It seems to make all of my other buffs about 50-100% more intense, and sometimes adds extra buffs that other players don't get. My [Enjoying Music] buff will be twice as strong, and sometimes it also gives me the [Flapping Hands] buff, which is really fun. (Regular players are really missing out on some of the [Autistic]-exclusive buffs IMO.) \n\nBut the [Overwhelmed by Noise] debuff is also much stronger, and I get the [Sensory Overload] debuff that feels horrible. If I don't move my character away from the overloading input or at least use items like [Earplugs] or [Sunglasses], I can get the [Meltdown] debuff that makes it hard to even control my character. It seems like most players without the [Autistic] trait get the [Sensory Overload] debuff very rarely once they are past the first few tutorial levels, and that it doesn't turn into the [Meltdown] debuff for them if they do.\n\nI think a lot of players believe the [Autistic] trait only has to do with social interactions, but that's just because they see the effects on social interactions more. They can't see how it affects pretty much everything we do in the game (at least it's like this for my character, I know that the [Autistic] trait varies a lot).\n\nThe player I'm doing the [Romantic Life Partner] sidequest with is also [Autistic], and the synergy we get from both having the trait is awesome. We get huge increases in things like the [Mutual Understanding] skill lines of the sidequest.

It seems to make all of my other buffs about 50-100% more intense, and sometimes adds extra buffs that other players don&amp;#39;t get. My [Enjoying Music] buff will be twice as strong, and sometimes it also gives me the [Flapping Hands] buff, which is really fun. (Regular players are really missing out on some of the [Autistic]-exclusive buffs IMO.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the [Overwhelmed by Noise] debuff is also much stronger, and I get the [Sensory Overload] debuff that feels horrible. If I don&amp;#39;t move my character away from the overloading input or at least use items like [Earplugs] or [Sunglasses], I can get the [Meltdown] debuff that makes it hard to even control my character. It seems like most players without the [Autistic] trait get the [Sensory Overload] debuff very rarely once they are past the first few tutorial levels, and that it doesn&amp;#39;t turn into the [Meltdown] debuff for them if they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of players believe the [Autistic] trait only has to do with social interactions, but that&amp;#39;s just because they see the effects on social interactions more.

I'm in the [ADHD] cognition class like you, as well as the [Autistic] one.\n\nI think that the [Anxiety Disorder] and [Depression] traits don't entirely go away, just like how we can't change from the [ADHD] and [Autistic] cognition classes. However, it doesn't mean that we can't decrease the amount and severity of the debuffs we get from them. Personally, my [GAD] (shorthand for [Generalized Anxiety Disorder]) trait is much less of a problem now that I use the [Medication] I received from a player of the [Doctor] class.\n\nLet me explain why I actually feel better viewing [Generalized Anxiety Disorder] as a trait that is probably a permanent part of my character, instead of just a debuff that I can work to get rid of. I view [Anxiety] as a debuff, but [GAD] as the trait that causes the debuff (and similar ones like [Panic Attack] that show up a lot).\n\nAt one point after starting [Medication] and noticing a reduction in the strength of my [Anxiety] debuffs from [GAD], I had a rather strong [Anxiety] debuff again one day. My character then got the [Panic Attack], [Uncontrollable Sobbing], and [Self-Hatred] debuffs, not just because of the event in-game that increased the [Anxiety] debuff, but because I previously thought the [GAD] trait might have gone away, that my character was \"fixed\" and \"normal\" now. I felt like I was failing at the game because I clearly still had the [GAD] trait causing the [Anxiety] debuff. I thought maybe my character would never be good at anything no matter how hard I tried, just because of the [GAD] trait.\n\nSince I've had the [GAD] trait since level 3 (and probably before that, but I'm not sure because of the feature where we don't remember our first few levels), and it has gotten better but doesn't seem to be going away entirely, I decided to view it as permanent but manageable. I think it's kind of like how it is for players with the [Diabetes] or [HIV] traits if they have the [Access to Health Care] buff. They'll always have the traits (unless the [Doctor] and [Scientist] classes find a way to remove them during their play time), but they can be controlled, and they don't have to ruin the game for them.\n\nIf I start playing and my [GAD]-related debuffs are bad that day, I can tell myself that I just got some bad RNG today, but that overall it's never going to affect my character as severely as it used to. That way I don't have to feel like I suck at the game just because I have [GAD], which isn't something I can control anyway. I mean, I can control how I react to the debuffs it gives me, but I can't control the fact that I have it, or how severe the debuffs are on any given day.\n\nBeing on [Medication] also helped me develop my [Meditation], [Positive Self-Talk], and [Rational Thinking] skill lines. I was locked out of using those skills before taking [Medication] and reducing the debuffs from [GAD]. But now I can also use those to combat my remaining [GAD]-related debuffs. If I get the [Catastrophizing] debuff from [GAD] (it's the one that makes characters think that everything will go wrong in the most horrible way possible), I can now use the [Rational Thinking] and [Positive Self-Talk] skils to reduce the debuff a lot.\n\nI know that the [Depression] trait isn't exactly the same as [Generalized Anxiety Disorder], but a lot of players with one have the other one too, and the players of the [Doctor] and [Scientist] classes think they might both be caused by our characters having less of the [Serotonin] neurotransmitter.\n\nIf you didn't like how your character felt on [Medication], you might have been taking the wrong one. There are a lot of different ones, and the players in the [Doctor] class and its sub-class [Psychiatrist] don't have a reliable way to tell which one will work for a character yet. Some characters have to try several different types of [Medication], or even use two at the same time, before they find a way to decrease the debuffs from the [Depression] trait. It takes a lot of testing, but it's worth it, IMO, for the lasting improvements once you get the right combination.\n\n[Medication] can also cause temporary debuffs that go away after you use it for awhile, and if you make sure to use it every time you play, at the same time in the game day. When I started using [Medication], I actually felt worse for about a week of playtime. I got a form of the [Insomnia] debuff, and my [Anxiety] debuff was stronger. But I kept using the [Medication] (I took it every in-game night), and then I started feeling much better. By after about six weeks of playtime with [Medication], I felt like a new character! No, actually - I felt like this was how my character was supposed to be all along. The debuffs from [GAD] were hiding a lot of my character's other traits and their true [Personality].\n\n[GAD] also did some stuff that interfered with gameplay directly when its debuffs were more severe. Part of the reason I couldn't use things like the [Meditation] and [Positive Self-Talk] skills was because [Anxiety] and similar debuffs were overwhelming my character so much and interrupting my own input, especially the [Panic Attack] debuff. They would keep interfering with my [Thinking] skill entirely. Like, I would try to activate the [Rational Thinking] skill and the stuff the severe [Anxiety] debuff was doing would just cancel it right out. It was like I hadn't even pressed the hotkey to use the skill. Really weird. Thankfully, severe debuffs like that are rare with [Medication].\n\nI think that [Depression] can be similar in how it messes with gameplay or even the interface itself. I've heard players say that it can give a debuff that misrepresents their character info. Like it'll make it impossible for them to see some of their achievements, or how good some of their skills are! They've compared it with what other players see when checking out their character stats, and it's totally off. It can also cause a debuff that makes some quests and other cool things in-game harder to see and access. Players without the debuff see a really big and clear quest marker or cool item, but players with the debuff have to look really close, and sometimes can't see them at all.
