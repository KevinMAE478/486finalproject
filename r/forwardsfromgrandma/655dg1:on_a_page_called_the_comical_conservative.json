Pretty standard, right? The issue is that the US didn&amp;#39;t want to lift sanctions on Iran, but needed to meet their part of the deal. Sanctions often include freezing the capabilities to transfer money to royalty, the elite, key figures, etc in a nation, so they can&amp;#39;t just wire them the money. The money they&amp;#39;re asking for that&amp;#39;s a deal/no deal condition had to get to them somehow, so we sent cash because it circumvents the sanctions currently in place. They have money, sure, but they can use that money to travel to someplace that has sanctions on them and buy that luxury good they want, and it&amp;#39;s surprising how effective if a deterrent that is to some members of that country&amp;#39;s elite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if they send the money, the deal goes through. If they didn&amp;#39;t, we&amp;#39;d have a more-nuclear-capable Iran. That&amp;#39;s where the externalities of which being worse comes in. Which has a larger downside? Them having a sizeable pile of cash to do stuff with, or them being able to create nukes? Seems obvious to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and then there&amp;#39;s the obvious of the &lt;em&gt;Iran&lt;/em&gt; deal and bombing &lt;em&gt;Syria&lt;/em&gt; but this is the same crowd that wants to bomb Agrabah, so that may be asking a bit too much.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dg7vdsx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492132461.0, "created_utc": 1492103661.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dg1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rpey", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Felinomancy", "parent_id": "t3_655dg1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Obama sent money to Assad?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama sent money to Assad?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dg7rpey", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128554.0, "created_utc": 1492099754.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dg1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dg1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg857z3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "simsim44", "parent_id": "t1_dg81k3d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Osama Bin Laden is dead?!?!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osama Bin Laden is dead?!?!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dg857z3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143044.0, "created_utc": 1492114244.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dg1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8720f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Corgiwiggle", "parent_id": "t1_dg81k3d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "More like Obama bin Oblaman was never stopped", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More like Obama bin Oblaman was never stopped&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dg8720f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492145092.0, "created_utc": 1492116292.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg81k3d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sheensies", "parent_id": "t3_655dg1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They seem to forget that Osama bin Laden died under Obama", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They seem to forget that Osama bin Laden died under Obama&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dg81k3d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492139048.0, "created_utc": 1492110248.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dg1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg89xlw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chrysalii", "parent_id": "t3_655dg1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So Trump bombed himself?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Trump bombed himself?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dg89xlw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148516.0, "created_utc": 1492119716.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dg1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8prei", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mellowmonk", "parent_id": "t3_655dg1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey, that's cash that Bush sent to Iraq [and it disappeared](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/08/usa.iraq1).
