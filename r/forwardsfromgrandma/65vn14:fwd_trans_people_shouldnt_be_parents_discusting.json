It is an opinion and calling someone a hypocrite because they have a belief different than you is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#39;t my views. I avoid sharing my views on those topics but I can understand the views of the people you are calling hypocrites and they have millions of years of biological and evolutionary evidence that supports the view that only two sexes exist. In general, calling someone a hypocrite tends to be a hypocritical thing to do. Degrading a group of people and their beliefs will never lead to productive conversation or positive change because you don&amp;#39;t think that any belief set but yours can be valid. You can&amp;#39;t get someone that believes opposite to you to reason with you if they know that you don&amp;#39;t have any understanding of their belief, or respect for the concept that their opinion holds as much merit as yours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I read through some of your post history, and am not too dissimilar from you in that I left the church. I didn&amp;#39;t wait to go on a mission or go to BYU like you did but I know what its like having your parents be disappointed and unaccepting. My dad also has 3 apostate brothers, and know quite a bit about the Provo dirty scene(one of the primary organizers was one of my best friends brothers). If you want someone to discuss it with just shoot me a PM. I have a bunch of experience with leaving the church.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dgemf51", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492514468.0, "created_utc": 1492485668.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgekixl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hordon_Gayward", "parent_id": "t1_dgek06k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure it does.
