Again, that was blasted far and wide... if you require a source for that, you&amp;#39;re likely more uninformed than I&amp;#39;d be able to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The claims in that Dossier? Well, you might need a source... but some key claims in it have been confirmed. (the spy/diplomat recalled because he was being investigated for trying to influence the election? Yeah, the one who got recalled was (according to two separate sources) the one they were keeping an eye on... Kulagin. That&amp;#39;s the biggest one I know of, and simply searching for &amp;quot;Trump Dossier Kalugin&amp;quot; will let you research to your hearts content...) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The claims of concrete evidence of collusion? That&amp;#39;s an easy one to find a source for... it&amp;#39;s the big news today!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, as to whether that is shit that Trump actually knew about? Well... we know damned well he know about Flynn, we know a lot of the &amp;quot;incidentally collected&amp;quot; contacts between Trump&amp;#39;s Campaign and the Russian agents were in calls either coming from or to Trump Tower, we know that Manafort had a &lt;strong&gt;HELL&lt;/strong&gt; of a lot of shady shit going on AND that it mostly came out long before the election, (so Trump knew about that too) and it was such common knowledge that Russian meddling was to Trumps benefit that Trump ended up with the &amp;quot;No Puppet! No Puppet! You&amp;#39;re the Puppet!&amp;quot; line in the second debate as his only response to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So... did Trump know about some of the shit going on between his campaign and the Russians? Unless he intentionally buried his head in the sand, he knew some of it and didn&amp;#39;t try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dgaor2s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294697.0, "created_utc": 1492265897.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dganbgb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SploonTheDude", "parent_id": "t1_dgan9u4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you have a source?
