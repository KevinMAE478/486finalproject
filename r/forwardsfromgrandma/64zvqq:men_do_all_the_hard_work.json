However, things aren't as clear-cut as that.\n\n- The article only says that the gap \"might vanish altogether\" without this hour-based discrimination, implying that it might not.\n- In fact, the article mentioned that pharmacists make the same wages regardless of hours worked, and it also pointed out that there's _still_ a 9% gap.\n- Working 16 hours/weekday (plus commute) does mean giving up free time compared to 8 hours, but what about 8 hours vs. 4 hours? The article mentions that in some professions, working a 20-hour week gets you less than half what you'd get working a 40-hour week.\n- As the final paragraph alludes to, women are subtly and not-so-subtly encouraged to be the primary parent. (This is partially a culture thing, but it's also due to [all the companies that don't offer paternity leave](http://motto.time.com/4574731/families-parental-leave-corporations-report/).) Being the primary parent means there's no way you could possibly work an 80-hour week.\n\n&gt; I find the simplest argument to be the best one : if women earn 77% then why don't employers overwhelmingly seek to hire women and cut their labor costs ?\n\nFirst of all, it isn't 77%. Once you control for profession, education, experience, and so on, the wage gap gets significantly smaller (but does [_not_](https://blog.dol.gov/2012/06/07/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/) go away entirely). The 77% statistic applies only at the broadest level.\n\nAnyway, here's my answer. Odds are, whoever sets worker salaries honestly thinks that their male employees are more skilled. And of course, if you think an employee is more skilled, it makes sense to give them a higher salary.\n\nThe thing is, people often judge women to be less competent than men, [solely](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5903) due to [gender bias](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/).\n\nIf you point this out, then the manager(s) may or may not accept it. If they do, they will almost certainly even out the salaries. No one wants to be sexist (I think).\n\nHowever, some people will refuse to change. They'll deny their subconscious sexism, arguing that the male employees are worth the extra money, for reasons completely unrelated to gender.

That's a problem, and it would be beneficial for both men and women if we fixed it.\n\nBut that doesn't erase the fact that men do choose those conditions in exchange for higher pay and women don't.\n\nYou can change societal values or you can insist we stop paying more for more difficult working conditions, but if you choose the latter, you'll find you have a labor shortage in jobs with difficult working conditions. That's supply and demand. If you don't pay more for more difficult jobs, people will work easier jobs instead.\n\nAnd yes, women take more days off due to maternity leave and related matters, but it's very difficult to tell an employer they can't promote a man who finished an entire project on his own in the last 6 months while his female co-worker was out of the office on maternity leave, and the promotion has to go to the woman instead. I don't have any good answer to this, it's just biologically unfair that if a couple wants to have children, the woman's career is going to be put on hold *to some extent* due to pregnancy. We should make every effort to minimize this effect, but I just don't see how you can eliminate it altogether without raising babies in an artificial uterus.\n\nAnyway, check out the [full interview with Claudia Goldin](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/) and she breaks down exactly how much of the gender pay gap is from each one of the topics you pointed out. It turns out there's no grand conspiracy. Men are paid 5c more for working in dangerous jobs, 5c more for taking fewer days off, 5c more due to a promotion they wouldn't have gotten if they had taken 6 months maternity leave, 5c more for working more overtime, 5c more for making different career choices... It all adds up, and in the end they make 23c more than women on average, but almost every penny of that is accounted for in some way.\n\nA common myth she addresses is that men are given more raises and promotions because they are better at asking/negotiating for them, but she counters this by noting that when men and women first enter the workplace, they are equally good at negotiating their pay. Unless men develop this skill later in life (and women do not), there is some other factor at play. It could be plain old sexism, or it could be a combination of the above (men are promoted due to working more hours, taking less time off, etc).", "edited": 1492071409.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean... you&amp;#39;re not wrong about any of this, the reasons why men have more injuries, less comfortable working conditions, take more overtime, and have different career choices &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; due to societal pressures. That&amp;#39;s a problem, and it would be beneficial for both men and women if we fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t erase the fact that men do choose those conditions in exchange for higher pay and women don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can change societal values or you can insist we stop paying more for more difficult working conditions, but if you choose the latter, you&amp;#39;ll find you have a labor shortage in jobs with difficult working conditions. That&amp;#39;s supply and demand. If you don&amp;#39;t pay more for more difficult jobs, people will work easier jobs instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, women take more days off due to maternity leave and related matters, but it&amp;#39;s very difficult to tell an employer they can&amp;#39;t promote a man who finished an entire project on his own in the last 6 months while his female co-worker was out of the office on maternity leave, and the promotion has to go to the woman instead. I don&amp;#39;t have any good answer to this, it&amp;#39;s just biologically unfair that if a couple wants to have children, the woman&amp;#39;s career is going to be put on hold &lt;em&gt;to some extent&lt;/em&gt; due to pregnancy. We should make every effort to minimize this effect, but I just don&amp;#39;t see how you can eliminate it altogether without raising babies in an artificial uterus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, check out the &lt;a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/\"&gt;full interview with Claudia Goldin&lt;/a&gt; and she breaks down exactly how much of the gender pay gap is from each one of the topics you pointed out. It turns out there&amp;#39;s no grand conspiracy.
