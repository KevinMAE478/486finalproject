Of course. Not all Muslims are terrorists and it would be a fallacy to believe so. But I would also beseech you to recognise that being a neo-nazi is quite a bit different from being a terrorist. One actually kills people, while one simply hates people. There have been [4,302 people killed by Islamists so far this year around the world](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=2017) and, as far as I know (and correct me if I'm wrong), zero killed by neo-nazis in the same time-frame. This points to there something being gravely wrong. If it were any other ideology (National Socialism, Anarchism, Communism, Christianity, etc) that had these kinds of death tolls, there would surely be great public outrage and movements to ban this ideology, or at least make it not socially acceptable. Just like how you cannot ban racism, but you can very much make it taboo, you cannot ban Islam. But, you can make it known that it is not welcome where you live. Because if you only decry the violent Muslims, you must also only decry the violent racists, the violent nazis, and the violent anarchists. You must treat all ideologies equally. Islam cannot get special treatment and shelter from criticism. Likewise, neither can nazism. \n\nBut when I see things like \"make racists afraid again\" and \"nazis deserve to be punched\" and other things that call for violence against people for the beliefs they hold, I cannot help but see them as hypocritical. Considering that if the other side of the spectrum called for beating up leftists and \"SJW's\", they would cry out how awful and violent the right is. Yet it is the same exact thing. It is calling for violence upon those with whom you disagree. That is completely wrong in my eyes. Politics should be a battleground fought with words, not fists. If you cannot beat the other side in an argument, maybe they have a point that is worth investigating. I am willing to hear every side to an argument, whether it comes from a nazi, a socialist, or anything in between. Good ideas are not relegated to one side or the other or any specific ideology and it is foolish to believe otherwise. For instance, I love the way nazi Germany ordered their economy in a way as to help their citizens the most. But on the other hand, I find the whole war and the holocaust absolutely abhorrent to think of. \n\nThe problem with Islam is that it is not simply a religion, but a whole philosophy that includes a political side. Now what I am about to say does not apply to every single Muslim, but rather a large minority or a majority (depending on whose statistics you look at and in what countries): Islam has a political side. This cannot be disputed. Just look to the many nations which are built upon Sharia Law (Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Islamic State, Indonesia to an extent, etc). In those countries, often being any other religion than Islam (and sometimes a certain sect of Islam) or disagreeing with Sharia Law, or being gay, or being an apostate (especially atheists) is punishable (taxes, jail time, execution, etc). The constitution of Saudi Arabia is literally the Quran as specified in [Chapter I Article I of the basic law (sometimes called constitution, but that is actually wrong) of Saudi Arabia](http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sa00000_.html). Also in Saudi Arabia it is illegal for women to drive or leave their house without a male family member, and they just got the right to vote in 2015. Most Muslim majority nations have [made apostasy and blasphemy illegal](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/29/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/), effectively getting rid of free speech and freedom of religion. This all goes to show that Islam is not simply a religion, but a code which informs its believers on how to order their nations. This code does not respect freedom of religion or free speech. It is antithetical to all that which western, enlightened nations stand for. Now if you believe that we should not have these freedoms, then you are welcome to. But if you do not, you cannot support Islam as a political doctrine (which most Muslims do).\n\nThe fact is that a [majority of Muslims worldwide want Sharia law](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/27/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) to be the law of the land in their nation and sometimes in all nations. It is fairly safe to say that at least a substantial minority, if not a majority, of Muslims worldwide are in one way or another \"radicalised\" as can be seen [here](http://pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=97) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TAAw3oQvg). \n\nThis leads to the question: What do we do about this? And to tell you the truth, I do not know. But we certainly should not be importing more of it, as you would not wish to import nazism or any other pernicious ideology. At this point, the safety of one's own citizens and common sense should come before helping foreigners. It is sad, of course, but not worth the risk. The government's first priority is to protect its citizens. And there are many, many good and nice Muslims out there. But taking in more (especially from the middle east) is not something that is beneficial to the health of a nation's citizenry. Simply for that risk alone.\n\nTo answer your original question, no, not all Muslims are terrorists. But quite a few Muslims don't disagree with terrorism either.
