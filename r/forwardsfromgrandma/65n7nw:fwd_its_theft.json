It\u2019s a rigged game benefiting only those at the top of the pyramid.\nThose winners are the central bankers and the private Federal Reserve that they own. They own a printing press that they use to give them riches and power and we have to pay that back\u2014with interest. It\u2019s debt slave currency\u2014not real money. It\u2019s impossible to pay back unless we have printing presses ourselves\u2014and that would be considered counterfeiting.

It\u2019s about control.\n\n&gt;As I said, the income tax was originally presented as a means to sock it to the rich and take some of their passive income. They were going after the windfall profit gleaned from investments such as stocks and bonds. At the last minute they also slipped in wages as \u2018windfall.\u2019 We working class folk work hard for our money. We trade our labor for money. It\u2019s an equal exchange. Where is the windfall in that? The rich corporations are able to use lawyers to game the system.

The Clintons claimed they were broke, but now they are worth well over $50 million. What did they do to amass such wealth? They pulled the levers of graft and power, that\u2019s how. Will anyone in Congress ever end the pernicious income tax? Of course not. It\u2019s there as a tool of control and tyranny.\n\n&gt;These are a few things to consider when you shovel off your hard-earned income into the pockets of your masters.

The other day I was driving on Highway 2 through Kalispell. A young person was dressed in a Statue of Liberty costume and beckoning customers to use a tax service called, \u201cLiberty Tax.\u2019 That\u2019s an oxymoron if there ever was one. We\u2019re bombarded by TV commercials touting services that encourage us to play the game \u2018to win.\u2019 We The People can never win. It\u2019s a rigged game benefiting only those at the top of the pyramid.\nThose winners are the central bankers and the private Federal Reserve that they own. They own a printing press that they use to give them riches and power and we have to pay that back\u2014with interest. It\u2019s debt slave currency\u2014not real money. It\u2019s impossible to pay back unless we have printing presses ourselves\u2014and that would be considered counterfeiting. Now they want to do away with cash altogether and get us all on the grid to make what we earn and spend trackable. It will also give them more power to steal from us. It\u2019s about control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, the income tax was originally presented as a means to sock it to the rich and take some of their passive income. They were going after the windfall profit gleaned from investments such as stocks and bonds. At the last minute they also slipped in wages as \u2018windfall.\u2019 We working class folk work hard for our money. We trade our labor for money. It\u2019s an equal exchange. Where is the windfall in that? The rich corporations are able to use lawyers to game the system. The average Joe doesn\u2019t have the resources for that, so the workers and small businessmen get socked the most. The powerless always bear the brunt. It\u2019s the screwing of the average man and it\u2019s unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, our so-called government representatives amass vast riches while in office. Career politicians are the new royalty and they pass legislation to enrichen themselves and their ultra rich buddies. The Clintons claimed they were broke, but now they are worth well over $50 million. What did they do to amass such wealth? They pulled the levers of graft and power, that\u2019s how. Will anyone in Congress ever end the pernicious income tax? Of course not. It\u2019s there as a tool of control and tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are a few things to consider when you shovel off your hard-earned income into the pockets of your masters. At the very least, realize that you are NOT doing your civic duty by allowing yourself to be robbed. It\u2019s about control. They could easily print up their own money\u2014they don\u2019t need yours to waste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s time to end the Fed and their gestapo, the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am mad drunk, so fuck Ben Garrison, fuck Republicans, and fuck Erin, and fuck my dad, and fuck assholes in Dota who report you for feeding when it&amp;#39;s not your fault the other team keeps killing you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "name": "t1_dgbmh18", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492342419.0, "created_utc": 1492313619.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 61}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7nw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t776", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7nw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbx3j1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "conceptalbum", "parent_id": "t1_dgbo1kn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/forwardsfromgrandma", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And this is why it is important to remember that anarcho-capitalists are not at all anarchists.
