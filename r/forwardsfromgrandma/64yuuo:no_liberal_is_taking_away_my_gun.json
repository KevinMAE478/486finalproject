A thumbprint reader also needs to be somewhat clean, so that's additional maintenance, that forgetting to do one time or maybe not doing it properly could lead to a non functioning firearm during a time when you might literally need it more than you've needed anything else in your life.

Also guns are entirely mechanical, so the safeties are as well. That means an electronically controlled safety would have to rely on something like a servo to remove whatever's blocking the gun's action, another electronic item that will need to be shock hardened and might break anyway.

Now you might be thinking, people engage in gun maintenance already so a couple more steps isn't unreasonable, and they're already expensive so a little bit extra doesn't seem too bad.

Compare this to a friend of mine who dropped a couple hundred dollars on a revolver, learned how to use it, loaded it, and put it in his night stand. I absolutely guarantee that if he doesn't touch it at all he'll still be able to pull it out 25 years from now and rely on it to work.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of the second amendment, but I don't like the suggestion because I hugely believe in the \"keep it simple\" philosophy of building things and it's reflected in almost everything I own.
