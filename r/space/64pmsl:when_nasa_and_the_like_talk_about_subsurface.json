"They're talking about oceans, which are covered in a layer of ice several thousand meters thick. That may seem like a lot, but consider that the ocean underneath the ice could be hundreds of kilometers thick.\n\nTaking Europa as an example, when you look at pictures of it you're essentially looking at a frozen ocean surface. underneath the relatively thin ice sheet is a massive liquid ocean, one as fluid as the oceans here on Earth (that is to say, you could swim in it and wouldn't be able to tell the difference, it's just water with some dissolved salts). At the bottom of that ocean you'd find a sea bed made of rock, just like the bottom of the ocean here on Earth. From there the deeper layers would be more of what you'd expect, gradually warmer rocks until the temperature is high enough for the rocks to melt. Europa has a molten interior/core, because Jupiter's gravity along with tidal forces form the three other big moons of Jupiter squeeze Europa constantly, which generates heat.
