This includes the Earth's moon, Jupiter's big four, Titan, Triton, Titania, Rhea and other smaller objects. So we can rule those out for seeing a planet-rise. Either the planet is always in the sky, or never. Depending on which side of the moon you settle on.\n\nSo we need to get creative. Where in our solar system will we find a place that has sun-rise in addition to another major body that actually rises and sets? You can probably tell where I'm going with this. The Outer Planets do not have a solid surface, so colonizing them seems extremely unlikely. Only one of the inner planets, the Earth, has a significant body in the sky outside of the sun.\n\nThe moon is so large in comparison with the Earth that, on occasion, the system has been described as a double planet system. It's probably not the best way to describe it. The moon is so large that when viewed from Earth it has very similar angular diameter to the Sun.\n\nYou are already standing on the place in the solar system that has the largest 2nd body rising and setting in the sky. Even Pluto and Charon, which is another system that has been described as double planet on occasion, can't hold a candle to the Earth and Moon in this respect, because not only is Charon tidally locked to Pluto, but so is Pluto to Charon.\n\nSo next time you're outside under a clear sky, take a look at the other planet in our local system and forget for a moment how mundane it has become, the only other place in the solar system humanity has visited in person.

By reduced gravity, I mean environments with gravity less than 1G but above 0G.\n\nWe know that 0G poses issues for long term habitation; you need to perform specific bone-straining exercises to prevent rapid bone loss and heart strength reduction, however we're at the point now that people can live in space for over a year and be more or less back to normal just a couple days after landing back in Earth's 1G environment, which is very significant progress. Most of the challenge now is to find a way of adequately straining the pelvis, which constantly receives large asymmetric compression loads on Earth but in 0G almost never experiences any strain.\n\nNow, in *reduced* gravity, the challenges are very different. All of your bones would be in constant load, your heart would always be pumping against gravity, and on a cellular level your body would be able to tell which way was down. We can assume that some levels of reduced gravity are nearly indistinguishable from 1G, at least from the body's perspective. 99% Earth gravity for example fits this category. We can also assume that levels of gravity very close to 0G are indistinguishable from 0G from a biological perspective; the gravity of a small asteroid would be an example here, with less than a centimeter per second per second of acceleration. At some point across this gradient from indistinguishable from Earth gravity to indistinguishable from 0G there must be a region of G where a human body will remain healthy with no assistance, a region where some additional exercise is required to keep a healthy skeletal and cardiovascular system, and a region where strict exercise regimens are required in order to stave off rapid bone loss and other ill effects. There are also other factors to consider, such as human development in the womb through to adulthood, and some regions may blend into each other somewhat, but we know we must be able to draw a line somewhere and say \"Any G level above or equal to this line is healthy for humans to live in long term\". \n\nWhere that line may lay is anyone's guess, but personally I think it's probably somewhere around the Moon's gravity or perhaps a bit lower. That's enough gravity that your blood still pools in your legs, your bones and especially your pelvis are being strained in a way that should keep them dense and strong, and all your biological functions should be able to tell how they are oriented. Maybe on worlds with Moon-levels of gravity people would wear weights or work out more often in order to stay 'Earth fit', but they would not deteriorate to the point of having any trouble functioning in the level of G they live in. Over generations people may start growing taller, but how tall a person grows is most strongly affected by genetics, and those aren't going to drastically change overnight. So long as a robust transportation system is in place, and genetic variations can be spread out across the entire human population, I believe we won't see any 9 foot tall Martians or 12 foot tall Moon-men, because the genetic drift that would be needed for that to occur would be continuously reset by genetic material from Earth. \n\nOf course, I could be wrong, and reproduction could not be possible under 0.8G, or long term human habitation of worlds below 0.5G may not be workable because of the long term development of bone problems or something. This is why we should be sending a large space station module into Earth orbit that spins attached to a counterweight by a long tether, thus simulating any level of G that we want in order to test long-term (6 months to a year) habitation effects. That way we can get some real data and actually generate a curve for these things. Maybe the bone strength curve starts to drop off immediately, maybe you need to get as low as 0.2G to start seeing effects. Maybe pregnancy (in mice of course) functions totally normally all the way down to 0.05G, maybe developmental issues arise after dropping below just 0.75G. We need to know the answers to these questions, and we can't exactly spend the money (or can't convince people to spend the money) to build a large, long-term habitat facility on every solid object in the solar system. \n\nLong story short, for all we know, a two year stay on Mars may have you falling apart at the seams, or you may return to Earth without skipping a beat.
