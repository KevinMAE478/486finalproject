SLS is the spiritual descendant of the Mars Direct rocket.\n\nDespite its many flaws, Mars Direct is *still* to this day THE Mars architecture against which all others are compared. He wrote a book called *The Case For Mars* in which he describes the plan. It's very good (written for a popular audience) and available everywhere. He is the father of humans-to-Mars advocacy. Because of him it is generally agreed on that a humans to Mars program can be done for the amount of money spent on chewing gum annually. \n\nHe's been preaching the gospel of \"travel light and live off the land\" for nearly 30 years. \n\n3 - I collected a few dozen mission proposals, including Mars Direct and the Bush-era 90-Day Report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/4znigs/xpost_rcolonizemars_a_collection_of_technical/). \n\n4 - Zubrin is wrong a lot, but he's right a lot too, especially when everybody else is wrong. Pretty much *all* of NASA's big ideas for how to get crew to Mars were either developed or popularized by Robert Zubrin, including shuttle-derived heavy lift vehicles, ISRU, pre-placed assets (including the MAV), and all the rest.
