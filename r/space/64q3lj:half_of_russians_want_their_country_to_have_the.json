The problem is that launching from Europe is like launching from New York (roughly equal latitudes). That's obviously horrible because you don't get nearly as big of a boost due to Earth's rotation.\n\nI believe Papua New Guinea used to be a French colony, so they've got good connections there. They *can* launch from Papua new Guinea, but it's far away and expensive to get a rocket there. So ye, the most straight forward solution is to team up with Russia and launch form Kazachstan, which is still a shitty location, but not as shitty. It's got infrastructure, so that's good, but the latitude is almost just as bad. I wonder why they don't launch from an island around Las Palmes. That would be good, a good latitude, but not very good for the telescopes at Las Palmas :). They do launch the Ariane-V from South-America sometimes. I guess sometimes Papau New Guinea is cheaper and sometimes South-America is cheaper.
