People can understand the idea behind authority and truth, and they will want to associate their lives, their various cultural and religious narratives with the effort they see that civilization has put into establishing those concepts. This isn't a crime, it's what everybody does, even atheists and agnostics, possibly in places they're not even aware of (or even aware of failing at intellectually by succumbing to their own personal biases). And it's here where our efforts for the sake of truth can get intertwined and muddled with the paradigm of truth itself, and end up not testifying against the religious phenomenon as much as the irreligious might want. Arguing against religion as propositions within philosophy or science is fair. Arguing against religion in some general sense, \"because all religion is a claim in philosophy or science\", is not... that being the implication of your comment against the cosmonaut.\n\nThe reason the more objective view of religiosity matters is because presuming that religion is nothing but a protoscience can give you a false impression of its nature (or complete nature) and hence of your understanding or expectations for its future. In the abstract, if something is an old machine or an outdated technique, then you can easily argue for its replacement and most people wouldn't object, since machines and techniques are usually seen as a means to an end, entirely subject to pragmatic concerns. If you decide to see religion as just a redundant technique for living life (a protoscience for understanding and documenting reality), then you're setting your mind up for frustration and the religious as absolute antagonists to truth. If that's not what religion is, then you're making a big strategic mistake on both of those fronts, for your freedom of thought on the matter and for your interactions with the religious (the majority of humanity).\n\nThe reason you can be against religion now is because religion exists for you to criticize in the first place. Now you might propose a thought experiment where a human arrives at the sophistication of an undogmatic philosopher and scientist without a history of \"stupidity\", but hindsight is 20/20 and arguing against a foundational paradigm of human thought with another that clearly stands on that foundation is naive. For one, it might be telling you about how beliefs are formed and why, what it takes for them to change and how to create beliefs about truth that are superior to the irrational dogmas as you see them.\n\nGiving leeway to irrationality, religious or otherwise, obviously shouldn't be tolerated whenever it oversteps its bounds. Do this cosmonaut's actions count? Cultural manifestations of what might currently be associated with irrational claims shouldn't be reduced to those claims, to be instantly challenged on that level, unless you've figured out the function of religiosity well enough in order to take the responsibility for the effects you produce in society.\n\nImplicitly demanding absolute perfection from those you call idiotic seems more like the reactionary emotions that mirror the religious beliefs which you find so frustrating, rather than some \"pure rationalism\". Study what this \"religious idiocy\" is about, instead of going straight to moral indignation over its continued existence. Being a historical process, its clearly systemic and it's not useful to put it in terms of \"stupid murderers of progress keep coming at me with their idiocy even in 2017\".\n\n If religion is so stupid, prove it by defeating it where it truly lives, fulfilling everything religion does for man and more.
