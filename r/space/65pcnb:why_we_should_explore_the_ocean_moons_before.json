It would be comparable to getting 10 CT scans. Also on Mars people can land and do all the further pre-launch preparations in underground habitats without worrying about wasting the extra fuel. In addition it is really pointless to make propellant depots in places where you can not make that propellant - launching all the propellant from Earth is &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are you focusing on Earth so much? It&amp;#39;s not like the point of these missions is to return some valuable material back. No, they return knowledge and that can be transmitted over radio from Earth, Moon or Mars. It does not matter where the expedition starts or returns to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mars has huge advantages as a base for all future space exploration because it has a lot of space-relevant resources in a shallow gravity well. If you want to have an expedition to Titan, with a bit of colony setup it will be cheaper to send a ton of water to Titan from Mars than from Earth. Orbital periods are not significantly different. Hell, with enough development even getting a ton of water to the Moon might eventually be cheaper from Mars (if you don&amp;#39;t mind the wait).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distances in space matter far less than dV budgets. I know that is counterintuitive, but it is very, very important for mission planning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dgdk1kq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468792.0, "created_utc": 1492439992.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhx18", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "_L5_", "parent_id": "t1_dgd90tl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Save for asteroids and comets, there are no resources in space *period*.
