The issue is that this stuff orbits earth at insanely fast speeds, and they all have their own unique orbits and trajectories. This means that collisions in space can destroy satellites, kill astronauts, and destroy ships or space stations,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also forces scientists and astronomers to have to alter their space entry trajectories and also establish non-ideal orbits, in order to miss space junk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more we dabble in space, the more serious the issue becomes. Better to find a solution now rather then when the situation gets out of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dg4lt83", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960989.0, "created_utc": 1491932189.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qml7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4t3o3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "monkiesnacks", "parent_id": "t1_dg48xsw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "define issue?\n\n[Visualisation of all the man made space debris](http://stuffin.space/)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;define issue?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://stuffin.space/\"&gt;Visualisation of all the man made space debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dg4t3o3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968868.0, "created_utc": 1491940068.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg48xsw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AndoAckerman", "parent_id": "t3_64qml7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is this actually that big of an issue as the article suggest?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this actually that big of an issue as the article suggest?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dg48xsw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491946192.0, "created_utc": 1491917392.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qml7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qml7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4mvwe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Theon_Severasse", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lv6r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This was my first thought to.\n\nI think that was such a good science fiction series, and I think really did a good job of showing a potential risk of space travel that I don't think is considered by a lot of people.\n\nThe main difference that I could see between how that series played out and how they may handle it in real life is that rather than simply pushing the debris into the atmosphere so that it burns up, collecting it and bringing it either back down to Earth to be reprocessed, or taken in orbiting stations that are specifically dedicated to recycling old satellites and debris.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first thought to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that was such a good science fiction series, and I think really did a good job of showing a potential risk of space travel that I don&amp;#39;t think is considered by a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main difference that I could see between how that series played out and how they may handle it in real life is that rather than simply pushing the debris into the atmosphere so that it burns up, collecting it and bringing it either back down to Earth to be reprocessed, or taken in orbiting stations that are specifically dedicated to recycling old satellites and debris.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dg4mvwe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962163.0, "created_utc": 1491933363.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4lv6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TrulyBigHeaded", "parent_id": "t3_64qml7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The anime series \"Planetes\" revolved around this very issue.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anime series &amp;quot;Planetes&amp;quot;

This is sort of like saying I&amp;#39;m not going to wash the dishes because the clothes need washing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to pursue both at the same time. For example Musk is not only working on less expensive access to space, he is also trying to make solar energy and electric cars economical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And space infrastructure can reduce the damage we do to our planet. For example, rare earth metals. These aren&amp;#39;t actually rare but mining them is a nasty business that wreaks havoc on the surrounding countryside. But mining these on the moon or an asteroid would cause no damage to the biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are other helpful minerals whose extraction presents problems.
