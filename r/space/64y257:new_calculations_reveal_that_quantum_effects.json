It&amp;#39;s interesting to note that both mathematics and physics are nowhere near answering this question. We are nowhere near understanding prime numbers and we are nowhere near understanding M-theory. There&amp;#39;s a good chance that if we come to understand one, we will also understand the other. Hopefully in our lifetimes, but I&amp;#39;m not counting on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dg61cc7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040365.0, "created_utc": 1492011565.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60zih", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DWMcAliley", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wj22", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I seem to recall that there is a property of Calabi-Yau manifolds that indicates whenever a section or dimension of the manifold is compressed to an infinitely small point a natural \"event horizon\" forms to cover the singularity created.  \n\nInteresting to see how different mathematical disciplines are arriving at the same conclusion:  Naked singularities are simply not physically possible.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I seem to recall that there is a property of Calabi-Yau manifolds that indicates whenever a section or dimension of the manifold is compressed to an infinitely small point a natural &amp;quot;event horizon&amp;quot; forms to cover the singularity created.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting to see how different mathematical disciplines are arriving at the same conclusion:  Naked singularities are simply not physically possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "space", "name": "t1_dg60zih", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039972.0, "created_utc": 1492011172.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wj22", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "olafwillocx", "parent_id": "t3_64y257", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/space", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not a suprise, really.
