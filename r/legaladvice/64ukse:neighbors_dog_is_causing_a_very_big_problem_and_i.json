Over the past 2 years or so one of their neighbors dogs has taken to jumping the fence and running where he pleases around the neighborhood. As far as I know the dog has never shown any signs of aggression or really making a nuisance of himself, however, the mail carrier has apparently put a dog order on the street and will no longer deliver mail to any house on that street, my grandparents house included.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for most people going to the post office to pick up their mail is a minor inconvenience but in my grandparents case they are 80 and 81 and both in very poor health. It&amp;#39;s extremely difficult for them to get out of the house, drive to the post office and then walk the extremely long walk to the section of the post office where they can pick up their mail. This is also made even more of a problem because my grandfather receives all of his medications through the mail from the VA and they won&amp;#39;t ship them to him through any carrier other than USPS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve talked to several of their other neighbors over the past few days and collectively here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve done so far:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 different neighbors have tried talking to the owner of the dog directly and asking him to either keep the dog inside or on a chain in his yard.

An animal control officer comes out and tries to catch the dog but the dog just runs back home and jumps the fence again (animal control is not allowed to go into his yard and detain the dog). Then the officer knocks on the door in an attempt to talk to the owner but he won&amp;#39;t answer the door (twice his kids were playing in the front yard and confirmed that their father was home at the time)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called the Tulsa police department myself today as a last ditch effort because Tulsa does have laws against letting dogs roam free. The police officer was rude and basically made sure I knew he couldn&amp;#39;t care less about the issue and told me to just call animal control out again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called animal control yet again and asked if there were any further actions we could take. The lady I spoke with said the only other option is to file a formal complaint which she explained would consist of my grandparents filling out and signing the complaint in front of the dog owner with an animal control officer present and then the officer could issue the owner a ticket. The problem with this is that this man has already displayed hostile, retaliatory actions against neighbors several times in the past, including causing significant damage to my grandparents&amp;#39; car. (He got away with that by claiming his son-in-law stole his car in the middle of the night and hit my grandparents car when he was driving away.
