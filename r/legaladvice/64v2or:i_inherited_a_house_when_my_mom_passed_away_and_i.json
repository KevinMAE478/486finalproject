They also aren&amp;#39;t in a place to &amp;quot;buy me out,&amp;quot; so they would basically need to take out another mortgage to pay me if I wanted.

Your best option would be to work with your brother, put the house on the market, and split the proceeds. Alternatively, see if your brother might be interested in buying out your half and leaving your stepparents in the house as tenants.\n\nYou need to see what equity exists in the house. In other words, its worth on the market after the mortgage(s) are paid off. Subtract cost of sale and divide by two for your share. \n\n&gt; How does owning 2 properties affect property tax? I believe the current name on the house is actually \"The Estate of Riddypads' Mom's Name,\" so i don't know how that will affect if my husband and I buy our own house.\n\nProperty tax attaches to the property.

Can he stop me if i wanted to sell the house? Can he stop me if i wanted to move in and make my parents move out?\n\nHe owns half of the house. You and he need to come to an agreement as far as how to deal with this. As I mentioned, there are few if any buyers for half-interest in a house. You can jointly decide to sell and split the proceeds, you can buy him out, he can buy you out, or you can continue joint ownership. \n\nYour stepparents are tenants. You and your brother would have to evict them if you wanted to move in. \n\nYour stepparents should probably be paying rent to you and your brother, and you and he paying the mortgage. \n\nYou need to have a heart-to-heart talk with your brother to decide what you and he want to do. You should together consult with an attorney comfortable with estate law and real estate. Key points:\n\n* What is the equity in the house?\n\n* Who is executor of the estate? \n\n* How were stepparents able to obtain a mortgage?\n\n* How do you and your brother want to proceed? \n\n&gt; What rights do my step parents have since they have been the ones paying the mortgage all this time?\n\nTough to say.

Alternatively, see if your brother might be interested in buying out your half and leaving your stepparents in the house as tenants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to see what equity exists in the house. In other words, its worth on the market after the mortgage(s) are paid off. Subtract cost of sale and divide by two for your share. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How does owning 2 properties affect property tax? I believe the current name on the house is actually &amp;quot;The Estate of Riddypads&amp;#39; Mom&amp;#39;s Name,&amp;quot; so i don&amp;#39;t know how that will affect if my husband and I buy our own house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Property tax attaches to the property. If it isn&amp;#39;t paid, the county will sell the house to pay the taxes. In many cases, property tax and insurance are bundled into the monthly mortgage payment and the bank pays the tax and insurance when due. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What rights does my brother have? Can he stop me if i wanted to sell the house? Can he stop me if i wanted to move in and make my parents move out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He owns half of the house. You and he need to come to an agreement as far as how to deal with this. As I mentioned, there are few if any buyers for half-interest in a house. You can jointly decide to sell and split the proceeds, you can buy him out, he can buy you out, or you can continue joint ownership. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your stepparents are tenants. You and your brother would have to evict them if you wanted to move in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your stepparents should probably be paying rent to you and your brother, and you and he paying the mortgage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to have a heart-to-heart talk with your brother to decide what you and he want to do. You should together consult with an attorney comfortable with estate law and real estate. Key points:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the equity in the house?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is executor of the estate? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How were stepparents able to obtain a mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you and your brother want to proceed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What rights do my step parents have since they have been the ones paying the mortgage all this time?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tough to say. I suspect that they or one of them is executor of the estate. While they&amp;#39;ve been paying the mortgage, they haven&amp;#39;t been paying rent to you and your brother. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg63cuu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042553.0, "created_utc": 1492013753.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v2or", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5y2m2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Realestatehell", "parent_id": "t3_64v2or", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "IANAL but In Florida your step father would receive what is called a \"life estate\" which would allow him to live there until death.
