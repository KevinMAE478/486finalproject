My fiancee and I have lived in California for the last 10 months. She&amp;#39;s 34, I&amp;#39;m 33. She drives for Uber/Lyft, I work as a network architect. We have a healthy and happy life together. Fast forward: My fianc\u00e9e (let&amp;#39;s call her B) went to a doctor in Daly City last Monday (4/10) for a refill on her Xanax and Wellbutrin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should have been a simple doctor&amp;#39;s appointment, but the nurse who admitted her was new and they had never met. It was her first appointment at this new office; she&amp;#39;s on Medi-Cal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Did a bit more research on this. The nurse mentioned below is an LMFT. Medi-Cal required her to go to a mental health doctor to refill Xanax &amp;amp; Wellbutrin, instead of just a GP doc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nurse started asking her a bunch of questions about her background, and steered the conversation strictly towards self-harm. The conversation went &amp;quot;Do you want to harm yourself?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If you did, how would you do it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;But if you DID, how would you do it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Have you ever had any friends harm themselves?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How did THEY do it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How do you THINK they did it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How do you THINK they did it?&amp;quot; The nurse was stuck on repeating the SAME QUESTION over and over again, until she got the answer she wanted. Had I been there, I&amp;#39;d have told her to walk out right then and there. But I wasn&amp;#39;t. So finally, they got to &amp;quot;Well, one of my friends committed suicide in a bathtub, so I imagine they used razor blades.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, since the nurse had finally pressured her into admitting she had friends that had committed suicide, the nurse then badgered her to answer HOW they had committed suicide, and then wrote down that B wanted to harm herself (in the ways B had described her FRIENDS harming themselves), and the nurse committed flat-out perjury on a 5150 form to involuntarily commit B to a hospital on a suicide watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 5150 contains a lot of perjury on the nurse\u2019s part, including \u201cshe has only been in California for 2 months and the new environment is causing her unmanageable stress\u201d, when anyone could clearly see that her driver\u2019s license shows LAST YEAR\u2019s date, her prescriptions have been filled in a San Francisco Walgreens for 6 months at least, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the nurse told my fiancee she was going to be placed into a suicide watch, the nurse had her supervisor come in and talk to my fiancee for less than a minute. She then signed the 5150.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the doctors &amp;amp; social workers at Mills General Hospital in San Mateo agreed that B should not have been placed in the hospital, that she is no risk to anyone, and that she has a stable support system and knows how to handle her stressors. They admitted that the original doctor who PLACED her on the 5150 was new and didn\u2019t understand the system well. They also said that they wouldn&amp;#39;t directly contradict the original doctor/nurse. When B got OUT of the hospital after the full 72 hours, the hospital tried to get her to sign a form stating she couldn\u2019t own a gun or ammunition ever again. She refused to sign this form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have a normal person tossed into a lockdown ward of the hospital, ruining their life for 72 hours (and the original nurse tried to push for the full 14 days) and costing the American taxpayer a ton. This doctor/nurse is just ruining people\u2019s lives with no regard to them whatsoever. Her civil liberties have been tossed aside and walked on. And who knows how many people they&amp;#39;re doing this to? They could be 5150&amp;#39;ing every patient that walks in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what B said, the girl who was harassing her to describe her friend&amp;#39;s suicide was a nurse and there was a large language barrier issue. The nurse then brought in the doctor to sign the 5150.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the law itself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advisement\nWhen persons are taken into custody on a 72-hour hold, they must be told (WIC 5157): \n(a) \nThe name, position, and agency of the person initiating the custody; \n(b) The name of the facility where they will be evaluated;\n(c) That they are not under criminal arrest, but are being detained for evaluation by mental health professionals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NONE of this was completed. She was never told any of this, nor was she given a form or any information regarding WHY or WHERE she was being held.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please tell me how we can fix this. She has to go back to the doctor this week and is terrified the doctor will simply 5150 her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is she legally required to go BACK to that doctor? I have called multiple law offices regarding civil rights, medical malpractice, etc. but none of them handle this sort of case.
