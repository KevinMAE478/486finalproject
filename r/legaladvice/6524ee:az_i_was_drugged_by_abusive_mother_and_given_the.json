That's why they call it \"idealization.\" You don't just think, \"I want to die.\" You plan out how you want to die, what kind of impact you'd want it to have on people, all the way down to how much work it's going to be for whoever has to clean it up. That's why a lot of \"in the moment\" decisions about suicide are.... perhaps dirty is the wrong word... messy, maybe? A shotgun can be very effective, but it leaves a lot to clean up, and may not cause the reaction you want it to. Bleeding out (whether through the wrists, neck, or anywhere, really) is similarly messy. Overdosing via medications (well, certain ones) is an otherwise clean ordeal. \n\nIn addition, the chosen method of suicide frequently follows the thought process of the individual. Someone who's prone to changing their mind a lot will probably choose a quick (but dirty) method, because they're worried they may change their mind. On the other hand, people who are worried about the \"stigma\" of suicide may choose to overdose on a medication, believing it would allow people to convince themselves it may have been an accident. \n\nAfter choosing the method, one who idealizes suicide will frequently obsess over the exact steps. If it's a hanging, where do I hang myself? Someone who's going for shock (perhaps as a last \"fuck you\") would choose somewhere rather public, or at least somewhere frequented by who they wish to see. If it's medication, do I die in my own bed? On the floor in the kitchen? Somewhere random in an ally? All of this is thought out by these people. \n\nIn addition, for many people who choose to die by medication, they believe it to be a more \"peaceful\" way to leave this life. They convince themselves that they'll simply go to sleep and not wake up. Once you've downed the pills (apart from throwing them back up), the decision is made, and now the only thing to do is get comfy and wait for death. \n\nWhen I was obsessed with dying, I chose medication overdose. It was easy to do (the doctor who writes the prescription gave me a 90 day supply, which was 180 pills. I downed around 100 of them). I also think I chose the medication because, at the time, I felt it was truly the only thing helping. My therapist was horrendous, my parents weren't supportive and believed it was all made up by the pharmaceutical companies to push more drugs, Id lost most of my \"friends\" in a bad breakup, and I truly felt alone. These little pills were all that was supposed to help me. If 2 a day couldn't help me feel better, 100 at once might permanently take the pain and suffering and insomnia and horrible thoughts away. I chose to die on a Monday night, because then my family would get a week away from work, school, etc. to process it, have the weekend to ease themselves back up, and be back to normal by next week. I wanted to die in my bed, so that it looked peaceful. I didn't want them to believe I was suffering at all. Doing it via pills would mean they wouldn't see fresh cuts on my body, and no one would have to clean anything up, meaning they could forget about me faster. The exact pills I chose were Trazadone. I figured overloading the brain with an antidepressant would at least make me deliriously happy while death overtook me. My note was succinct, and didn't mention anyone by name. I didn't want anyone to feel like they were at fault, because the problems existed in my head. And I wanted it to be memorable, but not a memoir that would end up in a book somewhere. \n\nThat Monday was the happiest point in my life, up till then. I woke up early in the day, ate a great breakfast, even hugged my parents before heading to school. At school, my teachers all seemed to be suddenly more interesting. The classes felt more fun. More people talked to me that day than had in the previous month. I was upbeat by the time school got out. \n\nI went home to an empty house (my parents would frequently work until 8 or 9 at night). Grabbed my iPod and my pills and laid back. I'd had a good day. It's always best to end on a high note, right? So I dumped the pills into my hand, threw them back, and chased it with a swig of Jack Daniels I stole from my parents' liquor cabinet (after all, one drink calms the nerves, right? And it wasn't like I had to worry about any side effects of mixing antidepressants and alcohol anymore). More relaxed than I'd been in months, I laid back and waited for death to make this my last hurrah. \n\nThankfully, my dog knew something was up. That big dumbass of a Labrador decided that she was going to be allowed on my bed, and helped herself to squeezing between my legs and resting her head on my lap. The look she gave me told me she knew something was up, and she wasn't going to be told to go away. \n\nAnd I cried. And cried. And realized I'd just made a huge mistake. All that planning. All the forethought. The hour I spent meticulously writing a note with my best handwriting. And, in that moment, I realized I wasn't ready to throw it all away. \n\nSomething they don't mention much, is that suicide by *certain* medications is peaceful. Xanax, Ambien, Hydro, things like that are relatively painless and peaceful. You go to sleep and don't ever wake up. But suicide via antidepressants or certain pain medications (*cough cough* Tylenol) are incredibly excruciating. With SSRIs, your brain is suddenly unable to process all of the input it's receiving, and goes into a state of delirium. You forget where you are, who you're with, all of it. You panic and hyperventilate and death comes slowly as your brain practically melts trying to figure out what's going on. With pain meds, you effectively rip holes through your intestinal tract, internally bleeding as your body races to close the wounds, only to find your blood pressure plummeting, heart rate increasing, and your brain goes into a panic. You die either when you bleed out or your heart goes into arrest because it literally can't beat fast enough. \n\nIf you've never counted the pills being wretched from your stomach to make sure you got them all out, let me be the first to say it's an eye opening experience. You're crying, your throat is raw from the excretion, your stomach is in knots trying to hurl itself through your throat, and you're panicking that you didn't get all of them so you call 911 on yourself so that at least someone with some sort of medical experience is watching over you. \n\nSorry this turned into basically an internal monologue gone rogue, but perhaps it can shed some light on the thought process behind \"these\" people and their choice for their end.

The police record's system should be able to find this (as long as the system is computer based). \n\nHowever, you CAN assist in a material manner by calling CPS. You are aware of these issues occurring. You do not have to be a mandatory reporter to report. You will also be adding credibility to OP's story by providing information associated with her case. Even if it is something that only she has told you, that you have no corroboration, that you have no physical evidence, you can (and should) make a report on OP's behalf. This is in addition to OP making outcry to someone at school, a physician, etc. \n\nOne final follow up comment: the legal issues can be handled when the OP gets a case worker due to the CPS investigation. They can talk to the city or district attorney (probably city based on the fact that it is a traffic issue) and work within the system to ensure it is handled appropriately.
