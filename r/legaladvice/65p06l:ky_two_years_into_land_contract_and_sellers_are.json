Any help would be appreciated. Will update if anything else happens. \nMy husband and I purchased a home in 08/15 on a land contract. Terms were $8000.00 down and $800.00/month. Only stipulations were we pay the property taxes, provide homeowners insurance at our expense and let the neighbor use our private driveway to access her outbuilding when necessary. The property came with 17 +/- acres of land (mainly hillside). So, fast forward to today when my husband decides that it&amp;#39;s a nice day to cut some trees and cover up some exposed gas lines that a timber thief from years ago messed up. Within an hour of him starting his saw, one of the six &amp;quot;sellers&amp;quot; (all siblings) called me at work to inform me that we had broken our land contract and she would be starting the eviction process in &amp;quot;a court of law, by the letter of the law&amp;quot; on Monday morning. She also informed me that herself and her two sisters were on the property taking pictures and that our grass was too high and was posing a &amp;quot;personal hygiene issue&amp;quot;. Not really sure what that means, although my grass is ankle high, however there is nothing in the contract staring a required or acceptable length of grass. My main question is - Should I be worried? Can they seriously evict us for clearing trees from a hillside when the contract doesn&amp;#39;t state anything regarding that being forbidden? Any help would be appreciated.
