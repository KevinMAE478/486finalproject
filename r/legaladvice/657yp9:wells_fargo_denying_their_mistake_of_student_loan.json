That means Wells Fargo receives payment after it clears your checking account (sometimes a day or two after) so technically you hadn&amp;#39;t paid them yet.  You were late in the technical sense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fifth, they did not erase all records of you being late.  Banks keep meticulous records of all transactions, including modifications.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sixth, the bank has no obligation to remove the co-signers even if you paid on time.  Why would the bank want to increase their risk on a loan if they don&amp;#39;t have to?  You&amp;#39;ll have better luck taking out a new loan to pay off the co-signed loan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seventh, what exactly do you think a lawyer will do for you at this point?  They waived your late fee, you have no damages, they are not required to modify your loan to remove your parent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : There is nothing to sue for and there is nothing for a government agency to &amp;quot;correct.&amp;quot;  Refinance your student loan with another company if you want to get your parents off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg97co4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209362.0, "created_utc": 1492180562.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657yp9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yuyr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sonofaresiii", "parent_id": "t3_657yp9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Send them your bank statement dude.
