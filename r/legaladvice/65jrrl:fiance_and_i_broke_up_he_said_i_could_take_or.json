Said it was his in the event of a breakup. He got in a car accident a few months later and is suing the other driver due to being unable to care for his home or pets. Since then, I took over the household and pet duties. I pay for the majority of the pet supplies and care, am on the vet docs, and do most their daily duties. Fast forward to us breaking up, when he told me during breakup talks that I could take or leave any of the pets. I made arrangements for the dog. Now he claims he was &amp;quot;emotional&amp;quot; so it doesn&amp;#39;t count and wants to either keep or at most, share the dog. He claims he&amp;#39;s suffering a mental breakdown, he works 2 jobs, and his living situation is unstable (might move, told me he wanted to skip town) and too isolated for a dog with separation anxiety. I want the dog but need to make sure I won&amp;#39;t get screwed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just typed all of this up and my computer shut off in the middle of it, so that&amp;#39;s nice. We live in the Twin Cities, MN. I&amp;#39;m supposed to be fully moved out of my ex&amp;#39;s home in a few hours so there&amp;#39;s a little pressure to quickly figure this out. He asked me to leave the keys and the dog behind. For timeline, we got together in September of 2013, got the dog in June 2014, his accident was in December 2014, and I officially moved in to help with everything in March 2015. We moved into a house he bought in May 2015 and have been here since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we first broke up he stated that I could &amp;quot;take or leave any of the pets, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter&amp;quot;. He had 2 cats before I was in the picture, so I never considered taking them, plus my new roommate is allergic. As for the dog, we always said it would be his, but since deciding that, I have taken over almost all of the responsibilities, both financial and otherwise. This is partly due to a car accident that caused a ruptured disk and a few bulging disks in my ex&amp;#39;s back, and my ex is suing. Part of his argument is that he couldn&amp;#39;t care for his responsibilities. Now I take him to the vet (more than once without my ex), buy food, groom, walk, pretty much do everything for the dog. It started after the accident and despite my ex&amp;#39;s improvements, the pets have only become more of my job and less of his. Not even sure if my ex knows some pretty basic things like what kind of food they all eat, what kind of meds they get, etc. and it&amp;#39;s been over a year since he last cleaned his cat&amp;#39;s litter boxes or picked up dog poop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since he said I could take or leave any pets, I arranged to move in with a long-time friend and her fiance, in their owned home with 2 dogs. This friend has babysat my dog on several occasions for up to 2 weeks at a time. My dog loves it over there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dog has separation anxiety, doesn&amp;#39;t get along with the cats, and is left alone and indoors for far too long. My ex works long days and just got a second job (to afford everything now that I&amp;#39;m leaving). The dog is usually kept in our room during the workday, usually only for up to 6 hours, rarely more than 8 since our work schedules aren&amp;#39;t the same. If I don&amp;#39;t walk the dog, he doesn&amp;#39;t get walked. My ex has walked the dog only a handful of times in it&amp;#39;s lifetime to my knowledge. If I&amp;#39;m working and my ex is off, he won&amp;#39;t do anything besides the bare minimum potty and feed, then potty again in 8 or so hours until I am home to take over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the week prior to the breakup, my ex had shared his issues with me, and how he was going to have a mental breakdown then was gone from our house for 3 nights while I kept the dog. We made the breakup official and I stayed with the dog at my friend&amp;#39;s home for the next few nights. I brought the dog back since then and have spent 3 of the last 6 nights with him in my ex&amp;#39;s home. Though initially when I brought the dog back, my ex argued I should just leave him with my friend since he had worked his 2nd job (uber driver) for 22 hours over the last 3 days in addition to his full-time kitchen job, and was planning on driving again that night until 3 am. I left the dog anyways for 2 nights, then came to pack for 2 more nights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I tried to convince my ex that I had a good stable environment for the dog, where he would have constant companionship, unlike at his house. Everything went to shit then and he said he wasn&amp;#39;t serious about me taking any of the pets, that he was emotional and it didn&amp;#39;t count, and that the dog was his or I could have him occasionally, &amp;quot;and that&amp;#39;s final&amp;quot; sort of thing. He claims his investments into the dog entitle him to that, and he will lose thousands if he loses the dog. Not sure if he&amp;#39;s forgotten I pay for/do everything for all the pets, not just the dog, and my name and # are on the vet bills too. He threatened to take me to court over it if I wouldn&amp;#39;t give up, or I could leave the $700 sound system my parents gave us for Christmas in exchange for the dog. He left shortly after threatening court again, and also threatening to call the cops on me being in his house because &amp;quot;he did me a favor&amp;quot; by not just throwing me on the street. I don&amp;#39;t even know who this guy is, apparently, because I did NOT get engaged to whoever this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no confidence he will honor the trade and won&amp;#39;t just come after me anyways. How much claim do I have to this dog if I can prove I paid at least half of everything for him? My ex says I only paid because I owed him money, however he refused to ever make a budget with me so I will never actually know how much I &amp;quot;owed&amp;quot; him. I understand dogs are considered property, so if there is no signed receipt for the dog, would my paying bills count as ownership?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#39;t really want to &amp;quot;keep score&amp;quot; with the lost investments like that. My parents have spent thousands on our wedding planning while he and his paid for nothing. My dad has repaired my ex&amp;#39;s car for only the cost of parts saving him hundreds, fixed our A/C for free, which we were told we would have to fully replace for $4000, installed a ceiling fan that was actually our engagement gift, a bathroom fan that my dad paid for and installed, and then done several other small tasks and repairs for free. Not including the wedding, my parents have done over $6000 of work for my ex for little to no cost to him. So yeah, keeping score about money just gets messy, fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be appreciated. I love this dog and want to give him the good life he deserves, but need to know that I won&amp;#39;t get screwed over by trying to do the &amp;quot;right thing&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**TLDR: Ex fiance(23M) and I (22F) got a dog less than a year into our relationship.
