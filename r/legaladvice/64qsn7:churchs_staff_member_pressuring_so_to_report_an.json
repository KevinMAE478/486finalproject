We&amp;#39;re engaged and she wanted to become a member, so she met with a staff member a few times to talk about her life journey. After the first meeting which I attended (about 6 months ago now), the staff member contacted my SO to meet with her in secret to ensure that I was not pressuring her to join, and to see if there was anything she wanted to say &amp;quot;confidentially&amp;quot; without me there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this meeting, my SO talked about her childhood, and events that brought her to her current place spiritually. One thing that came up was a time ~10 years ago when she (~12) was molested by her step-brother (~16). They were on a family trip, and needed to share beds at the motel. During the night he groped her, then put his hand down her pants. She stopped him, told her parents, and they handled things themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as the staff member heard this, she asked my SO if her step-brother was around any children today, to which she responded that he has a daughter with his long time girlfriend. The staff member urged that she &amp;quot;report&amp;quot; this event to the county he lives in, and said that his daughter is at risk if she does not. Given that it was a one time occurrence, her family handled it, and her step-brother has not shown any signs of pedophilia, my SO politely told her that she wasn&amp;#39;t going to do this and left. We then decided that we would not become members of that church, but would continue with holding our previously booked wedding there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to yesterday: the staff member (who we hadn&amp;#39;t contacted since the event 6 months ago) called my SO, and again asked her to come in to meet with her. My SO was hesitant and asked why. At first the staff member said it was &amp;quot;confidential&amp;quot; and shouldn&amp;#39;t be talked about over the phone. When my SO refused, the staff member said that she had just attended a seminar and that she was reminded that it&amp;#39;s her duty to make sure this gets &amp;quot;reported&amp;quot; to the county. My SO told the staff member that her mind has not changed since their last conversation, that it&amp;#39;s none of the staff member&amp;#39;s business, and that she regrets telling her about it in the first place.

It was a one time event that her dad handled, and her and her step-brother are on good terms today. The last thing she wants is some sort of legal action that would jeopardize his ability to see his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the statute of limitations for criminal charges in my state (&lt;strong&gt;MN&lt;/strong&gt;) is 3 years.
