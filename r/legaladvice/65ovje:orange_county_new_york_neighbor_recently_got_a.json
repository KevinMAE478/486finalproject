Here&amp;#39;s the email I got in response, and judging by it, I must not have been the only one to complain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/vlFTr\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/vlFTr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dgc7jda", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388224.0, "created_utc": 1492359424.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 85}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ovje", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ovje", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ovje", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcinci", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Napalmenator", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9o1b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "*Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*\n\n**Generally Unhelpful** \n\nYour comment has been removed for one or more of the following reasons:\n\n* It was generally unhelpful or in poor taste.\n* It was confusing or badly written.\n* It failed to add to the discussion.\n\n\n\n*If you feel this was in error, message the [moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdvice)*", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally Unhelpful&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your comment has been removed for one or more of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It was generally unhelpful or in poor taste.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It was confusing or badly written.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It failed to add to the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you feel this was in error, message the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdvice\"&gt;moderators.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dgcinci", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492402849.0, "created_utc": 1492374049.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9o1b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dgc2whj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 1, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dgc9o1b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492391001.0, "created_utc": 1492362201.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc2whj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 83, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nonworkreddit2016", "parent_id": "t3_65ovje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A rooster is considered poultry, by the way.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rooster is considered poultry, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dgc2whj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381612.0, "created_utc": 1492352812.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 83}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ovje", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5xti", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mladypain", "parent_id": "t3_65ovje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "2nding calling local zoning board and/or local government.
