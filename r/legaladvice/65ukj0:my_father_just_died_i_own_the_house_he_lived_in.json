This is general advice and/or things to think about.\n\nDo you have someone you can absolutely trust who can look after the property to ensure she cannot gain entry? Given that she was the ex-wife, I'm assuming she does not already have access, but if she does and she is *not* considered a tenant of that property (nor are there *any* current tenants), you should look into changing the locks and possibly installing security cameras. If you do have tenants on that property you can't just change the locks or install cameras, you'll have to talk to them first and come to an arrangement as far as how to proceed. Things are easier if the house is currently empty.\n\nIf she *is* considered a tenant of that property, then you need to proceed more carefully. You can't just toss her out, and trying to sell the property while she is resident in it will be difficult at best - especially if she claims to own the property or that she will own it.\n\nDid your fathers estate have a lawyer? Do *you* have a lawyer? Especially since you live overseas I think its in your best interest to hire someone in New York State who can work on your behalf to not only ensure your continued ownership of the home, but to intercede in the event that your father's ex-wife attempts to assert ownership or residency of the property. A lawyer can also tell you right away if you are screwed, can keep copies of any important paperwork, and can generally be a proxy for you. Even if you can come stateside for an extended period of time you probably want some sort of representation to ensure that your fathers will is being executed properly, and that his ex-wife does not actually have a legal claim to some of his stuff.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a lawyer. This is general advice and/or things to think about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have someone you can absolutely trust who can look after the property to ensure she cannot gain entry? Given that she was the ex-wife, I&amp;#39;m assuming she does not already have access, but if she does and she is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; considered a tenant of that property (nor are there &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; current tenants), you should look into changing the locks and possibly installing security cameras. If you do have tenants on that property you can&amp;#39;t just change the locks or install cameras, you&amp;#39;ll have to talk to them first and come to an arrangement as far as how to proceed. Things are easier if the house is currently empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; considered a tenant of that property, then you need to proceed more carefully. You can&amp;#39;t just toss her out, and trying to sell the property while she is resident in it will be difficult at best - especially if she claims to own the property or that she will own it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did your fathers estate have a lawyer?
