(This was a problem, from memory, because if you don&amp;#39;t send a &amp;#39;hang up&amp;#39; message correctly it can take 30-60 seconds before it permitted another call, even though the current call is clearly over.  All other calls to your mobile would get a &amp;#39;busy&amp;#39; signal, even though the user thought they had hung up the call correctly.  We only had this problem for one carrier in New Zealand  - everywhere else it behaved perfectly.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For testing EPIRBS you have to notify them in advance (and in fact this tells them to give you details from their end of the message etc) but, in my area, for emergency dialing it was sufficient simply to tell the operator that you are testing and that there was no emergency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes - as someone whose job in the past involved tracking down this kind of problem I can well imagine a sensible scenario of saying &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve enabled more logging to track the problem - can you try again.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;  This doesn&amp;#39;t mean &amp;#39;I am crowd sourcing testing for an essential service&amp;#39; - it means &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;There is a problem now that we haven&amp;#39;t seen before and if you can do this we can get it resolved as soon as possible&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes - the internet is strange.  Sometimes you even get people who have done that kind of testing in the past to answer the question!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-- Mac&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dgd0amf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426571.0, "created_utc": 1492397771.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbsgl1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SentraFan", "parent_id": "t1_dgbohu1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dude,\n\nThe carriers have all the logs they need at network.
