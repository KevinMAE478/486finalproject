I can not convince you through anything I say as many of you have already made up your mind and refuse to listen to anything I say about their relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a guy either.

She acted like it was not a big deal. He asked if she wanted him to drive her home and she said no. He asked if she wanted to call a friend to come pick her up and she said no. She wanted to stay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 7-8ish last night he confronted her about everything he knew and they had a pretty heated argument that ended up with him crying and leaving suddenly in his car.

She contacted her parents two weeks after conception and has been running the long con on them since.

They, my bro, his gf, and her parents, had a very long conversation about everything going on. They are flying down tomorrow to try and sort this all out. Although my bro is refunding the cost of the plane ticket plus buying their plane tickets to come out since he did feel extremely guilty about the whole situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the parents know about the father and know that he is willing to take care of the child they are unwilling to help with the adoption now. The girl is unhappy about that but not because she is suddenly &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot; in an abusive relationship, but because she simply does not want to be a parent.
