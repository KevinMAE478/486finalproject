Yes, this is an APS issue.  This is a pretty clear case of self-neglect, which is abuse.  In fact, the majority of cases that APS handles are people not being able to care for themselves.  Get APS involved and let them evaluate the situation.  \n\nNow here's what you can do to speed the process along:\n\n1.  Get contact info for everyone with knowledge of the situation.  This includes her doctors.\n2.  Get a list of the medications she is supposed to be on.\n  \n3.  Compile a history for the worker.  This is just helpful.  Be as precise as you can but don't worry about getting somethings wrong.  It will help the worker form a timeline and document the decline.\n \n4.  Document any instances you have witnessed showing her behavior that is a danger to herself or others.  As it continues, get specific with Dates and times.  The better that it is documented, the more the worker will understand. \n\n5.  Contact your mother's doctor and ask for a referral for a mental health exam.  The APS worker can usually help with this if you mother isn't cooperating, which is a strong possibility.  But talk to her doctor and explain your concerns regardless of whether you mother wants to go or not.  \n\n6.  Get a referral going for Meals On Wheels.  This does two things:  1.  You know that she is getting food daily.  2.  Another set of eyeballs on the situation.  They are a wonderful organization, please use them.  \n\n7.  If you are worried about your mother or haven't heard from her, call the police for a welfare check.  It is simple to do and the more eyes you get on this the better.  My cops were great for me when I needed to do this.  If you are worried about her, get them to check on her if you can't go yourself. \n \n8. Prepare yourself mentally.  Alcoholism isn't a quick fix issue and there is a pretty good chance she will never stop.  If she does, at this point it needs to be under a doctors supervision.  There are real dangers here if she quits cold turkey.  This is going to take some time and she may fight you the whole way.  Lean on the APS worker and the supervisor to find a solution here.  This needs to be a community solution, not an individual one.  \n\n9.  If she is on disability, then she probably already has Medicaid.  Start on the Medicaid website to determine what they will pay for, such as nursing home care.  The biggest problem in dealing with Medicaid is knowing what to ask, they won't tell you.  So find some suitable nursing homes or care facilities and contact them.  Talk to the intake coordinator or someone with a similar title.  They will help you know which questions to ask if you need to and will do a lot of the legwork for you should you need it.  If you have additional questions, also pop on over to r/socialwork and ask those good people. \n\n10.  It is going to be hard to force this issue but that doesn't mean you stop.  Be persistent with everyone.  Work with APS and let them know that you want to help, that you are willing to do some of the follow-up.  Be proactive.  You will run into roadblocks.  Just take a deep breath and keep going. \n\n11.  There are such things as Chemical Dependency warrants that you can file yourself.  However, I would recommend talking to the APS worker about this as my state was not Penn.  Ask APS about this.  If you can file it, show a judge that your mother is a danger to herself due to her self abuse, then she can be taken into a hospital.  FOLLOW HER and talk to the doctors personally.  I cannot stress this one enough.  \n\nI hope this helps.  Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions about the process.  I wish you and yours the best of luck.

But talk to her doctor and explain your concerns regardless of whether you mother wants to go or not.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a referral going for Meals On Wheels.  This does two things:  1.  You know that she is getting food daily.  2.  Another set of eyeballs on the situation.  They are a wonderful organization, please use them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are worried about your mother or haven&amp;#39;t heard from her, call the police for a welfare check.  It is simple to do and the more eyes you get on this the better.  My cops were great for me when I needed to do this.  If you are worried about her, get them to check on her if you can&amp;#39;t go yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare yourself mentally.  Alcoholism isn&amp;#39;t a quick fix issue and there is a pretty good chance she will never stop.  If she does, at this point it needs to be under a doctors supervision.  There are real dangers here if she quits cold turkey.  This is going to take some time and she may fight you the whole way.  Lean on the APS worker and the supervisor to find a solution here.  This needs to be a community solution, not an individual one.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she is on disability, then she probably already has Medicaid.  Start on the Medicaid website to determine what they will pay for, such as nursing home care.  The biggest problem in dealing with Medicaid is knowing what to ask, they won&amp;#39;t tell you.  So find some suitable nursing homes or care facilities and contact them.  Talk to the intake coordinator or someone with a similar title.  They will help you know which questions to ask if you need to and will do a lot of the legwork for you should you need it.  If you have additional questions, also pop on over to &lt;a href=\"/r/socialwork\"&gt;r/socialwork&lt;/a&gt; and ask those good people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is going to be hard to force this issue but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you stop.  Be persistent with everyone.  Work with APS and let them know that you want to help, that you are willing to do some of the follow-up.  Be proactive.  You will run into roadblocks.  Just take a deep breath and keep going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are such things as Chemical Dependency warrants that you can file yourself.  However, I would recommend talking to the APS worker about this as my state was not Penn.  Ask APS about this.  If you can file it, show a judge that your mother is a danger to herself due to her self abuse, then she can be taken into a hospital.  FOLLOW HER and talk to the doctors personally.  I cannot stress this one enough.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.  Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions about the process.  I wish you and yours the best of luck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dge1xr9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489155.0, "created_utc": 1492460355.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rkuc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdchxn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bushidomaster", "parent_id": "t3_65rkuc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is beyond a power of attorney.
