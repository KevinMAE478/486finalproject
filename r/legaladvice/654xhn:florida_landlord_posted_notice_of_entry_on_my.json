So if my bf or I wanted to be home, we were put in a position to have to call in to work last minute (which he did). For all I know, they could have gone around early this morning and posted them. I would have assumed (again, assumptions, I know) that they would post notices during business hours, not in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that they have been doing weird things like this more often lately (last month, they didn&amp;#39;t mail out the rent/water bills, we had to pick them up at the office, but they didn&amp;#39;t let us know. While at the same time, they email me to tell me about their events in the clubhouse all the time).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg7sxzh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129861.0, "created_utc": 1492101061.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sj2b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fooliam", "parent_id": "t3_654xhn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It is legal and considered reasonable.\n\nIt sounds like your property manager is otherwise reasonable.\n\nHave you tried talking to them about this?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is legal and considered reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like your property manager is otherwise reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you tried talking to them about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg7sj2b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129421.0, "created_utc": 1492100621.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654xhn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7fhcf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "parent_id": "t3_654xhn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/landlord) section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.
