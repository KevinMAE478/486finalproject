Most likely the police would tell them that this is a civil matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They could file a civil lawsuit against you.  It&amp;#39;s hard to say if they would do that, but it seems unlikely, and if they did, then it seems unlikely that they could convince a court that you stole what wasn&amp;#39;t given to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;B. Can I be made to pay past medical bills while I resided in my parents home and they paid all other medical bills and expenses &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;C. Can I press charges against my mother for harassment since she&amp;#39;s doing all of this to try and hound me, especially going through my friends to do so. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, criminal v. civil.  You can report her harassment to the police, but they aren&amp;#39;t going to do anything unless she&amp;#39;s threatened to kill you or something like that &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; it&amp;#39;s a credible threat.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;D. Can I get a restraining order against them so that they can&amp;#39;t contact me/show up at my university?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could TRY to get a restraining order, but I doubt that you would get one based only on what you have posted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am curious.
