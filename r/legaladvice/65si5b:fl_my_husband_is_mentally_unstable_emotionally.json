You are being used and abused. And you are a strong, intelligent, amazing woman with so much to offer the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems you may need a good advocate... a Counselor or therapist, to help you find your strength; and a great family lawyer to advise you. The best advice I could give is for you to follow your lawyer&amp;#39;s advice. You know that&amp;#39;s good advice! But I suspect it will be hard for you to take. Lawyers are tough clients! But if you could find one you&amp;#39;ll trust, it would help you a lot with the uncertainty portion of this situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you a romantic type of person? Are you afraid to be alone? Do you think you&amp;#39;ll never find anyone else, and this is better than nothing? What&amp;#39;s going on in you that you&amp;#39;re allowing these threats to cause you fear?  If he takes the car, report it stolen! If he sues for alimony, laugh!  He&amp;#39;ll never get it. He&amp;#39;s not dependent on you due to rearing your children or suffering from an illness..so a judge would see right through that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would you tell your best friend if she were you?
