I am curious whether that&amp;#39;s actually an option she&amp;#39;s ignoring because she doesn&amp;#39;t want to wait an additional day for the check, or if her boss is really that terrible. She&amp;#39;s my mom but now and then she fudges things...so we&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, from my poking around, that requiring an employee to come in to the office for a meeting outside of their shift might mean you have to pay them for that time? And from what she&amp;#39;s said, it is a meeting, her boss uses it to provide feedback and information as well as give out checks.If she really can&amp;#39;t get her check any other way I would think that makes it both &amp;quot;involuntary attendance&amp;quot; (2) and &amp;quot;training related to employee&amp;#39;s job&amp;quot; (3) according to DOL rules &lt;a href=\"http://www.mtrules.org/gateway/RuleNo.asp?RN=24%2E16%2E1009\"&gt;here?&lt;/a&gt;\nAlso, making someone on the night shift come in at an unspecified time during the day seems like requiring the employee to take extraordinary steps to get the check? &lt;a href=\"http://erd.dli.mt.gov/labor-standards/wage-and-hour-payment-act/electronic-wage-payment-faq\"&gt;3a here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I grasping at straws?
