Give them a cure or quit to fix the water billing issues before you move forward with filing anything...BUT...make sure all of your ducks are in a row and document &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Make sure your bills are paid, apartment is in good shape and you&amp;#39;re on good terms with your surrounding neighbours.  Let your neighbours know what you&amp;#39;re planning so you can avoid things like noise complaints...though I doubt that would be a problem.  Remember they can&amp;#39;t evict you without a court order, so you&amp;#39;ll have your day in court to outline the issues you&amp;#39;ve encountered and get the eviction request denied if you&amp;#39;ve got everything in order.  They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you&amp;#39;re in violation of your lease and relevant laws to get you evicted.  Don&amp;#39;t give them anything to go on in court and they&amp;#39;ll get laughed at by the judge.  Through my brief reading on Florida tenancy laws, it doesn&amp;#39;t sound critical enough for you to legally justify withholding rent unless they actually do retaliate by shutting off utilities etc.  Heavily document and even video record yourself dropping off rent payments so they can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;lose&amp;quot; the cheque.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg4then", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969284.0, "created_utc": 1491940484.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4sbyi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dorothyzborsnackpack", "parent_id": "t1_dg46dm4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, but they are too scared to do anything", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, but they are too scared to do anything&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg4sbyi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968050.0, "created_utc": 1491939250.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg46dm4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bigpipes84", "parent_id": "t3_64par5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think your best best is to get every tenant on board.
