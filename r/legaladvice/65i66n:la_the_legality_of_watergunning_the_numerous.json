I'm here in Houston, and every time I move one foot to the left, I'm simultaneously committing battery against every citizen of Louisiana simultaneously! \n\nIt seems that the minimum sentence is 120 days for battery. Thus, if I'm a couch potato and move only once per hour, and am awake for 16 hours per day, each day I commit 74.4 million acts of battery against the citizens of Louisiana. Thus, over the course of one year, I rack up a minimum of sentence of 8.93 billion years of mandatory minimum jail time in Louisiana. Of course, even if I'm immortal, I'll never be able to serve this time, as the sun will die long before I serve that sentence.

According to the letter of Louisiana law, merely walking past someone or driving past them counts as battery. After all, when I walk past someone, there is an incredibly minute amount of gravitational force generated between myself and them. Thus, when I walk past them, I am exerting a force upon them without their consent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hell, I don&amp;#39;t even have to enter Louisiana to do so! I&amp;#39;m here in Houston, and every time I move one foot to the left, I&amp;#39;m simultaneously committing battery against every citizen of Louisiana simultaneously! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that the minimum sentence is 120 days for battery. Thus, if I&amp;#39;m a couch potato and move only once per hour, and am awake for 16 hours per day, each day I commit 74.4 million acts of battery against the citizens of Louisiana.
