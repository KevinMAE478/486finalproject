You need to be in full CYA mode from now on.  She's obviously out for blood and doesn't give a shit about you, so you need to make sure to protect yourself.

If she tries to draw you into any fights or conflicts in the future just stonewall her and don't let yourself react.  Just keep on recording.  And sure as hell don't let her know you're recording, ever.  When she falsely accuses you of DV, assault, etc you'll be glad you have them.\n\nAs other people have said, your alimony responsibilities will be minimal based on the length of your marriage.  Obviously your mentally ill wife and her mentally ill mother won't react well when they find out this is the case, so brace yourself for things to get much worse when this happens.  And if you can don't mention this fact to them until they find out for themselves, you want to keep them in the dark about this as long as possible to give yourself time.\n\nFrom now until the divorce is finalized and signed you need to be a fucking boy scout.  Get on your CO's and NCO's good sides.  Volunteer for less desirable duties before you're voluntold.  Give them a heads up that the shitstorm that is your wife is likely to show up sooner or later, so when she comes to them with some made up B.S. it's not totally out of the blue.\n\nSomeone else here was able to find out with some really basic internet stalking that you've been doing some less than legal substances.  Time to stop, immediately.  If you're in the middle of a cycle, transition to PCT now.  If you're doing PCT, finish it.  If you're between cycles, don't start another one.  Get rid of anything you won't be using for PCT, then once PCT is over get rid of absolutely everything including paraphernalia, even if you have a full cycle ready to go.  The cost of a full cycle is far less than what you stand to lose if you get popped, please don't be stupid.  Delete your posts linked to this account that mention those less than legal substances.  You're reasonably safe as long as your wife thinks she's going to get those sweet sweet alimony checks, but once she finds out she isn't she'll drop a dime on you.  Look up how long detection times are for the various substances you've been taking, just so you know. \n\nFor the house, stupid to have her on the deed but not on the loan, but seems like you've realized that now so lesson learned.  Your lawyer should be able to help you with this, but worst case scenario would probably be that she's entitled to half the equity in the house (NOT half the value of the house).  If you can, you'd probably want to work out a deal where you buy out her half of the house as part of the divorce settlement, otherwise you'd want to force a sale immediately.  You absolutely do not want to own the house with her after this is over.\n\nAlso, don't feel bad about \"cheating\" on your wife.  If kissing some other chick is all you did then yeah, not great, but far from the worst thing someone has done in a relationship.  If she knows about it don't let her use it to guilt you into doing something you don't want to do, and don't let her use it to justify any actions she might take that would harm you.\n\nAs far as her \"standard of living\", that likely isn't going to do her much good.  Both because of the short duration of the marriage, and the fact that the courts will look at the earning potential of the supported spouse.  If she's able to work then when alimony is calculated it will be assumed that she is able to make $X amount of dollars, regardless of whether or not she actually does so, and that will be money you won't have to provide.\n\nA final thing to keep in mind is that the last time you had sex with your wife is also the last time you ever had sex with your wife.  Several painful months from now you'll be able to wash your hands of this whole ordeal and have the rest of your life to look forward to.  If you fuck up and get her pregnant you've got two decades of her draining you for child support, playing games with your kid to fuck with you, probably a few false accusations of child abuse in order to limit your time with your kid, etc.  And if she magically claims to be pregnant all of a sudden then for the love of everything holy get a paternity test ASAP.
