Can they do any of this legally? They didn&amp;#39;t know who our office manager was, if she would even have access to my SSN, nothing. It just happens that in our small company the phone rings to her extension if you don&amp;#39;t enter one yourself. If she doesn&amp;#39;t pick up, it gets routed to a random employee that would not have any access to sensitive information. I&amp;#39;m just blown away by this. Is this even legal??\nCan I get them to stop calling my work? I will NEVER discuss anything with them at work because we have an open office environment. How they hell can they offer up my social to whoever answers without even knowing who the hell they were talking to?? What can I do??\nEdit: we are small enough that we do not have a proper HR department.
