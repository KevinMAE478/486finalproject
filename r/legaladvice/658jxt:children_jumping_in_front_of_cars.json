On my street, this family moved catty-corner next to my house and quickly became the neighbors from hell.  It's a couple with 2 small boys, they can't be any older than five.  The kids are usually unsupervised and are almost always playing in the front driveway or in the street.  The problem is, they do so very recklessly.\n&gt; \n&gt; They ride skateboards down their sloped driveway (between their parents' car so you can't see them coming down the road) into the street. They ride bikes down the street and stop them behind cars backing out.  The worst thing they do though is wait on the side of the road when cars approach, and then jump in front of them at the last second.  They have done this to me a couple times, I've seen them do it to a family member of mine and another neighbor as well (both of whom scolded the child).  Thank god the driver slammed the breaks every time. Someone must have brought this up to the parents because a few months ago they started plopping a neon SLOW sign in the middle of the road (our street is so narrow I have to get out of my car and move it aside to get by). However, the kids' behavior has not changed, and I still rarely see one of their parents supervising them while they're outside.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don't know if I should contact child protective services or submit an anonymous police report.  It's only a matter of time before one of these boys kills themselves doing this.

On my street, this family moved catty-corner next to my house and quickly became the neighbors from hell.  It&amp;#39;s a couple with 2 small boys, they can&amp;#39;t be any older than five.  The kids are usually unsupervised and are almost always playing in the front driveway or in the street.  The problem is, they do so very recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ride skateboards down their sloped driveway (between their parents&amp;#39; car so you can&amp;#39;t see them coming down the road) into the street. They ride bikes down the street and stop them behind cars backing out.  The worst thing they do though is wait on the side of the road when cars approach, and then jump in front of them at the last second.  They have done this to me a couple times, I&amp;#39;ve seen them do it to a family member of mine and another neighbor as well (both of whom scolded the child).  Thank god the driver slammed the breaks every time. Someone must have brought this up to the parents because a few months ago they started plopping a neon SLOW sign in the middle of the road (our street is so narrow I have to get out of my car and move it aside to get by). However, the kids&amp;#39; behavior has not changed, and I still rarely see one of their parents supervising them while they&amp;#39;re outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I should contact child protective services or submit an anonymous police report.  It&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before one of these boys kills themselves doing this.  I also really don&amp;#39;t want to get personally caught up in anyway with them, I can&amp;#39;t afford a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg8a84g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148884.0, "created_utc": 1492120084.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658jxt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658jxt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658jxt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94388", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "parles", "parent_id": "t1_dg8bucr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why are you so against speaking with the parents?
