We have been here for about 8 months now, and I would say about 4 months ago, a new couple moved in below us. Ever since then, they have complained constantly to the landlord about us being loud on the weekends. What they are referring to is when we have guests over. They do stay late, and stay over sometimes in our apartment on Saturdays but we have since done everything we can to mitigate this issue including:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Only using a small bluetooth speaker for music. We verified with our landlord that the music CANNOT be heard downstairs in their apartment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Installed hundreds of dollars in area rugs on the floor, which was inspected by the landlord&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Requested all of our guests take their shoes off when they arrive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Made sure we do not stomp around when we walk&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have also taken off work, to stay home and work through this issue with the landlord. My wife and I are trying as best we can to mitigate this issue. We are not college kids having wild parties. We have a few guests, maybe 3-6 over at a time and we are usually just talking in the kitchen or playing cards.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, the downstairs neighbors were BANGING on their ceiling while we were talking in the kitchen. This afternoon, we received a letter on our door stating that they will go to the police if the &amp;quot;heavy walking, hard banging on the floors, and loud talking with guests&amp;quot; continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have lived below people before, and know it can be a nightmare. Throughout the week we are EXTREMELY quiet, to the point of almost library quiet. We do not have kids running around, we do not walk on our heals, but once a week we will have guests over on a Friday or Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really do want the police to come. We have not received complaints from anyone else, and we are not having wild loud parties that would be anything reportable. I just purchased a decibel meter so I can use it to prove we are not being out of control. At this point, I am not sure what else to do. We have honestly tried everything we can short of not having guests over and not talking at all. We truly have tried to do what we can to mitigate the issue, and it feels like we are walking on egg shells all the time and may disturb them at any moment. I feel almost harassed now that I have received this letter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should my course of action be? Should I reply to the letter? Can I call the police myself next time we have guests over to show we are not being unreasonable? I sent an email to the landlord this morning outlining most of what I said here, and explained we have done everything we can short of not having any guests over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Well I have an update. I spoke to the landlord(when I say landlord, it&amp;#39;s the woman who works in the office and has been dealing with this issue, it&amp;#39;s a larger complex EDIT: Shes the property manager, sorry if I confused anyone) she said that she&amp;#39;s sending these complaints to their legal department so that they can send me a legal cease letter and will have to take action if it doesnt stop. What she is referring to is walking and talking in the apartment. I told her we have not played music after quiet hours and she said there have never been complaints about music, just walking and talking after quiet hours with guests. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. She also said we had a complaint from a neighbor 8 months ago across the street who called the police. I asked why we never heard anything of this or had police come and she said they didn&amp;#39;t know what apartment\u200b it was and the police didn&amp;#39;t know what apartment it was. I have no idea how she can pin that on us when there are multiple other apartments within the building. I have a group legal plan with my work. I contacted an attorney but haven&amp;#39;t heard back yet. Thanks for the help so far everyone. This is extremely stressful and my wife is very upset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: Here is the follow up email from the property manager:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope you had a good Holiday. I wanted to follow-up on my conversation we had this morning regarding the noise complaints and the email I received below. I am sending you this notice in response to the various communications we have had regarding disrupting noise that I have received from other tenants after quiet time hours of 9:30 pm through 9:30 am coming from your apartment. To reiterate on our conversation, I explained to you the noise that is happening that is coming out of your apartment is too loud for 11:30 p. m through the early hours of the morning. I inspected your apartment Monday April 10, 2017, and advised you could use another runner and additional area rug around the front of your bar area in the kitchen going into the living room to be in compliance with the 80% of wood floors in apartment covered. I was hoping this would resolve the issue. However it has not. I have experience myself coming home late (early mornings) laughing , loud voices . This would not be in unusual if it was 8pm at night, but not at quiet time hours especially after 11 p.m. \nAfter you received the new carpet this past weekend I have received another complaint as discussed today regarding noise on Saturday 4/15/17 from 11:00 p.m. through 2 a.m. It seems the complaint noise such as loud laughing, loud voices and heavy walking and banging. Not music. What you might think is just a normal get together at that hour 11 p.m. to early morning hours loud laughing talking loud could be perceived completely different. I hope you understand the sensitivity of this situation. If you have some sort of fan or something that has a vibration that can affect the apartment below please put it on a chair or piece of furniture not directly on the floor. Page 19 -#21.5. Tenant shall not interfere with or disturb the comfort and rights of other tenants. No annoying sounds, lights, odors shall be permitted. Tenant shall not violate any noise or nuisance ordinance of the \u201cTownship of ***** and shall be responsible and shall be responsible for any non-compliance by tenants guests. \nI know we can work together on this to make sure all are happy and living in the comfort of their homes without loud disturbances. This will be sent to our legal department to serve that the rules and regulations are being exercised. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the parts that really drives me insane:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have experience myself coming home late (early mornings) laughing , loud voices&amp;quot; She stated she had heard laughing before when she was walking outside. We have a balcony, so I imagine what she heard was people out there talking. Regardless, even if this is at 11pm and during quiet hours, this STILL seems reasonable to me! As you can see there is no screaming or yelling. She is reporting us for guests who are talking or laughing outside. Maybe I am wrong but I just can&amp;#39;t understand this. Again you can see, music is NOT the issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you have some sort of fan or something that has a vibration that can affect the apartment below please put it on a chair or piece of furniture not directly on the floor.&amp;quot; This seems so petty to me, that we have to place our standing fan on a piece of furniture and not directly on the floor. Again, maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong and its really not that difficult to do but my god. It is hard to live somewhere when everything you do is scrutinized to such an extreme point. It is so stressful, I never know what I can and can&amp;#39;t do that will anger the downstairs neighbors, or now, the property manager who has fully taken their side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My wife and I live in an apartment complex in NJ.

They are in their right to complain if of course there is excessive noise during those periods.\n\nPoint out that they are the new tenants and likely do not have experience living in a lower unit. As a result they are disrupting your quiet enjoyment of the property (they will likely claim the same). There are just some realities one has to accept with apartment living and that is you're going to hear your neighbors sometimes.\n\nIf they get the law involved, you'll have to do the same.\n\nEdit: Ask any neighbors if they would like to go on record if they have any evidence of noise from your apartment. Try and document your interactions, and document that you've been reasonable and accommodating. Also document your proof and refute any claims against you. Furthermore, request a sit down meeting with the management and neighbor.

I mean I loved watching the show just as much as the next person but when it came on I would hear the theme music blare and the entire show. \n\nI talked to the office a couple times and he didn't want to turn it down. I have a very good surround sound system I really never got to use to its full capacity until the day it stopped. CSI was about to start so I loaded up call of duty or some other shooter game. \n\nRight as it started I cranked the volume of the surround sound way up. I played one 10 minute match and turned it down. He never did it again. I don't think he realized that the sound would make it through until I showed him. \n\nTL:DR Apartment life can suck but bad neighbors can make it worse. If they are unhappy they will leave soon.
