I&amp;#39;m in an unfortunate situation here in Albuquerque, NM. I was at a public park with my daughter and my dog. We were the only ones in the park at the time so I made the mistake of letting my dog off leash for the very first time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter and I were under a playground building a sandcastle. Since we were alone I decided to let her play while I went to a bench to get more sunscreen lotion for her- the bench was about 50 feet away. As I was walking there I saw my dog get up and make a beeline towards where my daughter was. When I looked in that direction I saw a german shepherd in the area of my daughter. My dog proceeded to do a full on attack and kept on attacking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t break them up right away because I had to get my daughter away from the situation first. When I finally got control of my dog and secured them both in my truck there was a lot of blood on my dog&amp;#39;s snout but I couldn&amp;#39;t find any wounds. It seemed like my dog had attacked for no reason which is EXTREMELY out of character for him. This is a lab/miniature pincher mix that is about the size of a blue heeler that has never shown the slightest bit of aggresion towards people or animals- not your typical guard dog or &amp;quot;fighting&amp;quot; type. The dog he attacked was literally 3 times his size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I spoke to the owner of the other dog she was understandably upset and there was a descent amount of damage to the dog&amp;#39;s snout and ears. The owner explained to me that they were walking along a hidden bike path behind where we were building the sand castle. When they approached my daughter popped out and said hello like she does with everyone- this startled the dog who is on the older side. The dog responded by barking at my daughter and posturing momentarily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now before I proceed let me make it clear that I understand this is my fault and should have never happened. I also understand that I am liable for the damage caused. I should have had my dog on a leash as the law states. I made the mistake of leaving my daughter momentarily to get the sunscreen. I gave the owner of the other dog my info, information on my dog&amp;#39;s vaccinations and assured her I would pay reasonable vet bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now about a week after the incedent the owner of the other dog contacted me saying I need to reimburse them $4000 for the dog&amp;#39;s injuries. I know I am at fault but this seems extremely high for what seemed like significant but superficial wounds. Still, I told the owner of the other dog to mail me copies of vet bills and we could set up a reimbursement plan. When I asked for the bills the owner became extremely upset and refused to provide the bills to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told the owner I wanted to end the conversation for the time being until their temper calmed down and we could talk rationally. A few days later the onwner contacted me again and said a &amp;quot;portion&amp;quot; of the $4000 is for their dog&amp;#39;s pain and suffering. I want to do the right thing here and make things right- but it feels like this person is trying to take advantage of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions are: Am I being unreasonable in only being willing to pay actual vet bills and requiring those bills be provided to me? and more importantly- if we cannot come to an agreement and this has to be handled in court is my dog in any danger of being euthanized? The dog is non aggressive- I know it seems foolish saying that given the context but I&amp;#39;ve had the dog for 5 years and this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever seen him act even remotely like this. Event though the situation was my fault and I made some bad decisions I&amp;#39;m terrified of my dog paying the price. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m at work so I can&amp;#39;t respond often- but I am reading all of your replies and I genuinly appreciate everyone&amp;#39;s input.
