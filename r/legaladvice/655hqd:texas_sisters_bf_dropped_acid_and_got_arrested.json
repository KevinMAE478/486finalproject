An eviction only happens after you've been told you can't legally stay there *and you stay anyway*.\n\nLegally, your sister shouldn't be there after her notice is up.  But, the landlord can't take the law into his own hands and kick her out.  First he has to go to court and prove she's not legally entitled to be there.  During that time he can't kick her out, but shes not there legally either.  She's just playing the system to live there without permission until they go through the hoops to legally kick her out.\n\nYour sister should be careful.  If she stays all the way until the eviction hearing and gets evicted it will be very hard for her to find a new apartment.  Some places even report if an eviction case was brought against her even if she leaves before the court date.  It would be best for her to work something out with the management company or leave as soon as she can.
