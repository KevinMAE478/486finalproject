But that is not the case in NY with regards to toplessness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no statute or caselaw in NY that affirmatively gives women the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; to be topless in public (nor, for that matter, is there a statute or caselaw that affirmatively gives men the same right). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a statute that prohibits indecent exposure, and there is caselaw that says it violates equal protection to enforce that statute in a way that allows men to go topless in public but not women. The practical effect is that, as that statute is currently interpreted and enforced, both male and female toplessness is &amp;quot;legal.&amp;quot; But it would likely be permissible for the state to reinterpret the statute and enforce it in a way that prohibits toplessness by both men and women (although I think it would take probably a strained reading of the definition of &amp;quot;indecent exposure&amp;quot;) or to pass a new statute that explicitly bans public toplessness by both genders. So, while it is currently legal, neither men nor women have a &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; under NY law to be topless in public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; to toplessness because, with a properly crafted law, the state could legally prohibit toplessness by both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "name": "t1_dg5vyl6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034128.0, "created_utc": 1492005328.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5j0ua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bsievers", "parent_id": "t1_dg5iyru", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaladvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're using \"legal\" to mean \"protected\".
