The calls come as early as 8am(just received one at 9am today, causing me to make this post) and sometimes as late as 9pm. \n&gt; \n&gt; The calls come from various companies either offering to renegotiate my credit card debt(I have none) or asking specifically for a woman by name. It's always been the same person they ask for, and that person is not me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I was applying for a membership at a pet store I frequent, and they already had my phone number registered under a different name. That person shared the last name of the lady who the collections agencies are trying to contact, so I assume that this person changed their phone number forever ago and I got stuck with the number that the collections agencies have.\n&gt; \n&gt; The calls aren't that big of an inconvenience, but as the title says, I've been getting them for almost a decade now. It's just annoying.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there anything I can do other than tell them to pound sand? I know that debt collectors have a stringent set of rules regulations they must follow, but I'm not well versed enough to know if this is some kind of violation that I can threaten them with.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before you ask, yes, I've asked them to stop. Yes, I've told them this isn't me, and that they have the wrong number. They're persistent. I get calls at least once a week.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, whoever offers advice", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/myIAb\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/myIAb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a bot whose sole purpose is to improve the timeliness and accuracy of responses in this subreddit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please update the body of your original post to include this information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do NOT delete this post - Instead, simply edit the post with the requested information.&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocationBot/\"&gt;Report Inaccuracies Here&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/ianpugh/LocationBot2.0\"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/u/ianp\"&gt;Author&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://locationbot.info\"&gt;LocationBot Statistics (Not Mobile Friendly)&lt;/a&gt; | LocationBot v2.1.1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original Post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;a href=\"/u/I_HEART_SMEGMA\"&gt;/u/I_HEART_SMEGMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Been receiving calls for someone else&amp;#39;s debt for close to a decade.
