When my girlfriend said she hadn't seen it, the woman called her a liar and grabbed her arm and jerked her out, reaching around to her back pocket to snatch my girlfriends phone (which I bought her). My girlfriend started yelling for someone to call security while everyone in there was trying to get the woman to stop. My girlfriend tried to leave and the woman kept pulling her arm back. A police officer who is technically a part time security for the team in this instance came over and told her to stop, and the woman still held on. My girlfriend said \"help me\" and he said \"I can't come in the women's restroom\" and finally the woman let go. According to the woman, her two little girls told her my girlfriend took her phone. Her husband had it the entire time.\n&gt; \n&gt; We all spoke to the cop, multiple witnesses corroborated the story and the cop asked if my girlfriend wanted to press assault charges. In the midst of all this, after trying to apologize, the assaulter left the premises and the officer didn't even take a report. When the witnesses asked him to do something, he said he couldn't because the woman had already left. We went to the team security and asked them to track down the woman and the officer, but we didn't know either's name. A police officer finally took our report but said there's not much they could do more than likely.\n&gt; \n&gt; This seems like a gross failure by team security and downright negligence. My girlfriend doesn't want to leave the house and I can't reach for her hand without her cringing and crying.

When my girlfriend said she hadn&amp;#39;t seen it, the woman called her a liar and grabbed her arm and jerked her out, reaching around to her back pocket to snatch my girlfriends phone (which I bought her). My girlfriend started yelling for someone to call security while everyone in there was trying to get the woman to stop. My girlfriend tried to leave and the woman kept pulling her arm back. A police officer who is technically a part time security for the team in this instance came over and told her to stop, and the woman still held on. My girlfriend said &amp;quot;help me&amp;quot; and he said &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t come in the women&amp;#39;s restroom&amp;quot; and finally the woman let go. According to the woman, her two little girls told her my girlfriend took her phone. Her husband had it the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all spoke to the cop, multiple witnesses corroborated the story and the cop asked if my girlfriend wanted to press assault charges. In the midst of all this, after trying to apologize, the assaulter left the premises and the officer didn&amp;#39;t even take a report. When the witnesses asked him to do something, he said he couldn&amp;#39;t because the woman had already left. We went to the team security and asked them to track down the woman and the officer, but we didn&amp;#39;t know either&amp;#39;s name. A police officer finally took our report but said there&amp;#39;s not much they could do more than likely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems like a gross failure by team security and downright negligence.
