Ive seen like 200 lb bands so you will have plenty of weight period, Attach the band to something at a low surface then stand on the bench for a goblet squat, wide stance as this uses more hamstring and glute, that you try to build. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Band Deadlifts, Buy a bunch of bands, place a deadlift bar over some high paralettes or something to where they have a bit of tension on them, elevate yourself to where they are at normal deadlift position and then perform a deadlift, It gets harder as it goes up which makes it amazing for glutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Band resisted hip bridges/thrust. I would suggest attaching these to PBC pipe, cause you can just attach tons of bands to this and its a great butt builder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same concept can be applied get a long bench, attach bands to pbc pipe hook heels behind it and use it for a prone hamstring curl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also get a pullup bar and a bench extend your legs straight out over a bench and place the band resisted PBC pipe under your legs to create a hamstring curl where you go down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also try nordic hamstring curls, these involve hooking your feet under something and almost touching your face to the ground then extending back up, these are great aswell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any sort of lunge also works, If your a masochist you can attach a band to the bend in the knee that is extending and do them in place while you have the other leg remaining straight behind you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your upper hamstring will make your gluteals seem bigger, thats why i suggested some other exercises as well. There you go, 8  exercises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alot of this stuff is going to take some toying with angles, but bands can provide a good workout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "name": "t1_dgaufm9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492302965.0, "created_utc": 1492274165.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65icmo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65icmo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3jak", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Skinwalker-", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2kvp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodyweightfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nah brah", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nah brah&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "name": "t1_dgd3jak", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492431491.0, "created_utc": 1492402691.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2kvp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Amenisis", "parent_id": "t3_65icmo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodyweightfitness", "controversiality": 1, "body": "but fit/small/firm is where its at . . .
