If you are doing them to build a baseline it is fine to do them every day. If you are using them for strength you may get more by doing them 3 days a week. If you progress them and do more than a minute, you will eventually end up in the latter of those groups.\n\nFor instance, i do a plank with arms straight and placed some distance \"above\" (in front of) my head. When i can hold that a minute i will go to feet on a bosu ball, hands on a medicine ball. One minute of this is HARD and you will feel it the next day. This is less like bodyline work and more like a static strength exercise. So there is a line where they transition from one into another.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depends.
