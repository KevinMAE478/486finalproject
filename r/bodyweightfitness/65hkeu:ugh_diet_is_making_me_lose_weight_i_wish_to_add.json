I thought it was rare. :)  \n&gt;I will add Yogurt. That's easy. How do you have yours? With sugar?\n&gt;Cottage cheese, I don't know how people eat it. Tried. Very tough to digest. \n\n\nBhakri is the only Indian bread I know how to make, and I prefer it over boring roti. \nI have my yogurt plain, I don't really like sweets. In america, it's homemade. In India, I preferred store-bought since my relatives would only make sour yogurt for lassi. \nI like cottage cheese... mostly because I was a camp counselor one summer and it was the only vegetarian source of protein the provided. After 3 days of zero protein, my body decided cottage cheese was delicious. If you don't like my diet, you don't have to copy it, I was just giving you an idea of what another vegetarian, partially Indian diet looks like.  \n\n&gt; Also, avocados in US may be different. Here it's simply bitter.  \n\nOur avocados (some Californian, mostly imported from mexico) are very buttery with a very subtle sweetness. Could you find out where your juice center gets your avocados? I'm just curious and it'll make it easier for me to find them next time I'm in India.  \n\n&gt;Haha! It is real. These juice center guys do it live - right in front of us - and charge me 35 bucks per glass. They get a KG of avocados for 70 bucks. Without sugar, the juice is just bland. Should I keep up with it? That's the best drink one can get, right? I am also alternating between milkshake now (mango and sapota). \n\nThere's a lot of conficting information about juice/shakes out there. There's a lot of ways to do it correctly and there are a lot of ways to do it incorrectly. I don't really know enough to say if it's good or not, but I do know that it's best if you get something that's nutrient dense (high nutrient/calorie ratio, don't get that confused with a high nutrient/volume ratio).  \n\n\n&gt; Yes, devising a plan at the moment. I discounted ghee as unhealthy, and it's a little confusing after reading some of the opinions here.  \n\nNonfat diets were a fad created in the 90s and were perpetuated by the sugar industry because when people took the fat out of their food, they needed to add sugar to make it taste good again. There's nothing wrong with fat or sugar, as long as you consume it in moderate quantities. \n\nI highly recommend myfitnesspal. It has Indian food too! Most things that Most people know about dieting is false (take for example the idea that fat=bad). MFP helps you do a better job of tracking everything analytically and safely instead of relying on opinions. You should also look into finding out exactly what percentage of protein, carbs, and fat (aka macros) you should include in your diet. I'd provide this information, but I don't remember the details and don't want to give you incorrect information. \n\n\n", "edited": 1492440841.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bhakri we used to make.

After 3 days of zero protein, my body decided cottage cheese was delicious. If you don&amp;#39;t like my diet, you don&amp;#39;t have to copy it, I was just giving you an idea of what another vegetarian, partially Indian diet looks like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, avocados in US may be different. Here it&amp;#39;s simply bitter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our avocados (some Californian, mostly imported from mexico) are very buttery with a very subtle sweetness. Could you find out where your juice center gets your avocados? I&amp;#39;m just curious and it&amp;#39;ll make it easier for me to find them next time I&amp;#39;m in India.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Haha! It is real. These juice center guys do it live - right in front of us - and charge me 35 bucks per glass. They get a KG of avocados for 70 bucks. Without sugar, the juice is just bland. Should I keep up with it? That&amp;#39;s the best drink one can get, right? I am also alternating between milkshake now (mango and sapota). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of conficting information about juice/shakes out there. There&amp;#39;s a lot of ways to do it correctly and there are a lot of ways to do it incorrectly. I don&amp;#39;t really know enough to say if it&amp;#39;s good or not, but I do know that it&amp;#39;s best if you get something that&amp;#39;s nutrient dense (high nutrient/calorie ratio, don&amp;#39;t get that confused with a high nutrient/volume ratio).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, devising a plan at the moment. I discounted ghee as unhealthy, and it&amp;#39;s a little confusing after reading some of the opinions here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonfat diets were a fad created in the 90s and were perpetuated by the sugar industry because when people took the fat out of their food, they needed to add sugar to make it taste good again. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with fat or sugar, as long as you consume it in moderate quantities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend myfitnesspal. It has Indian food too! Most things that Most people know about dieting is false (take for example the idea that fat=bad). MFP helps you do a better job of tracking everything analytically and safely instead of relying on opinions. You should also look into finding out exactly what percentage of protein, carbs, and fat (aka macros) you should include in your diet. I&amp;#39;d provide this information, but I don&amp;#39;t remember the details and don&amp;#39;t want to give you incorrect information. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "name": "t1_dgdkjp2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469439.0, "created_utc": 1492440639.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbq5ek", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "imbangalore", "parent_id": "t1_dgavyac", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodyweightfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; You're not eating enough.
