I just realized I've been practicing ring support holds and turning the rings out more and more but the whole time my elbows have been JUST shy of fully locked. And of course the extra 1 degree of arm extension to lock them out feels like it's 100x harder haha. So should the elbows fully lock out for a ring support hold or the top of a dip?
