Muscles are usually set in a somewhat contracted state when you use them a lot, which is good for delivering strength (Think cyclist or football players, who have short hamstrings as they spring a lot). This is the reason you don't want to static stretch before delivering power as you bring the muscle and other tissues out of their usual optimal state. So static stretching is ideal to become more flexible, so you could do them after your workout, but shouldn't be done before the workout.\n\nDynamic stretching on the other hand promotes loosening up, letting your body know where the limits are and getting the blood flowing a bit, so your body is ready for activity. That is why the RR warmup consists of dynamic stretches and not static one. They also target most of the muscles and tissues around your body that you will be working witb durng the RR. Better then just jumping jack and what not. If after the RR warmup you didn't have a small sweat, then by all means do a few burpees, squats, jumping jacks or whatever.\n\n2) that is true. I thought the mods were working on a more specific warming up for the legs, but I'm not sure. And there has been some discussion that the RR misses some leg exercises.

I&amp;#39;m new to home fitness and am just starting to look into the RR. I have a couple questions:\n1) I have been taught in all of my other exercise programs be it at gyms or things I follow online that you should always warm up before stretching (ie marching, high knees, jumping jacks, etc). What&amp;#39;s the reasoning behind not having that included in the RR?\n2) It seems like all of the stretching and essentially all of the activities aside from squats are targeting upper body. Is that a correct assessment? Or am I just missing how all the muscles work together?\nI&amp;#39;m looking to do a full body routine and have been doing this one: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/\"&gt;https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/&lt;/a&gt; for the past 2 weeks.
