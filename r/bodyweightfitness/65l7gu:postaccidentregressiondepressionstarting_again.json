I&amp;#39;m a 23 y/o male, 172 (5&amp;#39;7) cm and 69 kg (152 pounds) and most likely at 20-21% BF. I&amp;#39;ve started working out during the Summer of 2015 and continued working out till Fall of 2016. I&amp;#39;ve started my journey with &lt;a href=\"/r/bodyweightfitness\"&gt;/r/bodyweightfitness&lt;/a&gt; using the RR at no pullups and progressed to a PPL split and 15kg weighted pullups during that time. I&amp;#39;ve grown confident, self-assured and most importantly much more healthy. I got rid of excess fat and weight, had a much more functional body. Even though I started with aesthetic concerns, it became a ritual that I&amp;#39;ve become devout of.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue October 2016. I&amp;#39;ve been in a car accident, even though it didn&amp;#39;t impair me physically much (few broken bones in my arms and ankles), it cost the life of my 11 year old dog which spiraled me down to a bottomless pit. I&amp;#39;ve stopped working out altogether, which at the point was least of my worries, alienated myself from my social life and froze my uni semester. This continued in such manner until January 2016 despite using medication and seeing doctors. At that point I&amp;#39;ve met my girlfriend who patched me together.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started going out with her bit by bit, continued some of my studies and went back to working out. Now comes the bit which is relevant to this sub, I had lost a lot of my strength. I could hardly do a pullup, struggled maintaining a ring support hold due to me gaining fat and weight as well as the injuries that I sustained. I tried my best to continue on but when mid February hit, I&amp;#39;ve begun skipping workouts. As of today, I think I&amp;#39;ve worked out a grand total of 10 times (in a PPL split that is) since March.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to terms with loss of my strength as well as physique took its toll emotionally on to that point of &amp;#39;You can&amp;#39;t fail if you don&amp;#39;t try&amp;#39; mentality.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is me right &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/XtCMF\"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; both flexed and relaxed.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is actually pretty simple.

I guess you have to ask yourself the question of \"Why do you want to work out?\" Different people have different reasons, and my own might not work for you. You mentioned in your post that back then you worked out because it made you more confident, healthy, and that you enjoyed having a more functional body. Are your reasons still the same now? Do you have a different set of reasons? Having reasons or goals for working out will help you to stay consistent even when you're not feeling it. The fact that you made this post tells me that, at least, you want to come back and that you want to try again. And that in itself could be a good enough reason. All you need is to commit. Commit to trying, to giving it your best shot. One workout at a time. Don't skip, and don't give up. \n\nI don't know if my experience will apply to you but I'll share a little something anyway.

The change hit me pretty damn hard and I'm still adjusting. It wasn't even a bad change, it was by all definitions good. Amazing even. But it took me way out of my comfort zone and put a hold on my cirque dreams. Motivation had dropped to zero. Had close to 6 months off proper training. And then, one day I decided that I was just going to give it a go again. I'd loved training before, so why not? It wasn't a big revelation, just sort of a \"yeah, I used to do that. It was fun. Would be fun to try it again.\" And one session led to the next, and to the next. Do I know exactly why I'm doing this now? No. I've had some pretty big goals back then, do I have them now? No. I have some skills I think would be cool to achieve, but nothing set in stone.
