What phase did you start on and which one are you on now?\n\nDid the RR for 3 months or so. I started at phase 4, sort of. I just moved all of my skill work to off-days (which I used to do extra skill and mobility work anyway) and retook handstands (I was avoiding them since my wrists used to be too weak). That change was pretty useful for me and my routining now is better than it used to be. Thanks, Jokey!\n\n- What are your goals?\n\nI do it mainly for the fun and stress relief. I enjoy getting stronger and seeing progress and I have lots of fun with skill work. After I master handstands I want to be able to do one handed handstands, clean handstand walks and handstand presses, but those will take time! I enjoy watching handbalancing and I love playing with it so I want to git gud at it.\n\n- Are there bits that you absolutely hate doing?\n\nFlexibility work, which is odd because I enjoy mobility work. I think it's the discomfort from stretching I hate.\n\n- Did you change anything, and if so, what?\n\nMy strength days routine is basically Molding Mobility + RR warm-up + modified RR strength part (upper body is same, lower body is pistol and shrimp progression paired, L-sits and straddle L paired).\n\nThen off days is moar mobility + things like locomotive patterns and forward roll to warm-up + Emmet Louis fixing handstand stuff I can do + hollow holds + chest to wall handstand practice (drills from Antranik's handstand blogpost) + kicking to a back-to-wall handstand to practice kicking + crow pose variations + elbow lever (and want to start one arm elbow lever) + brachiation practice.\n\nInconsistently do flexibility work after that, which range from a single hamstring and quad stretches to full-fledged starting flexibility, depending on my mood. I also do lots of random stuff that I feel like doing in the day. I want to incorporate more gymnastics floor work and stuff like Ido's floreio.\n\n- Are there parts where the explanation of what to do isn't quite clear?\n\nNo, not really. But I think it could be more \"fleshed out\". Also, I really want to see the modules! I think it's a good part to expand on!\n\n- Do you feel the earlier phases have helped you building habits or did you think it was a waste of time and you would have rather started in a later one?\n\nI skipped them, but I recommend phase 1 as \"habit building\", I think it should work. I would drop the recommendation that you should stick with it for 2 weeks before moving on to a harder variation tho. I think 3-5 training sessions would be good enough since phase 2 isn't thaaaat harder.\n\n- Are there parts where the exercise demonstrations are subpar? (Yes, but got any better links? Would appreciate it :))\n\nWill look into it later.\n\n- Are there parts that especially helped your progress?\n\nMotivated me to get back to handstanding, taught me some good mobility and flexibility work, motivated me to change my lower body strenght routine (I liked your idea of unpairing leg and L-sits).\n\n- Are there things that did absolutely nothing for you?\n\nNo, not really.\n\n- How's your handstand?\n\nShit, but improving. Still shit, though.\n\n- Exercises you would like to see some programming for? There's still space for a phase 6.\n\nCurrently, nothing. When I get good I might suggest something.\n\n- If there is a phase 6, would you prefer a fixed routine or rather a collection of training info to send you on your own way into routine creation?\n\nLast option, I like this kind of info more usually.\n\n- Are you happy with how things are going?\n\nYes, a lot!\n\n- Who's literally the best and why is it /u/mmmr?\n\nI... Hmmm... Next question, please.\n\n- Got any questions yourself?\n\nNope.\n\n- Anything else?\n\nThanks for the routine!\n\nAlso, it's been two weeks that I'm not training because Life got in the way.

What phase did you start on and which one are you on now?\n\nRR for ~2 years, pretty much maxed out (effectively phase3).  Started ~phase4 with a bunch of changes (see below).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; What are your goals?\n\nGeneral:  Keep breathing, don't injure myself, improve HS, HeSPU and straddle press, pike press to HS this year. :-)\n\nWhy I went with move phase4:  I was looking for a split since my session were blowing out past 3hours.  The Strength/Skill split of phase4 appealed to me, since I was doing extra HS work on off days already and it kept the simplicity of a full-body strength workout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Are there bits that you absolutely hate doing?\n\nNope, not doing it to the letter though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Did you change anything, and if so, what?\n\n- Strength portion weighted, hence dips instead of HeSPU.\n- Moved L-sit to skill day.  Figured it was ok, since I had about 20sec max hold already.  Turned out to be a mistake, am about to move it back to Strength.\n- Kept warmup/mobility/stretching to what I was doing before, which was pretty similar.  Have started to do Ido's squat routine, and might take up some of Emmet's shoulder stuff.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Are there parts where the explanation of what to do isn't quite clear?\n\nPretty clear, didn't look at phase 1-3 in detail though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Do you feel the earlier phases have helped you building habits or did you think it was a waste of time and you would have rather started in a later one?\n\nI did the RR before, which kinda covers phase 2-3, so yes on building habits :-).  I might have initially benefited from a slower (mobility only) start, i.e. phase 1, and that's what I would recommend to someone starting out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Are there parts where the exercise demonstrations are subpar? (Yes, but got any better links? Would appreciate it :))\n\nHaven't really looked at most of them.  Just now had a quick look at the stretch/mobility things for phase 4.  Notice that Emmet's videos often don't show his stance, which is important for some of them, no better links unfortunately.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Are there parts that especially helped your progress?\n\nNot too much progress, most beneficial for me was the idea of a skill/strength split.  That really helped in progressing HS while in a major strength-phase.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Are there things that did absolutely nothing for you?\n\nNope.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; How's your handstand?\n\nPretty good.  Progress is pretty slow at my level though.  Besides the strength/skill split I found concentrating on shape-changes was most beneficial over the last couple months.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Exercises you would like to see some programming for? There's still space for a phase 6.\n\nAll of them ;-p.  Trouble is, at this level things *will* diverge for different people.  Maybe something along the lines of cyclic programming, e.g. how to concentrate on something (planche/levers/manna, whatever), while putting other things on maintenance (do the minimum to maintain level of skill).  Not sure if that can be done generically though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; If there is a phase 6, would you prefer a fixed routine or rather a collection of training info to send you on your own way into routine creation?\n\nSee last answer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Are you happy with how things are going?\n\nYeah, pretty much.  Need to get mobility work back on point, but that's a problem with my scheduling, not the routine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Who's literally the best and why is it /u/mmmr?\n\nHah.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Got any questions yourself?\n\n~~Nope.~~  Edit: Phase 4, HS/mobility prescribes 5x hollow-hold after Emmet's shoulder sequence.  What's the reasoning here?  I usually do a single short hold, just to remind myself of the position, 5 sets seems excessiv.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Anything else?\n\nEdit2:  Phase 5, Legs, balance work:  Missing newline, which screws the formatting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael", "edited": 1492245443.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;training tuesday posts for reference:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5xyrx4/training_tuesday_post_your_routine_for_20170307/dem5qhm/\"&gt;move phase4 adaption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/64p408/training_tuesday_post_your_routine_for_20170411/dg4725w/\"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any experience before starting it?

Maybe something along the lines of cyclic programming, e.g. how to concentrate on something (planche/levers/manna, whatever), while putting other things on maintenance (do the minimum to maintain level of skill).
