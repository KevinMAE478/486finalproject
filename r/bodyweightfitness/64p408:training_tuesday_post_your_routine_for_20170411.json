I&amp;#39;ve been involved with parkour since I was 13 and that&amp;#39;s mainly all body weight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the routine. I don&amp;#39;t drive yet so I&amp;#39;m gonna need to do a homework out for the time being. As soon as I can drive I plan on getting a gym membership and going 3 times a week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current routine is \n3 sets 10 reps squats with a 45 lb dumbbell ( biggest I have) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1:00 of Russian twists with a 20 lb dumbbell ( plan on increasing when my core stability is better) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 sets of 8 reps bicep curl at 35 lbs &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 sets of 8 reps hammer curl at 35lbs &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 sets of 8 leg raises &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 sets of 10 push-ups. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finishing out with a minute or two of jumping jacks &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my mind this seems like a good routine but I&amp;#39;m not sure. It seems to give me everything I want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions on what i should add/ subtract? I plan on doing this 3 or 4 times a week. Is that a good time frame? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated. I apologize in advance for the formatting I&amp;#39;m on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "name": "t1_dg48917", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945214.0, "created_utc": 1491916414.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p408", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p408", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4qok4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-RandomPoem-", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lcjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodyweightfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wall of text ahead, a lot of good stuff can be found in the Concept Wednesday threads in the sidebar.
