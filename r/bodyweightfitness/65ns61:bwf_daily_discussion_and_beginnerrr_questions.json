I basically had to deload by 10-15 pounds on all of my lifts to compensate for the increased amount of reps and I was still struggling with finishing each day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I am now at a stage where I&amp;#39;m kind of dissatisfied with gym workouts and have had multiple people recommend body weight workouts to me based on my body shape (Slightly skinny, basically a skinnyfat now.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of what got me into the gym was the simplicity of Stronglifts 5x5 and the app. I could rave for days about the fucking app. But to keep this short, I was wondering if there was a bodyweight workout as simple as StrongLifts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m personally not a fan of workouts with lots of different exercises in them and tend to go for full-body workouts which is why I enjoy routines like Stronglifts, Greyskull LP, and Ivysaur. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I want to know if there&amp;#39;s a bodyweight equivalent of a Stronglifts-styled workout with 5-6 movements. I don&amp;#39;t mind warming up but the number of warmup&amp;#39;s on the recommended routine look daunting and kinda put me off from it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal is aesthetics. I&amp;#39;m M/21 at around 5&amp;#39;9 145 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "name": "t1_dgbrwky", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492352492.0, "created_utc": 1492323692.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ns61", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ns61", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbuh6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cobolock", "parent_id": "t1_dgbryya", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodyweightfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd go with [fabric insulation tape](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insulating-Tape-25-Car-Fabric-Cotton/dp/B0029XY3UE) but that's just because I freaking love insulation tape.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d go with &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insulating-Tape-25-Car-Fabric-Cotton/dp/B0029XY3UE\"&gt;fabric insulation tape&lt;/a&gt; but that&amp;#39;s just because I freaking love insulation tape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "name": "t1_dgbuh6r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492359538.0, "created_utc": 1492330738.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ns61", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tf0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ns61", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc1a4i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "occamsracer", "parent_id": "t1_dgbz4f4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodyweightfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Says 500 lbs.
