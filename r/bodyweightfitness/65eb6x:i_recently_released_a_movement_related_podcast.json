You dip in and out of different movement disciplines and steal their best bits to become a well-rounded mover. Sounds super pretentious, but in practice, it&amp;#39;s quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist movement is as it sounds - specializing in one or two disciplines and not necessarily doing a whole lots else. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily bad or wrong - if you enjoy just doing one thing or you want to be world class at one thing, then by all means go for it. But when you specialize, you could argue that you&amp;#39;re making some degree of sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all you do is lift weights/do bodyweight training/run - there&amp;#39;s likely gonna be certain movement patterns that you&amp;#39;re going to miss out on or ones that will be harder for you to perform, as you&amp;#39;re limiting yourself to specific skills, apparatus and rule sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain disciplines offer a bit more of a wider variety and are closer to a generalist approach - e.g yoga, gymnastics, bodyweight fitness, but they can also have their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our natural environment &amp;amp; everyday life is becoming increasingly &amp;#39;specialist&amp;#39;. We&amp;#39;ve gone from being hunter-gatherers expressing a massive variety of movement patterns (our ancestors would likely run, jump, hang, swing, grapple, throw, swim, crawl, squat errday just to survive), through the agricultural revolution (less movement variety ), the industrial revolution (even less movement variety), and most recently through the technological revolution (where a load of jobs require you to sit for 8 hours a day and just move your fingers). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point being - we&amp;#39;ve already lost a lot of our natural movement capabilities, so by specializing in one or two disciplines, we&amp;#39;re potentially limiting ourselves even further. Then when we want our bodies to do something completely different (whether it&amp;#39;s playing with the grandkids or going surfing), whoops - our bodies have adapted to those few patterns we perform, and that ability to move like we&amp;#39;d like to ain&amp;#39;t there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we adopt a bit more of a generalist approach? (optional man-bun)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start small - like any habit, gradually build more movement into your everyday life. Start to view everything as movement as opposed to it being something you do x number of time a week for x reps or minutes. Movement as a lifestyle, as opposed to a chore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take regular movement breaks in work every 25 minutes or so to walk, stretch - ideally to hang and to get into a deep squat position, two positions that are super neglected in the modern world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add locomotion to your warm up.

Add some mobility work to your morning routine. Being able to get into good positions allows you to move well and express that movement variety.
