The point is that those organizations didn&amp;#39;t support this race that was winnable and instead spent money on an establishment dem in Georgia. Funny how they could work that one out even though they are on break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not gonna mention that we swung the district by over 20 points, or that Thompson&amp;#39;s campaign is still ongoing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, definitely mentioned in the article. Maybe you should read it before critiquing it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know there needs to be some sense of outrage, but how would you have done it if you were the DNC?  Dropped all of your meetings and flown over?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should have 1. Given the campaign funding when they asked for it instead of giving a very much reduced amount the day before. 2. Worked to put organizers on the ground like they are doing with the establishment candidate in Georgia. 3. Demonstrated that they indeed intend to follow a fifty state strategy like they keep asserting instead of abandoning candidates that endorse progressive policies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read the article before you spout nonsense next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dg8dupc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492153624.0, "created_utc": 1492124824.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iaq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iaq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iaq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iaq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iaq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iaq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8lldp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hurricos", "parent_id": "t1_dg8khc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean, ...
