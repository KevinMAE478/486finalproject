But here's another from business insider. Meager wage growth in 2016 doesn't make up for 8 years of wage stagnation while mainstreet was gutted.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/americas-shrinking-middle-class-hurts-economy-2016-6\n\n\"Can you provide a source on the magnitude that wages are being lowered? Nothing I have seen suggests declining wages across the board- in fact, in recent years, wages have started to rise.\"\n\nWages are not rising as fast as productivity or as fast as products. In the chart you cited, it showed real wages aren't as high as as they were in 1999 even though GDP is at a record high. In general, productivity is up, but wages aren't growing to match, so people aren't being paid their fair share. This is mainly a problem because medicine in particular, but also cars, homes, and other products, continue to grow more and more expensive, but wages aren't growing as fast. \n\nhttp://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/\n\nMexicans also hate NAFTA because they lost a lot of farming jobs. Mexico's GDP has increased but its poverty rate is almost unchanged after more than twenty years of NAFTA, all the gains go to the manager class. There are plenty of Mexicans who hate NAFTA. \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-31/outraged-mexicans-to-trump-tear-up-nafta-we-re-sick-of-it-too\n\nAnd mexican workers who hate it:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/workers-may-be-losers-in-mexicos-car-boom/2015/06/17/03da0a96-ee7f-11e4-8050-839e9234b303_story.html?utm_term=.9fbc6814c11c\n\nThis applies to all underdeveloped countries, Haitians hate the Clintons for helping a factory open in their country. They were forced to sell their farms to build the factory, and the factory employs korean managers who live in gated communities and break unions. China, Mexico, all the low wage countries we trade with, are even more unequal than us because the workers don't benefit, only the managers and executives of the country benefit. Their wages rise because they have to to account for the rising cost of living, but they're nominal wage doesn't reflect an actual improvement in the quality of their life, just like our wages grow but our middle class still declines.\n\n\"Secondly, are you against more of the gains going to those who are more in need than those who are already decently well off?\"\n\nI'm against the investor class making record profits while sacrificing the homes and livelihoods of hard working americans. Charity is good, developing the rest of the world is good, but you can't take away someones job and say \"well it means more to people in Mexico.\" It's A.) Not true that the Mexicans are better off, and B.) Immoral for the professional class to ask the working class to sacrifice themselves.\n\n\"Costs have dropped dramatically for many consumer items, what are you talking about? Compare cars or televisions to thirty years ago and you'd be amazed by the drop in price.\"\n\nYou're misinformed. Car prices have gone up ten fold, wages have not increased nearly as quickly. Today's workers can't afford the cars their making. Henry Ford made his cars affordable to his workers back in the 1910's, thats how much we've fallen behind.\n\nhttp://www.thepeoplehistory.com/70yearsofpricechange.html\n\n\"Child labour and forced labour have little to do with the success of China. Their success comes from trade and foreign investment\"\n\nCompanies invested specifically to profit off of child labor and slave labor,and China's economy is slowing because despite China's best efforts, their wages are making further investment less profitable. TPP was about replacing cheap chinese labor with cheap vietnamese and malaysian labor.\n\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/news/are-your-favorite-products-created-by-slave-labor--new-report-indicates-it-s-possible-144633547.html\n\n\"Your graph shows that a small portion of the already fairly well off received very little of the recent years, while the middle class and the top 1% have grown greatly\"\n\nThe world's upper middle class is just the middle class in the developed world, or even the working class. Because of differences in cost of living, there are countries where a dollar an hour is actually a good wage, but in the US you can't survive. That's why poverty is measured as based on the median income of a given country, because money and poverty are relative.\n\n\"I don't think anyone is trying to justify some of the shitty behaviour of companies in 3rd world nations. We should be doing more to fix that! It's not inherently connected to free flow of capital, though.\"\n\nIt is, because governments wind up enacting policies based on foreign demand and the whims of multinational corporations. It's corporate imperialism. The idea that we can enforce fair labor standards with our trade agreements is a fantasy, we can't prevent China from having slave labor because we don't have sovereignty over them. But we could tax their goods to prevent exploitation from being profitable, or even refuse to import from countries with human rights violations all together. We should not have liberal trade agreements with authoritarian states or countries that have abusive labor practices. But ultimately the best way to minimize or prevent exploitative labor practices is with tariffs or trade barriers to prevent companies from profiting off those relationships.\n\n\"Academic, peer reviewed theories are not elitist. \"\n\nThats like the definition of elitist. Intellectualism is itself elitism, even if it is usually our best way of understanding reality. It's still elitist. Yeah peer reviewed theories are important but there are many periods in history where academic theories of the time are wrong. I only need to look at our declining middle class and the gutted midwest, especially my home town of Detroit, to know their theories are wrong. Economics is just mathematical modeling, and models are often wrong. Data models told Clinton not to go to Wisconsin. How'd that turn out? 100 years ago all the academics said the best thing for the economy was for the government to not touch it, laizez faire capitalism.

Nothing I have seen suggests declining wages across the board- in fact, in recent years, wages have started to rise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wages are not rising as fast as productivity or as fast as products. In the chart you cited, it showed real wages aren&amp;#39;t as high as as they were in 1999 even though GDP is at a record high. In general, productivity is up, but wages aren&amp;#39;t growing to match, so people aren&amp;#39;t being paid their fair share. This is mainly a problem because medicine in particular, but also cars, homes, and other products, continue to grow more and more expensive, but wages aren&amp;#39;t growing as fast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/\"&gt;http://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mexicans also hate NAFTA because they lost a lot of farming jobs. Mexico&amp;#39;s GDP has increased but its poverty rate is almost unchanged after more than twenty years of NAFTA, all the gains go to the manager class. There are plenty of Mexicans who hate NAFTA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-31/outraged-mexicans-to-trump-tear-up-nafta-we-re-sick-of-it-too\"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-31/outraged-mexicans-to-trump-tear-up-nafta-we-re-sick-of-it-too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And mexican workers who hate it:\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/workers-may-be-losers-in-mexicos-car-boom/2015/06/17/03da0a96-ee7f-11e4-8050-839e9234b303_story.html?utm_term=.9fbc6814c11c\"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/workers-may-be-losers-in-mexicos-car-boom/2015/06/17/03da0a96-ee7f-11e4-8050-839e9234b303_story.html?utm_term=.9fbc6814c11c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This applies to all underdeveloped countries, Haitians hate the Clintons for helping a factory open in their country. They were forced to sell their farms to build the factory, and the factory employs korean managers who live in gated communities and break unions. China, Mexico, all the low wage countries we trade with, are even more unequal than us because the workers don&amp;#39;t benefit, only the managers and executives of the country benefit. Their wages rise because they have to to account for the rising cost of living, but they&amp;#39;re nominal wage doesn&amp;#39;t reflect an actual improvement in the quality of their life, just like our wages grow but our middle class still declines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Secondly, are you against more of the gains going to those who are more in need than those who are already decently well off?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m against the investor class making record profits while sacrificing the homes and livelihoods of hard working americans. Charity is good, developing the rest of the world is good, but you can&amp;#39;t take away someones job and say &amp;quot;well it means more to people in Mexico.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s A.) Not true that the Mexicans are better off, and B.) Immoral for the professional class to ask the working class to sacrifice themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Costs have dropped dramatically for many consumer items, what are you talking about? Compare cars or televisions to thirty years ago and you&amp;#39;d be amazed by the drop in price.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re misinformed. Car prices have gone up ten fold, wages have not increased nearly as quickly. Today&amp;#39;s workers can&amp;#39;t afford the cars their making. Henry Ford made his cars affordable to his workers back in the 1910&amp;#39;s, thats how much we&amp;#39;ve fallen behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/70yearsofpricechange.html\"&gt;http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/70yearsofpricechange.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Child labour and forced labour have little to do with the success of China. Their success comes from trade and foreign investment&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Companies invested specifically to profit off of child labor and slave labor,and China&amp;#39;s economy is slowing because despite China&amp;#39;s best efforts, their wages are making further investment less profitable.

Because of differences in cost of living, there are countries where a dollar an hour is actually a good wage, but in the US you can&amp;#39;t survive. That&amp;#39;s why poverty is measured as based on the median income of a given country, because money and poverty are relative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone is trying to justify some of the shitty behaviour of companies in 3rd world nations. We should be doing more to fix that! It&amp;#39;s not inherently connected to free flow of capital, though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is, because governments wind up enacting policies based on foreign demand and the whims of multinational corporations. It&amp;#39;s corporate imperialism. The idea that we can enforce fair labor standards with our trade agreements is a fantasy, we can&amp;#39;t prevent China from having slave labor because we don&amp;#39;t have sovereignty over them. But we could tax their goods to prevent exploitation from being profitable, or even refuse to import from countries with human rights violations all together. We should not have liberal trade agreements with authoritarian states or countries that have abusive labor practices. But ultimately the best way to minimize or prevent exploitative labor practices is with tariffs or trade barriers to prevent companies from profiting off those relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Academic, peer reviewed theories are not elitist. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thats like the definition of elitist. Intellectualism is itself elitism, even if it is usually our best way of understanding reality. It&amp;#39;s still elitist. Yeah peer reviewed theories are important but there are many periods in history where academic theories of the time are wrong. I only need to look at our declining middle class and the gutted midwest, especially my home town of Detroit, to know their theories are wrong. Economics is just mathematical modeling, and models are often wrong. Data models told Clinton not to go to Wisconsin. How&amp;#39;d that turn out? 100 years ago all the academics said the best thing for the economy was for the government to not touch it, laizez faire capitalism.

The free flow of capital between nations allows investors to simply flee to whichever country will give them the lowest tax rates, the most subsidies, et cetera.\n\nThe way you counter it is by re-establishing national boundaries with tariffs or other trade barriers. If companies want access to a market, they need to produce in said market and be subject to the laws and wages of that market, or else they need to pay a tax. This would end the global race to the bottom that has allowed a very small number of multinational elites to become very wealthy.\n\nIn my view the EU is now doing more harm than good by undermining national sovereignty and allowing Germany in particular to have an enormous amount of influence on other countries. And by having so many european nations share currency, governments are unable to print money to recover from the recession, and instead had austerity imposed on them by the EU. So I think Melenchon's ideas on the EU are good and would even indirectly benefit us because they would undermine the neoliberal world we are living in.\n\nI also disagree with your assessment that the 1950's was an especially unique period for certain policies. The growing global economy reflects increased production, US manufacturing did not shrink, it simply did not grow as fast as the rest of the world. (Although it actually did shrink once we started allowing companies to outsource jobs starting in the late 70's.) We can't exactly have trade surpluses like we did in the 50's, but there's no reason we can't have a relatively balanced trade, instead of allowing companies to produce in foreign countries before selling to the US. Our trade deficit is nearly 800 bilion dollars, thats the same as the entire stimulus package and more than our GDP grows in a given year. That's 800 billion dollars of goods and services that could be produced in the US. That's a lot of jobs, EPI estimates balancing our trade deficit would create nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs directly. And of course, regarding infrastructure, the fact that our infrastructure declined as we cut taxes for the wealthy sort of proves we need to raise taxes. This fear that we need the wealthy more than they need us is wrong, companies have bent over backwards to accomodate China's incredibly closed market, and we have a much larger consumer market. (Our people make more money so we can buy more consumer goods even though the GDP's of our countries are roughly equivalent.) Companies will always try to make profits, the fear that they will suddenly be happier with no profit versus a smaller profit if you raise taxes is enormously overblown.\n\nBut you are right to point out the effective tax rate was substantially lower because there were more loopholes. I don't know the optimal tax rate, its harder to figure out because of loopholes. I don't agree that a maximum income is inherently a bad idea, but I think it would have to be substantially higher than Melenchon, who wants one around 400k. That would actually limit the number of investors. But I wouldn't be against it at 100 million dollars or more.\n\nBut I'm not sure it would cripple france as much as you think. The wealthy would probably just leave if they could, but companies would still want to sell goods in france and would still want to invest in france if there's money to be made. They just wouldn't want to live there.\n", "edited": 1492205329.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;it would likely cripple France economically because of the globalist world we live in today&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This globalist world is, in my opinion, the fundamental problem. The free flow of capital between nations allows investors to simply flee to whichever country will give them the lowest tax rates, the most subsidies, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way you counter it is by re-establishing national boundaries with tariffs or other trade barriers. If companies want access to a market, they need to produce in said market and be subject to the laws and wages of that market, or else they need to pay a tax. This would end the global race to the bottom that has allowed a very small number of multinational elites to become very wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my view the EU is now doing more harm than good by undermining national sovereignty and allowing Germany in particular to have an enormous amount of influence on other countries. And by having so many european nations share currency, governments are unable to print money to recover from the recession, and instead had austerity imposed on them by the EU. So I think Melenchon&amp;#39;s ideas on the EU are good and would even indirectly benefit us because they would undermine the neoliberal world we are living in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also disagree with your assessment that the 1950&amp;#39;s was an especially unique period for certain policies. The growing global economy reflects increased production, US manufacturing did not shrink, it simply did not grow as fast as the rest of the world.

While attending the University of Chicago, Sanders was a member of the Young People's Socialist League, and he discusses his reasons for joining it, in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8-q0W78jYY). Sanders began his political career as a member of a socialist party in Vermont called the [Liberty Union Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Union_Party). Here is their [platform](http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=5). In 1979, Sanders put out a [short documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82pFvUq3o8) about American Socialist, Eugene Debs. [This image](https://i.redd.it/cq6xmzc8ip3y.jpg) depicts Sander's speaking at a 1983 meeting of the Socialist Party USA, and [this WNYC piece](https://www.wnyc.org/story/speech-1983-sanders-rails-against-establishment/) gives some context to his what he says and features clips from the speech itself. \n\nIn [this speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXtGK9sQUvM) from 1985, Sanders talks about worker alienation, the need of people to see themselves in their work, and the necessity of worker ownership. In [this 1985 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14lsC4WLV0), Sanders can be seen defending the gains of the Cuban Revolution. And [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvZRsdHgxgA) is a video of Sanders introducing Noam Chomsky at Burlington city hall, where Chomsky gives a speech about US foreign policy. Sanders discusses his opposition to US foreign policy in Latin America, in particular. Sanders even sent a letter to Ronald Reagan expressing his opposition to US support of the Contras in Nicuragua, around the same time. [This video includes Sanders, on a panel of others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OczMDr8iWx4), discussing observations about the Soviet Union after a trip there, in 1988.\n\nIn 2007, Bernie Sanders [advocated Worker Ownership in the US Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dKK2ya_JVc). [Here is a speech  that Sanders gave in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDSMaCzjEhs), that is quite similar the speech he gave in 1985. Sanders advocated for worker cooperatives in [point 3 his 12 point economic plan](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/an-economic-agenda-for-am_b_6249022.html) that he published during his Primary run. He doubled down on his views on Cuba, and the rest of latin america [on Democracy Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkat7UYPJWA) very recently. He even [denied his status as a Capitalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCKNtQXGbE) on CNN. Furthermore, Sanders also discusses worker co-ops and other examples of collective ownership on pages 243 and 259-262 of his book *Our Revolution* (Thomas Dune Books 2016). \n\nSpeaking of *Our Revolution*, let's look at some quotes from the book:\n\n&gt;What I learned playing on the streets and playgrounds of Brooklyn was not just how to become a decent ball player and athlete. **I learned a profound lesson about democracy and self rule.**\n\n(*Our Revolution*.  pg 11)\n\n&gt;O'Malley's [Owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers] devastating decision to rip the Dodgers out of Brooklyn in order to pursue greater profits on the West Coast was, I suspect, **one of my first observations regarding the deficiencies of Capitalism.**\n \n(*Our Revolution*.  pg 13)\n\n&gt;It wasn't just that racism, war, poverty, and other social evils must be opposed. It was that there was a cause and effect dynamic and an interconnectedness between all aspects of society. Things didn't just happen by accident. **There was a relationship between  wealth, power, and the perpetuation of Capitalism.**\n\n(*Our Revolution*.  pg 18)\n\n&gt;In Israel, we spent time working on several kibbutzim [collectively own and run Israeli communities]...People there were living their democratic values. **The kibbutz was owned by the people who lived there, the \"bosses\" were elected by the workers, and the overall decisions for the community were made democratically.**\n\n (*Our Revolution*.  pg 21-22)\n\n&gt;**This type of greed, and ruthless Capitalism is not an economic model we should be embracing. We can do Better; we must do better.** The economic establishment tells us that there is no alternative to this type of rapacious, cutthroat, Capitalism, that this is how the system and globalization works, and that there's no turning back. They're dead wrong.\n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 260)\n\n&gt;Employee owned enterprises boost morale, because workers share in profits, and have more control over their own work lives. **The employees are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else.** They have a say in how the company is run.\n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 261)\n\n&gt;The Workers in these operations understand that when employees own their workplaces, **when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the decision-making that impacts their jobs**, they are no longer just punching a time clock. They become more motivated, absenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up. \n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 261)\n\n&gt;We have got to send a message to the billionaire class: \"You can't have it all.\" You can't get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. You can't continue getting tax breaks by shipping American jobs to China. You can't hide your profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, **while there are massive unmet needs in every corner of this nation. Your greed has got to end.**\n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 266)\n\nBernie's brand of Socialism doesn't differentiate between reform and revolution, and he sees Nordic Social Democracy as a model for short term change. When put into context, Bernie more resembles someone like [Richard Wolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Wolff), than merely a lukewarm Social Democrat.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although from what I have read, Melenchon is more of a true Democratic Socialist where as bernie is a social democrat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bernie is a true Democratic Socialist, even if his primary campaign was only Social Democratic.

Sanders even sent a letter to Ronald Reagan expressing his opposition to US support of the Contras in Nicuragua, around the same time. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OczMDr8iWx4\"&gt;This video includes Sanders, on a panel of others&lt;/a&gt;, discussing observations about the Soviet Union after a trip there, in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Bernie Sanders &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dKK2ya_JVc\"&gt;advocated Worker Ownership in the US Congress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDSMaCzjEhs\"&gt;Here is a speech  that Sanders gave in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, that is quite similar the speech he gave in 1985. Sanders advocated for worker cooperatives in &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/an-economic-agenda-for-am_b_6249022.html\"&gt;point 3 his 12 point economic plan&lt;/a&gt; that he published during his Primary run. He doubled down on his views on Cuba, and the rest of latin america &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkat7UYPJWA\"&gt;on Democracy Now&lt;/a&gt; very recently. He even &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCKNtQXGbE\"&gt;denied his status as a Capitalist&lt;/a&gt; on CNN. Furthermore, Sanders also discusses worker co-ops and other examples of collective ownership on pages 243 and 259-262 of his book &lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt; (Thomas Dune Books 2016). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, let&amp;#39;s look at some quotes from the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I learned playing on the streets and playgrounds of Brooklyn was not just how to become a decent ball player and athlete. &lt;strong&gt;I learned a profound lesson about democracy and self rule.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt;.  pg 11)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;O&amp;#39;Malley&amp;#39;s [Owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers] devastating decision to rip the Dodgers out of Brooklyn in order to pursue greater profits on the West Coast was, I suspect, &lt;strong&gt;one of my first observations regarding the deficiencies of Capitalism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt;.  pg 13)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t just that racism, war, poverty, and other social evils must be opposed. It was that there was a cause and effect dynamic and an interconnectedness between all aspects of society. Things didn&amp;#39;t just happen by accident. &lt;strong&gt;There was a relationship between  wealth, power, and the perpetuation of Capitalism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt;.  pg 18)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Israel, we spent time working on several kibbutzim [collectively own and run Israeli communities]...People there were living their democratic values. &lt;strong&gt;The kibbutz was owned by the people who lived there, the &amp;quot;bosses&amp;quot; were elected by the workers, and the overall decisions for the community were made democratically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt;.  pg 21-22)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This type of greed, and ruthless Capitalism is not an economic model we should be embracing. We can do Better; we must do better.&lt;/strong&gt; The economic establishment tells us that there is no alternative to this type of rapacious, cutthroat, Capitalism, that this is how the system and globalization works, and that there&amp;#39;s no turning back. They&amp;#39;re dead wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt; pg 260)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employee owned enterprises boost morale, because workers share in profits, and have more control over their own work lives. &lt;strong&gt;The employees are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else.&lt;/strong&gt; They have a say in how the company is run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt; pg 261)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Workers in these operations understand that when employees own their workplaces, &lt;strong&gt;when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the decision-making that impacts their jobs&lt;/strong&gt;, they are no longer just punching a time clock. They become more motivated, absenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt; pg 261)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have got to send a message to the billionaire class: &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t have it all.&amp;quot; You can&amp;#39;t get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. You can&amp;#39;t continue getting tax breaks by shipping American jobs to China. You can&amp;#39;t hide your profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, &lt;strong&gt;while there are massive unmet needs in every corner of this nation. Your greed has got to end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/em&gt; pg 266)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bernie&amp;#39;s brand of Socialism doesn&amp;#39;t differentiate between reform and revolution, and he sees Nordic Social Democracy as a model for short term change. When put into context, Bernie more resembles someone like &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Wolff\"&gt;Richard Wolff&lt;/a&gt;, than merely a lukewarm Social Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dg9eodc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492217928.0, "created_utc": 1492189128.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b8v2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9crnc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg9c55s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dg9crnc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215784.0, "created_utc": 1492186984.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9c55s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rushmid", "parent_id": "t1_dg96zfa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Although from what I have read, Melenchon is more of a true Democratic Socialist where as bernie is a social democrat.\n\nDifference being - DemSoc wants to move towards a socialist society through democratic reforms i.e. Passing Laws.\n\nSocDem like bernie (at least his public position) is basically just a left of center liberal.
