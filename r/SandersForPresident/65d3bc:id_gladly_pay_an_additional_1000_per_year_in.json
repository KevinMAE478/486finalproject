This allows you to drastically lower operating costs, radically eliminate the epidemic of obesity (especially poverty-obesity) and related diseases, and avoid that half of all Medicare spending that occurs in the last year of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dga7wfy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492255601.0, "created_utc": 1492226801.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3bc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9byfo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blues65", "parent_id": "t3_65d3bc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As someone who already gets free Cadillac plan healthcare from my employer with no deductible, I would too!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who already gets free Cadillac plan healthcare from my employer with no deductible, I would too!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dg9byfo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492214904.0, "created_utc": 1492186104.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3bc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9otxs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "laxboy119", "parent_id": "t3_65d3bc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Whenever someone says I won't pay for someone else's healthcare.\n\nAsk them \"do you have health insurance\" \n\nIf yes \"you already pay for other people's healthcare, AND that Jacuzzi the millionaires wife just bought\"\n\nIf no, \"do you want insurance\"\n\nIf yes, \"so you really are ok paying for others care\"\n\nIf no,  can't help you there, this person is a moron ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone says I won&amp;#39;t pay for someone else&amp;#39;s healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask them &amp;quot;do you have health insurance&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If yes &amp;quot;you already pay for other people&amp;#39;s healthcare, AND that Jacuzzi the millionaires wife just bought&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If no, &amp;quot;do you want insurance&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If yes, &amp;quot;so you really are ok paying for others care&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If no,  can&amp;#39;t help you there, this person is a moron &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dg9otxs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229976.0, "created_utc": 1492201176.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3bc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9pp9s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "electrodude102", "parent_id": "t3_65d3bc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd gladly pay into a system that helps the sick rather than one that pays a ceos salary", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d gladly pay into a system that helps the sick rather than one that pays a ceos salary&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dg9pp9s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231026.0, "created_utc": 1492202226.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3bc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9v97r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "grahag", "parent_id": "t3_65d3bc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're not alone.
