Where is the line drawn?\n\n[As this video explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknoQYrgq60), Private property is distinct from personal property. Private property is that which you use to make money off of, a factory, delivery trucks, storefronts, etc. Personal property, which Socialists don't really care about, include things like your house, car, pants, computer, and toothbrush. When Socialists say they want to abolish private property, they mean they want to abolish the private ownership of the means of production. \n\n&gt;The problem with the system is it is not presented with any association that allows the general public to decide where the line is drawn.\n\n&gt;In a communist state, will there be trains? To benefit efficiency, will those trains sometimes be overallocated by whichever system controls the management of those trains? Will said system ever result in people being removed from trains?\nAre you gonna try to act like some system will ever decide this without the use of democracy? Are you acting like our system will ever fix this without some expression of democracy?\nNo system works without nuance and deliberation.\n\nI don't know what all of this train business is about, but yes, in a communist society, there would be trains.

Private property must, therefore, be abolished and in its place must come the common utilization of all instruments of production and the distribution of all products according to common agreement \u2013 in a word, what is called the communal ownership of goods.**\n\n&gt;**In fact, the abolition of private property is, doubtless, the shortest and most significant way to characterize the revolution in the whole social order which has been made necessary by the development of industry \u2013 and for this reason it is rightly advanced by communists as their main demand.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is unnuanced and wrong\n.\nI own a pair of pants.

Many contemporary Socialists would argue that the enforcement of private property rights is inherently violent, Pierre Joseph Proudohn, the first Anarchist famously said that 'Property is theft', and Jean Jacques Rousseau in his *Discourse on Inequality* asserted that private property is the source of inequality.\n\n&gt;What form of government and economy would not require the existence of police?  I can't image human society of more than a few dozen people where property doesn't exist.\n\nIn a an anarcho-syndicalist society, for example, there wouldn't usually be a hierarchically organized nation state, but rather a horizontally organized system of free associations. Enforcement of personal property rights, would fall under a differently organized law enforcement system, that wouldn't necessarily look like contemporary law enforcement. \n\n&gt; I  happen to believe the way we look at property and divide it up needs a major overhaul, but some form of enforcement to protect you and your stuff will probably always be needed. \n\nHow are you defining private property, though? You can't even begin to pose a solution to the problem until you define what it is you're trying to solve. \n\n&gt;I don't think what happened says anything significant about the balance of power in our society like this article is claiming. \n\nAnd why is that? The Police exist to defend the interests of private, capitalist corporations.

Many contemporary Socialists would argue that the enforcement of private property rights is inherently violent, Pierre Joseph Proudohn, the first Anarchist famously said that &amp;#39;Property is theft&amp;#39;, and Jean Jacques Rousseau in his &lt;em&gt;Discourse on Inequality&lt;/em&gt; asserted that private property is the source of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What form of government and economy would not require the existence of police?

Enforcement of personal property rights, would fall under a differently organized law enforcement system, that wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily look like contemporary law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I  happen to believe the way we look at property and divide it up needs a major overhaul, but some form of enforcement to protect you and your stuff will probably always be needed. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are you defining private property, though?

Social Democracy is Capitalism, and it's basically a fancy word for a Welfare State.\n\nDemocratic Socialism, on the other hand, is a kind of Socialism. Socialism being the collective ownership and democratic operation of the means of production and distribution, and their operation for needs first. This is in contrast to Capitalism, which is the private ownership of those means, for Profit first. \n\nDemocratic Socialism is less a specific tendency of Socialism, like Leninism or Anarcho-Communism, and more of a reaction to the tendency of 20th century communist states, like the USSR, to devolve into large, undemocratic bureaucracies. Wikipedia, of all things, defines the term quite well:\n\n* **Democratic socialism is a political ideology that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production, often with an emphasis on democratic management of enterprises within a socialist economic system. The term \"democratic socialism\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"socialism\"; the adjective \"democratic\" is often added to distinguish it from the Marxist\u2013Leninist brand of socialism, which is widely viewed as being non-democratic in practice. Democratic socialism is also sometimes used as a synonym for social democracy, although many say this is misleading because democratic socialism advocates social ownership of the means of production, whereas social democracy does not.**\n\nNow, is Bernie a Socialist, like he says he is?\n\nWell, his primary campaign certainly wasn't. It was primarily Social Democratic in nature. Bernie himself, however, is a Socialist.\n\nWhile attending the University of Chicago, Sanders was a member of the Young People's Socialist League, and he discusses his reasons for joining it, in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8-q0W78jYY). Sanders began his political career as a member of a socialist party in Vermont called the [Liberty Union Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Union_Party). Here is their [platform](http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=5). In 1979, Sanders put out a [short documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82pFvUq3o8) about American Socialist, Eugene Debs. [This image](https://i.redd.it/cq6xmzc8ip3y.jpg) depicts Sander's speaking at a 1983 meeting of the Socialist Party USA, and [this WNYC piece](https://www.wnyc.org/story/speech-1983-sanders-rails-against-establishment/) gives some context to his what he says and features clips from the speech itself. \n\nIn [this speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXtGK9sQUvM) from 1985, Sanders talks about worker alienation, the need of people to see themselves in their work, and the necessity of worker ownership. In [this 1985 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14lsC4WLV0), Sanders can be seen defending the gains of the Cuban Revolution. And [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvZRsdHgxgA) is a video of Sanders introducing Noam Chomsky, at Burlington City Hall, in which chomsky gives a speech about US foreign policy. Sanders discusses his opposition to US foreign policy in Latin America, in particular. Sanders even sent a letter to Ronald Reagan expressing his opposition to US support of the Contras in Nicaragua, around the same time. [This video includes Sanders, on a panel of others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OczMDr8iWx4), discussing observations about the Soviet Union after a trip there, in 1988.\n\nIn 2007, Bernie Sanders [advocated Worker Ownership in the US Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dKK2ya_JVc). [Here is a speech  that Sanders gave in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDSMaCzjEhs), that is quite similar the speech he gave in 1985. Sanders advocated for worker cooperatives in [point 3 his 12 point economic plan](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/an-economic-agenda-for-am_b_6249022.html) that he published during his Primary run. He doubled down on his views on Cuba, and the rest of latin america [on Democracy Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkat7UYPJWA) very recently. He even [denied his status as a Capitalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCKNtQXGbE) on CNN. Furthermore, Sanders also discusses worker co-ops and other examples of collective ownership on pages 243 and 259-262 of his book *Our Revolution* (Thomas Dune Books 2016). \n\nSpeaking of *Our Revolution*, let's look at some quotes from the book:\n\n&gt;What I learned playing on the streets and playgrounds of Brooklyn was not just how to become a decent ball player and athlete. **I learned a profound lesson about democracy and self rule.**\n\n(*Our Revolution*.  pg 11)\n\n&gt;O'Malley's [Owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers] devastating decision to rip the Dodgers out of Brooklyn in order to pursue greater profits on the West Coast was, I suspect, **one of my first observations regarding the deficiencies of Capitalism.**\n \n(*Our Revolution*.  pg 13)\n\n&gt;It wasn't just that racism, war, poverty, and other social evils must be opposed. It was that there was a cause and effect dynamic and an interconnectedness between all aspects of society. Things didn't just happen by accident. **There was a relationship between  wealth, power, and the perpetuation of Capitalism.**\n\n(*Our Revolution*.  pg 18)\n\n&gt;In Israel, we spent time working on several kibbutzim [collectively own and run Israeli communities]...People there were living their democratic values. **The kibbutz was owned by the people who lived there, the \"bosses\" were elected by the workers, and the overall decisions for the community were made democratically.**\n\n (*Our Revolution*.  pg 21-22)\n\n&gt;**This type of greed, and ruthless Capitalism is not an economic model we should be embracing. We can do Better; we must do better.** The economic establishment tells us that there is no alternative to this type of rapacious, cutthroat, Capitalism, that this is how the system and globalization works, and that there's no turning back. They're dead wrong.\n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 260)\n\n&gt;Employee owned enterprises boost morale, because workers share in profits, and have more control over their own work lives. **The employees are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else.** They have a say in how the company is run.\n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 261)\n\n&gt;The Workers in these operations understand that when employees own their workplaces, **when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the decision-making that impacts their jobs**, they are no longer just punching a time clock. They become more motivated, absenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up. \n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 261)\n\n&gt;We have got to send a message to the billionaire class: \"You can't have it all.\" You can't get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. You can't continue getting tax breaks by shipping American jobs to China. You can't hide your profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, **while there are massive unmet needs in every corner of this nation. Your greed has got to end.**\n\n(*Our Revolution* pg 266)\n\nBernie's brand of Socialism doesn't differentiate between reform and revolution, and he sees Nordic Social Democracy as a model for short term change. When put into context, Bernie resembles someone like Richard Wolff, than merely a lukewarm Social Democrat.\n\n---\n\n&gt;Second they did not have to hurt that poor guy to get him out, they could have offered more money to the other passengers which I would think would have been the more capitalist thing to do.\n\nThe article discusses counters this argument in the first section, entitled \"Offer to Pay the Man More.\"\n\n&gt; In fact forcing someone to do something against their will seems more in line with the mentality of a communist planned economy.\n\nCommunism, and Socialism as a whole, are not inherently planned, nor are they inherently coercive. In fact, I'd say it's Capitalism that is inherently forceful and coercive. The vast majority of people have one of two choices under Capitalism. Work or starve. During the Labor movement, it was argued that wage labor was different from chattel slavery, only in that it was temporary. Being forced to work under the barrel of a gun, and being forced to work under the threat of starvation are little different. The latter is just slower. \n\n&gt; We might need fear to keep our current unbalanced system of crony capitalism running but that is not real capitalism, such as is practiced in Scandinavia where they don't even need a minimum wage because they have things like effective labor unions.\n\nThe consolidation of power and resources is a natural consequence of Capitalism. It is real Capitalism. And while regulating Capitalism is a good start, it's not sustainable change, as it can easily be dismantled. We already tried that route and it failed. Look at the New Deal. It was almost immediately torn apart.
