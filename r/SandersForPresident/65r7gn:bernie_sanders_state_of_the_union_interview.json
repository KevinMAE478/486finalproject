It is a very complicated and difficult issue. You have a regime which in North Korea is isolated, which has put incredible resources into a nuclear and missile program while millions of its people over the years have starved to death. The key point here is that the United States must not act impulsively, and we must not act unilaterally. The key I think to this situation (and I think President Trump understands this) is dealing with China. China now receives about 80% of the imports of North Korea. They are virtually the only ally that North Korea has. And what China has got to understand is that they have got to put incredible pressure, work with the entire Asian community, in telling North Korea that they have to cease their efforts in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles  and more nuclear weapons. I think China has the capability of doing that. So a partnership with China and other countries in that region is what we've got to focus on.  \n\n&gt;[On the topic of potential Chinese sanctions on North Korea]  \n&gt;I think this policy shift on the part of China has been taking place for quite a while now. As I understand it, for example, China did not have a representative at the military parade in North Korea the other day. That says something. Just the other day the plane trips between Beijing and North Korea were suspended. Not to mention that China is now cutting back on the importation of coal from North Korea which is their major source of foreign currency. But China has got to do a lot more, a lot more. They have got to be working with the United States, with Japan, with South Korea to make it very clear to North Korea that these policies cannot continue or else there will be significant sanctions destroying that economy.  \n\n&gt;[On the topic of the Syrian war]  \n&gt;Here is the point. Jake when we talk about national disasters what is happening in Syria is almost beyond belief. You have a dictator there who appears prepared to destroy his entire country in order to hold onto his power and his wealth. 400,000 Syrians are dead, 10 million people displaced, they have detainment camps, massive torture, they bomb hospitals. This is a horrific regime. What our job there, again, is to not act unilaterally. In this case we have got to demand Russia, and Iran stop their efforts in supporting this horrific dictator. Assad has got to go, ISIS has got to be defeated, but I do not want to see the United States get sucked into perpetual warfare in the Middle East, see our men and women be killed, trillions of dollars have been spent. We've been in Afghanistan now for over 15 years. We've been in Iraq for a very long time. I don't want to see us dragged into another war in Syria when kids in this country cannot afford to go to college, when our infrastructure is collapsing, when 28 million Americans have no health insurance. We have got to start paying attention to our needs back home. Work with allies in the region. The war in Iraq was the worst blunder in the modern history of this country, precipitated mass instability. we cannot continue to make those mistakes. Countries around the world have got to work with us to address those crises... It's not a question of one strike or one big bomb in Afghanistan. What you need is a strategy. And that strategy has got to demand that Russia, that supplies an enormous amount of weaponry to Assad, stop what it is doing. This will require intensive negotiations to tell Russia that they cannot support a dictator who is destroying his entire country. One strike is not going to do very much in that process.   \n\n&gt;[On the topic of the Tax March]   \n&gt;I think the American people need to understand what kind of involvement Trumps business dealing have abroad, and what kind of leverage those dealings may have on his policies as President of the United States. They want a President whose going to represent the American people not his own business interests which extend all over the world...   \nTomorrow afternoon Tom Perez, whose chair of the Democratic party and I, will be taking a nine state tour all across this country to do what I think is absolutely necessary. And that is to help revitalize American democracy. So many of our people are giving up on the political process and that is very frightening. In the last Presidential election, where Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years. And in the previous two years before that, in the midterm election, we had the lowest voter turnout in 70 years. And I think what's happening is that the middle class shrinks as people perceive that the media and congress is not hearing their pain about a declining standard of living, about income inequality, not being able to afford to send their kids to college, they're giving up on the political process. And we cannot allow that to happen. So Tom and I will be going all over this country, we're going to be fighting to see that the Democratic party becomes a 50 state party. You can't just be a West Coast party and an East Coast party. And we need a bottom up party, a grassroots party which is prepared to stand up to the big money interests which have so much influence over the political and economic development of our country.   \n\n&gt;[On the topic of the DNC not sending enough resources to Kansas]   \n&gt;Let's be clear, the point here is that I think all over grassroots America, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans people are perceiving that Trump did not tell the truth in his campaign in terms of what he would do as President of the United States. He was going to drain the swamp. Well he has in fact appointed more billionaires to his cabinet than any President in history, etc. etc. So what I think has happened now, in Kansas, it is true that the Democratic candidate lost, it is true that the Democratic party should have put more resources into that election, but it is also true that he ran 20 points better than the Democratic candidate for President did in Kansas. So what you're seeing in Kansas, what you're seeing in Georgia, I believe you're going to see it in Montana, I believe that you are going to see it all over this country, is that many so called 'red states', working people are going to wake up and say 'Wait a second. Republicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicade, &amp; education, and they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1%. No that's not what we elected Trump to do. Yeah, climate change is real, it's not a hoax, we have got to move to sustainable energy.' I think all over this country, in red states and in blues states, people are beginning to stand up, they are beginning to fight back, they're demanding a government that does not just represent the billionaires but represents the working class of this country.  \n\n&gt;[On the topic on the removal of a passenger from a United flight by CDA officers]  \n&gt;I think anybody who flies a lot, and as a United States Senator, knows how dysfunctional, in many respects, the airlines are. They know that there are many many delays, that are caused not because of weather but because of inappropriate practices on the part of the airlines. This overbooking (which caused this particular problem) is not unique. I've been on airlines many many times where people have been asked to leave. And I think what we do need is to take a hard look at the airlines in this country and make them much more responsive to the consumers than they currently are. In terms of pricing, you could have two people on an airline, one paid twice as much as another person. So the idea of taking a hard look at airline travel, and by the way, the consolidation of ownership in the airline industry is something that I think would be a very useful effort.   \n\n-[Bernie Sanders April 16th 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPzssE8FRHo)\n\n \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[On the topic of tensions with North Korea.]&lt;br/&gt;\nThe important point is how we go forward.

Countries around the world have got to work with us to address those crises... It&amp;#39;s not a question of one strike or one big bomb in Afghanistan. What you need is a strategy. And that strategy has got to demand that Russia, that supplies an enormous amount of weaponry to Assad, stop what it is doing. This will require intensive negotiations to tell Russia that they cannot support a dictator who is destroying his entire country. One strike is not going to do very much in that process.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[On the topic of the Tax March]&lt;br/&gt;\nI think the American people need to understand what kind of involvement Trumps business dealing have abroad, and what kind of leverage those dealings may have on his policies as President of the United States. They want a President whose going to represent the American people not his own business interests which extend all over the world...&lt;br/&gt;\nTomorrow afternoon Tom Perez, whose chair of the Democratic party and I, will be taking a nine state tour all across this country to do what I think is absolutely necessary. And that is to help revitalize American democracy. So many of our people are giving up on the political process and that is very frightening. In the last Presidential election, where Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years. And in the previous two years before that, in the midterm election, we had the lowest voter turnout in 70 years. And I think what&amp;#39;s happening is that the middle class shrinks as people perceive that the media and congress is not hearing their pain about a declining standard of living, about income inequality, not being able to afford to send their kids to college, they&amp;#39;re giving up on the political process. And we cannot allow that to happen. So Tom and I will be going all over this country, we&amp;#39;re going to be fighting to see that the Democratic party becomes a 50 state party. You can&amp;#39;t just be a West Coast party and an East Coast party. And we need a bottom up party, a grassroots party which is prepared to stand up to the big money interests which have so much influence over the political and economic development of our country.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[On the topic of the DNC not sending enough resources to Kansas]&lt;br/&gt;\nLet&amp;#39;s be clear, the point here is that I think all over grassroots America, whether they&amp;#39;re Democrats, independents, or Republicans people are perceiving that Trump did not tell the truth in his campaign in terms of what he would do as President of the United States. He was going to drain the swamp. Well he has in fact appointed more billionaires to his cabinet than any President in history, etc. etc. So what I think has happened now, in Kansas, it is true that the Democratic candidate lost, it is true that the Democratic party should have put more resources into that election, but it is also true that he ran 20 points better than the Democratic candidate for President did in Kansas. So what you&amp;#39;re seeing in Kansas, what you&amp;#39;re seeing in Georgia, I believe you&amp;#39;re going to see it in Montana, I believe that you are going to see it all over this country, is that many so called &amp;#39;red states&amp;#39;, working people are going to wake up and say &amp;#39;Wait a second. Republicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicade, &amp;amp; education, and they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1%. No that&amp;#39;s not what we elected Trump to do. Yeah, climate change is real, it&amp;#39;s not a hoax, we have got to move to sustainable energy.&amp;#39; I think all over this country, in red states and in blues states, people are beginning to stand up, they are beginning to fight back, they&amp;#39;re demanding a government that does not just represent the billionaires but represents the working class of this country.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[On the topic on the removal of a passenger from a United flight by CDA officers]&lt;br/&gt;\nI think anybody who flies a lot, and as a United States Senator, knows how dysfunctional, in many respects, the airlines are. They know that there are many many delays, that are caused not because of weather but because of inappropriate practices on the part of the airlines. This overbooking (which caused this particular problem) is not unique. I&amp;#39;ve been on airlines many many times where people have been asked to leave. And I think what we do need is to take a hard look at the airlines in this country and make them much more responsive to the consumers than they currently are. In terms of pricing, you could have two people on an airline, one paid twice as much as another person. So the idea of taking a hard look at airline travel, and by the way, the consolidation of ownership in the airline industry is something that I think would be a very useful effort.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPzssE8FRHo\"&gt;Bernie Sanders April 16th 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dgciwok", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492403178.0, "created_utc": 1492374378.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r7gn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r7gn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r7gn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd4ja4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "magikowl", "parent_id": "t1_dgd4efx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks Chartis!
