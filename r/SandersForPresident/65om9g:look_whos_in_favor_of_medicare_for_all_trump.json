If you looked at T_D while it was being voted on, you&amp;#39;ll see people pointing out the issues in it and a vast majority of the subreddit did not want it. For another example, look at Syria. We were really torn when Trump bombed the airfield. We were terrified he was going to go in to Syria with ground forces and completely let us down. Fortunately, it turned out not to be the case, but we were definitely not behind him there if he decided to take that extra step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we love Trump, its not necessarily for the reasons you all might expect. We love him because he&amp;#39;s a slap in the face to political correctness and cultural marxism. We love him because he took the insults we face all the time and shrugged them off, whereas they could potentially ruin our lives. We love his plans on smarter immigration, a freer market, and returning power to the states. We are not a monolith though, and you&amp;#39;ll find everyone from Bernie bros to traditional conservatives to alt-righters in our midst. I used to be behind Bernie myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, we need alternatives. Trump, as far as we can tell, is the best option we&amp;#39;ve got right now. We don&amp;#39;t like most Republicans or Democrats. If you can show us a third way, we might well take it. But first you need to show us Trump is wrong, and so far we are pretty satisfied with his performance. I think in a year or so, once we&amp;#39;ve really gotten a feel for what &amp;quot;President Trump&amp;quot; means, we&amp;#39;ll be able to make a serious decision. At the moment however, you&amp;#39;re trying to derail a train that just really left the station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really agree with you when you say we are two sides of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dgcg82b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492399713.0, "created_utc": 1492370913.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65om9g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zbq7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65om9g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcldty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stir_friday", "parent_id": "t1_dgccp91", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "May I offer a suggestion?\n\nI won't link to it because I don't want to get flagged down by some autobot rolling out to crush dissent, but I posted something in \"/r/ The Voldemort.\" It's in my submission history if you would like to check it out.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;May I offer a suggestion?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t link to it because I don&amp;#39;t want to get flagged down by some autobot rolling out to crush dissent, but I posted something in &amp;quot;/r/ The Voldemort.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s in my submission history if you would like to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dgcldty", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492406406.0, "created_utc": 1492377606.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgccp91", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TastyBrainMeats", "parent_id": "t1_dgcbqem", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wish that I knew.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish that I knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "name": "t1_dgccp91", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395004.0, "created_utc": 1492366204.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcbqem", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stir_friday", "parent_id": "t1_dgcbolg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SandersForPresident", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How would they go about doing that?\n\nI ask because it sounds like we want them to have some sort of divine inspiration.
