Basically in the US&amp;#39;s history third parties have always failed EXCEPT when a popular politician feels the two major parties are broken and starts a new party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the reason I say Bernie is less right is because he is actually in a position to start a third party with a potential for success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that though, with a disenfranchisement rate of about 50% and a majority of the country being independents, I think if ever a time for a third party was possible it would be now. If they pick up like 15-20% of the vote from people not voting hitting some critical mass, the possibility of migrating from dems to progressives isn&amp;#39;t inconceivable. Highly unlikely... yes.
