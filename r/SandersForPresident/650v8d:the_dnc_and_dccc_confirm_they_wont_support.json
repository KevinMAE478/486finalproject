But let's compare that to a well-known Democratic leader like Joe Biden:\n\n**Based on party:** Joe has a 86% favorable rating among Democrats, and a 9% unfavorable.\n\n**Based on ideology:** 85% favorable among the very liberal (8% unfavorable), 89% favorable among the somewhat liberal (11% unfavorable), and 59% favorable among moderates* (29% unfavorable).\n\nThe only thing that's significantly different is Biden's favorable rating among the somewhat liberal. Everything else is pretty much identical. You could make the argument that Joe's been in the public eye for longer, so those numbers are more stable and unlikely to shift, while Bernie's are likely to change as folks get to know him and his policies (whether those numbers go up or down, who knows, though I'd say they're likely to get better since the country [is tending more and more left every year](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/01/why-america-is-moving-left/419112/)). But that's not really what we're talking about. We're just talking about whether he needs to improve his image with dems who are closer to the moderate end of the wing. And the answer seems to be that he doesn't really need to. Furthermore, I'd argue that more moderate dems are likely to support him rather than a republican, especially in the age of Trump where jumping the dem ship in favor of the republicans has a lot of drawbacks and implications.\n\nBut I'm not a polisci guy. There's always the chance that I'm just flat out wrong in my interpretation of this stuff. But at the very least, I think the numbers tell a pretty convincing story. The idea that Bernie is not liked by a large portion of the party (you say 15-20%) appears to be false. At best you could point to his unfavorable numbers among the somewhat liberal, but that doesn't match up with how well he's received within the party (*note that \"moderates\" does not only reflect moderate dems, it's just the centerpoint of a scale that spans from \"very liberal\" to \"very conservative\"). I think it'd be fair to say that party leadership is wary of him, but I think the fact that the democratic voting base likes him so much is a sign that the party leadership is just being stubborn, or has bought into this idea that Bernie somehow ruined Hillary's chances of winning in 2016. But that's a conversation for another time, I think.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ctrl+F &amp;quot;Sanders&amp;quot; and you&amp;#39;ll find pertinent polling information in that &lt;a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2017/PPP_Release_National_33017.pdf\"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; (which by the way is from March of this year).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on party:&lt;/strong&gt; Bernie has an 82% favorable rating among Democrats, and a 9% unfavorable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on ideology:&lt;/strong&gt; 86% favorable among the very liberal (6% unfavorable), 78% favorable among the somewhat liberal (15% unfavorable), and 53% favorable among moderates* (33% unfavorable).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like he&amp;#39;s doing pretty damn well to me. But let&amp;#39;s compare that to a well-known Democratic leader like Joe Biden:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on party:&lt;/strong&gt; Joe has a 86% favorable rating among Democrats, and a 9% unfavorable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on ideology:&lt;/strong&gt; 85% favorable among the very liberal (8% unfavorable), 89% favorable among the somewhat liberal (11% unfavorable), and 59% favorable among moderates* (29% unfavorable).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that&amp;#39;s significantly different is Biden&amp;#39;s favorable rating among the somewhat liberal. Everything else is pretty much identical. You could make the argument that Joe&amp;#39;s been in the public eye for longer, so those numbers are more stable and unlikely to shift, while Bernie&amp;#39;s are likely to change as folks get to know him and his policies (whether those numbers go up or down, who knows, though I&amp;#39;d say they&amp;#39;re likely to get better since the country &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/01/why-america-is-moving-left/419112/\"&gt;is tending more and more left every year&lt;/a&gt;). But that&amp;#39;s not really what we&amp;#39;re talking about. We&amp;#39;re just talking about whether he needs to improve his image with dems who are closer to the moderate end of the wing. And the answer seems to be that he doesn&amp;#39;t really need to. Furthermore, I&amp;#39;d argue that more moderate dems are likely to support him rather than a republican, especially in the age of Trump where jumping the dem ship in favor of the republicans has a lot of drawbacks and implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not a polisci guy. There&amp;#39;s always the chance that I&amp;#39;m just flat out wrong in my interpretation of this stuff. But at the very least, I think the numbers tell a pretty convincing story. The idea that Bernie is not liked by a large portion of the party (you say 15-20%) appears to be false. At best you could point to his unfavorable numbers among the somewhat liberal, but that doesn&amp;#39;t match up with how well he&amp;#39;s received within the party (*note that &amp;quot;moderates&amp;quot; does not only reflect moderate dems, it&amp;#39;s just the centerpoint of a scale that spans from &amp;quot;very liberal&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;very conservative&amp;quot;).
