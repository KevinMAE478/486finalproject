I prefer action and mechanically challenging games like Monster Hunter (which is deeply flawed still), Binding of Isaac, fighting games...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: don&amp;#39;t downvote if you just don&amp;#39;t agree, you can have your own opinion and reply with it. I just feel that navigating menus for 90% of a game is not fun, plus you can&amp;#39;t expect me to read so much text on such a crappy screen. I&amp;#39;d have no problem with story driven games if the 3DS&amp;#39;s screen had a bit higher definiton.\nAlso, I did play the previously mentioned games, each for at least 5 hours and I got bored from them, so don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m just judging them from trailers and videos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dg6lw59", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061885.0, "created_utc": 1492033085.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
