So while I didn't finish the game by any means or see all of what it has to offer I have seen enough for me to consider my opinion valid. \n\nFirst of all MH4U was my first Monster Hunter game, so I had no nostalgia for the multiple villages. The worst part of the game is anything done not hunting and I feel like Generations spent too much time trying to flesh out the villages. And look I know MH4U did the same thing with places to travel and take quests from but 4U felt more focused. Each place you had to go to had a small set of quests for you and then you moved on to the next place it was another way of measuring \"hey I'm getting farther in the game and unlocked these new places\" but you never really had any reason not to just stay in the first village once your couple of quests were done. In Generations I thought that there were too many quests that you had to talk to every person in a village after, and I thought that you unlocked all of them way too early. I can understand if you think this is a stupid opinion because there's no difference between how gen and 4U handled multiple villages but maybe it's just because I haven't quite nailed down what the key differences are (I'm writing this from memory and it's been since launch week that I played Gen)\n\n4U had a better system for powering each monster with the frenzied monsters. It was just cooler and made more sense because as bare as the story was, it was cool enough to explain the frenzy and how it was being spread by Gore. I felt like in gen monsters were powered up just because? Maybe there's a reason eventually but that's my thing 4U explained pretty quickly what frenzy is and gen seems to either give you too much too soon or too little too late. \n\nThat kinda leads to my overall complaint the progression in 4U seems more expertly crafted. I felt like I was doing something important with each quest. I play games with a completionist mind set so I would play every quest in every star rank before moving on, and even doing that I felt like I was rewarded after each quest with something new to buy or craft in the hub or a new quest. Gen didn't feel like that. And there's like way more grindy \"find the obscure bug/plant/ore\" quests especially in the early game than 4U. Not only that but I never felt like I was rewarded for doing all these. Like eventually I just looked up how to unlock a honey farming system and found out I had like a string of a ton of boring quests left to go thru before I could have my honey farming system. \n\nObviously I need to touch on the two biggest things Generations has to offer: hunting styles and monsters. I like them both. I was surprised how natural each style felt, especially when I had to right style for the Monster (adept for Narga, Arial for Naj). They work so I have no complaints about them, I wish 4U had them, and I hope each new game after XX has them. They add a lot to the experience of hunting and give more flexibility in build, weapon choice, and approach to each fight. I understand that gen has variations of mons but I don't like that there are no subspecies. I love narga and the 4 flagships. The 4 are all incredibly well designed as hunts as well as their actual artistic design  and I wish I liked the game enough to make it higher in rank to fight harder versions. I actually wish that about every Monster in Generations. I wanna fight the hardest and baddest things in the game but the game just throws me off of it. That thirst for more isn't there. I wish I could fight more monsters but the game doesn't make getting there interesting, and 4U did to me. \n\nSummed up: 4U was focused and progression was crafted expertly. Gens progression through the game pales in comparison, and that's ultimately the problem here. I really like hunting styles and the 4 flagship mons as well as narga. But the lack of subspecies makes the mon selection seem empty, even though I understand there are still substitutes that add variety \n\nEdit: don't feel like editing this, I'm about to go to work.
