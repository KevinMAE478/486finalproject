Other games that have helped me with anxiety are Fantasy Life and Animal Crossing  and Breath of the Wild has helped me a lot lately. Rune Factory 4 too. Also any platformers, any Mario or Shantae game. Basically anything that has short, quick levels during which I have to concentrate a lot seems to help my anxiety the most. I wish you all the best, and hope that everything turns out well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dg8y17x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492189256.0, "created_utc": 1492160456.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659yzh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ib4w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "somerandomgamer0", "parent_id": "t3_659yzh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lots of great recommendations!
