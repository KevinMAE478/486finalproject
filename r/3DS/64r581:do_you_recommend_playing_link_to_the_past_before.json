You literally have to look for it, and even then, it&amp;#39;s okay but not anything to write home about. I&amp;#39;d rather minimal story than a story that isn&amp;#39;t fantastic that I have to track down.\nCharacters? Some are interesting, but it&amp;#39;s all few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Difficulty level? You have to impose it upon yourself because no Zelda game has made healing this easy. Even without much cooking, if you explore a little you&amp;#39;ll have hundreds of mushrooms, fish, and apples. Nothing will kill you unless you let it, and even if you do...Mipha&amp;#39;s Grace and several fairies (without bottles!!!) will save you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It starts out as if there will be a ton to do, and plenty of survivalist challenge...but doesn&amp;#39;t really deliver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Music? Unlike every other Zelda, it is minimal. There are a few instances where it exists and is okay or even good, but...it isn&amp;#39;t there enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t even go into voice acting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#39;t a bad game. I&amp;#39;ve had fun. I&amp;#39;ve logged probably over 150 hours now. But it&amp;#39;s really, really not the best Zelda. I see where it takes some cues from LoZ, but not...enough?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to justify the game in my mind by saying, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; Zelda games are different and unique, no two are alike, and the next will take what this did right and add all the good stuff back.&amp;quot; I figure surely that&amp;#39;s accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dg5ewx6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491996838.0, "created_utc": 1491968038.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg56ov1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rahtin", "parent_id": "t1_dg55o6k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because it started off cool, fun, and different.\n\nThen you had to completely stop the game and go farm weapons and food.\n\nThe boss fights don't even seem challenging, it's just about how much food you bring.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it started off cool, fun, and different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you had to completely stop the game and go farm weapons and food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boss fights don&amp;#39;t even seem challenging, it&amp;#39;s just about how much food you bring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dg56ov1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491985670.0, "created_utc": 1491956870.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r581", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5el5a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dra39437", "parent_id": "t1_dg55o6k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I still think all the dungeons are pretty satisfying, especially with the wall-mechanic.
