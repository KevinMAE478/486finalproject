In general, I think the DS was amazing for revolutionizing how we interact with games, and the mechanics of the game were just so awesome (Bravely Default is the only RPG I can think of that comes close, and it still pales in comparison for novelty).  Variable difficulty, fighting two different battles at once, engaging story line, and comprehensive attack system with the pin mechanic, all made it totally special and unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CT is a masterpiece of a traditional RPG, TWEWY innovated imperfectly and wonderfully.  Or put another way, CT is Murtaugh, TWEWY is Riggs... both are great cops with two very different approaches to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dg9ek6w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492217798.0, "created_utc": 1492188998.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65conu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65conu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9eqvq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sykotiksonik", "parent_id": "t1_dg9co7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same here", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same here&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dg9eqvq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492218007.0, "created_utc": 1492189207.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65conu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ry7g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scissorgrass", "parent_id": "t1_dg9co7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I purposefully put it away for a couple years at a time to play it during xmas break.  \n\nWorth it.
