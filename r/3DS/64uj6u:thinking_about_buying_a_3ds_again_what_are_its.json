The Switch is out, and even if some people refuse to accept it, Nintendo will most likely only have one console going forward, that works both portable and on the TV. The benefits of only having one console to make games for easily outweigh the benefits of having specialized hardware and content for the different formats. That&amp;#39;s why the 3DS needs to &amp;quot;die&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, the 3DS isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; in the sense that it&amp;#39;s a bad purchase.
