If you want to get into the Persona games (and you should, they&amp;#39;re incredible), that is where I recommend you start. You shouldn&amp;#39;t play any other Shin Megami Tensei games. They&amp;#39;re good, but they&amp;#39;re really nothing like any of the Persona games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you already have a PS3 or PS4. Then just play Persona 5. I like Persona 4 better (so far, only 60 hours into P5), but P5 is easier to get into, and it&amp;#39;s still very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dgbkbc0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492339179.0, "created_utc": 1492310379.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k4a7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbp26x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "moodyssbm", "parent_id": "t3_65k4a7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "/r/Megaten always suggests starting with Persona 3 FES since it gives you a taste of what mainline and the Persona series have to offer simultaneously.\n\nYou can get a brand new copy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Shin-Megami-Tensei-Persona-FES-PlayStation/dp/B0014CN2H6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492317859&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=persona%2B3&amp;th=1) still, or you can get it on PSN for the PS3 for cheap as well.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/Megaten\"&gt;/r/Megaten&lt;/a&gt; always suggests starting with Persona 3 FES since it gives you a taste of what mainline and the Persona series have to offer simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get a brand new copy from &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shin-Megami-Tensei-Persona-FES-PlayStation/dp/B0014CN2H6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1492317859&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=persona%2B3&amp;amp;th=1\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; still, or you can get it on PSN for the PS3 for cheap as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3DS", "name": "t1_dgbp26x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346714.0, "created_utc": 1492317914.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ruhy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k4a7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbqo2s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "juru1876", "parent_id": "t3_65k4a7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3DS", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I tried to play Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor Overclocked.
