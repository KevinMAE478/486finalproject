These energy gels were made from Almonds, Coconut Water, Coconut Oil, Brown Rice Syrup, Honey, Blueberries, Sea Salt, Bananas, Lemon Juice and Lime Juice. I filled a couple of small baby squeeze packs with this blended mix and carried them with me during my run.\nA couple of other things I have discovered over the last couple of years of running is my breathing is better if I avoid all dairy foods, and I don&amp;#39;t get sore muscles as much if I avoid processes white sugar, hence my reason for making my own energy gel mixture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the start of the race I found someone who was aiming for 3hrs 20mins so I ran along side him for the first 30kms, until I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with him any longer (he managed to finish in 3hrs 5mins). At around the 36km mark, I started to cramp on the inside of my thighs so I had to back off the pace quite a bit for the last 5kms to make sure I made it to the finish line.
