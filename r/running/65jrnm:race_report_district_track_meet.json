The week before I had PRed in the 3200 with a 10:55 though so I figured if I could do that I could break five too. Anyway to warm up we ran around the football field for about ten minutes, did our plyometrics, and I did some hip stretches so mine wouldn&amp;#39;t lock up. After that we got our race stickers and lined up beside the track to wait for the JV race to finish. On the line I was actually feeling really good. Our district is one of the fastest in the city so I knew that the pack could help me break five if I just stayed with them for a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our race plan for this race was to run out the first 400m sub 70, then maintain to run about a 2:25, then run sub 3:45, and just kick with all you have that last lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bang! The gun went off and so did we starting out pretty fast and actually jostling very hard. On the 200 mark one of my teammates got spiked by some runner from another school as he was trying to pass him. By the 300 meter mark the pack had spread out in front and left the others behind, me included. I came across at a 1:09 though so I was super happy. I knew that these next two laps would make or break me. On this next 400 I just focused on my stride and breathing and knowing I had to run sub 2:30 on this 800. I stayed on my teammates tail for this lap and came across at a 2:25. The third lap is what always gets me. I usually eat absolute shit on this lap so I focused really hard on opening my stride and just maintaining. With about 600m I picked it up a notch to start my kick. I came across at 3:45, which was a little over the time I wanted so I knew I had to kick hard. I took off after crossing the line. At about the 150 meter mark of that lap I caught up to my teammate and passed another kid. My teammate decided to kick with me which in turn made me go faster. I just kind of said fuck it at this point and knew it was going to be an incredibly painful 200 meter finish. I kept up that kick and at the 100 meter mark I could see on our scoreboard the time said 4:40 and as I got closer to the line it had just turned to 4:50 so I knew I was going to make it. I crossed the line and threw my hands in the air. 4:57!!! It might not have been by much but I did it and it counts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right after the race I nearly threw up but then went over to all my teammates and got high fives and hugs. Another kid from my team who had been trying to break five also ran a 4:53 so we we&amp;#39;re pretty excited. I could see my dad really excited in the stands and my coaches gave me a big bear hug as I came up to see them. I was in that mile high the entire night. I&amp;#39;m so glad that I accomplished my goals of braking 11 minutes in the 3200 and breaking 5 in the 1600.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In hindsight though, fuck track and those events. It&amp;#39;s like if the idea of hell was condensed into 8 and 4 laps.
