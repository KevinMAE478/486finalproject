After running very light volumes (1000k annually, so only 12 mile a week) for eight years, I stepped up my game in 2015, running close to 2000k in 2016. For my first marathon (Antwerp, April 2016), I based my training on a plan out of Matt Fitzgerald &amp;#39;80/20 Running&amp;#39;-book. What I liked about his approach, was that the runs were laid out in great detail and that the cautious approach of running at least 80% of the time in the low-intensity heart rate zones 1 and 2 (out of 5) allowed me to increase my volume (and thus improve my aerobic base) without getting injured or overtrained. My biggest beef with the plan was that it was purely based on heart rate zones. I was left in the dark about what a sensible pacing strategy would be for my first marathon. A few weeks before the race, I settled for a pacing scheme to run a 3:50 race, which I executed quite well (finishing in 3:51:39, with a moderately positive split of +2%). For the Rotterdam marathon (my second), I based my training on the Hansons beginner program. The biggest draws were that this plan specified paces or pace ranges for all my runs and included more race-specific miles, at goal marathon pace (&amp;#39;tempo runs&amp;#39;) or slightly faster (&amp;#39;strength runs&amp;#39;). I trained for a 3:40 marathon. However, I made some substantial modifications to the plan: longer long runs (up to 20,5 miles, where the Hansons top out at 16 miles) and only 4 runs per week (I substituted 2 easy runs for 2 stationary bike rides and some strength training). I averaged around 60k (38 miles) on this plan (+25% compared to my training for Antwerp).   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race strategy&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal was a 3:40-finish and my strategy was to run the same type of split as I did in Antwerp (my only point of reference, so probably my best guess of what works for me). I would try to reach the half marathon point in 1:48-1:49 and allow myself to slow down 2% over the second half.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Rotterdam on Saturday afternoon. The race expo was so crowded, loud and stuffy that my girlfriend got claustrophobic. She raced the race expo to the exit in what was surely a new course record :-) I appreciate that race expos generate welcome revenue for race organizers and thus help keep costs for participants reasonable, but to force people to follow the full route through an overcrowded expo after bib pickup is not how I would treat my &amp;#39;customers&amp;#39;. No, I don&amp;#39;t want to try on your smelly socks, buy a megapack of yucky gels or get engaged in a conversation about nipple protection with fifty strangers listening in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to race day, I watched the weather forecasts with worry (Tuesday), alarm (Thursday) and horror (Saturday). It was to be an unseasonably warm Sunday. And boy, it surely was! A blistering sun, not even a breeze, and temperatures (in the mostly absent shade) gradually increasing from 13\u00b0C (55F) at 10am to well abouve 20\u00b0C (68F) after 2pm when the mortals were destined to finish. In an autumn marathon, a sunny 20\u00b0C is probably manageable to (heat-accustomed) inhabitants of the Low Countries, but after a long winter and a slow start to the spring, we were all in for a shock to the system. The median finishing time of the race was 4:10, a 10 minute increase from previous editions. DNFs are not listed on the race website, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if close to 1000 starters (out of aprrox. 15000) dropped out or didn&amp;#39;t make the cutoff time. I feel for everyone who muscled through countless cold training runs, only to be defeated by the first hot day of the year. Better luck next time around!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weather forecast and the fierce warning issued by the race organizers (&amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t try to run a PR in this heat&amp;quot;) made me lose my pre-race confidence in my ability to run this marathon in sub 3:40. I crossed the half marathon point in 1:51:16 and decided to fall back to my B-goal of PR&amp;#39;ing, preferably in sub 3:50. I finished in 3:49:33, a 2 minute improvement over my Antwerp debut (ran in an unseasonably cold day of around 7C/45F). Apart from the weather, the other thing out of my control was that it was impossible to run my desired pace in the first 15k of the race. Although the field was divided in five start waves (I started in the second), there were simply too many runners to set your own pace. Running on the &amp;#39;fringes&amp;#39; (sidewalks, adjacent bike lanes) is risky and pushing/nudging slower runners aside is not my style, so it was my fate to run the same pace of the flock of runners surrounding me (luckily, this was only slightly slower than my goal pace). When the field finally started to thin out (after the HM point), I was too tired and overheated to pick up the pace and attempt a heroic negative split in pursuit of my 3:40-goal.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those looking for race anecdotes: only one (mildly) funny thing happened to me. In the first 10k, I tried to keep the pacer for a 3:45 finish in my sight. If I squinted my eyes, I could just see his rather silly flag bobbing up and down at the horizon. I was approximately 100 meters behind him for a long time, and then I very slowly started to close in on The Flag. When I was literally one step behind this guy (around 15k in the race), he stepped aside, bent over and stepped out of the race! My plan was to ask him if he was attempting an even split and to follow him as long as possible, but he bailed on me! I never saw any of the other 3:45-pacers (they probably started in the first start wave or at the front of the second). So much for my history of running with pace groups ...    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me finish by saying that the Rotterdam marathon, the smelly race expo and fading pacer aside, is a great event: a nice, relatively flat course with some amazing views, huge and loud crowds (half a million spectators?), sponge stations (a godsend!), well-organized drink stations (every 5k) and a reasonable fee (60 euros for the event, a t-shirt and a nice medal). Highly recommended!    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am going to try to run a sub 20 minutes 5k (PR of 20:59) later this spring. In October, I am planning to run the very first &amp;#39;Great Bruges marathon&amp;#39;. This will be a much smaller event, allowing me to run my own pace and race. If my training goes well and it is not too hot on race day, I am confident of running sub 3h40.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report was generated using &lt;a href=\"http://racereportr.azurewebsites.net\"&gt;race reportr&lt;/a&gt;, a tool built by &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/bbqlays\"&gt;/u/BBQLays&lt;/a&gt; for making great looking and informative race reports.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "### Race information\n* **What?** Marathon Rotterdam\n* **When?** April 9, 2017\n* **How far?** 42,195km\n* **Website?** http://www.nnmarathonrotterdam.org/\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A |&lt; 3:40 | *No* |\n| B |&lt; 3:50 | *Yes* |\n| C |&lt; PB (3:51:39) | *Yes* |\n\n### Training\nI am a 39-year old male.
