I started wishing that I would hear my leg visibly snap in half because that somehow would feel amazing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got an ibuprofen from a random runner, finally hit the last aid station 3 hours later. Maybe mile 28. Got a grilled cheese and a Coke. Water refill. The volunteers loved the &amp;quot;everything hurts and I&amp;#39;m dying&amp;quot; singlet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked how far it was until the finish and the volunteer responded Seven. So I asked, miles? This got a laugh. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my pack back on and left with my Coke and my broken dreams. Goodbye time goal. Goodbye working leg. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fucking uphill finish and I should have just rolled off the side of the mountain and stayed there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finished in 10:20. Swollen shin, bruised. Sodium deficient, sunburnt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sucked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;0/10 did not enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still got my medal. But fuck that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: also waiting on MRI results to see if it&amp;#39;s a stress fracture so wish me not-broken-bones or something. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dgdpzds", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475776.0, "created_utc": 1492446976.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65up55", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdvh9j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "northandorbust", "parent_id": "t3_65up55", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Paris Marathon was an all-out disaster for me.\n\nEmpty water tables, heat I hadn't prepared for, crowding, an unprecedented amount of *shoving* and two-handed pushing (!!).
