I've looked up many causes, and I don't think it is Arthritis and it's definitely not too much pressure from my shoelaces. I normally Run Sprints in Track but sometimes I like to go \"the extra mile\" haha. Today I ran 8 miles and the same problem happened. However last time it happened I had to Ice daily and not run for about 5 days for it to go away. I had it looked at and they couldn't figure it out even with a Fracture Bone tester thing. So it wasn't a fracture. So what shoes should I get for this or what can I do to help? Anything I might be doing wrong? I really need help. I love running long distances but usually after 8 miles I am put out of running for at least a day or more and have to do self care. What's with this?

About 10 days after my first 20 mile run I got some pretty bad achilles tendinitis. I think this was the result of feeling so good from finishing 20 miles that I went too hard on the cutback week. As a result I ended up missing my first training run...just so happens it was my second 20 miles. I was devastated and, of course, was convinced that my training was over and I wouldn't be able to race.\n\nI bounced back by the end of that week with lots of RICE and finished the week 15 long run (20 miles) last week. Ended up being lazy for my first run this week (it fell on my birthday) and hit the snooze at 5:00am. So this week I'm readjusting my schedule to get that run back in.\n\nFeeling pretty ready but the elevation gain has me a little worried. I have hills in my area but nothing like out there. My 20 mile runs have had around 1.1k elevation gain...so it's not like I've been running flats. Also, luckily, it's been quite windy around here lately (15-20 MPH)...so that's helped me prepare for the possibility of strong winds.\n\nAnyone else running Big Sur or have any advice from past runs at this event?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Been training for my first marathon, Big Sur, since just after Christmas.

This will be my first 'official' run... my goal is to do a good job, but I don't know anything about good times or a good way to train. \n\nMy question is: does anyone have advice on how I could train myself to do well for this run starting now (I plan to do a mile later today after team practice); and is there any detail of some sort that I am missing?
