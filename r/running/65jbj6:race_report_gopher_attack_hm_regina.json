However I only really did about 3 quarters of the workout as I worked full weeks, plus overtime everyday. I also walked 50-75 km at work per week the last 2 months. I could have trained more, however the walking at work made up for my general lack of training vs other HMs other years&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woke up at 6:00am, ate a homemade egg mcmuffin (2 eggs scrambled into a microwavable egger container, toasted english muffin and a slice of chedder cheese.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let the dog out to do his thing, noticed the mist and light rain, started gearing up and got my 2-3 movements out of the way and I was out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went into this race thinking I need less then 30 min for a 5K, less then 60 min for a 10K, less then 90 min for a 15k to break 2 hours. and have some reserve time left incase of a wall or breakdown where i do an 8:00 km. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My personal mantra was &amp;quot;Slow the F down&amp;quot; because I naturally want to run in that pack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;0 - 5 KM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran what felt comfortable vs setting myself into a time zone and watching my time. (Checking my watch to make sure I wasn&amp;#39;t running a 5:25 km, then reminding myself to &amp;quot;slow the f down&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished my first 5K sub 30 mins, good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point a lady commented that I was a bad influence and she needs to slow down, we ran the rest of the race as personal pace bunnies - she was running the full and aiming for a 4 hour finish. She wanted to stay around a 5:45 km pace, she was confident at our pace I will break 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 - 15 KM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was comfortable, music was shut off and we watched each others pace, sometimes we went to a 5:30 km, slowed up to adjust. At worse we ran a 6:10 km pace. The course was a half loop design, the first half covered the same ground coming back, finish was in the middle. Second half of the HM was out and back same design. Full route was the same area one more time - so her full turn around was my finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10K I was well under 60 minutes, 15K I was 5 minutes under 90 min. I was going to be fine, I was on a diet of gel energy chews every 45 minutes and a &amp;quot;treat&amp;quot; berry gel pack that they gave out at the half way point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FInish&lt;/em&gt;\nI decided to run it out in the last 1 KM, I broke a personal 1 km speed record at 4:50.6 (as I was checking out Garmin right now) passed the finish line and a couple minutes later, my personal pace bunny, made sure everyone knew I just PRed and pointed me out, declared it and was happier then me!!  She finished a 4:10:46.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the stereotypical Canadian post meal, the option of donuts, apple crullers and Tim Horton coffee and bananas, soup, fruit and juice boxes. I went with coffee, banana and a couple orange juice boxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall great race, it&amp;#39;s my 3rd year running it, previously rana  2:04:50 and a 2:01:09.
