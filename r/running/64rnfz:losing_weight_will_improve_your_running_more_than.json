[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "running", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! Today I want to talk about how running was absolutely miserable for me and it is absolutely killing me to run hardly half a mile. Yet just two years ago when I was much smaller I was able to run effortlessly and even gracefully for multiple miles easily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most runners are already lean and mean, so it seems taboo to talk about weight in these circles. As soon as you bring it up people are quick to snap back and say, &amp;quot;Oh no its because your &amp;quot;fitness&amp;quot; changed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Your overvaluing the effect of weight loss&amp;quot;. Well, I can guarantee you I am not overvaluing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash back to me running at a lean 190, or 80lbs ago. Running was still hard, it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been good at. However, after running for a couple years I realized I was starting to crack the code of running. It was enjoyable. I was much faster, explosive, and my knees never really hurt that bad after a run(especially considering the volume I was doing back then.) Even when I was in &amp;quot;pain&amp;quot; I could push through, slow my pace down a little, and keep running and finish the run. Running was actually becoming enjoyable. However, that all came to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a injury weightlifting that was diagnosed as a sports hernia. This was unrelated to my running. I would have problems off and on with that injury, major depression, and weight gain for the next 2 years. I lost the will to live at some points, I would just sit in my house, watch Netflix and eat. I still did some weights though, and once the hernia healed I actually got stronger(much stronger) than I was in my running days. Obviously weight plays a factor in strength, but I am still much stronger than I was running, especially in the legs from squats and deadlifts. I decided that even though I was overweight, it would be nice to get back in the game and start running again. Some of you hear 270 lbs and picture me as this huge obese guy, but honestly i&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; big, I have more a of a powerlifter body nowadays so it isnt 270lbs of straight fat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture my surprise when I get back on a running trail and try to simply run for half a mile and my legs are absolutely killing me. I just did week 4 of couch2 5K and my knees still feel like someone took a sledgehammer to them. By the end of the last 5 minute &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;(if you want to even call it that) I was basically just granny power walking with the very little bit of glycogen I had left in my legs. What pissed me off was, I wasn&amp;#39;t even remotely tired from a cardio perspective, its just my legs can NOT handle this weight. It is &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; like running with a weighted vest on. But not a small ass 10-25lb vest like most people do and think that is hardcore. Put a 75-100lb vest on, and we&amp;#39;re in the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in the military so I tried to take the Army PT test with is a 2 mile run, which for me is in 16:36 or less. I figured, hell, I was blowing through that time 2 years ago and. I am a much stronger person than I was back then. The current me could pick that guy up and break him in half. Well imagine how embarrassing it was to see me come in limping across the finish line with a 21:45 time.(and trust me I wanted to shoot myself in the head the entire last half mile).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I sat there disgusted with my performance, breathing like I had just run a marathon, legs literally feeling someone drove a Ford Tacoma straight over them, I tried to do what all runners do an analyze my performance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I was slow, but &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; slow? What happened? Surely I got bigger, but my leg strength is much higher, that should allow me to, theoretically propel myself pretty far. Is it my cardio? Not really, I wasn&amp;#39;t even really tired up until the last half mile and I gutted it out because personally I believe cardio is largely mental. The only thing I could think of that had honestly changed was my &lt;strong&gt;weight&lt;/strong&gt;. My 6&amp;#39;0 frame is not designed to be lugging around 270 lbs, whether its muscle fat or whatever, the body really doesn&amp;#39;t give a damn. My theory is once you reach a certain weight(and this weight is largely based on your height, amount of muscle mass, and training experience) you are absolutely &lt;strong&gt;fucked&lt;/strong&gt;(and I mean bent over the kitchen counter fucked) as runner. I mean it really didn&amp;#39;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first started running I was about 205, the farthest I had EVER ran in my life was the mile they make you run in high school. I was a lifter and an athlete who largely sucked at distance running. And yet I was still like 20x faster than I am right now, despite me being much stronger and a more experienced runner. I used to run like a runaway hospital patient. No grace, no form, no technique, no breathing, &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. I was still 20x faster than I am now. Now, despite my sizable running layoff, I have breathing down to a T, my legs are stronger, I have pretty much mastered the POSE technique, and I personally think I run pretty sexy for a massive powerlifter. Yet I absolutely suck, and this &lt;strong&gt;feeling&lt;/strong&gt; sucks. When I first started being a lower weight the progress was rapid, I got better every run. Mostly because I was in the target weight zone and just steadily losing. As your weight decreases your running performance goes up. This is what I have seen. It all started making sense now. All those skinny people who had never touched a weight in their life, but could outrun me in basic training/boot camp. All those skinny guys who never complained about their knees hurting or their joints hurting. I was always playing with a loaded deck. Now I see the writing on the wall and I feel stupid for never realizing it before. It seems so god damn obvious now. I do realize now at 270 I am way behind the 8 ball and now going on a massive calorie deficit plus a short jog everyday(going to slowly build up because couch 2 5K is too intense right now). I am not making excuses. My laziness, ineptitude and dorito eating Neftlix watching self got into this condition and I&amp;#39;m going to dig myself out of this moon cratersized hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My big takeaway is 3 main points and any runner would do well to heed my advice on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule Number 1: Don&amp;#39;t ever get fat. If you have never been fat/big you dont know what its like. Running like this is torture. It is not fun, it is not liberating. It is not anything I came to know running as when I was smaller. I am not even closed to being one of the most experienced runners on this forum, but I have done half marathons, spartan race, and many military running events. I know what running is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to feel like, and this is not it. I wouldn&amp;#39;t wish running big on my worst enemy. My confidence has honestly been shredded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule Number 2: Most of your skills are due to your size don&amp;#39;t forget that. Dont ever talk down to big runners and say they are not trying hard enough. I have pushed myself into some dark places fitness wise before and I thought I was hard. No, I can promise you get fat and start running. I&amp;#39;ve played football, been through many military schools, competed in powerlifting, and ran a couple half marathons, and running fat and being overweight is &lt;strong&gt;by far&lt;/strong&gt; the hardest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever had to do in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule Number 3: If you get injured like I did, dont get depressed and spent all your time eating and lifting. Walk, eat a balanced low calorie diet, and stay in some form of shape. That way when the injury passes and heals you won&amp;#39;t have to be in my situation..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all I am going to keep pushing and get through this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope my story helped somebody out there, and if you have any questions I would be more than happy to answer them!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys!

Running was still hard, it's something I've never been good at. \n\nBecause you were overweight then too, with a BMI of around 26.  As you later point out, it does not matter if it is muscle or fat.  It's extra weight that you must move, requiring greater energy expenditure.\n\n&gt;  but I am still much stronger than I was running, especially in the legs from squats and deadlifts\n\nI bet your power-to-weight ratio is worse, not better.  But you'll never know, so you can believe what you want.\n\n&gt; Some of you hear 270 lbs and picture me as this huge obese guy, but honestly i'm not THAT big, I have more a of a powerlifter body nowadays so it isnt 270lbs of straight fat.\n\nEvery fat man who goes to the gym once in a while is a power lifter.\n\n&gt; I was basically just granny power walking with the very little bit of glycogen I had left in my legs.\n\nYou were not out of glycogen.  Nothing in a couch-to-5k program is going to put you in that position.\n\n&gt; I wasn't even remotely tired from a cardio perspective, its just my legs can NOT handle this weight.\n\nWere you wearing a heart rate monitor?   I am willing to bet you were in at least zone 3 if not zone 4.  Lower body discomfort tends to drown out cardio vascular discomfort.\n\n&gt;  Put a 75-100lb vest on, and we're in the ballpark.\n\nActually, no.  This is not remotely accurate.  As you also pointed out previously and know to be true, because you weigh 270 pounds your legs have adapted to moving that weight just to function day-to-day.  I can barely walk while carrying 100 pounds, and I'm willing to bet you would have almost as difficult of a time.  I guarantee that you would not be running with a 100 pound weight vest on if you can't handle couch to 5k.\n\n&gt; Imagine how embarrassing it was to see me come in limping across the finish line with a 21:45\n\nFor someone who weighs 270 pounds and is only in week 4 of C25k, a sub 11 minute mile is not terrible.\n\n&gt; disgusted with my performance, breathing like I had just run a marathon\n\nBut you just said that running doesn't make you tired \"from a cardio perspective\" so why were you breathing heavy?  Also, by the way, marathon pace doesn't induce particularly hard breathing (except maybe in the sub 2:30 elite class?) or particularly high heart rate because it would be unsustainable for the time it takes to run a marathon.  You mean breathing like you had just run a 2 mile speed trial.  It never gets easier, you just get faster.\n\n&gt; Is it my cardio? Not really, I wasn't even really tired up until the last half mile and I gutted it out\n\nIf you weren't breathing hard until the last half mile it means you were not running at the right pace.  For a two mile time trial, you should start breathing very hard almost immediately because you should be running above your VO2 max threshold for that short of a distance.  It also means that yes, yes, it is very much your cardio.  **You are not nearly as fit as you think you are.** You're fat.  The two are mutually exclusive.\n\n&gt; because personally I believe cardio is largely mental.\n\nYou would be wrong.  Cardio fitness is *an incredibly well studied* aspect of human physiology.  It is not mental.\n\n&gt; y theory is once you reach a certain weight(and this weight is largely based on your height, amount of muscle mass, and training experience) you are absolutely fucked(and I mean bent over the kitchen counter fucked) as runner. I mean it really didn't make sense.\n\nWhy wouldn't it?\n\nDid you take high school physics?\n\nThis is not rocket science.  Try running up a hill.  Is it harder than running on a flat surface?  Yes it is!  Why?  Because you have to fight against the force of gravity.  Lifting a weight is a lot harder than rolling a barbell around on the ground for the same reason.  You must overcome gravity to perform work.  When you move a heavier mass it is harder.\n\n&gt; And yet I was still like 20x faster than I am right now\n\nNo you weren't.  You did not run a 2 mile time trial in less than 1 minutes.\n\n&gt; despite me being much stronger and a more experienced runner.\n\nYou cannot become less experienced in running over time.  You can lose *conditioning* but not experience.\n\n&gt; I used to run like a runaway hospital patient. No grace, no form, no technique, no breathing, nothing.\n\nSo you were not an experienced runner then?  You were a rank amateur?  Got it.\n\n&gt;  I have breathing down to a T\n\nWhich explains why you didn't start breathing hard (e.g., 1 breath per step) for your two mile time trial until the bottom 800 meters, right?\n\n&gt; my legs are stronger, \n\n(but your power-to-weight ratio is lower)\n\n&gt; I have pretty much mastered the POSE technique\n\nThe what now?\n\n&gt; and I personally think I run pretty sexy for a massive powerlifter. \n\nAgain, you are wrong.  I promise you that the way you *imagine* your fat sloshing around while you run is not the way it *actually* sloshes around.\n\n&gt; Mostly because I was in the target weight zone \n\nYou were about 60 pounds heavier than your ideal racing weight of around 155, or BMI of 21.  Show me an Olympic runner in any distance (not sprinters) with a BMI of 26 and I'll eat my words.\n\n&gt; As your weight decreases your running performance goes up. This is what I have seen.\n\nTo a point.  Most people will tell you that their race PRs are usually at higher-than-usual weight (though typically only 2-3% higher than their normal BMI which is probably 21-23).  This is usually because PRs come from tapering down mileage in preparation for an event which causes temporary weight gain due to lower mileage for the same eating habits.  And there is certainly a point at which your BF% is so low that weight loss equals muscle loss.  It's all about power-to-weight ratio.\n\n&gt; Don't ever get fat.\n\nPreach bruh.\n\n&gt;  I am not even closed to being one of the most experienced runners on this forum\n\nBut that doesn't stop you from spouting advice now does it?\n\n&gt; Most of your skills are due to your size don't forget that. \n\n... And this is why I'm bringing you back down to earth, because this is literally the least informed thing anyone has ever said on this subreddit and if you've been here for more than the 10 seconds it took you to find the \"Text Post\" button you'd know that's saying a lot.\n\nRunning skill takes discipline, putting in the hard workouts that most people won't do.  It means constantly putting yourself in physical discomfort over extended periods of time to work toward a goal.\n\nThe beautiful thing about this is that it is almost impossible to put in the level of effort to become a skilled runner and stay fat.  All I need to do is look at you and I know instantly that you are not a skilled runner and have not put in the work.  You might have been a skilled runner in the past but you sure as shit aren't one now.\n\n&gt; Dont ever talk down to big runners and say they are not trying hard enough. \n\nYou have not tried hard enough for long enough or you wouldn't still be big.\n\n&gt; and running fat and being overweight is by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.\n\nIt never gets any easier.  You just get faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492003767.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t going to say anything until I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most of your skills are due to your size don&amp;#39;t forget that&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now I feel compelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most runners are already lean and mean, so it seems taboo to talk about weight in these circles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;#39;t wear your insecurities on your sleeve it&amp;#39;s easy to talk about your weight, and we do it all the time.  There&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Racing-Weight-Lean-Peak-Performance/dp/1934030996\"&gt;series of books about it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Flash back to me running at a lean 190, or 80lbs ago. Running was still hard, it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve never been good at. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you were overweight then too, with a BMI of around 26.  As you later point out, it does not matter if it is muscle or fat.  It&amp;#39;s extra weight that you must move, requiring greater energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but I am still much stronger than I was running, especially in the legs from squats and deadlifts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bet your power-to-weight ratio is worse, not better.  But you&amp;#39;ll never know, so you can believe what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of you hear 270 lbs and picture me as this huge obese guy, but honestly i&amp;#39;m not THAT big, I have more a of a powerlifter body nowadays so it isnt 270lbs of straight fat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every fat man who goes to the gym once in a while is a power lifter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was basically just granny power walking with the very little bit of glycogen I had left in my legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were not out of glycogen.  Nothing in a couch-to-5k program is going to put you in that position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t even remotely tired from a cardio perspective, its just my legs can NOT handle this weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Were you wearing a heart rate monitor?   I am willing to bet you were in at least zone 3 if not zone 4.  Lower body discomfort tends to drown out cardio vascular discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Put a 75-100lb vest on, and we&amp;#39;re in the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, no.  This is not remotely accurate.  As you also pointed out previously and know to be true, because you weigh 270 pounds your legs have adapted to moving that weight just to function day-to-day.  I can barely walk while carrying 100 pounds, and I&amp;#39;m willing to bet you would have almost as difficult of a time.  I guarantee that you would not be running with a 100 pound weight vest on if you can&amp;#39;t handle couch to 5k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine how embarrassing it was to see me come in limping across the finish line with a 21:45&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For someone who weighs 270 pounds and is only in week 4 of C25k, a sub 11 minute mile is not terrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;disgusted with my performance, breathing like I had just run a marathon&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you just said that running doesn&amp;#39;t make you tired &amp;quot;from a cardio perspective&amp;quot; so why were you breathing heavy?  Also, by the way, marathon pace doesn&amp;#39;t induce particularly hard breathing (except maybe in the sub 2:30 elite class?) or particularly high heart rate because it would be unsustainable for the time it takes to run a marathon.  You mean breathing like you had just run a 2 mile speed trial.  It never gets easier, you just get faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is it my cardio? Not really, I wasn&amp;#39;t even really tired up until the last half mile and I gutted it out&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you weren&amp;#39;t breathing hard until the last half mile it means you were not running at the right pace.  For a two mile time trial, you should start breathing very hard almost immediately because you should be running above your VO2 max threshold for that short of a distance.  It also means that yes, yes, it is very much your cardio.  &lt;strong&gt;You are not nearly as fit as you think you are.&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;re fat.  The two are mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;because personally I believe cardio is largely mental.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You would be wrong.  Cardio fitness is &lt;em&gt;an incredibly well studied&lt;/em&gt; aspect of human physiology.  It is not mental.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;y theory is once you reach a certain weight(and this weight is largely based on your height, amount of muscle mass, and training experience) you are absolutely fucked(and I mean bent over the kitchen counter fucked) as runner. I mean it really didn&amp;#39;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you take high school physics?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not rocket science.  Try running up a hill.  Is it harder than running on a flat surface?  Yes it is!  Why?  Because you have to fight against the force of gravity.  Lifting a weight is a lot harder than rolling a barbell around on the ground for the same reason.  You must overcome gravity to perform work.  When you move a heavier mass it is harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And yet I was still like 20x faster than I am right now&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No you weren&amp;#39;t.  You did not run a 2 mile time trial in less than 1 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;despite me being much stronger and a more experienced runner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot become less experienced in running over time.  You can lose &lt;em&gt;conditioning&lt;/em&gt; but not experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I used to run like a runaway hospital patient. No grace, no form, no technique, no breathing, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you were not an experienced runner then?  You were a rank amateur?  Got it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have breathing down to a T&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which explains why you didn&amp;#39;t start breathing hard (e.g., 1 breath per step) for your two mile time trial until the bottom 800 meters, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;my legs are stronger, &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(but your power-to-weight ratio is lower)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have pretty much mastered the POSE technique&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The what now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and I personally think I run pretty sexy for a massive powerlifter. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, you are wrong.  I promise you that the way you &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; your fat sloshing around while you run is not the way it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; sloshes around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly because I was in the target weight zone &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were about 60 pounds heavier than your ideal racing weight of around 155, or BMI of 21.  Show me an Olympic runner in any distance (not sprinters) with a BMI of 26 and I&amp;#39;ll eat my words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As your weight decreases your running performance goes up. This is what I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To a point.  Most people will tell you that their race PRs are usually at higher-than-usual weight (though typically only 2-3% higher than their normal BMI which is probably 21-23).  This is usually because PRs come from tapering down mileage in preparation for an event which causes temporary weight gain due to lower mileage for the same eating habits.  And there is certainly a point at which your BF% is so low that weight loss equals muscle loss.  It&amp;#39;s all about power-to-weight ratio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ever get fat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preach bruh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am not even closed to being one of the most experienced runners on this forum&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t stop you from spouting advice now does it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most of your skills are due to your size don&amp;#39;t forget that. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... And this is why I&amp;#39;m bringing you back down to earth, because this is literally the least informed thing anyone has ever said on this subreddit and if you&amp;#39;ve been here for more than the 10 seconds it took you to find the &amp;quot;Text Post&amp;quot; button you&amp;#39;d know that&amp;#39;s saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running skill takes discipline, putting in the hard workouts that most people won&amp;#39;t do.

It really sucked but it isn't impossible to make a comeback. Tips at the bottom. \n\nI'm also in the military. I have been in for over 14 years. When I first joined I ran like crap. Somewhere around my second deployment I finally found a love for running. I started doing half marathons, 5ks anything really. I'd get bored and run 8 miles just \"because.\" My pace was pretty awesome and im sure at one point i really was \"addicted.\" Well a couple of years after deployment I got pregnant. I didn't take good care of myself during the pregnancy like I should have and ate everything in sight. I gained a lot of weight (ended up over 200lbs) and ended up injuring one of my feet. After the pregnancy running was a real struggle and my foot hurt immensely. Eventually it hurt to walk. One x-ray at podiatry and the doc was already saying I needed surgery. I pushed off surgery for a while until I just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. Depression hit me pretty hard too so I totally understand what you mean. Eventually I got the surgery on my foot and finally it didn't hurt to walk anymore. After a while it didn't hurt that bad to run but I was horribly incredibly slow. I ended up on a permanent own pace and distance with APFT walk. Being able to run again I did shed some weight (about 30 or 40lbs), enough to pass tape but I was still pretty fat honestly. I ran and ran and ran some more. I completed a half marathon and the ten miler but I ate like garbage and my pace made me feel like I could have got a better time walking it. Eating like garbage just kept me at the same \"barely passing tape weight\" no matter how much PT I did. Important lesson \"You cannot outrun the fork!\" I lost a lot of flexibility in my big toe from the surgery so that was part of the problem. My stride got kind of messed up as a result. I went back and forth between running and then getting depressed about how I couldn't perform like before. The feeling that I could never be as good as I was before would hit me deep and sometimes would derail my attempts at running after work for days or even weeks in some cases. I tried everything to get my pace back with no success. Well eventually the screw from the surgery shifted (probably from me trying to force a proper stride) and it was horribly painful. I went back in and had the screw removed. Within 30 days I was back to running and got some pace back but not a lot. Eventually I started eating right but stopped running after work for a while (about a month or two). I was still running for PT though. I cut my calories pretty low. Since November I have dropped over 30lbs. I now no longer need to be taped. Once I felt a lot better (and healthier) I started running regularly again after work. It actually feels good again and is something I look forward to instead of dreading. A few weeks ago I did a half marathon and was pretty impressed with my time. The time I had estimated was off by over 20 minutes in a good way. The next day we ran at PT and I still did way better even the day after a half marathon than I had done in a long time. My pace is finally starting to get back with me. The medics in my unit heard about my half marathon pace and the run the day after. Their LT had a talk with me and guess what after 4 years and two surgeries, I am no longer on a permanent profile. I'm trying to take a diagnostic APFT really soon where I get to run. Some people might think I'm crazy but I'm pretty excited about it. As a female to get a 300 the pace isn't that bad. I think I need to drop another 2 minutes but we will see for sure after the diagnostic. I'm hoping maybe in the next couple of months I'll finally get that 300. \n\n My focus now is to drop about another 10lbs (although I don't need to), keep eating right (cut out the last bit of garbage I still slip into my budget), and work of some of the few \"saggy bits\" of my body I view as less than desirable...\n\n All I can say to you is at one point I felt helpless like nothing I could do would fix the situation I was in. I dwelled on it, I stalled, I made excuses and felt sorry for myself. Don't feel sorry for yourself. I don't know where you are stationed but many posts have an AWC (Army Wellness Center). See if your post has one. Make an appointment. They will be able to estimate your BF%. Don't be too upset if it is higher than you expected (mine certainly was). They use the bod pod which is fairly accurate. They can also do a metabolic assessment. Get this done. It uses a machine to tell exactly how many calories you burn daily (via respiration). They will give you your RMR, TDEE and calorie count for losing 1 or 2lbs per week. Treat it like a budget. Eat whatever you want but don't go over the limit. Like a bank account. You wouldn't want to overdraft your bank don't \"overdraft\" your food either. Eventually as you get used to the calorie limit if you are like me you will start to feel better and be more responsible about your food choices. You don't want to change too much to fast because it could set you up for failure if you get overwhelmed and quit. For me after learning that if I ate a bag of chips it would take up all of my lunch calories and I had to go hungry I started evaluating my food by what will keep me full for the least calories. A littke hint: Generally it's the healthier stuff. I can still have Pizza for dinner but I limit it to one slice. If I want two slice it's thin crust and veggie. I can still have chocolate but I need to either have a small portion of the bar or it is going to count for both of my snacks for the day which later will make me hungrier and kind of miserable. Better to pick the first option and have room for food later. \n\n  I'm short 5'3\", female, have 3 children, and I'm in my 30s. Hopefully my success will be able to help you out too.
