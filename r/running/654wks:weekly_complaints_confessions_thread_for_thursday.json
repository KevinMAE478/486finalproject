Really, this is more of a \"this is weird &amp; idk how to deal.\"\n\nOver the weekend, I went on a 5k training run with a friend who's a new runner. This was the first time she ever hit 5k distance, and I was SO excited for her. Afterwards, we met up with a few acquaintances for drinks. My friend announces, \"I ran my first 5k!\" There's some general congratulations. And my friend adds, \"And also, /u/CyanideInParadise ran the 5k with me!\" \n\nI don't talk about running much, so no one really knows that I'm a runner. And suddenly I'm getting a flurry of questions and comments about this. \"Wow, nice!\" \"How was it?\" \"Are you tired?\" \"How are you/your legs feeling now?\" \"10k anyday now!\" \n\nMe: *thinking to myself* \"Woah, woah...um...this was just a training run, you guys...\"\n\nI had no idea how to respond. I'm not fast or competitive, but even so, I've been running for years and it is just part of my schedule now, like eating or sleeping. It's not an \"event\" in my life unless it's something like a time/distance PR, or something special like seeing a fantastic sunrise. Even weirder is that, days later, I was still getting occasional comments from other mutual acquaintances and friends. Person: \"I heard you went on a run with [friend] over the weekend! How was it?\" Me: \"Uh....good.\" \n\n**Uncomplaint:** Even though I could do without this sudden celebrity, this will all be a net gain if I can get my friend hooked. Before starting to train, my friend swore she'd never want to run more than 5k...but, considering how thrilled she was after our run, I'm hoping that after we finish the actual race (in a few weeks), I can capitalize on her post-race euphoria and convince her to sign up for longer races with me. *scheming face*\n", "edited": 1492096184.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confession:&lt;/strong&gt; I am ridiculously excited to watch Boston this year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complaint:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel really petty complaining about this. Really, this is more of a &amp;quot;this is weird &amp;amp; idk how to deal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I went on a 5k training run with a friend who&amp;#39;s a new runner. This was the first time she ever hit 5k distance, and I was SO excited for her. Afterwards, we met up with a few acquaintances for drinks. My friend announces, &amp;quot;I ran my first 5k!&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s some general congratulations. And my friend adds, &amp;quot;And also, &lt;a href=\"/u/CyanideInParadise\"&gt;/u/CyanideInParadise&lt;/a&gt; ran the 5k with me!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t talk about running much, so no one really knows that I&amp;#39;m a runner. And suddenly I&amp;#39;m getting a flurry of questions and comments about this. &amp;quot;Wow, nice!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How was it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Are you tired?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How are you/your legs feeling now?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;10k anyday now!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;thinking to myself&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Woah, woah...um...this was just a training run, you guys...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how to respond. I&amp;#39;m not fast or competitive, but even so, I&amp;#39;ve been running for years and it is just part of my schedule now, like eating or sleeping. It&amp;#39;s not an &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; in my life unless it&amp;#39;s something like a time/distance PR, or something special like seeing a fantastic sunrise. Even weirder is that, days later, I was still getting occasional comments from other mutual acquaintances and friends. Person: &amp;quot;I heard you went on a run with [friend] over the weekend!
