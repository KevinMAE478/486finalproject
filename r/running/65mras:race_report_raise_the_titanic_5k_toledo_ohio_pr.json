This 5k is on the last Saturday before my first Marathon (Glass City Marathon in Toledo). I have been training since 1/1/17, and while this was supposed to be my last long run (tapered to 12 miles), I have maxed out at 22 miles, and felt that I am ready. I also really love anything related to the Titanic, so I decided to run this race instead. My goal was to PR on my 5k today as I really wanted to push myself. I have been training in sub 50 degree weather, so to be met with 80 degrees and sunny was a little daunting as it was WARM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This race was put on by our local running club in Toledo and was a fairly small event. I&amp;#39;d guess about 200 runners in all. Women and children ran first (a la Titanic rules of the Sea) and got a 3 minute head start. Once I got going, I really wanted to keep my pace under 9:00/mile but not start out too quickly. The course took us along the Maumee River where many historic ships docked for decades. We ran under a local bridge, which was difficult as it was a fairly hilly course (going up and over a fairly large bridge). Running along the river was really nice, and the race was a lot of fun. The overall champion was a 10 year old who finished at 20 minutes! I dogged it the entire time and was exhausted at the end, but I finished under 27:00 for my brand new PR of 26:45 (stopped my watch a few seconds after crossing the finish line).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to see that I, for the first time ever, placed in a race! I placed third in my age group and was awarded a small Titanic stress ball ship for my efforts! I PR&amp;#39;d and finished under 27 minutes!
