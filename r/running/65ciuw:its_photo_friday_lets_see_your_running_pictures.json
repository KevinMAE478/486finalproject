After my post about speed work, I went out and did a fartlek (kinda), maybe more of an interval thing. Did about&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/936666239\"&gt; half mile sprints&lt;/a&gt; interspersed throughout my run. &lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/photos/qcaS4RmygEryXjQB7\"&gt;Snapped this for my wife while I was out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have much else from this week, so enjoy two videos of my cats playing with a new circular ball scratcher thing: &lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/photos/AxogcDumU6FhciQR9\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;  -- &lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/photos/Em1i78Yu9ZEGrS1s5\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dg9ql4g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492232096.0, "created_utc": 1492203296.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ciuw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaigv6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Redkiig", "parent_id": "t3_65ciuw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is why I love running early in the morning.
