Weights are still going up  every trip to the gym but the squats are going to be really hard really soon.

I really wish I'd scheduled better and tried a recovery week next week just before my B-race (still up in the air if I can attend). Personally the lifting got heavy enough at the end of the week I'm not sure this even counts as a recovery week. I'm curious how other runners who lift heavy (whatever that is for them) manage. One other note is that my weight is starting to creep back up (+3.5 lbs over two weeks and I weigh daily so that isn't just a one time fluctuation) and I need to fix that ASAP. Clearly my experiment with eating by feel doesn't work as well as strictly tracking calories on MFP. On the other hand I haven't gone into a run simply ruing the fact that I don't have any energy.

That said other than like 1 R rep I hit all my paces, though the final T rep was hard). Were this not ostensibly a recovery week I would be thrilled with this workout. T paces - 7:01, 7:02, 7:03, 7:07, R paces - 43,44,44,43,46,45,43,43&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Weights&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I doubled down and squatted (5x135,155,175), Romanian Deadlifted 5x135, Deadlifted 5x175 and benched 3x5x95. Weights are still going up  every trip to the gym but the squats are going to be really hard really soon. I&amp;#39;m also wondering if I should be doing something more specific to running.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;7.2E&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;8:46/mile - First three miles the legs were just sore but around mile 5 everything really clicked and I just moved effortlessly (I love that feeling). The wind around here is starting to get to me&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;7.1E&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;8:18/mile ... just put it on cruise control and went through my favorite course. Nice and flat clay trail. It doesn&amp;#39;t get better than this.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Weights**&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Squat (3x5x185 yup, hard), Overhead press 3x5x85, Dumbell Rows (3x5x40), Hamstring Culs 3x5x75, Lunges (1x10x40) -- tried to hit more leg work. Note that I do 5 pistols each non lifting day as part of my general stretching so it&amp;#39;s not like I completely lack leg strength but I was curious what this would do.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5.7E&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;@9:02/mile and frankly it was a struggle to do this. It never got easy and I was glad to be done. The hamstrings in particular were sore.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt; 45.4 miles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One serious Q session + a long run was interesting but left me wanting a little more. I really wish I&amp;#39;d scheduled better and tried a recovery week next week just before my B-race (still up in the air if I can attend). Personally the lifting got heavy enough at the end of the week I&amp;#39;m not sure this even counts as a recovery week. I&amp;#39;m curious how other runners who lift heavy (whatever that is for them) manage. One other note is that my weight is starting to creep back up (+3.5 lbs over two weeks and I weigh daily so that isn&amp;#39;t just a one time fluctuation) and I need to fix that ASAP. Clearly my experiment with eating by feel doesn&amp;#39;t work as well as strictly tracking calories on MFP. On the other hand I haven&amp;#39;t gone into a run simply ruing the fact that I don&amp;#39;t have any energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dgcycja", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423855.0, "created_utc": 1492395055.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qrkb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qrkb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgddpyc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Iunius_Faber", "parent_id": "t1_dgcxoh7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't worry about race pace - a 10k race feels so different from a 10k training run that you'll never believe the times you'll get.\n\nGood luck for the rest of your training!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about race pace - a 10k race feels so different from a 10k training run that you&amp;#39;ll never believe the times you&amp;#39;ll get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck for the rest of your training!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dgddpyc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492457947.0, "created_utc": 1492429147.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcxoh7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Polgara19", "parent_id": "t3_65qrkb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Goal** 10k in May\n\nAfter a down week last week for a sports tournament, things really ramped up this week, and I finally hit 15k in a week!\n\n**Monday** Rest\n\n**Tuesday** 3.7k\n\n**Wednesday** Rest\n\n**Thursday** 5.4k\n\n**Friday**  Rest\n\n**Saturday** 5.9k -thought this was supposed to be a 40 min run, ran 43 min, got home and realized the plan had actually called for a 50 min run.

Work at it slowly (10% rule is solid) and xtrain on the bike as much as you feel comfortable to really build that aerobic engine while (hopefully) remaining injury free. That's the primary driver (as others said keep things easy). At some point add strides 1-2 times per week then eventually some intervals. Do some short for speed, and some longer but a bit slower for strength (these are more important for a half, but if you're new to running so quick short work can reap some immediate improvements). I'd also work up to running 4 or 5 times per week if possible but if you're xtraining it's less important. \n\nThe key thing is that fatigue is good, working your ass off once in a while is good but you cannot do it all the time or you will be injured.

But I got the miles in so I'm satisfied!\n\nSaturday I ran with my friend and her dog. The dog couldve kept up pace easily, but said friend isn't a runner and offered to run with me while I was staying with them! It was enjoyable and I think they're going to run more often! It was more of a run/walk.\n\n\nTraining feels like it's going very well and I can't wait for the mileage to start increasing! 4.5mi next weekend!!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ran the following runs on week 5/30 of Hal Higdon Novice Supreme:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Day&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Mileage&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Time (Min:Sec)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Pace (Min/mile)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Tuesday&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;18:14&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;8:58&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Wednesday&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;26:38&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;8:41&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Thursday&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;19:06&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;9:20&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Saturday&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;37:15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;11:59&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My relaxed pace runs are definitely getting faster without intending to, which is fun, and I&amp;#39;m going to let my comfortable pace settle around 9 min/mile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday and Saturday were odd.
