After reading the wise words of reddit I did part of the C25K program but decided to do a 5k before I had &amp;#39;graduated&amp;#39; - This is actually my 4th 5k to date with my PB being 45:55, hence the goal. I knew I could do better than this and aimed to cut 6 minutes off my time by finishing under 40 minutes. More recently I&amp;#39;ve been doing indoor treadmill intervals as I can monitor pace better on the &amp;#39;mill whilst also practicing running parts of the 5k route as I live nearby. Generally trying to lose weight to help keep me light on my feet. (Currently 118kg down from 125kg, still a long way to go.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sleeping pattern had been completely screwed the night before, waking up at 6pm after staying up all night and going to the gym in the morning. So I stayed up and figured that starting at 9:00am it would basically be like running at 10:00pm if I had woken up at 7:00am and for whatever reason I thought that would be fine! The weather was perfect, cool and cloudy although there was some headwind and I guessed that the weather would get worse rather than better and wore a light windproof jacket. After having a coffee with chocolate protein powder I set off to the start and positioned about 3/4 of the way to the back.\n  The plan was to try and maintain even splits and not start out too fast and have to walk, running for as long and consistently as I can maintain, listening to Strava splits to calculate if I needed to speed up or slow down to meet my 40m goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time I start these races I get caught up in the group and head out too fast, usually around 6:00~ km pace which is too fast for me, this race I actively tried to make even splits to hit under 40m, meaning i&amp;#39;d have to run 8:00km or 12:40~mile pace. As usual I started out a little too fast but I let plenty of people pass me for the first 1k, this felt pretty demotivating, but as the crowds started to thin I saw people start to walk from going too fast and slowly but surely made my move past them. Coming into the 2nd K I noticed a woman wearing black, I knew I was on time for under 40m with a 7:44 km to start and she was a little ahead of me, I made her my pseudo pacer and tried to stick to her. Coming up to my 3rd km and i&amp;#39;ve decided in my head that I was going to run during a full song and then walk the next song, and I could run in walking songs but that was knowing I would have to run the next song regardless. I come around the bend and look into the distance and see someone who looks like my nemesis about 0.5km away and my heart sinks, how could I have let her get so far away?! I refocus and look ahead to see that actually she was more like 150m ahead of me and the other was simply a look alike, &lt;em&gt;phew&lt;/em&gt;.  I decide that I had to run through a rest song to try and overtake her, each step drew me closer and closer until I eventually caught her, seems she had taken me for competition too because as soon as I overtook her she broke into a fast jog and started making ground. I kept heading slow and steady knowing that she couldn&amp;#39;t keep that pace for long, coming up to the 4th km I see her about 100m ahead of me and decide that I&amp;#39;m going to catch her, and when i do i&amp;#39;m not going to let her back past! My next running song comes on and I Want It All by Queen (&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDcoX7s6rE\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDcoX7s6rE&lt;/a&gt;) came on as my strava told me I had 0.6 miles to go and the clock was on 33m. 7 minutes to run a little over half a mile, I knew 40m was a possibility.  I put everything into my stride, she looks over her shoulder to see me coming up behind her and she breaks out into speed once more, this time I don&amp;#39;t let up. We get to the final 400m around the running track to the finish, I pass the only people left between me and her and break into a sprint for the first time since I injured my knee. I hear Strava tick 3 miles and the time is a little over 40:00, annoyed but still determined to try and catch the woman in black. I get close to arms reach distance behind her and she kicks hard and breaks out to the finish, I try to keep up staying on her heels but alas, the victory was hers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humbled in my defeat to the woman, I walked past the finished and took my token to be scanned with my barcode in order to get an official time later (will update when I receive it.) Time on strava came through at 41:53, 4:02 faster than my PB. Happy to finally beat my 5k time that i&amp;#39;d been working hard to crack down, I lay in the sunshine sprawled out in my mixed success. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know i&amp;#39;m a slow runner, and I have a long way to go, but this was the kind of post that I needed to see for encouragement when scrolling through reddit, knowing that there are others that have slower times but that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; make you any less of a runner.
