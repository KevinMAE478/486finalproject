I started running in September, and have seen my 5k PR go from 24:50 to 23:14 to 21:44 to 21:21, breaking sub 20 for the first time in &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/870809652\"&gt;February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did it by building a base of easy running, with usually one day per week of some form of speed workout. In preparation for Pfitz I upped my mileage to 50 for the first time for the last few weeks. I signed up for this 5k last minute mostly just to see where my fitness is at. I haven&amp;#39;t raced in a few months, so I was pretty sure I could get a big PR, especially with the recent increase in mileage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Key Workouts:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/937617830\"&gt;5x1k @ 5k pace&lt;/a&gt;: I suprised myself with my ability to stay around or under 6:00 pace with this one. This was when I really started to think about sub 19 for a goal. Though I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how much the rest intervals would help in terms of being able to hold 6:00 pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/923268058\"&gt;Long Run&lt;/a&gt;: Another thing that I feel really helped my fitness was long weekend tempos like this one. Looking back though I found I probably should have done these slower, as my legs were totally dead for a few days afterwards. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/933308977\"&gt;next one&lt;/a&gt; was a little shorter and easier, and I found it didn&amp;#39;t negatively impact my training as much afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I start Pfitz on Monday, I read his 5k pacing strategy carefully, and tried to follow it to the best of my ability. He says you should go out easier than you think for the first mile, then bump it up to 95% lactic threshold for the last 2. If done correctly, you should come out with near even splits and your best possible time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This course was hilly, and especially at the end was a pretty bad combination of headwind and climbing, so I resigned myself to the fact that this might not be a fast race. I have a faster 5k coming up next month, so this was fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre Race:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The race was small, around 350 people. It&amp;#39;s a booster for a Christian school&amp;#39;s athletics program, and had a LOT of young kids. Based on last year&amp;#39;s winners running the mid 18&amp;#39;s, I figured I had a shot at top 3 overall. The fastest runners there were boys from the high school XC team. I briefly chatted with them and learned that two were shooting for low 18&amp;#39;s, a few for sub 20. One named Jon was going for the win, which would be his 3rd year in a row winning it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were a TON of children in this race, and all of them lined up at the very front, which was frustrating. People kept telling them to move back, but they were pretty stubborn. Not my kids though, so what can you do. The group of XC runners moved some kids out of the way to get to the front, and I tried to tuck in close behind them. Race director counted us down and we were off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mile 1:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yup, I should have been more assertive getting kids out of my way, as there was basically a wall of them that I couldn&amp;#39;t get around for the first 100-200 meters. The XC group had about 50 meters on me as they went out hard and didn&amp;#39;t get blocked. Once I got through the kids, I started reeling in the lead group. I caught up to them at about 1 km, but was cursing myself a little bit for not sticking with Pfitz&amp;#39;s easier first mile, as I had worked pretty hard to catch up. Luckily they settled in at about a 6:05 pace, and I was able to go back to a sustainable pace and hang with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First mile split: 5:56&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mile 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeahhh, the first mile was harder than I wanted it to be, so I already knew the last two miles would be tough, and that I would need to hang in there. A few of the guys who said they were going for sub-20 had dropped off pace, so it was now me and three others in the lead pack. A guy with a white backwards cap, a guy in a red t-shirt, and Jon. This is where it started to get hilly, but I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of hill work, and I had recovered a little bit from tucking in behind them and letting them set the pace, so I was feeling okay. Jon&amp;#39;s breathing started to get really ragged, and he dropped off pace, which really surprised me. A quick glance back showed he wasn&amp;#39;t doing too hot, and was way behind after a few minutes. It was now down to me and two other guys, red t-shirt guy and white cap guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second mile split: 6:00&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mile 3:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty decent mile 2 split for how hard I went out, so I was pleased! Also I knew I was below 19:00 pace, so I was excited about that, and ready to fight hard to keep it. I knew I was going to start feeling it soon, especially with the wind and uphill coming up.  We took the turn in to head back, and sure enough it was pretty tough. My legs felt ok, but my breathing got really ragged here, and I slowed a bit. White hat guy started to open up a pretty sizeable lead, and red T shirt guy gave chase, but we were all three getting farther apart, and we all ended up being relatively alone for the last km. White hat guy in first, red t shirt guy in second a ways, and me in third. Nobody was close behind us, so Jon must have blown up pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third mile split: 6:14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final .1:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My kick was pretty reserved, because I was gassed, and it was uphill into a headwind. I managed to do it in about 6:00 pace. It was pretty painful, but if you don&amp;#39;t finish a 5k feeling like everything&amp;#39;s hurting and you&amp;#39;re dying, then you&amp;#39;re doing it wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I crossed the line in &lt;strong&gt;18:46&lt;/strong&gt;, 3rd overall, 1st age group, and a new 45 second PR. Wow! I knew sub 19 was possible, but to do it on slow course on a windy day just felt great and was super satisfying. White cap guy won with 18:13, red t-shirt guy came second with 18:29.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jon and the other guys came in behind me around the 20 minute mark, and they all seemed pretty disappointed. It was a tough race! A couple guys puked, and Jon later told me he started dry-heaving during that third mile when he dropped off. On a better day he&amp;#39;d beat me any day of the week, so it was maybe a cheap podium finish for me, but I was still glad to get my first overall podium, a medal and a gift card to a pizza place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note: does winning a gift card make me a professional racer now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple things!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) As I mentioned, starting Pfitz&amp;#39;s half plan, which will be super brutal. Mid week endurance runs, long runs ending in LT miles, and 20-minute repeat LT runs. Going to be tough, but I&amp;#39;m excited to see how much more I can improve! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I have a 25k and a half marathon in the fall which are my goal races for the Pfitz cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I need new PR goals now! I love 5k PR day! I&amp;#39;m thinking next I need to get out and conquer a sub-40 10k, which I think I can do. Do you think sub 90 is a good half goal? Also I have a flatter 5k coming up, shooting for 18:30 is reasonable I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Strava Activity&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/943190250/overview\"&gt;https://www.strava.com/activities/943190250/overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Splits&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Mile&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Pace&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5:56&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:14&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:09&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pictures&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZNstxUR.jpg\"&gt;Pre-race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/ZrpvjSE\"&gt;Uphill kick pain face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/zXGwM2V\"&gt;Post-race swag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was generated using &lt;a href=\"https://martellaj.github.io/race-reportr/\"&gt;the new race reportr&lt;/a&gt;, a tool built by &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/bbqlays\"&gt;/u/BBQLays&lt;/a&gt; for making organized, easy-to-read, and beautiful race reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "### Race information\n* **What?** Pi Run 5k\n* **When?** April 15, 2017\n* **How far?** 3.14 miles\n* **Where?** Grand Rapids, MI\n* **Strava activity:** Posted at the end!\n\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | PR (19:31)\n| B | Sub 19:00 | ** \n| C | Top 3 overall\n| D | Even splits\n\n\n### Training\nUp to this point I have been base building in preparation for Pfitz's 12/63 half marathon plan from Faster Road Racing, which I am starting Monday.
