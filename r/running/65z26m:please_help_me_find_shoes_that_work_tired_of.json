I&amp;#39;ve been losing weight, but when I was younger I was at one point pushing a 17 4E. When I first got real running shoes training for my first half marathon a few years ago I went to a chain running store and they had me run on a treadmill and do this and do that to try and find the &amp;quot;perfect fit&amp;quot; and then they just gave me the only 15s they actually had in stock, and told me I wasn&amp;#39;t measuring for a wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to use Asics, can&amp;#39;t remember which, I think gel nimbus. Then I transitioned to Brooks Glycerine, then to Brooks Ghosts and I thought I was in the clear but then once the nail finally came back I destroyed it doing the NYC Half. Since it takes so long to grow back you get some false positives sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my left foot is a 15, my right foot is a 14. Never had an issue with right foot, although have started to have right knee issues. My big toe is also the big toe with my middle toe being the third longest, so it&amp;#39;s not the length of the shoe. I&amp;#39;ve been running in regular width shoes, because aside from the toenail they&amp;#39;ve been working and was afraid going to wides might cause new issues. I went to a high rated running store, the one staffed by serious runners, and they weren&amp;#39;t necessarily sold on the wide idea but told me the 10mm drop is probably too much, causing me to pound away on my forefoot too much. They recommended I try New Balance 1080s, which I purchased in a wide size. I did a test runs and was fine, but popped in my orthotics and went for a 16 mile run over the weekend and they did some serious damage, I got my first ever blister on the TOP of my second toe and my fourth toe is also worse for the ware. The toebox is plenty wide but height-wise it is very constricting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m not even sure what to do at this point. I can&amp;#39;t find a 15 wide thats not a 10mm or 12mm drop, and I&amp;#39;ve heard about altras but the whole 0mm drop scares me a bit. I have a marathon in early June and I&amp;#39;m in crunch time, but if I got the right pair now I could break it in on time. Does anyone have any shoe recommendations? Or any idea about why I keep losing THAT toenail? Does pounding away on the forefront cause of the drop sound right, or would a wide size in a 10mm drop do the trick?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys, I am coming to your for advice in desperation.
