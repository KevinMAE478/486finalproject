Started with the treadmill. Added a 5k that week. And set a short term goal to do a 10k with my gf following the Higdon Novice 1 10k plan. She had other plans and ended the relationship. So I up the goal to do a local half marathon. Mostly because fuck her, but partly to set a different goal from one we shared. So I switched to the Higdon Novice 1 Half Marathon plan at the week with equivalent mileage of the 10k plan we were on. Week 4 if I recall right. I stuck to it strictly, only adjusting the day of the long weekend run to better accommodate my schedule as needed.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This race has a 4 hour limit, which equates to little over 18min/mi. I was deathly afraid the entire training regimen of not being able to finish it in time just due to being new to running. So first goal was set: Just finish the race. Get the medal.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second goal was a stretch goal. I thought it strange to be training for a 13mi run, but the program never prescribed more than 10mi in a run. So I ran the 13.1mi distance the last 2 long runs as test runs. They all ended in beautiful failures approaching 4 hours. I&amp;#39;d make it to 10 or 11 miles, then my calves would start screaming and I&amp;#39;d walk the rest. I guessed if I could run the whole thing, then I could do it in 3hrs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was over a thousand people. Temperatures were a comfortable 45 degrees with no wind and clear skies. Breakfast was a protein bar, 2 cups of coffee, and salt/caffeine pill about 2hrs before the race started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought the best way to ensure finishing the race in time was to join the 15min/mi pace group for as long as I could, and fall back if needed. That was the slowest pace group for the 2016 run.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The week of the race they announced the slowest pace group would be for 13.45min/mi. Upside: I&amp;#39;d make second goal if I could stick with it. Downside: over 1min/mi faster than I had thought. So I adjusted my planning to do this group instead.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No food/gu was taken on the course. I was nervous about adding them since I hadn&amp;#39;t trained with the previously. I took another salt/caffeine pill at miles 5 and 10.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone clusters at the starting line. I find the 3hr group. The gun fires. And we&amp;#39;re off! Walking. I decide I wasn&amp;#39;t going to walk the whole distance and move up to the 245hr pace group that was moving at a very comfortable speed.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything felt really good at that pace:. Legs stayed concersationally comfortable and heart never got out of hand. In fact, we talked the entire race.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About mile 8, I made a bio stop. Waited a few minutes, but was able to catch back up afterwards.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At mile 11, I was still feeling good so I left the group and pushed forward by myself. It was the longest 2mi I&amp;#39;ve ever run! But I did it. Watch time: 2:41:04.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I crossed the finish line and there was an awkward handoff with the medal that forced me to come to an abrupt stop. My knees almost gave out. A lady watching rush to help stand me up and gave me a coupon for a free pair of shoes for the effort!    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The post race celebration was nice. Pizza, cookies, ice cream, bananas, beer, breakfast sandwiches were everywhere. I avoided it all to find my favorite carbonated drink: Cherry Coke Zero.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Took 2 cans back to the car and sat for awhile. Partly reflecting what I had just accomplished. Partly because my legs still weren&amp;#39;t coordinated well enough to drive.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day smoking victory cigars from the comfort of my garage enjoying the nice weather (and not moving).    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I probably could have pushed myself up in the 230hr group. But am very glad to have left the 245hr group when I did and pushed forward by myself. I left everything I had in the last 2mi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m taking a week from running to appreciate sleeping in a bit longer. After that: I&amp;#39;m not really sure.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My next scheduled race is a 10k in the summer. So I need to keep conditioning up for that distance, plus the added Alabama heat. I&amp;#39;m going to keep running, but not really sure which direction to go with it without a dedicated training plan. I found the training plan to be incredibly useful for telling you when to run, and more importantly, when not to.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said: I&amp;#39;m extremely proud of myself for accomplishing this run. A year ago I wouldn&amp;#39;t have thought it possible.
