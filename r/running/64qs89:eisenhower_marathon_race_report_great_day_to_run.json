I find that even if no one reads this, I still want to have this record to look back on later.  So if you can make it all the way to the end\u2026Thank You!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Time on \u201cUncle Pete\u2019s Playhouse\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts after coming off of Pfitz\u2019s 5k training plan last fall: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have a spring marathon picked out (Eisenhower Marathon) where I\u2019m going for a BQ attempt which for me is 3:15.  I ran 3:17 at the last one I raced so I\u2019m planning to training the 3:10 range.  After this last training cycle and the way my GA paces have been dropping, I feel this is in the realm of possibility as long as training goes well.  Added bonus is that I\u2019ve run the Eisenhower Marathon before so I will be familiar with the race and course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to my Pfitz &lt;del&gt;brainwashing&lt;/del&gt; love, I am going to use his 18/70 plan (modified slightly around my schedule).  I have 5 weeks before starting the plan so, as I\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019ve modified the first mesocycle to build up to 60 mpw before starting the plan.  Coincidentally, the last week of the base build is the next AR Super Week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was immediately &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/594rej/5k_race_report_and_pfitzs_5k_training_plan_review/d95mc28/\"&gt;called out&lt;/a&gt; on my 3:10 goal which I fully knew was conservative, but didn\u2019t want to jump the gun too quickly on setting a more concrete goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For my spring 2016 marathon, I followed Pfitz\u2019s 18/55 marathon plan with some extra miles that had me averaging 50 mpw over the cycle, peaking around 62 mpw, and was able to run 3:17.  After a down summer, I started Pfitz\u2019s mid-distance 5k plan for a sub-19 attempt.  I averaged 48 miles over the cycle, peaking at 55 (70 if you consider Super Week), and ran 18:50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mileage from the 5k race to the start of the marathon plan:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;39, 45, 53, 55, 61, 80.7 (Super Week)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid 18/80 plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this cycle, I wanted to bump up the mileage some and began looking at Pfitz\u2019s 18/70 plan as well as the 18/87 plan.  I knew I was going to need to stretch the 18/70 plan to cover running 7 days a week which the 18/87 plan already did/  Also, the biggest addition to the 18/70 plan to get to the 18/87 plan were more recovery miles and more recovery doubles.  In the end I decided, to use the layout of the 18/87 plan as well as the weekend long runs and use the week day runs from the 18/70 plan.  I also needed to trim a few miles here and there (mainly from the mid-week medium-long runs) to fit my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typical schedule was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday:&lt;/em&gt; speed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/em&gt; medium-long&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/em&gt; recovery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday:&lt;/em&gt; general aerobic/medium-long&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday:&lt;/em&gt; recovery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday:&lt;/em&gt; long run&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunday:&lt;/em&gt;  recovery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mantra for this cycle became: Volume over intensity.  I knew this was going to be a big mileage jump.  If I needed to, I would sacrifice some of the speed workouts to be able to keep running the higher mileage.  I did okay with the plan towards the beginning with only the tempo workouts suffering.  I had some rough patches of weather that hit when I was needing to do the longer tempo runs.  I did manage to get in two 5-mile LT runs that went well.  The middle of the plan became a grind as the weekly mileage piled on, but I made it through mostly unscathed.  The VO2 Max workouts were the one part of the plan that really suffered.  Between swapping a tune-up race week and tired legs, I only managed a few interval workouts with the longest being 800m repeats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weekly mileage progression:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;55, 64, 69, 71, 73, 65, 70, 77, 72, 72, 77, 78, 81, 75, 62, 61, 47, 56 (Average = 68)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key runs:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/887574054\"&gt;MP long run \u2013 18 mi w/ 12 mi at MP&lt;/a&gt; - MP splits were 7:00, 6:57, 6:56, 6:59, 6:57, 6:58, 7:00, 7:03, 6:56, 7:01, 7:04 for an average of 6:59.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/881595065\"&gt;VO2 workout \u2013 9 mi w/ 6x800 at 5k&lt;/a&gt; - looking to hit 6:00 pace and the interval paces were 5:53, 5:52, 5:53, 5:46, 5:55, and 5:49 for an average of 5:51.  So a bit faster than planned, but they felt sufficiently hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/844880778\"&gt;Tempo \u2013 10 mi w/ 5 mi at LT&lt;/a&gt; -  I was pretty happy to get a good one in.  It wasn&amp;#39;t easy, but definitely in the required comfortably hard range.  Goal LT pace was 6:40 and I averaged 6:31 with the help of a tail wind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/874528417\"&gt;Medium-long run \u2013 13 mi impromptu progression&lt;/a&gt;.  Ended up being one of my faster ML runs of the cycle.\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/896258968\"&gt;Long run \u2013 20 mi&lt;/a&gt; - Didn&amp;#39;t have a set goal pace.  Just wanted to go out at a comfortable, strong pace and try and run even.  Averaged 7:54 pace for the run which has been my fastest 20 mile run to date according to Smashrun.  Which is funny since that&amp;#39;s a faster overall pace than some of my MP long runs from last cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitness Comparisons:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I love looking at is being able to run at faster pace with equivalent HR as fitness improves.  Here are two separate comparisons of two similar ML runs and two similar tempo runs about 12 months apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/453948870\"&gt;December 21, 2015 \u2013 9 mi w/ 5 at LT, 39 ft change, 147 avg HR, 8:22 avg pace, 32 deg F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/844880778/overview\"&gt;January 26, 2017 \u2013 10 mi w/ 5 at LT, 579 ft change, 151 avg HR, 7:36 avg pace, 24 deg F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/506943305\"&gt;March 2, 2016 \u2013 11 mi, 539 ft change, 140 avg HR, 8:25 avg pace, 33 deg F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/910003835\"&gt;March 22, 2017 \u2013 13 mi, 703 ft change, 138 avg HR, 7:52 avg pace, 35 deg F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitness checks:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/905031135\"&gt;10k tuneup&lt;/a&gt; went extremely well with a 38:54 PR and made feel like my goals were lining up well.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/60gs61/the_weekly_rundown/df684l4/\"&gt;Mini recap here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Race Goal:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I put forth in my 5k write-up, I went into the plan with a 3:10 goal (7-min PR seemed like a good jump).  Training was going well and in my head, I was already thinking of dropping that to 3:05.  After &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5lspmi/ar_january_book_discussion_how_bad_do_you_want_it/dby9ucl/\"&gt;this conversation&lt;/a&gt;  in the book discussion of How Bad Do You Want It? Related to having public vs. private goals, I decided to put the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5myc4g/the_weekly_rundown/dc79nm7/\"&gt;new goal out there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some solid long runs with MP miles, I then began to wonder if I should go a bit faster.  On top of that,several redditors were &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5xttda/the_weekly_rundown/dekrrkn/\"&gt;in support of a sub-3 attempt&lt;/a&gt;.  I mulled it over and thought there could be &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5xzp4n/tuesday_general_question_and_answer/dem9kig/\"&gt;a chance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the week leading up to race the race, I had been getting real nervous about the sub-3 goal.  My legs had been feeling real flat and running seemed to have turned into a chore.  My MP runs had been focused on the 3:05 goal (7-ish pace) and I was getting concerned that trying to throw down 6:50-ish miles was going to be out of reach.  The few miles I did at sub-3 pace didn\u2019t feel extremely hard, but I was worried about not having a true long run MP at the new goal race pace.  During my rehearsal run during race week, I started my 2-mile MP section going for roughly 6:50 pace.  It was a struggle (mostly mentally)!  I just wasn\u2019t feeling it.  I cut it short around 1 mile in and jogged for a bit.  At that point, I decided to stop focusing on the sub-3 goal.  I felt really, really good about the 3:05 goal and felt confident that I should be able to go under that in the right conditions.  Immediately, I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.  I regrouped and then tried to finish out the planned MP miles at 7-ish pace.  It was great.  I seemed to settle into pace easily and felt comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know of lot of this is mental, but I did not want to go into the race dreading it.  I don\u2019t go into races expecting to have fun.  Races aren\u2019t fun.  I race to push myself as much as I can.  But I also didn\u2019t want to psych myself out before I even started.  So the new plan was to go out close to 7:00 pace and play it by ear.  I\u2018d try to push some earlier miles to maybe keep the sub-3 in reach, but not be so crazy that I blow up later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the week things starting to feel a bit better and with some more encouragement, I began to feel better about the sub-3 chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goals heading into race day:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A++ goal: sub-3, A+ goal: sub-3:05, A goal: 3:05, B goal: 3:10, C goal: 3:12-ish (Comfortable BQ)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions from Training Plan:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like most Pfitz plans (and higher mileage plans in general), this was another tough one.  I feel like I handled the mileage increase well and definitely could see improvements to my endurance/stamina in regards to GA/ML/long runs.  I really wish I could have hit the interval workouts as scheduled.  Hopefully, the next time I try a plan with this sort of mileage, my body will adapt a bit quicker to allow for the speed work too.  One trouble I found was that 18 weeks at a large volume really got to be  grind.  I think I came very close to overtraining.  Some days were just a mental struggle to out and get the miles.  I think for my next marathon cycle I may try a 12-week program to help with that.  I certainly needed the 18 weeks in this case to give a gentle build to peak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE:  I wrote all of the above before race day so that the race (good or bad) wouldn&amp;#39;t influence my training writeup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d originally hoped to run the Wicked Marathon (my first marathon) again, but due to a trip that weekend was out.  There were only a handful of other choices that didn\u2019t require extended travel and fit in my time window for favorable weather.  I decided to run the &lt;a href=\"http://eisenhowermarathon.com/\"&gt;Eisenhower Marathon in Abilene, KS&lt;/a&gt;.  I\u2019ve run this marathon &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/540500712/overview\"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; which was a definite plus.  It\u2019s pretty flat (700 ft), 2-loop course which allows for frequent aid stations and has several direction changes which means if the wind is bad, you only have to deal with it for a couple of miles or so.    According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.findmymarathon.com\"&gt;www.findmymarathon.com&lt;/a&gt; (using their criteria), it is the 202nd fastest marathon in the country and the 2nd fastest in KS.  Once you factor in weather for optimal performance, it gives it the 145th fastest in the country and 1st fastest in KS for setting a PR.  In the past 2 years, 15% of runners had qualified for Boston.  All in all, it looks like a good, fast course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The course an out-and-back that is sort of shaped like a T with the start at one end of an arm.  It goes about 2 miles to the base which is a lollipop through a park, then a short arm to the turnaround at 6.55 miles.  You run the lollipop one way for the \u201cout\u201d and the other way for the \u201cback\u201d.  The marathon runs the course twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a small race (136 marathon finishers) although they do have a HM, 10k, and 5k on the same course (676 racers in total).  The marathon and half start 30 minutes before the 5k/10k and the course is such that most of the 5/10k runners will be done (or at least spread out) by the time we\u2019d encounter them again.  Last year\u2019s winning time was 2:42 with the top 5 under 3:00:01.47 (must have sucked for #5!) and the top 10 under 3:10-ish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the race was a little over 2 hours away, I decided to find a place to stay the night before, leave the kids at home with Grandma, and have a nice trip with just my wife and I.  Instead of finding a hotel (and since it was just the two of us instead of all six), I found a bed and breakfast in Abilene, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.abilenesvictorianinn.com/index.html\"&gt;Victorian Inn&lt;/a&gt;.   It was a nice little place with reasonable prices and only about a mile from the start line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We made it there in the afternoon, got settled, and picked up my packet.  We forgoed the pasta dinner, but went to hear the speaker.  She is a Kansas runner who holds the 12 hour state record at 70.5 miles.  She also had run a 24 hour race the weekend before (her first race over 12 hours), ran 122 miles, and was planning on running the marathon the next day.  Dang!  After that, we got dinner at a local restaurant (huge burger for me, beef brisket tacos for my wife) which was awesome.  Back to the B&amp;amp;B to get clothes and gear ready then turned in early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shakeout run that morning left me feeling much more confident in the sub-3 than I had in awhile.  In addition, when we checked in, there was a motivational daily calendar on the desk with this quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. You can&amp;#39;t cross a chasm in two small jumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even more encouragement that a risk may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typical race morning.  Up at 4:30 for breakfast, bathroom, get ready, bathroom, get to race site, bathroom.  You know the drill.  I did a little bit of light jogging and some strides to loosen up.  My legs were feeling pretty good, temps were really cool (around 50), and the wind seemed light.  I was expecting the temp to be low 50s at the start but warming up to low-mid 60s by the end of the race.  There was going to be some wind too (expecting 9-ish mph getting up to 13 mph at the end) which I was hoping would keep things cooler.   The wind was directly out of the south which meant the first 2 miles of each loop would be rough plus a 0.5-mile section later in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with a pace band from &lt;a href=\"http://www.findmymarathon.com\"&gt;www.findmymarathon.com&lt;/a&gt; which is course specific.  It accounts for the elevation when giving the pace split.  I also set it to even effort with a conservative first two miles.  I\u2019ll include these goal splits in after the true splits. for comparisons.  All splits listed are from my watch, which I knew wouldn\u2019t be exact.  Last year, I ran 26.6 miles according to my watch so I knew I didn\u2019t to keep that in my mind while monitoring average pace (i.e. shoot for close to 6:50 pace instead of 6:52 for the 2:59:59).  I also added some [inspiration] on my arm hoping to use it for a morale boost when things got tough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just before the start, we are called to the line.  Based on previous year\u2019s results, I figured I could be in the top 10 so I wanted to be near the front, but not on the front.  Of course, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/lASqw3F.jpg\"&gt;nobody wanted to be on the line&lt;/a&gt; so I got pushed up there knowing people would start passing from the beginning.  Whatever.  Horn sounds and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/CjzBhXU.jpg\"&gt;we\u2019re off&lt;/a&gt;.  Sub-3 attempt is a go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 1-3: 6:56 (7:01), 7:00 (7:01), 6:55 (6:59)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first half mile is a little chaotic as everyone sorts out the pace they want to run.  I am hoping that I can find someone running close to my pace since the marathon and half start at the same time.  I manage to find some people here and there but keep losing contact as they speed up or I do.  I get a little help with the wind because of this but by mile 1.5 or so, I am running alone\u2026.and this stays the same for the rest of the race.  (Yeah, it sucked!)  I bypass the first aid station since it was at mile 1 or so, but grab some water at the next.  My plan was to get something (water or Gatorade) at every aid station, but I had to bypass the next one since it was on the opposite side of the road from the 90 degree turn I was making and no one was there to hand out cups (just sitting on the table.  Great!  I grind up one of the courses few hills and make the turn into the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 4-7: 6:51 (6:47), 6:56 (6:52), 6:50 (7:02), 6:51 (6:51)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The park is nice and flat, shaded, and I am able to hit the aid stations.  The road is a bit windy through here which makes running tangents difficult.  I do the best I can, but as I finish the lollipop loop, I began meeting the runners behind meaning finding a straight path is harder.  Back out of the park and into the wind again.  Still not too bad and I am able to cruise over the rollers to the turn around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turnaround 1: 45:47 (7:00 avg pace)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not too bad, pace-wise.  Lower than needed, but I am consistently lower for each goal split of the pace band.  Time to ratchet things down a bit.  Approaching the turnaround, I was able to see the leaders and determine I\u2019m sitting in 7th place with 5 males and the lead female in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 8-10: 6:41 (6:44), 6:50 (6:48), 6:51 (6:50)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time for the first gel which a sip over the next half mile.  Goes down fine with minimal fuss, just in time to hit the aid station with full water bottles.  Plan is to wash the gel down then use the rest of the water to cool down.  Except that when I call out for a water bottle, the volunteer slowly walks to the table so that by the time I\u2019m there, I\u2019d have to come to a complete stop to even get the bottle.  I blow past him a little pissed and will just have to get something at the next table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 11-13: 6:47 (6:51), 6:44 (6:49), 6:46 (6:50)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much to say here.  I\u2019m feeling strong and liking how my splits are looking.  The wind is at my back and I am just happy not to have to deal with that.  Get to the start/finish, wave to my wife, toss the light gloves as I was not needing them anymore, and head back out for the second loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HM Split: 1:30:47 (6:56 average pace)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had around 13.2 miles by watch which I expected.  There lots of slight curves through the park which make running the tangents hard.  Especially with lots of other runners to dodge.  According to the pace band, goal split for the half was 1:30:12 (6:52 avg pace, so not too far off).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first half felt tough, but controlled.  I had hoped to be under 1:30, but was happy with the shiny new HM PR!  I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to negative split the second half with the upcoming wind, so I knew sub-3 wasn\u2019t in the cards today.  I planned to keep the pace around 7:00, but knew the next couple of miles into the wind would cause those to be a bit slower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mile 14: 6:49 (6:48)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still doing okay, but I hadn\u2019t really hit the headwind yet.  Feeling strong mentally, but I know I need to be careful not to push too hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 15-17: 7:09, 7:18, 7:14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was the wind.  Wow!  It was like getting slapped in the face.  Oh, hey!  There\u2019s the same aid station with no on handing out cups.  Then came that hill again.  I managed to power up it and get into the park, but it was a grind after the wind.  I needed to get some calories so I called for Gatorade at the next aid station, but no one had a Gatorade in their hand.  I knew I couldn\u2019t miss it so I had to come to stop to get the cup.  Once I got going again, I hit the lollipop portion\u2026and got directed the wrong way.  I tried to argue, but they kept pointing the wrong way.  I knew I should have trusted myself, but I listened.  Until I saw the race leader coming towards me on his \u201cout\u201d portion of the loop. I wasn\u2019t far from the split, so I cut the corner to get back on course.  Had my second gel somewhere in here, but can\u2019t ember which mile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note:  I\u2019ve stopped including the paceband goal splits because those went straight out the window after mile 14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 18-20: 7:08, 7:25, 7:27&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those together really drained my momentum.  I turned out of the park, back into the wind which seemed to just drain the life out of me.  The hills that didn\u2019t seem so bad the first time were killing me.  The wheels were getting loose, but I kept thinking if I could just get to the turnaround, I\u2019d have a tailwind the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turnaround 2: 2:19:07 (7:05 avg)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Average pace had slipped considerably, but I could salvage the 3:05 with the help of the tailwind and some controlled pacing.  Nutrition hadn\u2019t been great due fighting the wind and trouble with the aid stations, but I had been grabbing what I could when I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 21-23: 7:14, 7:25, 8:26&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to start trying to get the pace down again but it was getting increasingly more difficult.  I took another salt pill hoping that may help, but I ended up having to take my first walk break toward the end of mile 23.  The wheels had officially come off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles 24-26: 8:28, 9:43, 10:06&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These were agonizing miles.  I\u2019d try to run and get a little ways, then my legs would just quit.  No cramps or pains.  They just didn\u2019t have anything left.  After trying to hold on to the thoughts of achieving some of my goals, it was horrible to watch them trickle through my fingers as I had to keep taking walk breaks which were becoming more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final 0.5 mi: 9:19 pace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After letting all the other goals slip, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could even manage a PR.  I stopped looking at my watch; I just wanted to be finished.  Before the final turn to the finish (3-ish blocks away), I made my last goal of not walking while anyone at the finish line could see me.  Thankfully, I was able to achieve&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/aOlUKng.jpg\"&gt; that goal and manage to salvage a PR of 3:15:51&lt;/a&gt; (7th overall, 5th male, 1st M40-44).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/933752122\"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whew!  What can I say here?  I was crushed.  Five months of training wasted.  At least that was what it felt like.  I am so thankful I had my wife there to be supportive, because I was so drained, mind and body.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After lying on the ground for a bit, I managed to hobble to get some food (pancakes and sausage FTW) and then check on awards.  Since they were starting with the HM awards (ladies first), I decided to book it back to the B&amp;amp;B so I could a hot shower.  It felt so good\u2026although I did find some chafed spots I didn\u2019t realize.  Luckily my feet came out relatively unscathed, just a blister on the side of the ball of my foot.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We made it back just in time for me to get my &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GOTNXIJ.jpg\"&gt;age group award&lt;/a&gt; (presented by Eisenhower\u2019s granddaughter which was neat) and then head home.  The girls were apparently eager for us to get back as they had planned a party for me compete with balloons, posters, and cookies.  Cookies are always appreciated.  They know me well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take-Aways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I go out too fast?.......probably, but through the first half I was still feeling strong&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could I have held on if the weather had been better?...probably, though pace would have slipped a little more&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of things came together in a bad way:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the first mile or so, I ran this race alone.  There was just no one close to my pace to work with.  Not a fun experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nutrition definitely suffered.  My plan going in was 3 gels and alternating Gatorade and water at the aid stations.  This did not happen.  The heat made the thought of stomaching a 3rd gel impossible.  In addition, I missed 4-5 aid stations because the volunteers just weren\u2019t prepared.  Two of the stations had cups out on the table, but no volunteers handing them out, plus it was on the opposite side of the road from the turn I needed to make.  Two or three of the stations either didn\u2019t have what I called for ready and in hand by the time I hit the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked the weather data later and saw that the wind ended up being worse than I expected.  Temps for the first half was 56-57 F and 60-64 F for the second.  Winds at the start were around 14 mph, but during the second half, they picked up to 15-16 mph with 24 mph gusts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weather ended up affecting a lot of people.  During the second loop, I ended up passing two guys that were ahead of me for the entire first half.  Both were walking.  They never passed me back, although I was passed by another male and one woman.  I checked the splits of the two guys I passed and their last quarter of the race was as painful as mine.  Even the winner had a worse day than planned (albeit he paced himself well).  When I spoke to him before the race, he said his goal was in the 2:30\u2019s (can\u2019t remember now if he said 2:30 or just in the 2:30\u2019s)....he won in 2:44. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m feeling pretty good, all things considered; definitely better than after the last marathon I raced.  The 3-mi recovery I did the day after the race sucked at first but I eventually got loosened up. I ran 6 miles the next day which was a little more painful due to the DOMS, but again, loosened up towards the end and had the last 2 miles at an easy pace.  No real issues besides general muscle soreness.  One calf is a bit tight, but it\u2019s the one I\u2019ve had issues with for awhile now, so nothing out of the ordinary.  The blister on my foot is a bit tender, but should heal just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u2019s Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A nice couple of weeks of recovery then into training for the next race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a 6-hour race in about 7 weeks on a flat, 5k loop.  I\u2019m planning to ease off the pace on my long runs and get some more back-to-back runs in.  My \u201cA\u201d goal is 40 miles with a \u201cB\u201d goal of beating the course record, 35.96 miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after that is a local track meet that\u2019s held every year.  We\u2019ve taken our girls for the past 2 years, and while it is geared more towards the youth, it is an all-ages meet.  I\u2019m planning on running the 1600 again and want to incorporate some Daniels\u2019 R-paced workouts during the 6-week ultra buildup to give me some leg speed for the track race.  I set my PR of 5:49 at the meet last year, 2 weeks after running a 24-hour race.  I\u2019m hoping this last marathon cycle and some speed rep training will help better that by a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I plan to take it a bit easy over the summer then start a half marathon plan for a late fall race.  Once that\u2019s done, I\u2019ll start looking to tackle the marathon distance again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well\u2026looks like I didn\u2019t have it in me this time to make it in one jump this time.  Looking back afterwards, I\u2019m glad I missed my goal by as much as I did, as weird as that sounds.  I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to BQ.  But if I had just squeaked in, I know I would not have been happy with that result.  I know I had a better race in me that day.  I know I have a better one in me still.  It\u2019s time to dust myself off and get back to training.  The one thing I\u2019m sure of \u2026I left everything I had, physically and mentally, on the course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I will apologize in advance for the length of this, like I usually do, but I like including as much as I can remember about the training and the race.  I find that even if no one reads this, I still want to have this record to look back on later.  So if you can make it all the way to the end\u2026Thank You!\n\n**Last Time on \u201cUncle Pete\u2019s Playhouse\u201d**\n\nHere are my thoughts after coming off of Pfitz\u2019s 5k training plan last fall: \n\n&gt; I have a spring marathon picked out (Eisenhower Marathon) where I\u2019m going for a BQ attempt which for me is 3:15.  I ran 3:17 at the last one I raced so I\u2019m planning to training the 3:10 range.  After this last training cycle and the way my GA paces have been dropping, I feel this is in the realm of possibility as long as training goes well.  Added bonus is that I\u2019ve run the Eisenhower Marathon before so I will be familiar with the race and course. \n\n&gt; Due to my Pfitz ~~brainwashing~~ love, I am going to use his 18/70 plan (modified slightly around my schedule).  I have 5 weeks before starting the plan so, as I\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019ve modified the first mesocycle to build up to 60 mpw before starting the plan.  Coincidentally, the last week of the base build is the next AR Super Week.\n\nI was immediately [called out]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/594rej/5k_race_report_and_pfitzs_5k_training_plan_review/d95mc28/) on my 3:10 goal which I fully knew was conservative, but didn\u2019t want to jump the gun too quickly on setting a more concrete goal.\n______\n**Background**\n\nFor my spring 2016 marathon, I followed Pfitz\u2019s 18/55 marathon plan with some extra miles that had me averaging 50 mpw over the cycle, peaking around 62 mpw, and was able to run 3:17.  After a down summer, I started Pfitz\u2019s mid-distance 5k plan for a sub-19 attempt.  I averaged 48 miles over the cycle, peaking at 55 (70 if you consider Super Week), and ran 18:50.\n\n*Mileage from the 5k race to the start of the marathon plan:*\n\n*39, 45, 53, 55, 61, 80.7 (Super Week)*\n___\n**Hybrid 18/80 plan**\n\nFor this cycle, I wanted to bump up the mileage some and began looking at Pfitz\u2019s 18/70 plan as well as the 18/87 plan.  I knew I was going to need to stretch the 18/70 plan to cover running 7 days a week which the 18/87 plan already did/  Also, the biggest addition to the 18/70 plan to get to the 18/87 plan were more recovery miles and more recovery doubles.  In the end I decided, to use the layout of the 18/87 plan as well as the weekend long runs and use the week day runs from the 18/70 plan.  I also needed to trim a few miles here and there (mainly from the mid-week medium-long runs) to fit my schedule.\n\nTypical schedule was:\n\n*Monday:* speed\n\n*Tuesday:* medium-long\n\n*Wednesday:* recovery\n\n*Thursday:* general aerobic/medium-long\n\n*Friday:* recovery\n\n*Saturday:* long run\n\n*Sunday:*  recovery\n\nMy mantra for this cycle became: Volume over intensity.  I knew this was going to be a big mileage jump.  If I needed to, I would sacrifice some of the speed workouts to be able to keep running the higher mileage.  I did okay with the plan towards the beginning with only the tempo workouts suffering.  I had some rough patches of weather that hit when I was needing to do the longer tempo runs.  I did manage to get in two 5-mile LT runs that went well.  The middle of the plan became a grind as the weekly mileage piled on, but I made it through mostly unscathed.  The VO2 Max workouts were the one part of the plan that really suffered.  Between swapping a tune-up race week and tired legs, I only managed a few interval workouts with the longest being 800m repeats.\n\n*Weekly mileage progression:*  \n\n55, 64, 69, 71, 73, 65, 70, 77, 72, 72, 77, 78, 81, 75, 62, 61, 47, 56 (Average = 68)\n\n*Key runs:*\n\n[MP long run \u2013 18 mi w/ 12 mi at MP](https://www.strava.com/activities/887574054) - MP splits were 7:00, 6:57, 6:56, 6:59, 6:57, 6:58, 7:00, 7:03, 6:56, 7:01, 7:04 for an average of 6:59.  \n\n[VO2 workout \u2013 9 mi w/ 6x800 at 5k]( https://www.strava.com/activities/881595065) - looking to hit 6:00 pace and the interval paces were 5:53, 5:52, 5:53, 5:46, 5:55, and 5:49 for an average of 5:51.  So a bit faster than planned, but they felt sufficiently hard.\n\n[Tempo \u2013 10 mi w/ 5 mi at LT](https://www.strava.com/activities/844880778) -  I was pretty happy to get a good one in.  It wasn't easy, but definitely in the required comfortably hard range.  Goal LT pace was 6:40 and I averaged 6:31 with the help of a tail wind.\n\n[Medium-long run \u2013 13 mi impromptu progression]( https://www.strava.com/activities/874528417).  Ended up being one of my faster ML runs of the cycle.\n[Long run \u2013 20 mi](https://www.strava.com/activities/896258968) - Didn't have a set goal pace.  Just wanted to go out at a comfortable, strong pace and try and run even.  Averaged 7:54 pace for the run which has been my fastest 20 mile run to date according to Smashrun.  Which is funny since that's a faster overall pace than some of my MP long runs from last cycle.\n\n*Fitness Comparisons:*\n\nOne thing I love looking at is being able to run at faster pace with equivalent HR as fitness improves.  Here are two separate comparisons of two similar ML runs and two similar tempo runs about 12 months apart.\n\n[December 21, 2015 \u2013 9 mi w/ 5 at LT, 39 ft change, 147 avg HR, 8:22 avg pace, 32 deg F]( https://www.strava.com/activities/453948870)\n\n[January 26, 2017 \u2013 10 mi w/ 5 at LT, 579 ft change, 151 avg HR, 7:36 avg pace, 24 deg F]( https://www.strava.com/activities/844880778/overview)\n\n[March 2, 2016 \u2013 11 mi, 539 ft change, 140 avg HR, 8:25 avg pace, 33 deg F]( https://www.strava.com/activities/506943305)\n\n[March 22, 2017 \u2013 13 mi, 703 ft change, 138 avg HR, 7:52 avg pace, 35 deg F]( https://www.strava.com/activities/910003835)\n\n\n*Fitness checks:*\n\nA [10k tuneup]( https://www.strava.com/activities/905031135) went extremely well with a 38:54 PR and made feel like my goals were lining up well.  [Mini recap here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/60gs61/the_weekly_rundown/df684l4/)\n___\n\n*Race Goal:*\n\nLike I put forth in my 5k write-up, I went into the plan with a 3:10 goal (7-min PR seemed like a good jump).  Training was going well and in my head, I was already thinking of dropping that to 3:05.  After [this conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5lspmi/ar_january_book_discussion_how_bad_do_you_want_it/dby9ucl/)  in the book discussion of How Bad Do You Want It? Related to having public vs. private goals, I decided to put the [new goal out there]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5myc4g/the_weekly_rundown/dc79nm7/).\n\nAfter some solid long runs with MP miles, I then began to wonder if I should go a bit faster.  On top of that,several redditors were [in support of a sub-3 attempt]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5xttda/the_weekly_rundown/dekrrkn/).  I mulled it over and thought there could be [a chance](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5xzp4n/tuesday_general_question_and_answer/dem9kig/).\n\nIn the week leading up to race the race, I had been getting real nervous about the sub-3 goal.  My legs had been feeling real flat and running seemed to have turned into a chore.  My MP runs had been focused on the 3:05 goal (7-ish pace) and I was getting concerned that trying to throw down 6:50-ish miles was going to be out of reach.  The few miles I did at sub-3 pace didn\u2019t feel extremely hard, but I was worried about not having a true long run MP at the new goal race pace.  During my rehearsal run during race week, I started my 2-mile MP section going for roughly 6:50 pace.  It was a struggle (mostly mentally)!  I just wasn\u2019t feeling it.  I cut it short around 1 mile in and jogged for a bit.  At that point, I decided to stop focusing on the sub-3 goal.  I felt really, really good about the 3:05 goal and felt confident that I should be able to go under that in the right conditions.  Immediately, I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.  I regrouped and then tried to finish out the planned MP miles at 7-ish pace.  It was great.  I seemed to settle into pace easily and felt comfortable with it.\n\nI know of lot of this is mental, but I did not want to go into the race dreading it.  I don\u2019t go into races expecting to have fun.  Races aren\u2019t fun.  I race to push myself as much as I can.  But I also didn\u2019t want to psych myself out before I even started.  So the new plan was to go out close to 7:00 pace and play it by ear.  I\u2018d try to push some earlier miles to maybe keep the sub-3 in reach, but not be so crazy that I blow up later.\n\nTowards the end of the week things starting to feel a bit better and with some more encouragement, I began to feel better about the sub-3 chance.\n\n*Goals heading into race day:*\n\nA++ goal: sub-3, A+ goal: sub-3:05, A goal: 3:05, B goal: 3:10, C goal: 3:12-ish (Comfortable BQ)\n___\n\n*Conclusions from Training Plan:*\n\nLike most Pfitz plans (and higher mileage plans in general), this was another tough one.  I feel like I handled the mileage increase well and definitely could see improvements to my endurance/stamina in regards to GA/ML/long runs.  I really wish I could have hit the interval workouts as scheduled.  Hopefully, the next time I try a plan with this sort of mileage, my body will adapt a bit quicker to allow for the speed work too.  One trouble I found was that 18 weeks at a large volume really got to be  grind.  I think I came very close to overtraining.  Some days were just a mental struggle to out and get the miles.  I think for my next marathon cycle I may try a 12-week program to help with that.  I certainly needed the 18 weeks in this case to give a gentle build to peak.\n\n*NOTE:  I wrote all of the above before race day so that the race (good or bad) wouldn't influence my training writeup.*\n\n___\n**Race Choice**\n\nI\u2019d originally hoped to run the Wicked Marathon (my first marathon) again, but due to a trip that weekend was out.  There were only a handful of other choices that didn\u2019t require extended travel and fit in my time window for favorable weather.  I decided to run the [Eisenhower Marathon in Abilene, KS]( http://eisenhowermarathon.com/).  I\u2019ve run this marathon [before]( https://www.strava.com/activities/540500712/overview) which was a definite plus.  It\u2019s pretty flat (700 ft), 2-loop course which allows for frequent aid stations and has several direction changes which means if the wind is bad, you only have to deal with it for a couple of miles or so.    According to www.findmymarathon.com (using their criteria), it is the 202nd fastest marathon in the country and the 2nd fastest in KS.  Once you factor in weather for optimal performance, it gives it the 145th fastest in the country and 1st fastest in KS for setting a PR.  In the past 2 years, 15% of runners had qualified for Boston.  All in all, it looks like a good, fast course.\n\nThe course an out-and-back that is sort of shaped like a T with the start at one end of an arm.  It goes about 2 miles to the base which is a lollipop through a park, then a short arm to the turnaround at 6.55 miles.  You run the lollipop one way for the \u201cout\u201d and the other way for the \u201cback\u201d.  The marathon runs the course twice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small race (136 marathon finishers) although they do have a HM, 10k, and 5k on the same course (676 racers in total).  The marathon and half start 30 minutes before the 5k/10k and the course is such that most of the 5/10k runners will be done (or at least spread out) by the time we\u2019d encounter them again.  Last year\u2019s winning time was 2:42 with the top 5 under 3:00:01.47 (must have sucked for #5!) and the top 10 under 3:10-ish.\n___\n**Pre-Race**\n\nSince the race was a little over 2 hours away, I decided to find a place to stay the night before, leave the kids at home with Grandma, and have a nice trip with just my wife and I.  Instead of finding a hotel (and since it was just the two of us instead of all six), I found a bed and breakfast in Abilene, the [Victorian Inn]( http://www.abilenesvictorianinn.com/index.html).   It was a nice little place with reasonable prices and only about a mile from the start line.\n\nWe made it there in the afternoon, got settled, and picked up my packet.  We forgoed the pasta dinner, but went to hear the speaker.  She is a Kansas runner who holds the 12 hour state record at 70.5 miles.  She also had run a 24 hour race the weekend before (her first race over 12 hours), ran 122 miles, and was planning on running the marathon the next day.  Dang!  After that, we got dinner at a local restaurant (huge burger for me, beef brisket tacos for my wife) which was awesome.  Back to the B&amp;B to get clothes and gear ready then turned in early.\n\nThe shakeout run that morning left me feeling much more confident in the sub-3 than I had in awhile.  In addition, when we checked in, there was a motivational daily calendar on the desk with this quote:\n\n&gt; Don't be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. You can't cross a chasm in two small jumps.\n\nEven more encouragement that a risk may be warranted.\n___\n\n**Race Day**\n\nTypical race morning.  Up at 4:30 for breakfast, bathroom, get ready, bathroom, get to race site, bathroom.  You know the drill.  I did a little bit of light jogging and some strides to loosen up.  My legs were feeling pretty good, temps were really cool (around 50), and the wind seemed light.  I was expecting the temp to be low 50s at the start but warming up to low-mid 60s by the end of the race.  There was going to be some wind too (expecting 9-ish mph getting up to 13 mph at the end) which I was hoping would keep things cooler.   The wind was directly out of the south which meant the first 2 miles of each loop would be rough plus a 0.5-mile section later in the loop.\n\nI decided to go with a pace band from www.findmymarathon.com which is course specific.  It accounts for the elevation when giving the pace split.  I also set it to even effort with a conservative first two miles.  I\u2019ll include these goal splits in after the true splits. for comparisons.  All splits listed are from my watch, which I knew wouldn\u2019t be exact.  Last year, I ran 26.6 miles according to my watch so I knew I didn\u2019t to keep that in my mind while monitoring average pace (i.e. shoot for close to 6:50 pace instead of 6:52 for the 2:59:59).  I also added some [inspiration] on my arm hoping to use it for a morale boost when things got tough.\n\nJust before the start, we are called to the line.  Based on previous year\u2019s results, I figured I could be in the top 10 so I wanted to be near the front, but not on the front.  Of course, [nobody wanted to be on the line]( http://i.imgur.com/lASqw3F.jpg) so I got pushed up there knowing people would start passing from the beginning.  Whatever.  Horn sounds and [we\u2019re off]( http://i.imgur.com/CjzBhXU.jpg).  Sub-3 attempt is a go!\n\n*Miles 1-3: 6:56 (7:01), 7:00 (7:01), 6:55 (6:59)*\n\nThe first half mile is a little chaotic as everyone sorts out the pace they want to run.  I am hoping that I can find someone running close to my pace since the marathon and half start at the same time.  I manage to find some people here and there but keep losing contact as they speed up or I do.  I get a little help with the wind because of this but by mile 1.5 or so, I am running alone\u2026.and this stays the same for the rest of the race.  (Yeah, it sucked!)  I bypass the first aid station since it was at mile 1 or so, but grab some water at the next.  My plan was to get something (water or Gatorade) at every aid station, but I had to bypass the next one since it was on the opposite side of the road from the 90 degree turn I was making and no one was there to hand out cups (just sitting on the table.  Great!  I grind up one of the courses few hills and make the turn into the park.\n\n*Miles 4-7: 6:51 (6:47), 6:56 (6:52), 6:50 (7:02), 6:51 (6:51)*\n\nThe park is nice and flat, shaded, and I am able to hit the aid stations.  The road is a bit windy through here which makes running tangents difficult.  I do the best I can, but as I finish the lollipop loop, I began meeting the runners behind meaning finding a straight path is harder.  Back out of the park and into the wind again.  Still not too bad and I am able to cruise over the rollers to the turn around. \n\n*Turnaround 1: 45:47 (7:00 avg pace)*\n\nNot too bad, pace-wise.  Lower than needed, but I am consistently lower for each goal split of the pace band.  Time to ratchet things down a bit.  Approaching the turnaround, I was able to see the leaders and determine I\u2019m sitting in 7th place with 5 males and the lead female in front of me.\n\n*Miles 8-10: 6:41 (6:44), 6:50 (6:48), 6:51 (6:50)*\n\nTime for the first gel which a sip over the next half mile.  Goes down fine with minimal fuss, just in time to hit the aid station with full water bottles.  Plan is to wash the gel down then use the rest of the water to cool down.  Except that when I call out for a water bottle, the volunteer slowly walks to the table so that by the time I\u2019m there, I\u2019d have to come to a complete stop to even get the bottle.  I blow past him a little pissed and will just have to get something at the next table.\n\n*Miles 11-13: 6:47 (6:51), 6:44 (6:49), 6:46 (6:50)*\n\nNot much to say here.  I\u2019m feeling strong and liking how my splits are looking.  The wind is at my back and I am just happy not to have to deal with that.  Get to the start/finish, wave to my wife, toss the light gloves as I was not needing them anymore, and head back out for the second loop.\n\n*HM Split: 1:30:47 (6:56 average pace)*\n\nI had around 13.2 miles by watch which I expected.  There lots of slight curves through the park which make running the tangents hard.  Especially with lots of other runners to dodge.  According to the pace band, goal split for the half was 1:30:12 (6:52 avg pace, so not too far off).\n\nThe first half felt tough, but controlled.  I had hoped to be under 1:30, but was happy with the shiny new HM PR!  I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to negative split the second half with the upcoming wind, so I knew sub-3 wasn\u2019t in the cards today.  I planned to keep the pace around 7:00, but knew the next couple of miles into the wind would cause those to be a bit slower.\n\n*Mile 14: 6:49 (6:48)*\n\nStill doing okay, but I hadn\u2019t really hit the headwind yet.  Feeling strong mentally, but I know I need to be careful not to push too hard.\n\n*Miles 15-17: 7:09, 7:18, 7:14*\n\nAnd there was the wind.  Wow!  It was like getting slapped in the face.  Oh, hey!  There\u2019s the same aid station with no on handing out cups.  Then came that hill again.  I managed to power up it and get into the park, but it was a grind after the wind.  I needed to get some calories so I called for Gatorade at the next aid station, but no one had a Gatorade in their hand.  I knew I couldn\u2019t miss it so I had to come to stop to get the cup.  Once I got going again, I hit the lollipop portion\u2026and got directed the wrong way.  I tried to argue, but they kept pointing the wrong way.  I knew I should have trusted myself, but I listened.  Until I saw the race leader coming towards me on his \u201cout\u201d portion of the loop. I wasn\u2019t far from the split, so I cut the corner to get back on course.  Had my second gel somewhere in here, but can\u2019t ember which mile.\n\nNote:  I\u2019ve stopped including the paceband goal splits because those went straight out the window after mile 14.\n\n*Miles 18-20: 7:08, 7:25, 7:27*\n\nAll of those together really drained my momentum.  I turned out of the park, back into the wind which seemed to just drain the life out of me.  The hills that didn\u2019t seem so bad the first time were killing me.  The wheels were getting loose, but I kept thinking if I could just get to the turnaround, I\u2019d have a tailwind the rest of the way.\n\n*Turnaround 2: 2:19:07 (7:05 avg)*\n\nAverage pace had slipped considerably, but I could salvage the 3:05 with the help of the tailwind and some controlled pacing.  Nutrition hadn\u2019t been great due fighting the wind and trouble with the aid stations, but I had been grabbing what I could when I could.\n\n*Miles 21-23: 7:14, 7:25, 8:26*\n\nI was able to start trying to get the pace down again but it was getting increasingly more difficult.  I took another salt pill hoping that may help, but I ended up having to take my first walk break toward the end of mile 23.  The wheels had officially come off.\n\n*Miles 24-26: 8:28, 9:43, 10:06*\n\nThese were agonizing miles.  I\u2019d try to run and get a little ways, then my legs would just quit.  No cramps or pains.  They just didn\u2019t have anything left.  After trying to hold on to the thoughts of achieving some of my goals, it was horrible to watch them trickle through my fingers as I had to keep taking walk breaks which were becoming more frequent.\n\n*Final 0.5 mi: 9:19 pace*\n\nAfter letting all the other goals slip, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could even manage a PR.  I stopped looking at my watch; I just wanted to be finished.  Before the final turn to the finish (3-ish blocks away), I made my last goal of not walking while anyone at the finish line could see me.  Thankfully, I was able to achieve[ that goal and manage to salvage a PR of 3:15:51]( http://i.imgur.com/aOlUKng.jpg) (7th overall, 5th male, 1st M40-44).\n\n[Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/933752122)\n____\n\n**Post-race**\n\nWhew!  What can I say here?  I was crushed.  Five months of training wasted.  At least that was what it felt like.  I am so thankful I had my wife there to be supportive, because I was so drained, mind and body.  \n\nAfter lying on the ground for a bit, I managed to hobble to get some food (pancakes and sausage FTW) and then check on awards.  Since they were starting with the HM awards (ladies first), I decided to book it back to the B&amp;B so I could a hot shower.  It felt so good\u2026although I did find some chafed spots I didn\u2019t realize.  Luckily my feet came out relatively unscathed, just a blister on the side of the ball of my foot.  \n\nWe made it back just in time for me to get my [age group award]( http://i.imgur.com/GOTNXIJ.jpg) (presented by Eisenhower\u2019s granddaughter which was neat) and then head home.  The girls were apparently eager for us to get back as they had planned a party for me compete with balloons, posters, and cookies.  Cookies are always appreciated.  They know me well.\n____\n**Take-Aways**\n\nDid I go out too fast?.......probably, but through the first half I was still feeling strong\n\nCould I have held on if the weather had been better?...probably, though pace would have slipped a little more\n\nLots of things came together in a bad way:\n\nAfter the first mile or so, I ran this race alone.  There was just no one close to my pace to work with.  Not a fun experience.\n\nNutrition definitely suffered.  My plan going in was 3 gels and alternating Gatorade and water at the aid stations.  This did not happen.  The heat made the thought of stomaching a 3rd gel impossible.  In addition, I missed 4-5 aid stations because the volunteers just weren\u2019t prepared.  Two of the stations had cups out on the table, but no volunteers handing them out, plus it was on the opposite side of the road from the turn I needed to make.  Two or three of the stations either didn\u2019t have what I called for ready and in hand by the time I hit the table.\n\nI checked the weather data later and saw that the wind ended up being worse than I expected.  Temps for the first half was 56-57 F and 60-64 F for the second.  Winds at the start were around 14 mph, but during the second half, they picked up to 15-16 mph with 24 mph gusts.\n\nThe weather ended up affecting a lot of people.  During the second loop, I ended up passing two guys that were ahead of me for the entire first half.  Both were walking.  They never passed me back, although I was passed by another male and one woman.  I checked the splits of the two guys I passed and their last quarter of the race was as painful as mine.  Even the winner had a worse day than planned (albeit he paced himself well).  When I spoke to him before the race, he said his goal was in the 2:30\u2019s (can\u2019t remember now if he said 2:30 or just in the 2:30\u2019s)....he won in 2:44. \n\nI\u2019m feeling pretty good, all things considered; definitely better than after the last marathon I raced.  The 3-mi recovery I did the day after the race sucked at first but I eventually got loosened up. I ran 6 miles the next day which was a little more painful due to the DOMS, but again, loosened up towards the end and had the last 2 miles at an easy pace.  No real issues besides general muscle soreness.  One calf is a bit tight, but it\u2019s the one I\u2019ve had issues with for awhile now, so nothing out of the ordinary.  The blister on my foot is a bit tender, but should heal just fine.\n____\n**What\u2019s Next?**\n\nA nice couple of weeks of recovery then into training for the next race.\n\nI have a 6-hour race in about 7 weeks on a flat, 5k loop.  I\u2019m planning to ease off the pace on my long runs and get some more back-to-back runs in.  My \u201cA\u201d goal is 40 miles with a \u201cB\u201d goal of beating the course record, 35.96 miles.\n\nTwo weeks after that is a local track meet that\u2019s held every year.  We\u2019ve taken our girls for the past 2 years, and while it is geared more towards the youth, it is an all-ages meet.  I\u2019m planning on running the 1600 again and want to incorporate some Daniels\u2019 R-paced workouts during the 6-week ultra buildup to give me some leg speed for the track race.  I set my PR of 5:49 at the meet last year, 2 weeks after running a 24-hour race.  I\u2019m hoping this last marathon cycle and some speed rep training will help better that by a bit.\n\nAfter that, I plan to take it a bit easy over the summer then start a half marathon plan for a late fall race.  Once that\u2019s done, I\u2019ll start looking to tackle the marathon distance again.\n____\n**Final thoughts**\n\nWell\u2026looks like I didn\u2019t have it in me this time to make it in one jump this time.  Looking back afterwards, I\u2019m glad I missed my goal by as much as I did, as weird as that sounds.  I *really* wanted to BQ.  But if I had just squeaked in, I know I would not have been happy with that result.  I know I had a better race in me that day.  I know I have a better one in me still.  It\u2019s time to dust myself off and get back to training.  The one thing I\u2019m sure of \u2026I left everything I had, physically and mentally, on the course.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "id": "64qs89", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 90, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brwalkernc", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64qs89", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.running", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "edited": 1491918386.0, "link_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/64qs89/eisenhower_marathon_race_report_great_day_to_run/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945893.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/64qs89/eisenhower_marathon_race_report_great_day_to_run/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Eisenhower Marathon Race Report \u2013 Great Day to run a Half PR, Too Bad I was Doing the Marathon", "created_utc": 1491917093.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 32, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 90}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qs89", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qs89", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qs89", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4a3di", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YourShoesUntied", "parent_id": "t1_dg49mjd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey I'm reading through my report now.
