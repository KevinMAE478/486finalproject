I haven&amp;#39;t even been able to hit Runnit just to browse. But here we go, finally some time to reflect and write at the same time :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my first &amp;#39;Just Marathon&amp;#39;, or first &amp;#39;Non-Triathlon Marathon&amp;#39;, however you&amp;#39;d like to say it. The run of my Ironman was something over 5 hours, so it&amp;#39;s nice to have a &amp;#39;marathon&amp;#39; time that I can tell people without having to &amp;#39;splain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Race information&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What?

I generally tolerate intensity well, and I simply did not have the ability to run 6 days a week given those other training and job issues. Suffered a very minor calf tweak back in Feb, but that lasted all of a week. Developed some very minor plantar fajitas towards the end of training, but it never seemed to affect my running--it only affected my limping around afterwards. I mostly hit my training goals, with the occasional long run around weeks 8-10 being maybe 5 to 10 sec/mile off of my target paces. That&amp;#39;s what made me think that maybe I&amp;#39;d just shot for a bit too fast of a pace to start with. But I stuck with my original goal pace, which was 8:15s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Race strategy&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I&amp;#39;d have limited ability to really be warm to start the race, so I planned on hitting 8:30s for the first 4 miles, and then come down to my 8:15 pace, with the idea of dipping below a little bit when I felt good to make up for those first miles. I also knew the course would be hilly, hillier than I was able to train for in particular. So I planned to let myself ease up on the uphills and then take what the downhills gave me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a solid nutrition/hydration plan as well--my old-people drink for breakfast (Boost, the breakfast of, well, me on race day), and a combo of Cliff Shots and whatever course energy drink + water. I&amp;#39;m fairly skilled at cup-crushing to drink on the run, so I didn&amp;#39;t bother with a hydration belt or stopping to walk at aid stations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stayed with a friend&amp;#39;s parents Friday and Saturday night. He was also running the race, and his parents are fantastic people and wonderful hosts. Also discovered that his dad and my dad served on the same ship in the Navy way back when (10 years apart), so that was cool. Drove the course on Saturday, did packet pickup, all went well. I know &amp;#39;carb loading&amp;#39; the night before doesn&amp;#39;t do anything to get you glycogen, but I like my pre-race traditions. For me, it&amp;#39;s some wine and some sort of pasta in clam sauce. Luckily, there&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;The Hill&amp;#39; in St. Louis, where I think literally there&amp;#39;s an Italian restaurant every 50 feet. Got my clam pasta...although, thanks I think to American preferences, there were more clams and mushrooms than pasta. I left quite a bit of the clam/mushroom mix in the bowl at the end, in fact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slept really well, actually. I had one of those nights where I would wake up and think &amp;quot;Man, it&amp;#39;s gotta be time to get up now...ooh! 12:30! Back to sleep!&amp;quot; By the time 4:30 rolled around, I was up and dressed and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only drawback was pre-race GI stuff...could not get anything evacuatory to happen at the house. Typically that&amp;#39;s not a problem race morning, so I was concerned. We had to leave to get there in time, and I was more than a bit worried on the way over. We parked, walked towards the start, and I got into a porta-potty line...and blessed hallelujah, everything turned out okay :) Hit the corral area feeling good, optimistic. Put on my headphones for some pre-race psyching up, and got in a little warm-up easy loping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also managed to quite easily find the three other people I knew who were running the race, so that was cool. One was running the half, the other two were corralled behind me, but I found them and shared good lucks. Two of my favorite training songs came on right before the race, so I went into it feeling good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mile 1-4&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan was to go under pace for these miles, and it wasn&amp;#39;t very hard. I was worried about going out too hard, but there were two bridges over the Mississippi in these miles, which helped me ease back on the throttle. This is also where we first encountered the wind. I had tried to be optimistic about it, talking about directions and coinciding with downhills and stuff. But it was a factor for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ran over the river into &lt;a href=\"https://file.ejatlas.org/docs/Common_looking_building.jpg\"&gt;East St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; juuuuust long enough to realize that we really didn&amp;#39;t want to be running there, and turned back across the river. Pacing was good here. Started getting upset at the runners ducking of the street to pee in the open beside buildings...then realized that half of the buildings they were peeing beside were literally burned-out. Heard one guy say to guy running next to him &amp;quot;Does anyone live here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back across the river. Feeling good. Got a few comments on my calf graffiti: &amp;quot;Shut Up Legs&amp;quot; (a cycling thing, but it, as it turns out, was fitting)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mile 5-10&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A chocolate company handing out chocolates at mile 6...strange. Big snowcap sort of chocolates. I assumed it was more for the back half of the race, many of the thousands who were doing the half as more of a fun time thing (no judging here, just sayin). Mile 6 marker was a full .22 miles off the mark. Ran through the Budwater Brewery--I mean, not through the brewery with the tanks and the horses and the guys with the big beards who seem to work in every brewery, but through the campus between the buildings. It was here where I saw my first instance of a runner pull out his phone to call a friend as I was passing him. &amp;quot;Hey...yeah, I&amp;#39;m about 6 miles through! Just going through the brewery!&amp;quot; I would later see at least two more people pull out their phones to take video selfies mid-stride. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mile 10 marker was spot-on, so I stopped worrying about that issue. The Half People split off (well, they were actual whole people, but you know what I mean), and suddenly there were a lot fewer people to watch, use as rabbits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mile 11-18&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still feeling really good through this part. Some long downhills and uphills, but my pacing was very steady and on-target. I was a little higher than the 8:15 pace, more like 8:20, but I was okay with that. High fiving kids, thanking all the excellent volunteers who cheered us on--the volunteers were stellar for this race, not just saying that. Only minor complaint was one station whose gatorade was about triple strength--had a small coughing fit there after chugging it down in one gulp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around mile 18, the sun came out. Before that, it was completely overcast, with a significant south wind. Now it was sunny and starting to heat up quickly, with the same significant wind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I felt like I was hitting my energy and hydration marks well, so I was confident. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mile 19-21&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where things slipped just a bit. Came out of a loop through a park--saw my fast buddy again, he was looking great. Also saw my other friend corralled behind me, he was smiling and looking good too. But my own pacing started to slip. I went from thinking 8:30s was possible to thinking 8:40s would be more realistic. And then the cramping started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a right leg cramp that made me start walking stretches in my Ironman--I&amp;#39;d managed to run (not fast, but run) 16 miles of that race before I had to start walk/running, and it was a high calf cramp then. Here it started with quad and hammy. Hip flexors were tight and sore just from a long time of not going through a big range of motion, but stopping briefly to put them through some range-of-motion, I discovered the other cramps. I have a thing called &amp;#39;theater seat syndrome&amp;#39;--if my knees and hips stay in one position (straight or bent, doesn&amp;#39;t matter) for a long time, say an hour or so, they get sore. That happens to me on long runs too, but usually stopping just to get a few high-knees in fixes that. And it did, but it also sent shocks of pain through the rest of my legs, particularly my right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if it was hydration or something else. Going both by volume I was drinking and by feel (I only neglected to drink something at maybe two aid stations the whole race), I wouldn&amp;#39;t have said I was dehydrated. But it was warming up too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mile 22-25&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where the wheels came off, at least as far as my pacing goals went. I stopped at one corner to high-knee again, and my right leg muscles, &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of them, locked up so painfully I just about fell over onto two pre-teen volunteers standing by the curb. Water started going over the head here as well, which helped. I also did about three 30-pace fast-walk segments that I followed by faster running to try to get myself kicked back into gear. A lot of right leg pain here. Lefty came back in line, at least as fast as muscle cramping goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around mile 23 or so, we reached the end of the uphills, and had a lot of significant downhills towards the finish line. That&amp;#39;s where I added some ankle pain to the mix :/ My left ankle, I just noticed at one point, was hurting, right around the top of the back of the shoe. That&amp;#39;s a new thing for me, and I suspect it was the cumulative downhills that I was using to regain time throughout the race. I monitored the achilles pain, and came to the judgment that it wasn&amp;#39;t slowing me down, it just hurt. Cause I&amp;#39;m stubborn to the point of being stupid like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I passed a guy standing on the sidewalk that I play volleyball with up in Iowa where I live. Just odd. I also started leapfrogging with another runner, and at least found some humor in speeding up as I ran past the photographers (I wanted that &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/CFcOiN5.jpg\"&gt;sweet sweet hover shot&lt;/a&gt;, you know). And, wouldn&amp;#39;t you know it, one of those times I finally convinced myself to stay at that sped up pace, or near it, heading towards the end. But don&amp;#39;t let the picture fool you, I was in quite a bit of pain at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No joke at all, there were about 3 times where, for maybe 200 yards or more, I was running with my eyes completely closed. Surreal. I could have slowed down and made things easier, but...it&amp;#39;s a race and stuff, and I don&amp;#39;t like letting pace goals go easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mile 25-26.2&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was bummed that my pacing goals had slipped away, and I was now gritting my teeth to try to break 3:50--a full 10 minutes off of where I had hoped to be. I managed to find a kick, and managed to break that D-level goal at least. I even had enough speed to be able to get a &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/488oPgL.jpg\"&gt;hover picture crossing the finish line&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily my suffering face is angry-face, so my suffering pics don&amp;#39;t look too awful usually. I was in a world of hurt there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost fell right over just from sheer leg pain after the finish. My fast buddy found me, said something like &amp;quot;do you feel as well as you looked coming in there?&amp;quot; I said something while being doubled over from leg pain--and in fact my being doubled over led to a medic coming over to check on me. I told him I felt perfectly fine from the waist up, which honestly was true. My HR was flat as a pancake for the whole race, 154 or so, and I had energy to spare. My left leg had come back around, and it was really just my one leg. I think the combo of wind, hills I wasn&amp;#39;t trained for, and late-race heat was what did it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Finish Line&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had to ask a volunteer for a bottle of water--usually they are shoving one in your hand. Odd. Got my medal, got a &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/sV7IzRN.jpg\"&gt;medal picture that reflects how happy I was to be both done with the race and done with marathon training for a while&lt;/a&gt;. Then went through the line of tents offering--fruit cups, potato chips, toasted ravioli, frozen custard sandwiches, pretzels, etc...and &lt;strong&gt;no more opportunity to get water without walking back to the finish line&lt;/strong&gt;. Spent a nice 20 minutes in the massage tent--no massage, I got strapped into the leg compression pneumatic booties and more or less took a nap. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made the ascent up the ramp towards the Arch and the race party--passing some people who had established a base camp halfway up where they could pause before summitting. Still looking for water at this point. Came across some tents that charities had set up--Girls on the Run, Someone Doing Something To Fight Cancer, etc. The Cancer tent had several cases of bottled water sitting there untouched. I said &amp;quot;Hey, could I beg one of those bottles of water off you?&amp;quot; Woman says &amp;quot;Well...I can give you one if you make a donation.&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;???&lt;/strong&gt; Says I &amp;quot;I have no money on me at all...I just ran a marathon.&amp;quot; Says she &amp;quot;Oh...sorry.&amp;quot; So, the charity would only sell me water. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued to the party, turned in my bib-coupon for a free Michelin Ultra or whatever passed for beer. Met up again with my fast buddy--he not only grabbed a podium spot in his AG, he also came in three minutes under BQ time. So here&amp;#39;s hoping for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered that, while I hit none of my pacing goals, I was in the top 1/4 of my AG. Low 20&amp;#39;s place out of high 90s runners. So that made me start to feel a little better--I think the course got more people than just me. My fast buddy had some cramping too, and said that everyone he talked to said they had dealt with cramps at some point during the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my ankle, after all that downhill charging, has what I have been told is a &amp;#39;boggy edema&amp;#39;. Sounds like a zydeco song, but means that my achilles is swollen and hurts. Luckily, I have a 60 mile gravel bike race coming up in two weeks, so I have turned my attention to getting my butt back on my bike, and can give my ankle, and that nagging PF, some time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m feeling okay about my performance. It&amp;#39;s funny, I went into it with pacing goals and absolutely no placing goals. But my AG placement makes me feel pretty good. And I&amp;#39;ve literally only run that distance once before this race, in my Ironman, so now I know more of what to expect for me. I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how  to tackle the cramping issue, because I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what caused it. Could be that more long slow miles would help, just a stab in the dark. But I don&amp;#39;t know that I&amp;#39;ll be able to do 6 days a week of running any more later than I could this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a marathon already paid for in October in Des Moines. What will be interesting is that I am also hoping to race a Half-Iron in September, so I don&amp;#39;t know yet what my training should or will look like. However...that race may not happen, and if not I think I&amp;#39;ll look for a different Half-Iron in August. And I suspect I&amp;#39;ll just do my Half-Iron training and extend my long runs longer. The triathlete&amp;#39;s training for single-sport racing is always interesting :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Des Moines is flatter, I think. And it&amp;#39;s late season, so I&amp;#39;ll be going from heat training to colder racing. I&amp;#39;m pretty optimistic at the moment that I can at least PR there, given that I was so far off a pace that I do think, sans wind/heat/cramping, I could have hit on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my first Just Marathon. Thanks for reading, and for the comments of support from people over the months leading up to it :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Life decided to demand that I actually do stuff following my race this last Sunday--stuff I'd been putting off leading up to the race.

Water started going over the head here as well, which helped. I also did about three 30-pace fast-walk segments that I followed by faster running to try to get myself kicked back into gear. A lot of right leg pain here. Lefty came back in line, at least as fast as muscle cramping goes.\n\nAround mile 23 or so, we reached the end of the uphills, and had a lot of significant downhills towards the finish line. That's where I added some ankle pain to the mix :/ My left ankle, I just noticed at one point, was hurting, right around the top of the back of the shoe. That's a new thing for me, and I suspect it was the cumulative downhills that I was using to regain time throughout the race. I monitored the achilles pain, and came to the judgment that it wasn't slowing me down, it just hurt. Cause I'm stubborn to the point of being stupid like that.\n\nAt this point I passed a guy standing on the sidewalk that I play volleyball with up in Iowa where I live. Just odd. I also started leapfrogging with another runner, and at least found some humor in speeding up as I ran past the photographers (I wanted that [sweet sweet hover shot](http://i.imgur.com/CFcOiN5.jpg), you know). And, wouldn't you know it, one of those times I finally convinced myself to stay at that sped up pace, or near it, heading towards the end. But don't let the picture fool you, I was in quite a bit of pain at that point.\n\nNo joke at all, there were about 3 times where, for maybe 200 yards or more, I was running with my eyes completely closed. Surreal. I could have slowed down and made things easier, but...it's a race and stuff, and I don't like letting pace goals go easy.\n\n#Mile 25-26.2\nI was bummed that my pacing goals had slipped away, and I was now gritting my teeth to try to break 3:50--a full 10 minutes off of where I had hoped to be. I managed to find a kick, and managed to break that D-level goal at least. I even had enough speed to be able to get a [hover picture crossing the finish line](http://i.imgur.com/488oPgL.jpg). Luckily my suffering face is angry-face, so my suffering pics don't look too awful usually. I was in a world of hurt there.\n\nI almost fell right over just from sheer leg pain after the finish. My fast buddy found me, said something like \"do you feel as well as you looked coming in there?\" I said something while being doubled over from leg pain--and in fact my being doubled over led to a medic coming over to check on me. I told him I felt perfectly fine from the waist up, which honestly was true. My HR was flat as a pancake for the whole race, 154 or so, and I had energy to spare. My left leg had come back around, and it was really just my one leg. I think the combo of wind, hills I wasn't trained for, and late-race heat was what did it. \n\n#Finish Line\nHad to ask a volunteer for a bottle of water--usually they are shoving one in your hand. Odd. Got my medal, got a [medal picture that reflects how happy I was to be both done with the race and done with marathon training for a while](http://i.imgur.com/sV7IzRN.jpg). Then went through the line of tents offering--fruit cups, potato chips, toasted ravioli, frozen custard sandwiches, pretzels, etc...and **no more opportunity to get water without walking back to the finish line**. Spent a nice 20 minutes in the massage tent--no massage, I got strapped into the leg compression pneumatic booties and more or less took a nap. Amazing.\n\nMade the ascent up the ramp towards the Arch and the race party--passing some people who had established a base camp halfway up where they could pause before summitting. Still looking for water at this point. Came across some tents that charities had set up--Girls on the Run, Someone Doing Something To Fight Cancer, etc. The Cancer tent had several cases of bottled water sitting there untouched. I said \"Hey, could I beg one of those bottles of water off you?\" Woman says \"Well...I can give you one if you make a donation.\" **???** Says I \"I have no money on me at all...I just ran a marathon.\" Says she \"Oh...sorry.\" So, the charity would only sell me water. Awesome.\n\nContinued to the party, turned in my bib-coupon for a free Michelin Ultra or whatever passed for beer. Met up again with my fast buddy--he not only grabbed a podium spot in his AG, he also came in three minutes under BQ time. So here's hoping for that.\n\nI discovered that, while I hit none of my pacing goals, I was in the top 1/4 of my AG. Low 20's place out of high 90s runners. So that made me start to feel a little better--I think the course got more people than just me. My fast buddy had some cramping too, and said that everyone he talked to said they had dealt with cramps at some point during the race.\n\n#Aftermath\nSo my ankle, after all that downhill charging, has what I have been told is a 'boggy edema'. Sounds like a zydeco song, but means that my achilles is swollen and hurts. Luckily, I have a 60 mile gravel bike race coming up in two weeks, so I have turned my attention to getting my butt back on my bike, and can give my ankle, and that nagging PF, some time to recover.\n\n#What's next?\nI'm feeling okay about my performance. It's funny, I went into it with pacing goals and absolutely no placing goals. But my AG placement makes me feel pretty good. And I've literally only run that distance once before this race, in my Ironman, so now I know more of what to expect for me. I don't know exactly how  to tackle the cramping issue, because I don't know exactly what caused it. Could be that more long slow miles would help, just a stab in the dark. But I don't know that I'll be able to do 6 days a week of running any more later than I could this time.\n\nI have a marathon already paid for in October in Des Moines. What will be interesting is that I am also hoping to race a Half-Iron in September, so I don't know yet what my training should or will look like. However...that race may not happen, and if not I think I'll look for a different Half-Iron in August. And I suspect I'll just do my Half-Iron training and extend my long runs longer. The triathlete's training for single-sport racing is always interesting :)\n\nDes Moines is flatter, I think. And it's late season, so I'll be going from heat training to colder racing. I'm pretty optimistic at the moment that I can at least PR there, given that I was so far off a pace that I do think, sans wind/heat/cramping, I could have hit on Sunday. \n\nSo that's my first Just Marathon.
