So we had our home invitational today, and I ran the 4x800 and 1600m. The temperature was a bit hot for what I&amp;#39;m used to at this time of the year, around 70-75 degrees (it was 40 last weekend and 55ish at our Tuesday meet). We had done a workout on Thursday, 200,300,400,600m ladder (up and down @5:08 pace). At the end of March I ran a solo 5:13 1600m time trial, then a 5:14 meet in cold weather, then 5:15 meet in good conditions, all on the following Saturdays. Got enough rest, took an ice bath the night before, and came to the meet feeling alright. Warmed up, felt okay, got into the race and my legs were instantly dreading it. The 4x800 actually barely pushed out a PR at a  2:14-15 split (went out at a 64 against two state champs who decided to run second leg, didn&amp;#39;t mean to go that fast), but my legs felt it and arms were out of it. Then came the mile, and it was a bit warmer outside with about 12mph winds around the final turn and on the home stretch. I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling great, but decided that I wanted to break my PR and possibly go sub-5 as I had been hoping to do in the early/mid season. I got into the race, felt like I wasn&amp;#39;t pushing myself very much, and our first lap was a high 1:13, not bad. Got around the second lap, the pack I was with was full of really fast guys who were taking it easy, mid 1:18. Third lap started feeling it a little bit but I fell back as the fast guys started pushing their pace, mid 1:19. Final lap, I was alone chasing the guy in front of me, was 3 seconds away. low 1:19. I felt it was a really crappy race for me as I had been running similar times all season so far, and everyone else had been PRing and doing very well at this meet. I ran about two seconds faster in ideal conditions last Tuesday. Diet may not have been great but that usually doesn&amp;#39;t effect me, the sun made me kind of tired. Feeling okay now but still disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Splits: \n1:13.7\n1:18.2\n1:19.3\n1:19.2\nFinal: 5:10.8&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First time doing a race report, apologies if I forget anything.\n\nA bit of an intro, I've been running since middle school and my PRs from last year are 2:18 (800m) 5:06 (1600m) 11:35 (5k XC split) 18:18(5k XC).
