He&amp;#39;d buy two pre-ride, cut them into quarters, and eat them as he went along. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a history of pretty nasty cramps, so I decided to try McD&amp;#39;s during long runs. ...except that McDonald&amp;#39;s doesn&amp;#39;t start selling cheeseburgers until midday and we&amp;#39;re usually running by then. Ray A. Croc up to his usual tricks. What a jerk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got Bacon Egg &amp;amp; Cheese sammies instead and ate them on runs over 15mi. Worked great.

So, the day after our long runs (we did 18, 20, 22, 20 18) we followed them up with 10milers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was training for marathon/ironman I only ever did one 20 miler, so this was a lot of running, but then again, an ultra is a lot of running. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least, it&amp;#39;s meant to be. I walked a lot. My wife tore down the trail like the gazelle that she is. She didn&amp;#39;t even stop at the aid stations.

They did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Race&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have done a lot of running, biking, outdoor events of all stripes, and I have to say about Yamacraw that it is exceedingly well run. I&amp;#39;ve never finished an event before and felt like I knew the organizer personally. Brian Gajus was at the finish line all day congratulating finishers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen a race director care that much before.

The 50K group does a lollipop to add some distance to what the 20K people do, but for the most part, every step you run is new scenery to you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the scenery is crazy good. There aren&amp;#39;t a ton of vistas, but you run through all manner of amazing rock formations that are absolutely gorgeous. You&amp;#39;re also on singletrack or ancient fire roads most of the time. There is one gravel road section with a serious climb that does not want to end, but it&amp;#39;s not easy to put together 50K of backcountry on the east coast without a gravel road connection or two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Finish&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Runners finish at the end of a long covered bridge that traverses a gorge. The bridge is in all the marketing materials and is a pretty cool way to end a run. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had massive leg cramps most of the day, starting around 10mi. I drank all the water I planned to drink, ate pickles, tried Endurolytes, still cramps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the race I was shambling along at a terribly slow pace. Every step I was thinking &amp;quot;bridge,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bridge,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bridge.&amp;quot; I passed a sign that said 2mi to go, so I knew I was close. I began to see bridges everywhere. Is that a bridge? Nope, that&amp;#39;s a rock. Is that a bridge? No, that&amp;#39;s my hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized the bridge wouldn&amp;#39;t be the first thing I saw at the end. The first thing I&amp;#39;d see would be someone who had already finished, then run backwards along the course to gloat and/or incorrectly report distance to the end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally the bridge hove into view. I couldn&amp;#39;t wait to make the last turn onto the bridge, run down its length, and then collapse &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lady stood nearby. She&amp;#39;d obviously finished her run already and was walking backwards along the course. &amp;quot;TAKE A RIGHT ON THE BRIDGE,&amp;quot; she said. Oy. My whole world is bridge, lady. You think I don&amp;#39;t want to- ...nevermind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get grumpy when my blood sugar is low. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife finished in just over 7 hours and I finished just north of 9.
