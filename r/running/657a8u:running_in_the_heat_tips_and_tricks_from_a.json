Well I&amp;#39;m your guy. I&amp;#39;ve lived in Dallas for 30 years and I&amp;#39;ve spent almost all of that training in some capacity in the heat and just generally living in the outdoors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First tip and this is a big one. &lt;strong&gt;Hydrate. Hydrate. Hydrate.&lt;/strong&gt; It is not good enough to just grab a quick sip of water before you run out the door. You need to hydrate all day before you run and the days before you run. Then Take something with you run distance dependent of course and keep going. When you get back Hydrate again. Your boss or teacher should think you&amp;#39;re a slacker for having to go to the bathroom so much. Now would be the time to take a drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go out slower. You&amp;#39;re not going to be in the same conditions as in the cooler temps so start out slower. That first mile may need to drop pace as you get used to getting in the heat from the AC and the cool temps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headwear: A Visor is my personal favorite and Headsweats is a great brand and the only one I use. I like that the top of my head can breathe and the sweat and sun stay out of my eyes. I have recently purchased a Headsweats hat and I am starting to like it, but we&amp;#39;ll see when the real heat comes. Buffs are also a great option as you can wet them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neck wear- Wet down a bandana or buff with ice and throw it around your neck before you go out and keep you cool early on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunblock- Don&amp;#39;t forget your sun block. Cancer sucks so just do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes time. Some of us have had our whole lives to get used to this stuff and are just better naturally at it. Take it slow, start working on some taper weeks or some lower mileage rest weeks while you get used to it. You&amp;#39;re likely not going to do a lot of PRing in the extreme heat early on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrate- Yes it&amp;#39;s that important. pick up the water bottle/glass and take a drink again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements- I personally don&amp;#39;t use a lot of them like salt tabs or electrolyte tabs, but I have used NUUN and it&amp;#39;s ok, Gatorade is honestly just as good in my opinion. If you&amp;#39;re a major distance runner you probably didn&amp;#39;t need this post anyway.

Know where you can find shade. Shade can seriously save a run and sometimes maybe even your life (a little dramatic, but the heat doesn&amp;#39;t play around). I try to find a point where I can run in the shade somewhere near the middle of my run. I have a small patch of trail that is fully covered, take some water here and slow the pace down and enjoy it. If you need to walk it, walk it. Use it smartly and as long as you need to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks again &lt;a href=\"/u/yourshoesuntied\"&gt;/u/yourshoesuntied&lt;/a&gt; for this point on transition from heat to cool. I don&amp;#39;t think about it since it&amp;#39;s never happened to me. &amp;quot;One thing not mentioned that effects me a LOT when running in the heat is the immediate transition from being hot outside to walking directly into a cold house/office or sitting down into a cold vehicle that has the AC cranked up. Most people this is not a problem but those sensitive to the heat (like me) experience black outs due to the drastic temp change. I&amp;#39;ve learned after waking up numerous times on the floor that it&amp;#39;s very very important to stay outside and cool down in the shade before heading into a cold house/car. Just a forewarning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in All have fun and be safe. Heat does weird things to people and it&amp;#39;s important to make sure people know your route, know where your shade points are.
