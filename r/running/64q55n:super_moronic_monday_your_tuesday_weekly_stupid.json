If you&amp;#39;re anything like me you don&amp;#39;t need an app that does this.\nI run with my phone in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01H0GN3YG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1\"&gt;little running pouch&lt;/a&gt; and can easily check it if I need to. But most apps can be set to give you an update every x km or x minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I LOVE the Nike Run Club app. Apparently a lot of people on reddit really dislike it, but the coaching features are so good for me as a beginner and super motivating for me, not to say completely FREE.
