I&amp;#39;ve been working on coming back for an awful knee injury, and while I have been training exceptionally hard, I had no idea where my fitness was with running/swimming, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I ran the most tactical race possible since there was a lot of wind and I was able to work myself into 3rd overall for a smaller, local 5k. Super, super happy with my result and progress. I&amp;#39;m going to keep training as hard as possible for the next 6 weeks and see where that gets me. Back to 2-3x per days for the next few months to prep for my August challenge!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dg5wbbe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034586.0, "created_utc": 1492005786.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg57", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg57", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ud01", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pzinha", "parent_id": "t1_dg5vex6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is indeed a good chain of achievements!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is indeed a good chain of achievements!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dg6ud01", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492072330.0, "created_utc": 1492043530.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg57", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69nua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mattack73", "parent_id": "t1_dg5vex6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Amazing!!!!
