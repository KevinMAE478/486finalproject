I am 32year old male, newbie runner for the last 5 months into this thing and I finally &amp;quot;splurged&amp;quot; on a FR230. I was able to borrow a friend&amp;#39;s HRM4 and during my run today found that I may be training too hard. During my 45minute run today I spent the first third at 150-155, the second third over 160 and the final third of my run in the high 160s and touched 170. I felt fine and not overworked at all. Since I am assuming I am working harder than I should/need to, what is the heart rate range I should be in for these &amp;quot;low and slow&amp;quot; runs? What threshold before I am no longer training in the &amp;quot;low and slow&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dg60i2b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039444.0, "created_utc": 1492010644.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xpif", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xpif", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8gjtj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yavin_17", "parent_id": "t1_dg5z1uj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had something similar and went to see a PT.

For marathon distance, high sugar is good and high fiber is probably bad. Regular candy works great and is a lot cheaper than running food, and the main difference is just that the running food has added electrolytes that regular gummy bears or whatever don&amp;#39;t have. If you&amp;#39;re running in the heat and find you need electrolytes, you can buy a big jar of S caps pretty cheap if you shop around. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "running", "name": "t1_dg61m5c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040668.0, "created_utc": 1492011868.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5z1af", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "driving2012", "parent_id": "t3_64xpif", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hello.
