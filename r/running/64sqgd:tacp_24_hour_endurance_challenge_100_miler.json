Usually chalked full of helpful tips, data points and summarized bits. For those of you new to my reports. I like to tell more of a long drawn out story. I throw it all together and just let it happen. I miss important things sometimes. I focus on the mundane often. I do this not to bore those reading this. I ultimately will compile all my race reports one day and while it&amp;#39;s not important right now. Some of this stuff will be helpful for me in the future so bare with me if it gets crazy and rambles like usual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Event &amp;amp; Build Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The TACP 24 Hour Challenge is held at one of the most weird times. Noon Thursday to Noon Friday. This has significant meaning to the group of military men and women who put on the event to raise funds for fallen members of their team. The local news station did a brief &lt;a href=\"http://www.wthitv.com/story/35038203/24-hour-run-challenge-for-soldiers\"&gt;segment&lt;/a&gt; that covers some of the details I&amp;#39;m leaving out. I intentionally avoided/declined interviews because I couldn&amp;#39;t bare to make a fool of myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matters even more unique the race is held on a 1 mile paved loop that is in the shape of the state of &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/922926586\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;(My Strava of first 30 miles). Due to the odd starting time and that it wasn&amp;#39;t widely announced, the turn out was not massive but that didn&amp;#39;t stop runners from taking the challenge. Little did they know what they were in for after my training partner and fellow ultra runner got in on helping organize the event. The previous year saw a couple of runners put in 30-40 miles in the 24 hour period. This year it was to be a whole other game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 29 years old, this was my last shot at getting in a 100 mile run before I turned 30 on Sunday, days after the race. A devastating let down at my November 100 set me back mentally all winter and I was chomping at the bit to finish what I had started. I was convinced to run this event and due to it&amp;#39;s timing decided it was worth the cause. There&amp;#39;s a small group of local ultra runners that live in our city and nearly all of them showed up in support. Most of them not having a lot of time to dedicate due to having to work Thursday and Friday couldn&amp;#39;t run more than a few hours. I on the other hand was dead set on lasting the full 24 hours and beyond. I needed to hit 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, my goal was 100 miles. Being that the course wouldn&amp;#39;t close, I told everyone that no matter what, if I wasn&amp;#39;t at 100 miles by the time the race was over, I was staying and finishing what I started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Participants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being small, there weren&amp;#39;t many people who registered for the full 24 hours. I&amp;#39;d guess there were about 50 or so people who paid the registration fee to run for much less time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 24 hours, the local military base would have guys running a loop almost in a casual relay fashion. At any given time there would be a couple members cruising along completing their laps. There were occasional family members and friends and local runners participating to show their support as well though nothing super competitive. The path was also open to the public so there were plenty of people walking about trying to figure out what the hell was going on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are only 4 notable people in this story when it comes to the 24 hour event. From left to right: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/1f305\"&gt;Brad, Curt, Mary, YourShoesUntied!&lt;/a&gt; They said they wanted a pic of &amp;quot;The Legends&amp;quot;. I had no business being in the shot but they wouldn&amp;#39;t let me pass. They laughed at my joke for saying I didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be in the pic but I was actually being serious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting with Mary, she&amp;#39;s my training partner and good friend. Her goal was to last the full 24 hours and get in 100 miles. Ultras are nothing new to her and she&amp;#39;s finished a couple of 100&amp;#39;s herself so it&amp;#39;s totally within her abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was Curt who showed up to see what he could do but he had to pace himself because he also had a marathon the morning after the race finished and didn&amp;#39;t want to be too exhausted. I didn&amp;#39;t know much about Curt but from what I&amp;#39;m told he&amp;#39;s done some pretty cool things  when it comes to ultra distance running. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was me, shooting for triple digits. Experienced 50k and 50 miler finally on a course where everything was in my favor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there was Brad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I found out about Brad attending I got nervous. Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by the Gandalf beard or the head full of white/grey hair, when you see him and know who he is, you&amp;#39;re looking at a true legend of ultra running. Prior research on Brad left me envious and very very very intimidated. Without going into much detail, he&amp;#39;s finished Vol State (314 mile race in the heat of July) &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt; and unaided/solo, totally alone. He&amp;#39;s ran the infamous Barkley. He&amp;#39;s also the National Record Holder for his age division in &lt;strong&gt;6 day racing events&lt;/strong&gt;! Yeah, not 24 hours...144 hour races! May I add that that 144 hour record was done on a 1 KILOMETER paved loop!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I watched his every move like a hawk. Mimicking what he did to the best of my abilities in an effort to learn from the best. I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said that I didn&amp;#39;t step my game up to try to impress him either. I&amp;#39;m sure he wasn&amp;#39;t that moved by my efforts after all of his years of ultra running but dammit I just wanted to be noticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along for the ride and right by my side was LadyShoes and Lil&amp;#39;Shoes who crewed for me nearly the whole time. Though Lil&amp;#39;Shoes did get to go to the grandparents house that night while I continued running. She enjoyed the nearly unlimited amount of time on the iPad while sitting in our vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also popping in and out were good friends of mine who had showed up to help pace me or run some miles for the event...or both. Two of which would play a crucial role in my success at the finish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Weather.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh god the weather!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This race was by far the most insane event I&amp;#39;ve been a part of when it came to the forecast. In the span of 24 hours, it went from sunny and 70, to black clouds, lightning, thunder, hail, tornado warnings, to fog, to chilly Fall-esque morning. A lot of people just couldn&amp;#39;t hack it. High winds forced a lot of folks to pack up and leave early because their tents/canopies weren&amp;#39;t designed for those conditions and collapsing. Needless to say, with as much rain as we got, we also got to witness one of the largest most vibrant rainbows I&amp;#39;d ever seen. It was so breath taking that nearly every runner stopped at one point or another to just look at it. The pics taken do zero justice in how beautiful it was. &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/tc9TcqB\"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/AY6s3r4\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from snow and triple digit temps, we covered just about every aspect of mid-west weather.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Race.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re getting bullet points here. This is to touch on the more memorable things because I&amp;#39;m sure most of you already scrolled through, saw how long it was, saw the pics, looked at my finish time and called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:30 am - 11:59 am, people begin to stir around the &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Rfj1O\"&gt;timing tent&lt;/a&gt; which will be home base for the many members of the local military base who came out to run laps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:00 Noon - Race begins! Sunny and 70&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:45 pm (~4 miles), I make the first pit stop by my Jeep which acted as my own &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/hS8DNf6\"&gt;aid station&lt;/a&gt;. It contained my gear and enough food and drink for a family of 4 to survive off of for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:00pm, &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/G87oXiD\"&gt;2 straight hours of warmth and sunshine start burning my shoulders&lt;/a&gt; and now I&amp;#39;m dealing with uncomfortable sunburn that I wasn&amp;#39;t prepared for. I decide to throw on a T-shirt. OUCH! To prevent any more sunburn. Too late. Big white baby got scorched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:30pm, Decided to put on my race vest as I started to get hot and wanted to make sure I had immediate access to fluid. Oh yeah! Sunburn + bouncing vest = Kill me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:00pm (~18 miles) begins rounds of storms. Coming and going each front passing by became stronger and stronger. Temps start to slowly drop. First pair of shoes, ASICS GT1000, are soaked. Change of socks and slip into ASICS GT3000 for added support as my feet were starting to adjust to pounding the asphalt and not liking it. We make sure to deploy &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/huB6ilC\"&gt;Operation Jeep Hobo Aid Shelter&lt;/a&gt; to protect us from the wind and rain and kinda-sorta keep the contents inside dry. Lil&amp;#39;Shoes carries on reading her book in my death chair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:00pm (23 miles exactly!) winds begin picking up making it hard to run in the more open sections of the loop and debris starts becoming a factor as the dust gets in our eyes kicked up by the incoming storms. Canopies begin buckling and crashing under the passing rains. I&amp;#39;m starting to get frustrated at this point by the waves of storms coming and going. Dry one minute, pouring the next. Over and over. It made it hell to keep a steady pace and killed what mojo I had going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:10pm (~28 miles) I was starting to feel rough. This is when all hell broke loose. Every minute the sky got darker and darker. So dark in fact that the street lights began coming on and race officials got nervous. We began hearing reports of tornado warnings for our area. LadyShoes shares a screenshot of our &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/nptjvpL\"&gt;upcoming battle&lt;/a&gt;. Gandalf Brad and I are a quarter mile away from finishing our 30th mile tied for 1st place when the temp bottoms out and the wind hits us so much that we have to literally lean forward to stay upright and run. Seconds later lightning crashes and we start running face first into pea sized hail pellets. I turn to Brad and yell, &amp;quot;Looks like it&amp;#39;s gonna be one of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; races!&amp;quot; we both oddly laugh like lunatics and haul ass back to the finish line. He ducking in the military tent for cover and I giving up hope on Operation Jeep Hobo Aid Shelter as we &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/iUNzhzT\"&gt;close ourselves into the Jeep cargo bay&lt;/a&gt; for safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~5:40pm The storm lets up enough after what feels like forever, just enough for me to change, &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; into a dryer shirt and sock/shoes. While sitting idle for 30 minutes in my Jeep I completely failed myself and did not eat or drink anything. Horrible horrible mistake on my behalf. I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking clearly enough and as a result things weren&amp;#39;t going to get much better in the coming hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:00pm, the race is about a quarter of the way over and the race leaders (Mary, Gandalf Brad, and I) are just above the 50k mark after a slow restart. This is usually my toughest time physically during an ultra. If I&amp;#39;m not feeling rough around the 21 mile mark I&amp;#39;m surely getting hit hard around 31 miles. I hadn&amp;#39;t been eating well and as Mary pointed out to me I became &amp;quot;really fucking mean&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;an asshole&amp;quot;. I was encouraging her to quit but apparently my joking sounded a lot more non-jokey. I had hit my first dark place. Nutrition off and already getting tired of my hydration choices I was simply being... a dick! I knew that I was going to have to keep moving, try to get in calories and get over this hump so I made it a tiny goal to just make it to mile 40. Because the 30&amp;#39;s suck. They always do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:30pm-ish is when I hit the 40 mile mark. I had slowed down considerably but oddly enough both Mary and Gandalf Brad did a bit too. Unfortunately I took a few extra pit stops and they lasted too because Mary was eventually 2 laps ahead of me and Gandalf Brad was 3 laps a head. There were just over 3 hours left until midnight (the half way / 12 hour mark) to make up ground and I was already feeling better with each mile. Eventually I snapped out of it and felt a second wind come along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~10:00 - 11:00 pm I had covered enough ground to tie up with Mary and settle back into second place just a mile shy behind Gandalf Brad. I agree with Mary that we can hit a nice easy 50 miler in 12 hours flat and we work together into the misty, rainy night to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:00 Midnight! -  I stick with Mary as she is really stressing about her kids at home. She had gotten word in the previous hours that her two young children at home were quickly coming down with some sort of bug and her husband had his hands full. Only living a couple of miles away this made her urge to stop even greater. As we cross the half way mark of the race 12 hours in and 12 hours remaining, the clock strikes midnight. That&amp;#39;s some Hickory Dickory Dock shit right there. Perfectly paced given I wanted an even split 100 miler. We both agree to take an extended mini-break before we start up on our last half of the adventure and tackle the remaining 12 hours. I&amp;#39;ll also note that this is the point in the race where I started getting tired of messing with my watch. Our loops were an accurate 1 mile but due to tight turns and GPS connectivity every lap was coming in short or long or spot on and this was starting to play with me mentally. You&amp;#39;d get to a point where you didn&amp;#39;t know if you were on lap 35 or lap 36 because your watch is giving you 35.5 at the finish. Because of this I found myself thinking too much on numbers and it effecting my pacing and mentality. I ditched my GPS before starting my 51st mile. I forgot to turn it off as I tossed it into the cup holder of my Death Chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:15-ish pm I am ready to get back into it and Mary informs me she&amp;#39;s calling it a night. She&amp;#39;s got a &lt;strong&gt;200 mile&lt;/strong&gt; race coming up in the fall and with sick kids at home she decided it was best to rest up and and go be mom! I nod showing I understand and head off for more laps. By this time the 4th place gentleman, Curt, had been taking a lot of rest breaks and just genuinely enjoying himself. He&amp;#39;d been going back and forth from canopy to canopy most of the night meeting people and racing-but-not-racing. He was probably behind us by a good 20 miles come midnight so he decided he&amp;#39;d catch some sleep in the crew cab of his truck until he woke up hours later ready to go again. This meant that only two people were left competing in the 24 hour race. I and Gandalf The Ultra Legend Brad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Morning Hours - Brad and I battle back and forth from midnight until just before sunrise. He never letting up on his steady, relentless forward motion and me always within minutes behind him. Throughout the night I had lead once or twice I believe, we had tied numerous times, and every remaining lap I was still chasing him down. While it probably didn&amp;#39;t look like much, this game of cat and mouse built a sense of importance in my mind and did amazing things for my confidence. Not only was I doing pretty well, I was neck and neck with an ultra legend and holding my ground. It was a massive booster that allowed me to remain level headed for hours as we chipped away at the 50&amp;#39;s, the 60&amp;#39;s, the into the 70 mile range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~5:15am Friday morning I hit the 70 mile mark right as Beardy McBearderson starts pulling away on me. His experience was showing and my inexperience was starting to come out. I was in new territory. The furthest I&amp;#39;d ran before that point was just shy of 70 miles. Two things happened when I hit that 70 to 75 mile distance. My brain told me that my accomplishment was good enough to quit and my body was starting to not pay attention to what I was wanting it to do. My mind was so cloudy and hazy due to the lack of sleep and needing to stay focused that I was in desperate need of a mental recharge. I needed to shut my brain off. I made it back to my Jeep on my 75th loop begging Lady Shoes for the permission to sleep. Knowing that I wouldn&amp;#39;t catch Brad without it and knowing I was safely keeping my 2nd place spot. I sat down in the front seat of LadyShoes&amp;#39;s vehicle and dozed off with the intent of sleeping for quite a few hours. Practically throwing in the towel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:00am Only ~30-45 minutes later we both come to, to the sound of a phone vibrating. A buddy was calling me so he could come by and say HI before he headed to work. I am so thankful he did. I woke up full of energy. The kind of energy you get from one of those &amp;quot;epic naps&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;d take in your early 20&amp;#39;s between college classes. That roughly 30 minutes was enough to make me a whole new person. We quickly parted ways and I hopped back into the race where I left off. During my break Brad had pulled away by an additional 3 miles making his lead now 5-6 miles a head of me. He must have known I was taking a break and burned a little extra gas. I had some catching up to do. I take off flying, clicking away at 1 mile loops like I had just started fresh. I believe my first 3 laps were done in just over 30 minutes meaning that I was keeping a 10 min/mi pace. Passing Brad a couple of times in those early morning hours gave me a boost again as I tried to catch up. Funny enough, every other lap or so he&amp;#39;d go to check in at the table as I was passing him so I&amp;#39;m sure he was left scratching his head wondering how I was catching up to him but he wasn&amp;#39;t witnessing me actually passing him. But the race officials and their tally marks don&amp;#39;t lie. I was back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:00am- 9:00am. During this time, a good friend and local ultra distance training partner showed up. Ecstatic that I was one of only two people remaining throughout the night, he was jumping at pacing me for a couple of laps to keep me motivated. He kept telling me that what I was doing was something memorable and bigger than just me. At that point I couldn&amp;#39;t argue. He manages to pace me for a 2 laps wearing a flannel button down shirt, a trucker hat and jeans. Imagine a long bearded trail hipster. That&amp;#39;s what I was working with. His insight was valuable to me during this window of time. It kept me focused and entertained. He eventually had to leave but he told me he&amp;#39;d be back to check up on me. Also during this time, a couple of other ultra training partners showed up to pace me for a lap or two. They were a tad bit more chatty to which I had to remind them &amp;quot;A little less talky-talky! A little bit more runny-runny!&amp;quot; It was the politest way I could tell them to shut up. One person I had paced during her time finishing the Indiana Trail 100 a year prior so we were already on the same page and fell right in line with knocking out the loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:00am hits and Brad is just now getting into the 90 mile range while I&amp;#39;m still a good 2-3 laps behind (~87-88 miles?) and slowing. This is when I get a visit and motivational boost I&amp;#39;ve never experienced before by an unexpected visitor. The most recent 100 mile finisher out of my circle of friends shows up to cheer me on and decides to walk a lap with me. During this time he decides that, damaged hip or not, he&amp;#39;s going to see me until the end and do whatever it takes to get me to 100. I&amp;#39;m generally not the buddy-system, bro-motivation kind of runner but at 90 miles into a race something changed and I felt I needed him because he was making it work. Living 5 minutes away, he goes home to change into his running clothes so he can see this thing through. He gets back around 10:00 and starts making calls to friends and members of the local running club to start showing up in support of what I&amp;#39;m doing. He&amp;#39;s making live video posts, Instagram videos, he somehow managed to become a pacer and a promoter. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I wanted the attention but I started to realize that my first pacer was right in telling me that what I was doing was bigger than just me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:00am. One hour remains in the race. Brad is at 97 or 98 miles. He&amp;#39;s confident he can grind out an additional 2-3 more and go sub-24 with a 100 miler. He&amp;#39;s done it a million times no reason to doubt him. I&amp;#39;ve finally hit 90 miles and with an hour to go it&amp;#39;s obvious I&amp;#39;m not getting my first official 100 miler in under 24 hours, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; it was so close that I could taste it so my main focus was to simply get the job done. With my new motivational pacer and promoter we trudge out laps as the clock counts down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~11:53am. I return from lap #92 with only 7 minutes left in the race. Gandalf Brad has just finished his 100th mile loop and is now sitting in a chair behind the lap counter people sipping on some hot soup looking like he just got done jogging 2-3 miles. Way to make it look easy BRAD! I verify with the officials and am told that my next lap will count towards my total since I took off before the time was up. Some races, especially the less-official ones allow this sort of thing in the spirit of fun. Even if I didn&amp;#39;t make it back in time, it would count and it would be one more lap that I didn&amp;#39;t have to think about so my pacer and I wasted no time at all rushing back to the start line to churn out another mile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~12:05pm. After what seemed like a bitter sweet loop I finally make it back completing my 93rd mile and am greeted with applause from all of the crew and military members. So many of them were amazed and it made me feel good to know I could provide them with the show. I thank numerous workers for dedicating their time to make the event happen and collected my award after a few hand shakes. I explained that it wasn&amp;#39;t over yet and there are some &amp;quot;Hell Yeah&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Right On&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; as I head out for my 94th mile re-energized from the &amp;#39;official&amp;#39; finish. We were on our own now! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~12:30pm. Pacer and I hit 95 miles. With only 5 miles left I ditch any thoughts about my time and how long it&amp;#39;s taking me. I couldn&amp;#39;t care any less at that point. I wanted to savor the experience. I decided on a short 15 minute break as I watch everyone pack up and leave. With tactical precision the members of the military base disassemble the heavy canopies like they were doing their own timed competition. I take this short break to revel in the moment. The weather is overcast, cold, and windy. Everything is soaking wet. It&amp;#39;s a miserable day to be honest. But here we are. All that&amp;#39;s left. My unexpected pacer. My future wife. And our daughter. My first 100 miler is within reach and a wave of calmness comes over me as I sit in my Death Chair changing socks adding layers of clothes to keep warm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~12:45pm we take off on our final 5 loops around the stadium. They are remarkably effortless considering the circumstances but still slow enough that it&amp;#39;s a slog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;96th. Check!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;97th. Completed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;98th. Done!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;99th. Finished!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1:55pm Friday afternoon. Actual time. I made sure of it. Prior to taking off on my final lap I had discussed with my pacer that I&amp;#39;d like to do it alone. He understood. He supported it. In all of my time studying first time 100 mile finishes of other people, the one thing I caught was that they needed that last mile to themselves if they could afford it. I&amp;#39;ll never have the experience again to run my 100th mile for the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; time ever again. Doing it on my own is how I started the journey years ago and it was important to me to do it on my own now. I wanted that final mile to hit me hard like a fist to the gut. I wanted to use that final mile to reflect on how far I&amp;#39;ve come. On the things I&amp;#39;ve done to become who I am. And on where I&amp;#39;m going as a runner. A father. A husband. And hopefully an inspiration to others. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without missing a beat I take off on my final lap. I&amp;#39;m tired but awake. I&amp;#39;m drained but energized. I hurt but there&amp;#39;s no pain. I&amp;#39;m foggy but focused. I feel drunk but I&amp;#39;m stone cold sober. It&amp;#39;s surreal. There&amp;#39;s a gentle mist falling as I turn around and look behind me at the 3 people left standing waiting for me and me only, to finish. I get choked up but swallow a few hard knots and carry on. I raise both middle fingers to a section of the course that I hated most. Half way around the asphalt loop I smile at a woman who&amp;#39;d come out on her front porch across from the park to watch me. It was almost like she &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;. The thought of that choked me up again but I didn&amp;#39;t let it last. I round the final turn which is nearly a straight line to the finish. I see my daughter waiting behind a tree for me. She wants to finish with &amp;quot;Dad&amp;quot;. We&amp;#39;ve got less than a tenth of a miles left just long enough for her to keep up with me and my increasing pace as we head to the finish. Nail in the coffin as we close in on the line. I lose my edge and get rather emotional. She looks up at me and asks if I&amp;#39;m crying because my throat burns. I manage to get out between sobs that &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/chCqUUK\"&gt;&amp;quot;Everything burns, Kid! Let&amp;#39;s finish this!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cross the now imaginary finish line and immediately ask for the time. 2:06pm. 100 miles in 26h:06m:xxs. 2nd overall. 1st in age group. Apparently the only resident of my city to ever run 100 miles within the city limits. To which I responded &amp;quot;Dammit!&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;m never satisfied. I go in for my victory hug. I lose it and Lady Shoes loses it and even Lil&amp;#39;Shoes tears up. Then we look over at my pacer and bust out laughing as he&amp;#39;s overcome with emotions too. I drop to the path because I feel a huge since of relief and just want to sit. &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/4lEB0\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m told you could see it in my face&lt;/a&gt;. My first hundo in the books. It was a good day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things I Learned - Looking Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training. I train without a plan. I feel it suits my style best when I train by &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; and keep a rough idea of what my weekly mileage will be based on the experience I have. Leading up to the race my mileage varied but I averaged roughly 100k a week. That averaged out to be ~50k during the work week and ~50k divided up over the weekend. I ran literally everyday so it&amp;#39;s easier to keep track of my mileage when I don&amp;#39;t have to think back about which days I took off. I put in a few 70-80 mile weeks. I also put in one 102 mile week. Nearly all mileage was done at an easy pace with the occasional &amp;#39;fast-ish&amp;#39; run thrown in. Most mileage done on flat paved paths in an effort to get used to this course. Volume is more important to me than quality when it comes to training for this round. Some days it was just a matter of grinding out a 2 hour run when I really shouldn&amp;#39;t have been running at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training Injuries. I&amp;#39;m a relatively injury free runner. My most general complaints come in the form of overall fatigue and muscle soreness. Occasionally a tendon or some tendonitis will flair up and I&amp;#39;ll reduce mileage for a few days before getting back to work. The months leading up to the race I experimented with many different shoes, something I don&amp;#39;t often do. This resulted in a bothersome couple of injures to the bones/tendons in my feet. Again, reduced mileage. Back at it consistently and carefully. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diet. Dumpster fire. Garbage disposal. Junk food junkie. Whatever you want to call it, that&amp;#39;s my nutritional plan. I try to avoid sweets and I try to limit the overall mass quantity of food to portion sizes that can easily be burnt off after a long run or two. This will always be a work in progress. Nutrition during the run isn&amp;#39;t much different. Pedialyte. Baby food. Pizza rolls. Gummy bears. Hostess Zingers. Red Bull. That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s working for me right now. I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;ll change when I have a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-race Damage. I ran the very next day. It was a casual mile done in 9 minutes if that says anything about how banged up I was. I recover pretty quickly. Obviously fatigued with sore muscles, that was predictable. There was some slight discomfort in both achilles the receded after a week. No blisters or toe nail issues. The week after I put in ~45 miles of running. Mostly easy paced with one faster 8 miler. I think I was still riding the high. Looking back, and maybe this is a little TMI but I wear compression shorts to prevent chafing in the crotch/inner thigh area. Everytime I run ultra I forget that the #1 problem spot isn&amp;#39;t my groin area but between my ass cheeks. Compression tights keep everything in place but they push your butt cheeks together and I never do anything to prevent this until it&amp;#39;s too late. Towards the end of the race I can describe the pain best when telling everyone that &amp;quot;it feels like I sat on a tablesaw!&amp;quot; Everyone laughed at me but it was the truth. My pacer is trying to convince me to get a tattoo to commemorate my first 100 and it be a tablesaw blade. It&amp;#39;s pretty tempting. Anyways, number one lesson. Lube the butt crack. Before. During. After. Lube the butt crack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pacing. Adding up all of my lengthy aid stops, storm stops, a 30-45 minute nap and a lengthy couple of breaks I&amp;#39;m kicking myself for taking as long to finish as I did. If I can get my stops down to more of an art and learn to compete on a sleep deficit it&amp;#39;s going to be a game changer. I still hate that it took as long as it did but I now know that a sub 24 hour 100 miler is obtainable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve touched on this before so if it&amp;#39;s still in your memory, I&amp;#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a pretty insane year a head of me. I did this intentionally. I&amp;#39;ve created my own Mid-West Ultra Grand Slam maybe I&amp;#39;m suicidal I dunno...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;March - TACP 100 miler - Indiana  (Complete)&lt;br/&gt;\nApril - Indiana Trail 100 miler (pacer - maybe)&lt;br/&gt;\nMay - Hawthorn 12H 100k - Indiana&lt;br/&gt;\nJune - Eagle Up Ultra 100 miler - Ohio&lt;br/&gt;\nOct - NB 100 miler - Kentucky/Tennesse&lt;br/&gt;\nNov - Tunnel Hill 100 miler - Illinois  (Western States Qualifier)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Lady Shoes and the InCrustWeTrust crew for always supporting me and having my back with stuff like &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/nivmk\"&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt;. And one more thing; &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/EdAkM\"&gt;my pacer&lt;/a&gt; surprised me with my first unofficial-official &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/GB4mF\"&gt;100 mile buckle&lt;/a&gt; days after the race as a memento. The event didn&amp;#39;t hand out buckles and everyone deserves a buckle for their first 100. He thought it would be a nice thing to do and it was completely unexpected and much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. I&amp;#39;m done now. Thank you for either skimming or sticking this one out. Until next time folks...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Who:** Yours Truly  \n**What:** TACP 24 Hour Challenge  \n**When:** Noon on Thursday, March 30th to Noon on Friday, March 31st  \n**Where:** Indiana State University - Memorial Stadium, Terre Haute, Indiana  \n**Why:** Why not?  \n_____\n\n**Warning:** \n\nTypical race reports tend to follow a general guideline. Usually chalked full of helpful tips, data points and summarized bits. For those of you new to my reports. I like to tell more of a long drawn out story. I throw it all together and just let it happen. I miss important things sometimes. I focus on the mundane often. I do this not to bore those reading this. I ultimately will compile all my race reports one day and while it's not important right now. Some of this stuff will be helpful for me in the future so bare with me if it gets crazy and rambles like usual. \n\n_____\n\n \n**The Event &amp; Build Up**\n\nThe TACP 24 Hour Challenge is held at one of the most weird times. Noon Thursday to Noon Friday. This has significant meaning to the group of military men and women who put on the event to raise funds for fallen members of their team. The local news station did a brief [segment](http://www.wthitv.com/story/35038203/24-hour-run-challenge-for-soldiers) that covers some of the details I'm leaving out. I intentionally avoided/declined interviews because I couldn't bare to make a fool of myself. \n\nTo make matters even more unique the race is held on a 1 mile paved loop that is in the shape of the state of [Indiana](https://www.strava.com/activities/922926586)(My Strava of first 30 miles). Due to the odd starting time and that it wasn't widely announced, the turn out was not massive but that didn't stop runners from taking the challenge. Little did they know what they were in for after my training partner and fellow ultra runner got in on helping organize the event. The previous year saw a couple of runners put in 30-40 miles in the 24 hour period. This year it was to be a whole other game.\n\nAt 29 years old, this was my last shot at getting in a 100 mile run before I turned 30 on Sunday, days after the race. A devastating let down at my November 100 set me back mentally all winter and I was chomping at the bit to finish what I had started. I was convinced to run this event and due to it's timing decided it was worth the cause. There's a small group of local ultra runners that live in our city and nearly all of them showed up in support. Most of them not having a lot of time to dedicate due to having to work Thursday and Friday couldn't run more than a few hours. I on the other hand was dead set on lasting the full 24 hours and beyond. I needed to hit 100.\n\nAs mentioned, my goal was 100 miles. Being that the course wouldn't close, I told everyone that no matter what, if I wasn't at 100 miles by the time the race was over, I was staying and finishing what I started. \n\n\n_____\n\n**The Participants.**\n\nBeing small, there weren't many people who registered for the full 24 hours. I'd guess there were about 50 or so people who paid the registration fee to run for much less time. \n\nThroughout the 24 hours, the local military base would have guys running a loop almost in a casual relay fashion. At any given time there would be a couple members cruising along completing their laps. There were occasional family members and friends and local runners participating to show their support as well though nothing super competitive. The path was also open to the public so there were plenty of people walking about trying to figure out what the hell was going on. \n\nThere are only 4 notable people in this story when it comes to the 24 hour event. From left to right: \n\n[Brad, Curt, Mary, YourShoesUntied!](http://imgur.com/a/1f305) They said they wanted a pic of \"The Legends\". I had no business being in the shot but they wouldn't let me pass. They laughed at my joke for saying I didn't deserve to be in the pic but I was actually being serious. \n\nStarting with Mary, she's my training partner and good friend. Her goal was to last the full 24 hours and get in 100 miles. Ultras are nothing new to her and she's finished a couple of 100's herself so it's totally within her abilities.\n\nThere was Curt who showed up to see what he could do but he had to pace himself because he also had a marathon the morning after the race finished and didn't want to be too exhausted. I didn't know much about Curt but from what I'm told he's done some pretty cool things  when it comes to ultra distance running. \n\nThere was me, shooting for triple digits. Experienced 50k and 50 miler finally on a course where everything was in my favor. \n\nAnd then there was Brad. \n\nWhen I found out about Brad attending I got nervous. Don't be fooled by the Gandalf beard or the head full of white/grey hair, when you see him and know who he is, you're looking at a true legend of ultra running. Prior research on Brad left me envious and very very very intimidated. Without going into much detail, he's finished Vol State (314 mile race in the heat of July) **twice** and unaided/solo, totally alone. He's ran the infamous Barkley. He's also the National Record Holder for his age division in **6 day racing events**! Yeah, not 24 hours...144 hour races! May I add that that 144 hour record was done on a 1 KILOMETER paved loop!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I watched his every move like a hawk. Mimicking what he did to the best of my abilities in an effort to learn from the best. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't step my game up to try to impress him either. I'm sure he wasn't that moved by my efforts after all of his years of ultra running but dammit I just wanted to be noticed.\n\nAlong for the ride and right by my side was LadyShoes and Lil'Shoes who crewed for me nearly the whole time. Though Lil'Shoes did get to go to the grandparents house that night while I continued running. She enjoyed the nearly unlimited amount of time on the iPad while sitting in our vehicles. \n\nAlso popping in and out were good friends of mine who had showed up to help pace me or run some miles for the event...or both. Two of which would play a crucial role in my success at the finish. \n\n_____\n\n**The Weather.**\n\nOh god the weather!\n\nThis race was by far the most insane event I've been a part of when it came to the forecast. In the span of 24 hours, it went from sunny and 70, to black clouds, lightning, thunder, hail, tornado warnings, to fog, to chilly Fall-esque morning. A lot of people just couldn't hack it. High winds forced a lot of folks to pack up and leave early because their tents/canopies weren't designed for those conditions and collapsing. Needless to say, with as much rain as we got, we also got to witness one of the largest most vibrant rainbows I'd ever seen. It was so breath taking that nearly every runner stopped at one point or another to just look at it. The pics taken do zero justice in how beautiful it was. [Rain](http://imgur.com/tc9TcqB). [Bow](http://imgur.com/AY6s3r4). Aside from snow and triple digit temps, we covered just about every aspect of mid-west weather.\n\n_____\n\n**The Race.**\n\nYou're getting bullet points here. This is to touch on the more memorable things because I'm sure most of you already scrolled through, saw how long it was, saw the pics, looked at my finish time and called it a day.\n\n* 11:30 am - 11:59 am, people begin to stir around the [timing tent](http://imgur.com/a/Rfj1O) which will be home base for the many members of the local military base who came out to run laps.\n\n* 12:00 Noon - Race begins! Sunny and 70's.\n\n* 12:45 pm (~4 miles), I make the first pit stop by my Jeep which acted as my own [aid station](http://imgur.com/hS8DNf6). It contained my gear and enough food and drink for a family of 4 to survive off of for weeks. \n\n* 2:00pm, [2 straight hours of warmth and sunshine start burning my shoulders](http://imgur.com/G87oXiD) and now I'm dealing with uncomfortable sunburn that I wasn't prepared for. I decide to throw on a T-shirt. OUCH! To prevent any more sunburn. Too late. Big white baby got scorched. \n\n* 2:30pm, Decided to put on my race vest as I started to get hot and wanted to make sure I had immediate access to fluid. Oh yeah! Sunburn + bouncing vest = Kill me.\n\n* 3:00pm (~18 miles) begins rounds of storms. Coming and going each front passing by became stronger and stronger. Temps start to slowly drop. First pair of shoes, ASICS GT1000, are soaked. Change of socks and slip into ASICS GT3000 for added support as my feet were starting to adjust to pounding the asphalt and not liking it. We make sure to deploy [Operation Jeep Hobo Aid Shelter](http://imgur.com/huB6ilC) to protect us from the wind and rain and kinda-sorta keep the contents inside dry. Lil'Shoes carries on reading her book in my death chair. \n\n* 4:00pm (23 miles exactly!) winds begin picking up making it hard to run in the more open sections of the loop and debris starts becoming a factor as the dust gets in our eyes kicked up by the incoming storms. Canopies begin buckling and crashing under the passing rains. I'm starting to get frustrated at this point by the waves of storms coming and going. Dry one minute, pouring the next. Over and over. It made it hell to keep a steady pace and killed what mojo I had going. \n\n* 5:10pm (~28 miles) I was starting to feel rough. This is when all hell broke loose. Every minute the sky got darker and darker. So dark in fact that the street lights began coming on and race officials got nervous. We began hearing reports of tornado warnings for our area. LadyShoes shares a screenshot of our [upcoming battle](http://imgur.com/nptjvpL). Gandalf Brad and I are a quarter mile away from finishing our 30th mile tied for 1st place when the temp bottoms out and the wind hits us so much that we have to literally lean forward to stay upright and run. Seconds later lightning crashes and we start running face first into pea sized hail pellets. I turn to Brad and yell, \"Looks like it's gonna be one of *those* races!\" we both oddly laugh like lunatics and haul ass back to the finish line. He ducking in the military tent for cover and I giving up hope on Operation Jeep Hobo Aid Shelter as we [close ourselves into the Jeep cargo bay](http://imgur.com/iUNzhzT) for safety. \n\n* ~5:40pm The storm lets up enough after what feels like forever, just enough for me to change, *again* into a dryer shirt and sock/shoes. While sitting idle for 30 minutes in my Jeep I completely failed myself and did not eat or drink anything. Horrible horrible mistake on my behalf. I wasn't thinking clearly enough and as a result things weren't going to get much better in the coming hours. \n\n* 6:00pm, the race is about a quarter of the way over and the race leaders (Mary, Gandalf Brad, and I) are just above the 50k mark after a slow restart. This is usually my toughest time physically during an ultra. If I'm not feeling rough around the 21 mile mark I'm surely getting hit hard around 31 miles. I hadn't been eating well and as Mary pointed out to me I became \"really fucking mean\" and \"an asshole\". I was encouraging her to quit but apparently my joking sounded a lot more non-jokey. I had hit my first dark place. Nutrition off and already getting tired of my hydration choices I was simply being... a dick! I knew that I was going to have to keep moving, try to get in calories and get over this hump so I made it a tiny goal to just make it to mile 40. Because the 30's suck. They always do. \n\n* 8:30pm-ish is when I hit the 40 mile mark. I had slowed down considerably but oddly enough both Mary and Gandalf Brad did a bit too. Unfortunately I took a few extra pit stops and they lasted too because Mary was eventually 2 laps ahead of me and Gandalf Brad was 3 laps a head. There were just over 3 hours left until midnight (the half way / 12 hour mark) to make up ground and I was already feeling better with each mile. Eventually I snapped out of it and felt a second wind come along. \n\n* ~10:00 - 11:00 pm I had covered enough ground to tie up with Mary and settle back into second place just a mile shy behind Gandalf Brad. I agree with Mary that we can hit a nice easy 50 miler in 12 hours flat and we work together into the misty, rainy night to make that happen.\n\n* 12:00 Midnight! -  I stick with Mary as she is really stressing about her kids at home. She had gotten word in the previous hours that her two young children at home were quickly coming down with some sort of bug and her husband had his hands full. Only living a couple of miles away this made her urge to stop even greater. As we cross the half way mark of the race 12 hours in and 12 hours remaining, the clock strikes midnight. That's some Hickory Dickory Dock shit right there. Perfectly paced given I wanted an even split 100 miler. We both agree to take an extended mini-break before we start up on our last half of the adventure and tackle the remaining 12 hours. I'll also note that this is the point in the race where I started getting tired of messing with my watch. Our loops were an accurate 1 mile but due to tight turns and GPS connectivity every lap was coming in short or long or spot on and this was starting to play with me mentally. You'd get to a point where you didn't know if you were on lap 35 or lap 36 because your watch is giving you 35.5 at the finish. Because of this I found myself thinking too much on numbers and it effecting my pacing and mentality. I ditched my GPS before starting my 51st mile. I forgot to turn it off as I tossed it into the cup holder of my Death Chair.\n\n* 12:15-ish pm I am ready to get back into it and Mary informs me she's calling it a night. She's got a **200 mile** race coming up in the fall and with sick kids at home she decided it was best to rest up and and go be mom! I nod showing I understand and head off for more laps. By this time the 4th place gentleman, Curt, had been taking a lot of rest breaks and just genuinely enjoying himself. He'd been going back and forth from canopy to canopy most of the night meeting people and racing-but-not-racing. He was probably behind us by a good 20 miles come midnight so he decided he'd catch some sleep in the crew cab of his truck until he woke up hours later ready to go again. This meant that only two people were left competing in the 24 hour race. I and Gandalf The Ultra Legend Brad. \n\n* Early Morning Hours - Brad and I battle back and forth from midnight until just before sunrise. He never letting up on his steady, relentless forward motion and me always within minutes behind him. Throughout the night I had lead once or twice I believe, we had tied numerous times, and every remaining lap I was still chasing him down. While it probably didn't look like much, this game of cat and mouse built a sense of importance in my mind and did amazing things for my confidence. Not only was I doing pretty well, I was neck and neck with an ultra legend and holding my ground. It was a massive booster that allowed me to remain level headed for hours as we chipped away at the 50's, the 60's, the into the 70 mile range. \n\n* ~5:15am Friday morning I hit the 70 mile mark right as Beardy McBearderson starts pulling away on me. His experience was showing and my inexperience was starting to come out. I was in new territory. The furthest I'd ran before that point was just shy of 70 miles. Two things happened when I hit that 70 to 75 mile distance. My brain told me that my accomplishment was good enough to quit and my body was starting to not pay attention to what I was wanting it to do. My mind was so cloudy and hazy due to the lack of sleep and needing to stay focused that I was in desperate need of a mental recharge. I needed to shut my brain off. I made it back to my Jeep on my 75th loop begging Lady Shoes for the permission to sleep. Knowing that I wouldn't catch Brad without it and knowing I was safely keeping my 2nd place spot. I sat down in the front seat of LadyShoes's vehicle and dozed off with the intent of sleeping for quite a few hours. Practically throwing in the towel. \n\n* 6:00am Only ~30-45 minutes later we both come to, to the sound of a phone vibrating. A buddy was calling me so he could come by and say HI before he headed to work. I am so thankful he did. I woke up full of energy. The kind of energy you get from one of those \"epic naps\" you'd take in your early 20's between college classes. That roughly 30 minutes was enough to make me a whole new person. We quickly parted ways and I hopped back into the race where I left off. During my break Brad had pulled away by an additional 3 miles making his lead now 5-6 miles a head of me. He must have known I was taking a break and burned a little extra gas. I had some catching up to do. I take off flying, clicking away at 1 mile loops like I had just started fresh. I believe my first 3 laps were done in just over 30 minutes meaning that I was keeping a 10 min/mi pace. Passing Brad a couple of times in those early morning hours gave me a boost again as I tried to catch up. Funny enough, every other lap or so he'd go to check in at the table as I was passing him so I'm sure he was left scratching his head wondering how I was catching up to him but he wasn't witnessing me actually passing him. But the race officials and their tally marks don't lie. I was back!\n\n* 7:00am- 9:00am. During this time, a good friend and local ultra distance training partner showed up. Ecstatic that I was one of only two people remaining throughout the night, he was jumping at pacing me for a couple of laps to keep me motivated. He kept telling me that what I was doing was something memorable and bigger than just me. At that point I couldn't argue. He manages to pace me for a 2 laps wearing a flannel button down shirt, a trucker hat and jeans. Imagine a long bearded trail hipster. That's what I was working with. His insight was valuable to me during this window of time. It kept me focused and entertained. He eventually had to leave but he told me he'd be back to check up on me. Also during this time, a couple of other ultra training partners showed up to pace me for a lap or two. They were a tad bit more chatty to which I had to remind them \"A little less talky-talky! A little bit more runny-runny!\" It was the politest way I could tell them to shut up. One person I had paced during her time finishing the Indiana Trail 100 a year prior so we were already on the same page and fell right in line with knocking out the loops.\n\n* 9:00am hits and Brad is just now getting into the 90 mile range while I'm still a good 2-3 laps behind (~87-88 miles?) and slowing. This is when I get a visit and motivational boost I've never experienced before by an unexpected visitor. The most recent 100 mile finisher out of my circle of friends shows up to cheer me on and decides to walk a lap with me. During this time he decides that, damaged hip or not, he's going to see me until the end and do whatever it takes to get me to 100. I'm generally not the buddy-system, bro-motivation kind of runner but at 90 miles into a race something changed and I felt I needed him because he was making it work. Living 5 minutes away, he goes home to change into his running clothes so he can see this thing through. He gets back around 10:00 and starts making calls to friends and members of the local running club to start showing up in support of what I'm doing. He's making live video posts, Instagram videos, he somehow managed to become a pacer and a promoter. I wasn't sure I wanted the attention but I started to realize that my first pacer was right in telling me that what I was doing was bigger than just me. \n\n* 11:00am. One hour remains in the race. Brad is at 97 or 98 miles. He's confident he can grind out an additional 2-3 more and go sub-24 with a 100 miler. He's done it a million times no reason to doubt him. I've finally hit 90 miles and with an hour to go it's obvious I'm not getting my first official 100 miler in under 24 hours, **but** it was so close that I could taste it so my main focus was to simply get the job done. With my new motivational pacer and promoter we trudge out laps as the clock counts down.\n\n* ~11:53am. I return from lap #92 with only 7 minutes left in the race. Gandalf Brad has just finished his 100th mile loop and is now sitting in a chair behind the lap counter people sipping on some hot soup looking like he just got done jogging 2-3 miles. Way to make it look easy BRAD! I verify with the officials and am told that my next lap will count towards my total since I took off before the time was up. Some races, especially the less-official ones allow this sort of thing in the spirit of fun. Even if I didn't make it back in time, it would count and it would be one more lap that I didn't have to think about so my pacer and I wasted no time at all rushing back to the start line to churn out another mile. \n\n* ~12:05pm. After what seemed like a bitter sweet loop I finally make it back completing my 93rd mile and am greeted with applause from all of the crew and military members. So many of them were amazed and it made me feel good to know I could provide them with the show. I thank numerous workers for dedicating their time to make the event happen and collected my award after a few hand shakes. I explained that it wasn't over yet and there are some \"Hell Yeah's\" and \"Right On's\" as I head out for my 94th mile re-energized from the 'official' finish. We were on our own now! \n\n* ~12:30pm. Pacer and I hit 95 miles. With only 5 miles left I ditch any thoughts about my time and how long it's taking me. I couldn't care any less at that point. I wanted to savor the experience. I decided on a short 15 minute break as I watch everyone pack up and leave. With tactical precision the members of the military base disassemble the heavy canopies like they were doing their own timed competition. I take this short break to revel in the moment. The weather is overcast, cold, and windy. Everything is soaking wet. It's a miserable day to be honest. But here we are. All that's left. My unexpected pacer. My future wife. And our daughter. My first 100 miler is within reach and a wave of calmness comes over me as I sit in my Death Chair changing socks adding layers of clothes to keep warm. \n\n* ~12:45pm we take off on our final 5 loops around the stadium. They are remarkably effortless considering the circumstances but still slow enough that it's a slog. \n\n96th. Check!\n\n97th. Completed!\n\n98th. Done!\n\n99th. Finished!\n\n* 1:55pm Friday afternoon. Actual time. I made sure of it. Prior to taking off on my final lap I had discussed with my pacer that I'd like to do it alone. He understood. He supported it. In all of my time studying first time 100 mile finishes of other people, the one thing I caught was that they needed that last mile to themselves if they could afford it. I'll never have the experience again to run my 100th mile for the **first** time ever again. Doing it on my own is how I started the journey years ago and it was important to me to do it on my own now. I wanted that final mile to hit me hard like a fist to the gut. I wanted to use that final mile to reflect on how far I've come. On the things I've done to become who I am. And on where I'm going as a runner. A father. A husband. And hopefully an inspiration to others. \n\nWithout missing a beat I take off on my final lap. I'm tired but awake. I'm drained but energized. I hurt but there's no pain. I'm foggy but focused. I feel drunk but I'm stone cold sober. It's surreal. There's a gentle mist falling as I turn around and look behind me at the 3 people left standing waiting for me and me only, to finish. I get choked up but swallow a few hard knots and carry on. I raise both middle fingers to a section of the course that I hated most. Half way around the asphalt loop I smile at a woman who'd come out on her front porch across from the park to watch me. It was almost like she *knew*. The thought of that choked me up again but I didn't let it last. I round the final turn which is nearly a straight line to the finish. I see my daughter waiting behind a tree for me. She wants to finish with \"Dad\". We've got less than a tenth of a miles left just long enough for her to keep up with me and my increasing pace as we head to the finish. Nail in the coffin as we close in on the line. I lose my edge and get rather emotional. She looks up at me and asks if I'm crying because my throat burns. I manage to get out between sobs that [\"Everything burns, Kid! Let's finish this!\"](http://imgur.com/chCqUUK).\n\nI cross the now imaginary finish line and immediately ask for the time. 2:06pm. 100 miles in 26h:06m:xxs. 2nd overall. 1st in age group. Apparently the only resident of my city to ever run 100 miles within the city limits. To which I responded \"Dammit!\" because I'm never satisfied. I go in for my victory hug. I lose it and Lady Shoes loses it and even Lil'Shoes tears up. Then we look over at my pacer and bust out laughing as he's overcome with emotions too. I drop to the path because I feel a huge since of relief and just want to sit. [I'm told you could see it in my face](http://imgur.com/a/4lEB0). My first hundo in the books. It was a good day. \n\n_____\n\n**Things I Learned - Looking Back**\n\nTraining. I train without a plan. I feel it suits my style best when I train by *feel* and keep a rough idea of what my weekly mileage will be based on the experience I have. Leading up to the race my mileage varied but I averaged roughly 100k a week. That averaged out to be ~50k during the work week and ~50k divided up over the weekend. I ran literally everyday so it's easier to keep track of my mileage when I don't have to think back about which days I took off. I put in a few 70-80 mile weeks. I also put in one 102 mile week. Nearly all mileage was done at an easy pace with the occasional 'fast-ish' run thrown in. Most mileage done on flat paved paths in an effort to get used to this course. Volume is more important to me than quality when it comes to training for this round. Some days it was just a matter of grinding out a 2 hour run when I really shouldn't have been running at all. \n\nTraining Injuries. I'm a relatively injury free runner. My most general complaints come in the form of overall fatigue and muscle soreness. Occasionally a tendon or some tendonitis will flair up and I'll reduce mileage for a few days before getting back to work. The months leading up to the race I experimented with many different shoes, something I don't often do. This resulted in a bothersome couple of injures to the bones/tendons in my feet. Again, reduced mileage. Back at it consistently and carefully. \n\nDiet. Dumpster fire. Garbage disposal. Junk food junkie. Whatever you want to call it, that's my nutritional plan. I try to avoid sweets and I try to limit the overall mass quantity of food to portion sizes that can easily be burnt off after a long run or two. This will always be a work in progress. Nutrition during the run isn't much different. Pedialyte. Baby food. Pizza rolls. Gummy bears. Hostess Zingers. Red Bull. That's what's working for me right now. I'm sure it'll change when I have a heart attack. \n\nPost-race Damage. I ran the very next day. It was a casual mile done in 9 minutes if that says anything about how banged up I was. I recover pretty quickly. Obviously fatigued with sore muscles, that was predictable. There was some slight discomfort in both achilles the receded after a week. No blisters or toe nail issues. The week after I put in ~45 miles of running. Mostly easy paced with one faster 8 miler. I think I was still riding the high. Looking back, and maybe this is a little TMI but I wear compression shorts to prevent chafing in the crotch/inner thigh area. Everytime I run ultra I forget that the #1 problem spot isn't my groin area but between my ass cheeks. Compression tights keep everything in place but they push your butt cheeks together and I never do anything to prevent this until it's too late. Towards the end of the race I can describe the pain best when telling everyone that \"it feels like I sat on a tablesaw!\" Everyone laughed at me but it was the truth. My pacer is trying to convince me to get a tattoo to commemorate my first 100 and it be a tablesaw blade. It's pretty tempting. Anyways, number one lesson. Lube the butt crack. Before. During. After. Lube the butt crack. \n\nPacing. Adding up all of my lengthy aid stops, storm stops, a 30-45 minute nap and a lengthy couple of breaks I'm kicking myself for taking as long to finish as I did. If I can get my stops down to more of an art and learn to compete on a sleep deficit it's going to be a game changer. I still hate that it took as long as it did but I now know that a sub 24 hour 100 miler is obtainable. \n_____\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nI've touched on this before so if it's still in your memory, I'm sorry.\n\nI've got a pretty insane year a head of me. I did this intentionally. I've created my own Mid-West Ultra Grand Slam maybe I'm suicidal I dunno...\n\nMarch - TACP 100 miler - Indiana  (Complete)  \nApril - Indiana Trail 100 miler (pacer - maybe)  \nMay - Hawthorn 12H 100k - Indiana    \nJune - Eagle Up Ultra 100 miler - Ohio    \nOct - NB 100 miler - Kentucky/Tennesse    \nNov - Tunnel Hill 100 miler - Illinois  (Western States Qualifier)  \n\n_____\n\nSpecial thanks to Lady Shoes and the InCrustWeTrust crew for always supporting me and having my back with stuff like [THIS](http://imgur.com/a/nivmk). And one more thing; [my pacer](http://imgur.com/a/EdAkM) surprised me with my first unofficial-official [100 mile buckle](http://imgur.com/a/GB4mF) days after the race as a memento. The event didn't hand out buckles and everyone deserves a buckle for their first 100. He thought it would be a nice thing to do and it was completely unexpected and much appreciated.\n\n_____\n\nOk. I'm done now. Thank you for either skimming or sticking this one out.

The local college's football team's stadium is located right in the center and this path was built so people could enjoy the surrounding grounds.\n\n&gt;Does LadyShoes run at all?\n\nYes and no. Yes, as in sometimes when she gets a wild streak she will go out and run a mile or two slowly but if you were to ask me if she was a runner, I'd say no. She probably puts in 25 miles a year...if that. Though I will say that at events like this, she's very very helpful in going with me when I need to walk a lap or two. Helps me a lot!\n\n&gt;Why don't you have a proper ultra beard? Is there, like, some hipster-equivalent to the typical ultrarunner, which actually involves NOT having a massive beard?\n\nI know ultra beards are the '*thing*' but I've got this superstition now regarding it. Every single time I grow my beard out long, my race performances suck or I just do badly. Nearly every time I've got this stubble-baby beard thing going on I'm always racing much better and doing good. I know it's not a legitimate excuse, but it's a trend that works for me so I'll keep it short for as long as necessary. When I quit winning and PR'ing I'll grow it back. \n\n&gt;How many shoes did you go through?\n\nThis is one of the things that I didn't get around to talking about in the report. I rarely take more than two pairs but for some reason this time I took 4 pairs and due to the storms I used them all because my feet kept getting soaked. In order I used:\n\n* Asics GT1000 (Miles 1-30)  \n* Asics GT3000 (Miles 30-40)\n* Sketchers GoRun Forza 2 (Miles 40-42)  \n* Hoka Gaviota (Miles 43-100)\n\n&gt;What kind of stuff do you eat?\n\nYet another aspect of the report I wanted to get to but didn't. This time it was a bit weird because looking back, I really didn't eat that much. Breaking it down, the first ~30 miles I had:\n\n* A couple pouches of baby food puree\n* A couple hand fulls of pizza rolls\n* A ziploc baggie of gummy bears\n\nThen as the night went on, I scavenged because when I run long distances, I lose all interest in solid foods. LadyShoes did run up the road and bring me back two large cokes and a 20 piece McDonald's chicken nugget. That was devoured! I did manage to choke down a couple slices of left over pizza they had at the timing tent, and when morning came around I slammed about a half dozen donuts. \n\nHonestly, for this race I survived the last half of it on chicken soup broth, coke, and ginger ale. It's what my body was craving so I went with it. \n\n&gt;How much walking vs. running do you do in something like this? Do you have a schedule or just switch by feel?\n\nThis was a unique situation where I actually ran (shuffled) more than I walked for most of the event. We did the math and estimated the length of all of my stops/breaks and I spent ~90-100 minutes or more not moving at all. That means had I of kept moving I would have hit 100 miles in the 24 hour window. That works out to be a steady but slow 13:xx avg pace for the entire duration. So now to answer your question, I'd say for this particular event I walked about 10-15 loops total. There was a window of time somewhere between 30 and 40 miles where I was struggling and a majority of the laps were done walking BUT my race walking pace is roughly a 12 min/mi when I'm fresh so some of those loops were actually done faster walking than \"running\" at times. \n\nGoing into this event, my plan was to have a run/walk schedule. In the past, running for 25 minutes and walking for 5 minutes worked very well for me. However, since the loop was only a mile a 25/5 plan like that would have forced me to run when I was supposed to be at my aid stop refueling. I abandoned this plan before starting and just ran by feel. I'd pick points along the loop every so often and force myself to walk small stretches just to make sure I'd have energy left much later in the race.  \n\n&gt;Upon turning 30, were you able to tell the difference between your post-race aches and pains and your \"now I'm elderly\" aches and pains?\n\nUp until now, the day after the 100, I'd never felt better! I woke up the next day and did yard work and ran a short recovery mile pretty quickly. I've had 20 mile training runs beat me up worse than I felt. Now that I'm 30, I don't feel like much has changed. I still recover pretty quickly and the only time things hurt is when I sit idle and get stiff...so I just keep moving.\n\nAs for the pacer friend, he went above and beyond doing that for me. I thanked him every way I could, texts, calls, messages, etc and I still feel like I owe him. He's got a 100 at the end of the summer and I need to see how close it is because if it's a short drive, I might sneak up unexpectedly and help pace him as a final thanks. And that last lap... man it was amazing. Every emotion you can imagine and oh so worth it!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aw thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is the mile look purposely in the shape of the state of Indiana or was that a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mile loop is intentionally designed to be in the shape of Indiana. The local college&amp;#39;s football team&amp;#39;s stadium is located right in the center and this path was built so people could enjoy the surrounding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does LadyShoes run at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. Yes, as in sometimes when she gets a wild streak she will go out and run a mile or two slowly but if you were to ask me if she was a runner, I&amp;#39;d say no. She probably puts in 25 miles a year...if that. Though I will say that at events like this, she&amp;#39;s very very helpful in going with me when I need to walk a lap or two. Helps me a lot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t you have a proper ultra beard? Is there, like, some hipster-equivalent to the typical ultrarunner, which actually involves NOT having a massive beard?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know ultra beards are the &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39; but I&amp;#39;ve got this superstition now regarding it. Every single time I grow my beard out long, my race performances suck or I just do badly. Nearly every time I&amp;#39;ve got this stubble-baby beard thing going on I&amp;#39;m always racing much better and doing good. I know it&amp;#39;s not a legitimate excuse, but it&amp;#39;s a trend that works for me so I&amp;#39;ll keep it short for as long as necessary. When I quit winning and PR&amp;#39;ing I&amp;#39;ll grow it back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How many shoes did you go through?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is one of the things that I didn&amp;#39;t get around to talking about in the report. I rarely take more than two pairs but for some reason this time I took 4 pairs and due to the storms I used them all because my feet kept getting soaked. In order I used:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Asics GT1000 (Miles 1-30)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Asics GT3000 (Miles 30-40)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sketchers GoRun Forza 2 (Miles 40-42)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hoka Gaviota (Miles 43-100)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of stuff do you eat?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet another aspect of the report I wanted to get to but didn&amp;#39;t. This time it was a bit weird because looking back, I really didn&amp;#39;t eat that much. Breaking it down, the first ~30 miles I had:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A couple pouches of baby food puree&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A couple hand fulls of pizza rolls&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A ziploc baggie of gummy bears&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then as the night went on, I scavenged because when I run long distances, I lose all interest in solid foods.
