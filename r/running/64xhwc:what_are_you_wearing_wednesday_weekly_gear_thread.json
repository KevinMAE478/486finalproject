I'm embarassed to admit this but I do want quick access to my phone because I'm a millennial and I like attaching photos to my Strava runs.\n\nI bought the pack knowing that there are no side pockets, but man, a Salomon style side stash would take this pack to the next level.  Oh well.  There is a small pocket on the lower back where you can put anything that doesn't need to be readily accessible.  Like I said, no wasted space.

I really enjoyed the vest and how it stayed in place for the entire run, the water bottles stayed up front and My giant Note 4 fit in the back zipper pocket perfectly. \n\n**Pros-**\n\n* Fit (also a con) I am a Male 5'9\" and weight in at 167lbs I am in a small in this vest. I heeded the warnings of those before me and the reviews and ordered the small. It stayed perfectly in place. The side straps were all the way out, but the chest straps were as tight as they would go. It really seems like these two are not in line at all. \n\n* Soft flasks worked nicely. I had to keep blowing air back in them so they wouldn't fall down. I only used one since I was on a 10K and just wanted to see how it worked. If I had water on both sides I think it would minimize a lot of shifting. \n\n* comfort- This is one I was worried about since I run in tank tops or singlets mostly. I wasn't sure how the straps would work without more coverage. After a 10K and it was humid that night (rained that afternoon) it was super comfortable, I could barely tell it was off my shirt at all on my neck. \n\n* Weight- Super super light, I barely even noticed it was on after about the first 200 yards. \n\n* storage- There is a ton, there is a zipper pocket just below the left water bottle that would be ideal for a key or a gel or even a little bigger waffle. there are gel pockets more accessible up closer to the neck above the bottles. I would even consider throwing a tailwind single in one for a quick tear off and refill as needed. The back pocket is giant and would have more than enough room for clothes, rain jackets, etc. There is an outside zipper pocket as well that fit my Note 4 perfectly. I put it in a ziplock bag (sandwhich size) and turned it off and put it in there. Nothing not a single bump from it the entire run. I'll be putting my phone and maybe a credit card in there for race day. \n\n**Cons-**\n\n* Size- I can't imagine how someone smaller than me fits in this thing. and what must the large be like. \n\n* Soft flasks- This may just be personal preference, but I'm going to reserve judgement until I get the hard bottles in. I liked the quick bite and suck and honestly it wasn't hard to raise it up to my neck a little so I didn't have to bend my head. However, if I didn't blow air into the bottle after I was done to fill it up it will definitely slide to the bottom of the pocket. I may try using a bandana in the pocket to take up some room in the bottom. \n\nFor now that's about it, I'll let you know more as I take it progressively further. It'll go for 9 miles with me on Sat Morning, so I'll have a better idea of what's what. \n\nEdit: Added Weight to the Pros section. \n\n", "edited": 1492018798.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is my review of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Direction-Ultra-Graphite-Large/dp/B0141UL896/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1492016649&amp;amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;amp;keywords=Scott+jurek+ultra+3.0\"&gt;Ultimate Direction Scott Jurek Ultra 3.0&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took it out for a trial 10K the other night to see how it performed and fit and all that jazz.
