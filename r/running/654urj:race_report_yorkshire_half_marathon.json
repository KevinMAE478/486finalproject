I was only able to fit in one more run a week due to time constraints, so with a month to go and the race looming, I began to run home from work once a week (11.5 miles) just to get me body used to the distance. I am &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; going to utilise a proper training plan next time, as I feel I could&amp;#39;ve coped better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had absolutely &lt;strong&gt;no idea&lt;/strong&gt; what to expect - the atmosphere was fantastic! The local running club provided pacers up to a 2:20 finish, but I never caught up with them due to my pace/start position, something to aim for next time! It was a bit disorientating at first as I didn&amp;#39;t really have a &amp;#39;pre-race&amp;#39; routine having never done this before, so I just kept calm, did a few light stretches. I do however wish I&amp;#39;d joined the long queue for the portaloos pre-race...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The route starts with a 5-6k ascent out of the city - I was wholly unprepared for the sheer length of the ascent and the slog it was going to be to get up it! At this point the weather was starting to heat up as well, and I decided to stick with a group of club runners aiming for a sub-2:30 finish as they were pacing well compared to a lot of people in my starting paddock, who were beginning to walk to cope with the hills. At this point I admitted defeat and dived into a portaloo as the water I had consumed before the race was starting to distract me - I estimate I lost about 3 minutes before getting back into the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once out of the city, we hit the edge of the Yorkshire Moors - the winding road through green fields was a much more pleasant enviroment to run through compared to the city start, but the lack of spectators encouraging me definitely knocked my confidence, and I started to accept I probably wasn&amp;#39;t going to hit my 2:30 goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon we hit the descent back into the city - as well as the crowds lining the villages on the route with Jelly Babies, water bottles and sprinklers! As soon as I started to see the markers for the last few km&amp;#39;s I got my confidence back - by this point I had identified another runner whose pace I felt comfortable running at, so I decided to stay close and try and keep up, starting to overtake some struggling with the heat/distance. It was a balmy 17 degrees centigrade at this point, with a cloudless sky and beating sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last couple of miles were the toughest physically, but I knew at this point I was going to be OK, and that I wasn&amp;#39;t too far behind my original goal. The last 400m was one of my favourite parts of the race - hundreds of spectators, an announcer calling my name and a jokey sprint with another runner towards the line. Finally I was across!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was doing at this point - I followed the few runners I had finished with and collected my first ever goody-bag and gulped down the water, a medal was put around my neck and I politely refused an Alcohol-free Erdinger (I don&amp;#39;t understand alcohol-free beer) and took in the atmosphere, before collecting my bag. Overall the event was very well organised, as you&amp;#39;d expect for an even that had been running for a few years - the event managers have even sent me a new t-shirt for free as I had the wrong size in my goody bag post-race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was generated using &lt;a href=\"https://martellaj.github.io/race-reportr/\"&gt;the new race reportr&lt;/a&gt;, a tool built by &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/bbqlays\"&gt;/u/BBQLays&lt;/a&gt; for making organized, easy-to-read, and beautiful race reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "### Race information\n* **What?** Yorkshire Half Marathon\n* **When?** April 9, 2017\n* **How far?** 13.1 miles\n* **Where?** Sheffield, UK\n* **Website:** [http://www.theyorkshiremarathon.com/events/eventsplusnet-yorkshire-half-marathon-sheffield/](http://www.theyorkshiremarathon.com/events/eventsplusnet-yorkshire-half-marathon-sheffield/)\n* **Strava activity:** [https://www.strava.com/activities/934489706](https://www.strava.com/activities/934489706)\n\n### Goals\n\n*I have only been running since October last year, and I am very much a work in progress!
