I recognized the guy from somewhere, and then it clicked, I had seen him alongside Yoel Romero recently, shortly after he got busted. My initial impression of the guy is that he&amp;#39;s somewhat of a scumbag, and definitely coaches his athletes on how to get out of sticky situations, including steroid busts. If you re-watch the press conference where Jon Jones talked about his steroid bust and left crying, you&amp;#39;ll see what I mean. He was asked &amp;quot;what did you test positive for?&amp;quot; and his answer was &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t even pronounce it!&amp;quot;. WTF? Can&amp;#39;t pronounce &amp;#39;Clomid&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;estrogen blocker&amp;#39;? It was clear to me that someone had coached him to say that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some quick googling I found that Malki Kawa is CEO of an athlete management company called First Round Management: &lt;a href=\"https://www.firstroundmanagement.com/\"&gt;https://www.firstroundmanagement.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He represents some big names including Jon Jones, Tyron Woodley, Condit, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going back to Yoel, what really stands out to me is that both him and Jon Jones not only used the &amp;quot;tainted supplement&amp;quot; excuse, both were able to submit samples of the supposed tainted substances, and both were thus &amp;quot;proven innocent&amp;quot; and had their suspensions reduced. Memory fails me here, but this is the 4th or 5th time someone is &amp;quot;cleared&amp;quot; this way recently. No athlete ever submitted tainted substances 5+ years ago, aside from maybe Sean Sherk, who may have been the first to abuse the loophole I think I&amp;#39;ve found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory is that high profile athletes (Jon Jones, Yoel Romero, and others) are taking the tainted supplement excuse to the next level with the help of their manager, in this case Malki Kawa. I think they&amp;#39;re acquiring tainted supplements which may be produced specifically in the event of a bust. If and when they get busted, they have a whole array of &amp;quot;tainted&amp;quot; supplements at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So where does Ben Rothwell fit in? The first time he was busted, Ben basically said &amp;quot;sorry fans&amp;quot;. He was busted again earlier this year, but this time he came out with the same PR line Jones and Yoel used; &amp;quot;I would appreciate the chance to show that I have not cheated nor did I intend to cheat. Please hold your opinions of me until all the facts are out. I appreciate everyone&amp;#39;s support as I go through the process with USADA&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; Ben Rothwell&amp;#39;s case is still being prepared.
