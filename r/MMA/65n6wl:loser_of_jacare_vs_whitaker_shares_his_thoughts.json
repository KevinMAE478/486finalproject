UFC makes money fights for Bisping because he's the most likely opponent in a while for these guys to beat, and nothing he says (if he said anything at all) is likely to change that unless he suddenly becomes a McGregor-level draw and gains leverage.

The fact that Bisping's reign was being doubted from the beginning was by no fault of his own, he won the title in the most decisive way possible, a 1 round KO. And yes, McGregor did fight opponents clearly worse than the contenders on queue, that's where the FIRST Nate fight came from. McGregor decided (or maybe he didn't, but if it's Bisping's decision now, McGregor has just as much agency, and in fact more, given how much leverage he has to make fights)  to fight a middle of the road lightweight just because he called him out rather than Aldo, the best contender at the time and former champion, and much of the featherweight lineup. The difference is that Bisping stayed in his weight class, and put his belt on the line.

Except then Yoel pops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weidman somehow gets an immediate rematch, but pulls out. Bisping gets the belt. In this time Jacare beats a top 5 opponent. Yoel is suspended, Weidman and Rockhold are coming off losses, Moose is 1-1 in his last two and his win was against low ranked Leities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Jacare is clearly next, but they decide to put in Dan Henderson, who is hardly ranked and has a 1 fight streak over an unranked WW. Everyone says &amp;quot;haha don&amp;#39;t worry this is just a one off Jacare is next&amp;quot;, except basic logic and reason lets you know that Weidman or Yoel will hop him after they fight once Yoel&amp;#39;s suspension is up. Not that it matters, because Bisping is off fighting GSP now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you paid attention since 2014, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that Jacare got screwed continuously one way or another for two years. It&amp;#39;s just not that hard to see if you were around or understand the divisional landscape at the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MMA", "name": "t1_dgboi1y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492345734.0, "created_utc": 1492316934.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbnh2b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chicubs33883", "parent_id": "t1_dgbmxah", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MMA", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Nonsense.
