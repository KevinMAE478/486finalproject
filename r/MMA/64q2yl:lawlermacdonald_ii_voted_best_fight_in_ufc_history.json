I wouldn&amp;#39;t show this fight to any faint hearted people. But man both fighters gave it their all, and if you ever wanna see someone give it their all and more watch this fight.  Both fighters left everything in that octagon that night. It was a little sad as well though, because while watching it you know that neither fighter can ever be 100% again after a fight like that. They left a part of them selves there that night. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MMA", "name": "t1_dg4lll6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960759.0, "created_utc": 1491931959.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhj4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q2yl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4llix", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JoeLasDome", "parent_id": "t3_64q2yl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MMA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This was a great fight, but I have to put Dustin Porier vs the Korean Zombie, along with Henderson vs Rua up there as well.
