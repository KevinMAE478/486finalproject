Jon Jones beats all comers, therefore he must be the greatest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are all fights at flyweight non-competitive? I really don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s true. It looks like every other division, where you can only base who&amp;#39;s good and who isn&amp;#39;t on who&amp;#39;s beaten who. People don&amp;#39;t recognize the names of a lot of the flyweights for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Lighter weight divisions (and especially FLW which was the last to be added on the men&amp;#39;s side) haven&amp;#39;t been around nearly as long as the heavier weight classes, that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s no flyweight Shoguns, Wanderleis, or Hunts to point to and use as your initial comparison for judging up and coming fighters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  It&amp;#39;s stuck in a vicious cycle whereby people don&amp;#39;t watch it because the guys are &amp;quot;too small&amp;quot;, and so even though talent grows in that division over time like in any other, hardly anyone is actually following the division and so they don&amp;#39;t know or care to watch when big fights happen because they don&amp;#39;t know the fighters. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MMA", "name": "t1_dgdntqa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492473341.0, "created_utc": 1492444541.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhj4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q51o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdf1li", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IshiharasBitch", "parent_id": "t1_dgd9d6y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MMA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "People are downvoting you, but none have specifically refuted your points.
