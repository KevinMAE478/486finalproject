Rose has never been that impressive to me. Her fight with Karolina was sloppy. Both of them looked sloppy. Waterson looks refined, looks like she drilled the basics over and over and over more so than the other girls in her division. She will be a threat to JJ, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here is Waterson shadowboxing with timestamp (&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZLefgM7DD8w?t=252\"&gt;https://youtu.be/ZLefgM7DD8w?t=252&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is Vanzants open workout (&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdEoVClpTSw\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdEoVClpTSw&lt;/a&gt;)..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The speed difference is super noticable. If you compare Namajunas to Vanzant.. they&amp;#39;re basically equal speedwise and that&amp;#39;s going to be a massive difference in the fight. Namajunas will be outclassed heavily by Watersons kicks and in awe by her speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MMA", "name": "t1_dg6ie0w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057966.0, "created_utc": 1492029166.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhj4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yfc5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6dked", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "loissemuter", "parent_id": "t1_dg65o06", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MMA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In five official UFC fights, Rose has fought Carla Esparza, Angela Hill, PVZ, Tecia Torres, and Karolina.\n\nRose only outgrappled Angela Hill and PVZ, got choked out by Carla Esparza.\n\nAside from the Hill and PVZ fights, Rose hasn't even been able to record a credible submission *attempt* in the UFC.
