I have been there. I have recovered. I relapse sometimes, but it is rare, and I don't beat myself up over it. From your post, I can see that we must address many issues. \n\nLets start with the most basic issue. Your calories. Are you eating enough? I'm guessing from your post history that you are a girl, and I have seen time and time again that girls tend to be overly restrictive when it comes to calorie reduction. When you do this, you tend to stick to your diet for some time, but ultimately, when the opportunity arrises (a party, family gathering, general emotional highs/lows), your cravings overcome you, and you binge. Maybe cravings isn't even the right word. You try to find comfort in food. This is the most common cause of binging. This issue can be addressed in two ways. Firstly, you must be eating calories below maintenance, but not to the point where food is always on your mind. Find out your TRUE TDEE and macros. If you need help with this, shoot me a PM. \n\nSecondly, you must stop your emotional eating. Ups and downs are a part of life, but you shouldn't try to fill in a void or express happiness with food. You should understand that food is basically just fuel for the body. I know it is hard to think this way, with the way media is shoving food up our faces all day, but you have to think along these lines to change your actions. I am not saying that you should go full Buddhist-mode and have complete detachment with food, but you should learn to cultivate the proper balance. \n\nThe next issue we must address is the pressure to eat from friends and family. I have faced this too. They will tell you to eat more, they will mock you, they will show how they eat whatever they want and are still fit. I have learnt that you cannot change people. You should at least once tell your family and friends that you have a goal to achieve and they should not berate you. If they do not understand, and still keep on compelling you to eat (which in my experience, they will), then you should distance yourself from them. They do not understand your desires and respect your choices. They are not worth it. I know it can seen trivial to distance yourself from friends and family on the basis of food, but let me tell you, this nature of theirs runs deeper than just food. Maybe you have realized this by now, maybe you will realize this later. \n\nFinally, we must address the major issue at hand. Your self-image and self-discipline. As this is a self-discipline, sub, let us first get this out of the way. You say that you have felt fat since Grade 4, and have been starving yourself since Grade 6. Going by your age, you should be in Grade 11-12 now. So in 5-6 years, you have been unable to get un-fat? If you were to lose even a lousy 1 lbs a month, you would have lost upwards of 60 lbs in this time frame. I don't think you were carrying around that much fat when you were in Grade 6. Why are you still trying to lose weight? With proper discipline, losing a lbs of fat a week, you should have lost the required weight within a few short months, and should now well be on the way of bulking (GAINING WEIGHT!), so as to build a better muscular frame. Have you been spinning your wheels for these many years?\n\nI am not trying to belittle you. I am trying to put into numbers that you have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps, and finish what you have started (weight loss). Don't prolong this. Weight loss should not be a life long endeavour. Which leads me into the next point. \n\nDevelop some life goals. Take your mind of food and weight. Food and body is not the be-all-end-all of life. When you begin to chase some truly big goal in life, be it academic, spiritual, financial etc, you will not only shift your focus away from food, making dieting easier, but will slowly boost your self-esteem and begin to change your self image. You don't want to look back after a few years, and be disappointed that you wasted the prime of your life thinking about food and body, when you could have done something bigger than yourself. \n\nOkay, this was a long response. It is coming from a place of experience and pain.\n\nActionable Steps.\n1. Calculate your true TDEE and Macros and stick to them. Don't listen to what family and friends have to say. Select a time-line and get the weight loss over with. Be bold, be assertive. Stand up for yourself where you need to. \n2. Change your self image, and choose some life-goals. For this, I would recommend you read Awaken the Giant Within.\n3. Cultivate new positive habits. I recommend you read The Power of Habit. \n\nIf you follow these three steps, I can guarantee your life will change. But you will need to remain disciplined. You will need to believe in yourself.  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can understand your predicament. I have been there. I have recovered. I relapse sometimes, but it is rare, and I don&amp;#39;t beat myself up over it. From your post, I can see that we must address many issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets start with the most basic issue. Your calories. Are you eating enough? I&amp;#39;m guessing from your post history that you are a girl, and I have seen time and time again that girls tend to be overly restrictive when it comes to calorie reduction. When you do this, you tend to stick to your diet for some time, but ultimately, when the opportunity arrises (a party, family gathering, general emotional highs/lows), your cravings overcome you, and you binge. Maybe cravings isn&amp;#39;t even the right word. You try to find comfort in food. This is the most common cause of binging. This issue can be addressed in two ways. Firstly, you must be eating calories below maintenance, but not to the point where food is always on your mind. Find out your TRUE TDEE and macros. If you need help with this, shoot me a PM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you must stop your emotional eating. Ups and downs are a part of life, but you shouldn&amp;#39;t try to fill in a void or express happiness with food. You should understand that food is basically just fuel for the body. I know it is hard to think this way, with the way media is shoving food up our faces all day, but you have to think along these lines to change your actions. I am not saying that you should go full Buddhist-mode and have complete detachment with food, but you should learn to cultivate the proper balance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next issue we must address is the pressure to eat from friends and family. I have faced this too. They will tell you to eat more, they will mock you, they will show how they eat whatever they want and are still fit. I have learnt that you cannot change people. You should at least once tell your family and friends that you have a goal to achieve and they should not berate you. If they do not understand, and still keep on compelling you to eat (which in my experience, they will), then you should distance yourself from them. They do not understand your desires and respect your choices. They are not worth it. I know it can seen trivial to distance yourself from friends and family on the basis of food, but let me tell you, this nature of theirs runs deeper than just food. Maybe you have realized this by now, maybe you will realize this later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we must address the major issue at hand. Your self-image and self-discipline. As this is a self-discipline, sub, let us first get this out of the way. You say that you have felt fat since Grade 4, and have been starving yourself since Grade 6. Going by your age, you should be in Grade 11-12 now. So in 5-6 years, you have been unable to get un-fat? If you were to lose even a lousy 1 lbs a month, you would have lost upwards of 60 lbs in this time frame. I don&amp;#39;t think you were carrying around that much fat when you were in Grade 6. Why are you still trying to lose weight? With proper discipline, losing a lbs of fat a week, you should have lost the required weight within a few short months, and should now well be on the way of bulking (GAINING WEIGHT!), so as to build a better muscular frame.

I know you must be having a really hard time right now and I feel for you. \n\n&gt; I quit therapy for the time being today because I dread going\n\nThis is my first advice: go back. It sounds like you're in group therapy, so it may be more easy to consider doing one on one instead? Whatever it is, you need someone to help you with this, it'll be much easier than going it alone.   \n\n&gt; I didn't eat over 2,000 calories Monday-Thursday this week. Yesterday I ate 1,400. Today I ate 2,800. \n\nI just want to point out one thing: People tend to look at calories like a day-by-day thing when sometimes it is more helpful to look at it as a week-by-week thing. \n\nWhat I mean is this: there are a lot of healthy eaters who will eat under maintenance on the weekday (cooking and packed lunches) to eat over maintenance on the weekend (alcohol, restaurants, desserts) and they *still* manage to overall maintain their weight. Why? Because your body isn't very careful about how it \"logs\" its calories: so long as you GENERALLY eat in a balanced way it doesn't matter. So when you're a healthy eater, reaching for that extra slice of pizza even if it's because of peer pressure isn't that big of a deal because you can just take it easy the next day or couple of days to make up for it. \n\nThat always takes the pressure off of me a little bit: knowing that its more of a fluid process helps you to feel less bad about yourself if you do happen to eat too much somedays. \n\nI also have a background of disordered eating during my teen years. At one point I was at 1200 a day every day for a year. it was a nightmare. in college when i started eating more regularly i actually grew two inches taller, so it was definitely stunting my growth. It's important to address it but feel hopeful that the damage at this point is completely addressable. I'm very happy and a healthy weight and I eat generally whatever I want, which tends to be everything from pizza to broccoli salads to greek yogurt to steak. So have hope! You CAN and WILL get better. \n\n&gt; I see people accomplish the goals they want to with food and I just can't. \n\nWhat about setting easier goals? What kind of goals have you been setting? Can you set one that simpler or easier to accomplish?  \n\n&gt; I don't know how to curb my own cravings\n\nIf you are undereating you are NOT going to curb them, because your cravings are your body's way of telling you to stop undereating. If you ate at maintenance for a few weeks to a month you should eat your cravings decrease. Also, if you're a vegetarian, you might want to consider adding more fats and proteins to your diet -- they satiate hunger (but only if you're eating a decent amount of food to begin with). \n\n&gt; But someone will want to force me to eat it out of their own self-interest I'm sure  \n\nI'm confused about this. Do you really have people forcing you to eat dairy products even when you're lactose intolerant? I feel like just saying \"I'm lactose-intolerant\" should be enough. Why do you think people are forcing you to eat? What self-interests does that serve? Just trying to understand what's going on :)\n\nPlease, please, PM me and we can continue this conversation further. And reach out to your therapist or another adult that you trust. Stay strong lady, if I did it you can do it!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;O girl I&amp;#39;m so sorry. I know you must be having a really hard time right now and I feel for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I quit therapy for the time being today because I dread going&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first advice: go back. It sounds like you&amp;#39;re in group therapy, so it may be more easy to consider doing one on one instead? Whatever it is, you need someone to help you with this, it&amp;#39;ll be much easier than going it alone.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t eat over 2,000 calories Monday-Thursday this week. Yesterday I ate 1,400. Today I ate 2,800. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to point out one thing: People tend to look at calories like a day-by-day thing when sometimes it is more helpful to look at it as a week-by-week thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I mean is this: there are a lot of healthy eaters who will eat under maintenance on the weekday (cooking and packed lunches) to eat over maintenance on the weekend (alcohol, restaurants, desserts) and they &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; manage to overall maintain their weight. Why? Because your body isn&amp;#39;t very careful about how it &amp;quot;logs&amp;quot; its calories: so long as you GENERALLY eat in a balanced way it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. So when you&amp;#39;re a healthy eater, reaching for that extra slice of pizza even if it&amp;#39;s because of peer pressure isn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal because you can just take it easy the next day or couple of days to make up for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That always takes the pressure off of me a little bit: knowing that its more of a fluid process helps you to feel less bad about yourself if you do happen to eat too much somedays. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a background of disordered eating during my teen years. At one point I was at 1200 a day every day for a year. it was a nightmare. in college when i started eating more regularly i actually grew two inches taller, so it was definitely stunting my growth. It&amp;#39;s important to address it but feel hopeful that the damage at this point is completely addressable. I&amp;#39;m very happy and a healthy weight and I eat generally whatever I want, which tends to be everything from pizza to broccoli salads to greek yogurt to steak. So have hope! You CAN and WILL get better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I see people accomplish the goals they want to with food and I just can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about setting easier goals? What kind of goals have you been setting? Can you set one that simpler or easier to accomplish?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to curb my own cravings&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are undereating you are NOT going to curb them, because your cravings are your body&amp;#39;s way of telling you to stop undereating. If you ate at maintenance for a few weeks to a month you should eat your cravings decrease. Also, if you&amp;#39;re a vegetarian, you might want to consider adding more fats and proteins to your diet -- they satiate hunger (but only if you&amp;#39;re eating a decent amount of food to begin with). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But someone will want to force me to eat it out of their own self-interest I&amp;#39;m sure  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confused about this. Do you really have people forcing you to eat dairy products even when you&amp;#39;re lactose intolerant? I feel like just saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m lactose-intolerant&amp;quot; should be enough. Why do you think people are forcing you to eat? What self-interests does that serve?

First--\n\nSome people asked about my friends, and I'll use an example from today to explain why I feel like I can't refuse my best friend: She brought some leftover cookies from her family over while hanging out this morning. I made sure to only eat one (I wouldn't eat more in front of another person, but if she wasn't there, I would have eaten plural). I tried to be firm, which was the last (generic) piece of advice my therapist gave me, and asked her to take the cookies home. She blatantly refused. I tried to be general but honest and said if they're around, I will for sure binge on them. And she REFUSED to take them home. I held them out and she set her arms down (before you guys think I was being rude, they were store-bought cookies and half of them were eaten when she brought them over--she didn't even ask if I wanted them). At that point I was desperate and told her she needed to take them. She said \"I can't believe you are getting so worked up about this.\" I honestly think I handled it well, and I never raised my voice or said anything rude to her, so that comment upset me and I just turned around and told her I'd see her later. *Then* she texted me later and asked if I was okay, and I beat around the bush because talking about my eating habits makes me uncomfortable, but I just sent her a long message (written in a non-accusatory way, I just told her about my eating habits which led into why I asked her to take the cookies--because I didn't want to purge that week). She took it really well and apologized and I think she understands where I'm at now. So, one friend is no longer an issue.\n\nAlso, I realistically *should* be the weight I want to be considering the time frame I gave, so I'll add some numbers. I'm 5'3.75. My highest weight was 137 pounds last May. I ate about 1200 calories a day, which turned into 900, then 800, then 500 until I was down to 112 pounds in September. Then, I don't know how it happened, but I binged my way back up to 125 about two months ago. Then I starved myself down to 120 (most days I only ate one apple with half a tablespoon of melted peanut butter). I'm about 125 again. I've always stayed between 115 and 130 pounds, which to be honest is a large range.
