The only productive thing i did was going to the gym, cooking and spending a bit of time with a girlbuddy of mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never been this blocked. It is crazy. All I did was sleep long, watch youtube/reddit and masturbate. What the hell? I can\u00b4t even get out of bed properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last months I have been doing really good actually. Stopped smoking 4 months ago without any relapse, quit my work because i needed more time for university and it wasnt really satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last weeks i tried to repair my willpower/concentration by limiting my internet/smartphone use, but boy did it go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have any tips how to get back on track?\nI am kinda lost. I don\u00b4t even do fun stuff because i feel guilty doing something fun without doing any work.
