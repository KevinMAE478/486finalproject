My life has been a little crazy- I was raised in a very intense Baptist household, got kind of kicked out of the church. I was always way too curious and asking questions that people couldn\u2019t answer- I was at odds with the church\u2019s disbelief in evolution, resistance to global warming, general intellectual inconsistency. I was always the black sheep asking why forever, there were instances where at a Bible study I made the pastor\u2019s wife cry, and was kicked off of the worship team by the pastor who ended up yelling at a sixteen year old girl who wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to get baptized. I always loved singing and that was maybe the final straw of what made me leave the community, being cut off from the one thing that made me feel close to God. The other kids my age at church really never accepted me, my first love interest was interested sexually but wouldn\u2019t date me because he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cunequally yoked\u201d as they say. I remember purity conferences and examples of how sex before marriage would leave you dirty forever, like the example of how just one drop of poison in apple juice ruins the whole thing, and nobody would ever want to drink you (what if someone was sexually assaulted? I thought). Everyone thought my best friend growing up and I would get married eventually, but as I \u201cstrayed from the path\u201d people started to realize that I didn\u2019t belong in the community. \nAnyway right after graduation I moved out and went to my local university in order to save money. There was a freshman first night and a girl asked for my number. We started a relationship and started doing crazy shit, we had threesomes and worked as camgirls making thousands of dollars, went to hotels and partied all the time. Eventually we went our separate ways but I still feel close to her in a way that I won\u2019t feel with anyone else because we have the same crazy obsession with sex to be honest, for me likely a result of Baptist repression and for her because that\u2019s the way she is. I went to France to study abroad and despite maybe hundreds of hours of practicing French on my own time, translating movie scripts and endless work, I felt wasn\u2019t able to improve very much at all. When I was there I would spend days alone in my messy room, and really only talked to other English speakers. People were a little harsh with me because of the whole American political climate but really I was just sensitive because it was the only time I felt stupid. \nI met a guy in Paris after posting on a website asking for someone to hold my bag (of winter clothes I brought to live in France) and getting to know him was the most natural, amazing thing in the world. He sailed across the Atlantic with his family over eight months, backpacked Southeast Asia, has been to like thirty countries total. When I got back to Paris after a month we had the most amazing time, I sat on his handlebars while zipping down the Champs-Elysee and explored the illegal part of the French catacombs, had sex in his kitchen and spent every moment possible together before I had to leave to go back home. Three days in a row together and the last day, we spent all night talking even though he had to go to work... it was literally like a movie. Unfortunately back at home things weren\u2019t so good, my parents were together when I left the country, but during my stay in France they had a fight so bad my mom got arrested and there was a restraining order so they still can\u2019t talk to each other.&lt;br/&gt;\nI went back to university but had trouble focusing. I started dating older guys for financial compensation, even a really emotionally demanding woman who would pay my rent and etc\u2026 it was just so hard to stay stimulated in these classes that didn\u2019t delve into the reality of issues (my major is political science at a state university with a really underwhelming program). I failed a lot of my classes and this semester I had to take a leave of absence (which I didn\u2019t even do properly). Nobody knows this, none of my friends or family, in January I went back to see this guy (on a Eurotrip funded by my sugar daddy). We had originally planned to spend the weekend together in a private Airbnb I paid for, but he totally bailed on me and we only spent the last afternoon in Paris together (the next day he was moving to a country in Africa for a year for work). Nothing happened between us and I bawled my eyes out and sexted my ex, lied to my friends that it was insanely romantic etc. I really only went on the trip for the chance to see him and it was honestly heartbreaking to experience. \n    The next semester I moved into this house with a crazy old guy (who had this enormous fiasco where he thought my booty call was my boyfriend that I was cheating on, refused to give me my security deposit back when I was trying to move out after my housemate was stealing stuff from my room), moved out, then decided on a whim to send French guy a message explaining my feelings for him and asking whether we could see each other \u201cif life ever pushed us to the same place\u201d. He responded incredibly enthusiastically, saying that he wanted a relationship with me, we talk every day now and I bought a ticket to visit him in Africa, and what\u2019s more I\u2019m meeting his parents. \n    However I lied about an internship I got (it was offered a long time ago but I never followed up on it) in order to give the impression that there was a path for us to live together in France someday, I\u2019m secretly not attending university anymore, I think I have an issue with the Adderall I\u2019m prescribed, I compulsively pick at my skin, I have a few sugar daddies who fund my lifestyle but most of the time I spend reading and studying languages and waiting to go to meet this guy. I have no discipline at all because so many amazing things have come so easily to me. This guy I want to be with is the opposite- he\u2019s so hardworking, completely uninvolved with social media or the web addiction I seem to have and I don\u2019t know how long I can keep up this crazy ruse with everyone in my life.
