This in itself has not been that big of a deal until now, I was disciplined and did not procrastinate that much, as long as I learned at the library and not at home. \nMy problem now consists of two ( and maybe a half parts): \n1. How do I stretch the effective learning at the library as long as possible?\n2. How do I better my discipline at home?\n2. \u00bd How do I better my discipline during the semester to prevent something like this learning marathon from having to happen again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For elaboration: \nI stand up allmost every day at 7 30 am. (8 on the weekend) and try to be at the library by 9 to 9 30. \nI then learn with on bigger pause, during which I go for a walk outside, until 12 or 12 30. Then I eat and go for a longer walk for about an hour. After that I learn for another two hours, with one or two short breaks to free my mind. That is the point at the day where my workeffort often goes downhill. It often starts with me getting tired and deciding I&amp;#39;m no longer learning effectively, so I go home with the plan to have a short break at home, do some chores and then learn and repeat what I learned up to that point. But most often it doesnt really come to that. The short break at home allways escalates, and even after having done the chores and getting some fresh air outside, I often dont really get back to learning, mostly opening the lectures and excercises on the laptop but never really getting into it. \nThis leads to my questions from before, mainly how to continue working after the location change, because I will have to do some work for the last exam in 9 days (Math if anyone cares) even before having written the exam in 5 days (Organic chem). \nI, know these kind of problems get posted here a lot, but I think for me, and many others its quite a big psychological thing, having the solutions said to me directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello r/getdisciplined !\n\nI need your help, just like many others before me. \nI'm currently at the end of week 6 of a 7 \u00bd  week learning marathon for university, because I failed all my exams and now had/have to repeat them in 3 big courses.
