I feel my anxiety decrease and my discipline level up. What I&amp;#39;m doing, I think, is tricking my brain into activating spiritual wires without actually believing in false concepts. I just took bare truths, coated them as spiritual path, and here you go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now I have some questions and I need certain advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Do you generally think this is a good idea?
