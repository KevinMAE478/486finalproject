Logically you know that getting to your long term goal will take a lot of hard work and patience. You know that nothing comes easily and the only way to get to your goal is to grind.\n\nHowever knowing something and internalizing it can be different things. This is probably why- at least in my opinion- you get started working and feel disillusioned because what's in your head is the end result, not whatever task that you're doing.\n\nFocusing on *product* leads to frustration, impatience, feelings of failure and despair, and even depression. Focusing on the end goal is detrimental to your progress because it is so far off that you can't possibly get a sense of the scale of effort and time you have to put in to achieve that goal.\n\nFocusing on *process* however, can alleviate some of those pains. Pride is my worst enemy as well, so when I heard of this, I really felt like it could help me. Focusing on the process means that you need to set smaller short term goals, and patiently, patiently work towards them. For example learning how to play the piano is a difficult, time-consuming task. You have to learn the notes, scales, chords, arpeggios, basic to advanced theory and even after all that practice until your fingers fly and your brain intuitively seeks out the proper keys. This takes years.\nInstead of having in your mind the image of a virtuoso tearing up the keyboard and adoring fans watching in awe, the goals must be turned inward. Your first goal should be a test to name all the notes correctly. Then play five notes without stumbling. Then a bar in a song.\n\nShort term goals lead to more feelings of accomplishment and steady progress towards a long term goal. This keeps you motivated to keep going, and it's easier to motivate yourself to start when you have a clear, reachable goal in mind. This is important because discipline relies on that image. If you see yourself playing pieces by Chopin, and you then struggle to find middle C, you're setting yourself up fo failure.\n\nIt is important, like what many others have said here, to really internalize that you are not a genius or gifted in any way. The slightest failure will make that image crumble. That being said, not being a genius doesn't automatically make you ordinary or worthless, and being ordinary doesn't mean being worthless. You have to realize that success comes from dogged determination. You can distinguish yourself from others by putting in hard work. You may not be a genius, but you will be a better role model to others when they know that you just pushed to get where you are, and you weren't necessarily gifted for that field. This means to them, that they can do it too, and your success will mean so much more once other people realize that.\n\nIt is, in my opinion, not possible to *not* have an ego. But it is possible to keep it in check, and that is hard to do. Working hard without using your ego, as you asked, *is* possible. It just takes training.\n\nWhenever you find yourself getting frustrated because your insecurities are coming out, it is best to stop and be aware of it. Take some time to breathe and reassure yourself that **patience** and **failure** are your greatest allies. \n\n*Process* over *Product*...\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My two cents:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big dreams are great to have, but they get in the way when that&amp;#39;s all you think about.

That being said, not being a genius doesn&amp;#39;t automatically make you ordinary or worthless, and being ordinary doesn&amp;#39;t mean being worthless. You have to realize that success comes from dogged determination. You can distinguish yourself from others by putting in hard work. You may not be a genius, but you will be a better role model to others when they know that you just pushed to get where you are, and you weren&amp;#39;t necessarily gifted for that field. This means to them, that they can do it too, and your success will mean so much more once other people realize that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is, in my opinion, not possible to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have an ego. But it is possible to keep it in check, and that is hard to do. Working hard without using your ego, as you asked, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible. It just takes training.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever you find yourself getting frustrated because your insecurities are coming out, it is best to stop and be aware of it. Take some time to breathe and reassure yourself that &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt; are your greatest allies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "name": "t1_dgduiil", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480787.0, "created_utc": 1492451987.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uzju", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uaqp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdmeg7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "5steelBI", "parent_id": "t3_65uaqp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/getdisciplined", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Action precedes motivation; ego is a phantasm.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action precedes motivation; ego is a phantasm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "name": "t1_dgdmeg7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492471705.0, "created_utc": 1492442905.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uzju", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uaqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uzju", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uaqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uzju", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uaqp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdplfs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FR_STARMER", "parent_id": "t1_dgdljzk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/getdisciplined", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Depends on the insecurities, but I generally confront them and take active measures to forgive myself for them or fix them if I can", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depends on the insecurities, but I generally confront them and take active measures to forgive myself for them or fix them if I can&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "name": "t1_dgdplfs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475343.0, "created_utc": 1492446543.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdljzk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Keenkeem", "parent_id": "t1_dgdd5ls", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/getdisciplined", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How would you start addressing your insecurities?
