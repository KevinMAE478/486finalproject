Best time is May-Sept when you can enjoy outdoor events. Don't pay attention the news about violence -- it's almost all concentrated FAR from where the tourist go.  Heck, New Orleans is far more dangerous -- they actually have high crime areas very close to lots of the tourist areas. \n\nA quick guide of things to do:\n\n1. Try local cusines. For best pizza, Lou Malnati's is the first choice with Giordanos as second choice. You can try Deep Dish / Stuffed Pizza or go with a chicago style [thin pizza](http://www.suitcasesandsippycups.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/chicago-thin-crust-pizza.jpg) that's actually more common here. Try Portillos and get [Italian Beefs](http://eleq31whb2-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portillo%E2%80%99s-Family-Recipe.jpg).\n2. Lots of museums -- many of which are among the best in the US. Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, Shed Aquarium, Art Institute  etc.    [The Art Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago) is actually one of the best art institutes in world. \n3. John Hancock -- they have a great views and a restaurant and bar about 1000 ft above.\n4. ~~Willis Tower~~ Sears Tower. Great view from about 1400ft above. It has a nice [sky deck view](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/28/0b/e8/280be89ed6e2d700158b3ed79883ceec.jpg)\n5. Take an archicture tour -- they have some by bus and some by river. \n6. Visit [Navy Pier](http://legacy.aboutparking.com/chicago/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chicago-navy-pier-1309392914-781.jpg)\n7. Walk around beautiful [downtown](http://svcdn.simpleviewinc.com/v3/cache/chicago/7D5B48744E38337E5DD846D0A57C9281.jpg), both the 'loop' and 'river north'. The 'loop' is the financial area with lots of touristy things. River North is where the best bars and restuarants are located. \n8. Watch some comedy show. Chicago might be #1 on comedy. [Second City](http://www.secondcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SC_1440x325_SecondCity_doc2016-234.jpg?_=1466453698) is famous for many famous comedians coming throgh. Some examples of Chicago Second City alumni: Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Steven Colbert, Steve Carell, Chris Farley, Bill Murray, John Belushi, etc. There is also IO Improv, Laugh Factory, and various other comedy shows. \n9. Go to Hyde Park: the beautiful [University of Chicago campus](https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/images/wallpapers/campus_city_lake_1280x800.jpg) and Museum of Science and Industry \n10. Enjoy the neighborhood areas -- old town, gold coast, lincoln park, lakeview / wrigleyville,etc. \n11. Unless you're coming from NYC, enjoy some of the fine theater. It's the best theater in the US outside of NYC. In fact, Chicago is usually the first stop for Broadway shows when they leave NYC and many Broadway shows start out in Chicago. Kinky Boots won best musical Tony award and was originally from the Chicago area. \n12. Lots more...will add more later if I have time.

Best time is May-Sept when you can enjoy outdoor events. Don&amp;#39;t pay attention the news about violence -- it&amp;#39;s almost all concentrated FAR from where the tourist go.  Heck, New Orleans is far more dangerous -- they actually have high crime areas very close to lots of the tourist areas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick guide of things to do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Try local cusines. For best pizza, Lou Malnati&amp;#39;s is the first choice with Giordanos as second choice. You can try Deep Dish / Stuffed Pizza or go with a chicago style &lt;a href=\"http://www.suitcasesandsippycups.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/chicago-thin-crust-pizza.jpg\"&gt;thin pizza&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#39;s actually more common here. Try Portillos and get &lt;a href=\"http://eleq31whb2-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portillo%E2%80%99s-Family-Recipe.jpg\"&gt;Italian Beefs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lots of museums -- many of which are among the best in the US. Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, Shed Aquarium, Art Institute  etc.    &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago\"&gt;The Art Institute&lt;/a&gt; is actually one of the best art institutes in world. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;John Hancock -- they have a great views and a restaurant and bar about 1000 ft above.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Willis Tower&lt;/del&gt; Sears Tower. Great view from about 1400ft above. It has a nice &lt;a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/28/0b/e8/280be89ed6e2d700158b3ed79883ceec.jpg\"&gt;sky deck view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take an archicture tour -- they have some by bus and some by river. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=\"http://legacy.aboutparking.com/chicago/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chicago-navy-pier-1309392914-781.jpg\"&gt;Navy Pier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walk around beautiful &lt;a href=\"http://svcdn.simpleviewinc.com/v3/cache/chicago/7D5B48744E38337E5DD846D0A57C9281.jpg\"&gt;downtown&lt;/a&gt;, both the &amp;#39;loop&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;river north&amp;#39;. The &amp;#39;loop&amp;#39; is the financial area with lots of touristy things. River North is where the best bars and restuarants are located. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Watch some comedy show.
