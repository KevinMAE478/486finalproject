And it's night and day. To an average American, the military can do no wrong, every dollar spent on it is justified, every honor given to every serviceperson is well-deserved, etc... Most nations simply aren't like this. US had a bit of a pushback against this after Vietnam, but unfortunately that ended.\n\n&gt; Name all these thousands of monuments/memorials to our military.\n\nFirst, it sounds like you are implying I said the word \"thousands\" somewhere, which I haven't. Second, do a Google search, and you'll see PLENTY more than for, for example, scientists, engineers, doctors, etc. I.e., more than for people who actually contributed to this nation's prosperity, as opposed to harming it.\n\nIf all you can think of are the things you mentioned, than you are even further under a rock than you've revealed yourself to be, so far.

If it provokes you, that&amp;#39;s your problem; it&amp;#39;d only be trolling if this was my intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalashnikov is certainly honored, but not for his military career. So already your pitiful counterargument is damaged. And it&amp;#39;s damaged even further when we recognize that one counterexample doesn&amp;#39;t mean shit when talking about trends. The reason I assert that the US adores its military much more than any other country is for a different reason: I actually know how people in the US and other countries, on average, view their nations&amp;#39; military organizations. And it&amp;#39;s night and day. To an average American, the military can do no wrong, every dollar spent on it is justified, every honor given to every serviceperson is well-deserved, etc... Most nations simply aren&amp;#39;t like this. US had a bit of a pushback against this after Vietnam, but unfortunately that ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Name all these thousands of monuments/memorials to our military.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, it sounds like you are implying I said the word &amp;quot;thousands&amp;quot; somewhere, which I haven&amp;#39;t. Second, do a Google search, and you&amp;#39;ll see PLENTY more than for, for example, scientists, engineers, doctors, etc. I.e., more than for people who actually contributed to this nation&amp;#39;s prosperity, as opposed to harming it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all you can think of are the things you mentioned, than you are even further under a rock than you&amp;#39;ve revealed yourself to be, so far. Just Google it, there a plenty in just about any big city, and more than a few in smaller ones, especially southern and original 13 colonies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pics", "name": "t1_dg8psx4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492170451.0, "created_utc": 1492141651.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7hr3w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dave_890", "parent_id": "t1_dg73txy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; There are plenty of monuments to servicemen in the US.
