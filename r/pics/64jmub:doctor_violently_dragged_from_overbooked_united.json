I remember thinking that it should be illegal for them to do that. I asked my mom why it was permitted, and she said it&amp;#39;s because not everyone makes the flight. It didn&amp;#39;t compute for me, because &amp;quot;what if everyone shows up?&amp;quot; is the next logical question. I wasn&amp;#39;t some prodigy - it&amp;#39;s common fucking sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The United premise that $800 compensation should be sufficient is horseshit. For me to fly now I have to drive an hour and a half to the airport to be there an hour and a half early to get through security. I&amp;#39;ve made plans for rental cars or a ride and accommodation on the other end. I probably am flying on the last possible day to get where I&amp;#39;m going if it&amp;#39;s for an event so that I minimize my time away from home and in a hotel. $800 is a financially generous compensation offer, but it doesn&amp;#39;t begin to address the complete hassle of changing all of the arrangements that surround the flight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;United is soooooooo boned. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pics", "name": "t1_dg2x38a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491873590.0, "created_utc": 1491844790.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 228}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64jmub", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg30w22", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sardonnicus", "parent_id": "t1_dg2w775", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If the airline is going to gamble on people not showing up, then they can assume the liability of costs if everyone does show up.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the airline is going to gamble on people not showing up, then they can assume the liability of costs if everyone does show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pics", "name": "t1_dg30w22", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491877578.0, "created_utc": 1491848778.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2w775", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 299, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dsafire", "parent_id": "t1_dg2u4vx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It is.
