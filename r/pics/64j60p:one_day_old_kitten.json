But worse.\n\nFirst off, kittens cant pee or poo on their own for a while. You literally have to rub their crotches until they go for a few weeks. This has to be done two or three times a day. And they *will* end up with mud butt. Like a lot. \n\nYou also can't really bathe kittens. They're so tiny they can't maintain their body temperature without help so if you just bathe a kitten then leave it alone, it'll likely get hypothermia and die. So you have to bathe it then dry it as best you can then swaddle it with a towel until it's completely dry. This is a constant thing because kittens can get too cold easily and will die if that happens.\n\nFeeding is also a pain in the nuts. You'll have to feed them with a syringe for a loooong time because they cant handle solid foods. You should also give them water this way, kittens don't understand that they need to drink water so they'll ignore it if you just leave it there and die of dehydration (seeing a theme here?).\n\nThey also don't get that food comes in multiple forms so once they start associating the syringe with food, you have to actively train them that a bowl of milk replacer is actual food and not just a fun puddle. They literally do not understand that what's in the syringe and the bowl are the exact same thing and will struggle like mad to get to the syringe, splashing through the bowl of food, instead of drinking from the bowl.\n\nAnd the feeding has to be done every 2-3 hours. You want to sleep a full night? Tough shit, kids gotta eat. You have to go to work? Better smuggle those little bastards in because they'll be in bad shape by the time you get back home from an 8 hour day with no food.\n\nThey basically need 24-7 care for eight months. And if you want some time off, you'd better hope you can find a cat sitter that knows what they're doing because if they don't the kittens will die.\n\nAnd to top it all off, some of them will probably still die. Birth defects and general developmental problems often manifest in one or two of the kittens and these problems are generally not compatible with life. So even if you do *everything* right, one or two (or more) could still die on you anyways.\n\nA lot of people aren't ready for that. Having held a two week old kitten in my hands as it took its last breath, you are never ready for that. \n\nSorry if that brought people down a bit. I just get a little frustrated when I see people fawning over young kittens or bringing them home to care for them when they're a few days old and they have no idea what they're doing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As adorable as they are, I do not miss dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t realize just how much &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; it is to care for newborn kittens, mainly because the mother usually does 99% of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve handled several litters of newborns with no momma and it&amp;#39;s like having actual human children. But worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, kittens cant pee or poo on their own for a while. You literally have to rub their crotches until they go for a few weeks. This has to be done two or three times a day. And they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; end up with mud butt. Like a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also can&amp;#39;t really bathe kittens. They&amp;#39;re so tiny they can&amp;#39;t maintain their body temperature without help so if you just bathe a kitten then leave it alone, it&amp;#39;ll likely get hypothermia and die. So you have to bathe it then dry it as best you can then swaddle it with a towel until it&amp;#39;s completely dry. This is a constant thing because kittens can get too cold easily and will die if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeding is also a pain in the nuts. You&amp;#39;ll have to feed them with a syringe for a loooong time because they cant handle solid foods. You should also give them water this way, kittens don&amp;#39;t understand that they need to drink water so they&amp;#39;ll ignore it if you just leave it there and die of dehydration (seeing a theme here?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also don&amp;#39;t get that food comes in multiple forms so once they start associating the syringe with food, you have to actively train them that a bowl of milk replacer is actual food and not just a fun puddle. They literally do not understand that what&amp;#39;s in the syringe and the bowl are the exact same thing and will struggle like mad to get to the syringe, splashing through the bowl of food, instead of drinking from the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the feeding has to be done every 2-3 hours. You want to sleep a full night? Tough shit, kids gotta eat. You have to go to work?
