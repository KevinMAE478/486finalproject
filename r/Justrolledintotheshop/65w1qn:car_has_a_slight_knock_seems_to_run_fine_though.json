There&amp;#39;s very much less getting underneath the hood and tinkering, bodging together a fix to keep the car together until coming home, and that&amp;#39;s due to better engineering all around. Of course, they&amp;#39;re commensurately more expensive to fix when they go wrong, but the idea here is that with minimal maintenance, cars even from 15-20 years ago can run quite problem free, which was not at all the case.
