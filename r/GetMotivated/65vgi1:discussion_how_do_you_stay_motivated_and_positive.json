I have had a though life and been depressed with loads of ups and downs. \n\nWhat really keeps me going is my social life, going out with friend and really talk about the shit that's bothering you. Make your friends help you. Friends that help you make you get a good connection with eachother and makes the friendship have more depth.

This may be the hardest part but just try everyday with baby steps and in no time you'll be having less of a hard time being not positive. Failing isn't bad. Failing makes you stronger and failing makes you know yourself allot better. \n\n\nEdit: Forgot to tell. That eventhough I live the life i've wanted and fought for it for years.
