Im less than two weeks off the pain medicine and a few other medications they had me pumped on for a while im happy to make moves and move forward. im struggling now by looking at all the amazing things people in my life do around me and have the capability of doing and i get very angry and jealous in a way which is saddening. i recently have been more reclusive but i bought myself a les paul and managed to express myself and feelings through music and learning that by giving myself something todo. i just have so many things going on right now i feel like its never going to end and the pain will never subside it will only be shoved under the table and covered up by occupying myself. Right now my biggest worry is that im off disability and i cant get the motivation to get a job or find a job that will give me benefits as mine runs out in july. my only option is to go back to my union and start construction again which i think can be dangerous for myself and id be a slow worker as im still in recovery. im just extremely stuck right now and i feel frozen in time at the moment. im trying to live day to day but thats just procrastinating all of the lawyers, doctors and other bulshit that needs to be handled. the best thing in my life right now i can say is playng the guitar but its just a distraction. im finding it really hard to completely switch the way i think into a more positive manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "name": "t1_dgafghs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492270781.0, "created_utc": 1492241981.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaf7sc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mobilebloke", "parent_id": "t1_dgacdhk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GetMotivated", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh no - I am really sorry to hear that .
