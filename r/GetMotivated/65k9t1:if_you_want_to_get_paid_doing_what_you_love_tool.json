This was her first big success! Once she had a few jobs completed for people, clients began to flock to her. A few months down the road she landed a contract for a Fortune 500 making double what she had been in child care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Determination goes a long way if you stay focused and committed to what you love. I&amp;#39;m glad I got to help her and experience her success first hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR--- gf wasn&amp;#39;t happy in childcare, had her quit, focused on writing,  ended up making double her salary in around 6 months&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "name": "t1_dgb7wyv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321356.0, "created_utc": 1492292556.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k9t1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k9t1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb8bhh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PiggiePutz", "parent_id": "t1_dgb7tcn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GetMotivated", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Actually I would rather earn the minimum to survive to do the thing I love than to make it big doing something I don't like.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually I would rather earn the minimum to survive to do the thing I love than to make it big doing something I don&amp;#39;t like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "name": "t1_dgb8bhh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321915.0, "created_utc": 1492293115.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k9t1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k9t1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgchpxg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YOUR_DEAD_TAMAGOTCHI", "parent_id": "t1_dgb8a10", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GetMotivated", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How do you come up with new goals and dreams?
