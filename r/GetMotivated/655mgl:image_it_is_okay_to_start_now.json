It&amp;#39;s particularly hard for ADHD peeps, we think &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve wasted all day, I&amp;#39;m such a fuckup, nothing k can do now&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve wasted a few hours but have some things I really want to do, I&amp;#39;ll start now&amp;quot; and this just gets worse over the timespan of years. The past bears to relevance to the present, just do now what you want to do now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: the reason this means a lot to me is that I&amp;#39;m starting my own business right now after a decade in college working on degrees I am not using. It&amp;#39;s so tempting to think &amp;quot;Why the hell wasn&amp;#39;t I doing this for the last ten years&amp;quot; whenever I notice how much I love it and how good at it I am, but that sort of thinking will mess you up. The past is dead. The future doesn&amp;#39;t exist. Make the best of your life now, there&amp;#39;s no other time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "name": "t1_dg863d9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143998.0, "created_utc": 1492115198.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7vb6y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RoadHogsCousin", "parent_id": "t3_655mgl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GetMotivated", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can relate to this.
