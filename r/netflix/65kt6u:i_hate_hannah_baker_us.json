I hate Hannah baker. Let&amp;#39;s unpack this, fuckstorm that Hannah can&amp;#39;t-communicate-Baker has created shall we? So let&amp;#39;s see. Hannah goes through a series of rigorous events throughout her 3 years of high school. Starting with her short time with Justin Foley. Justin didn&amp;#39;t do that much wrong. Yeah, he took a dumb picture but he isn&amp;#39;t the one who sent it out. Hannah instead of communicating, went into &amp;quot;woe is me&amp;quot; mode and never even got his side of the story. And this starts the whole &amp;quot;everyone&amp;#39;s against me&amp;quot; theme. Now Hannah has this annoying little habit of freaking out and then never explaining herself and expecting people to understand her. Like when she freaks out on clay and the guidance councilor. She also never properly explains herself saying he &amp;quot;kind of&amp;quot; forced himself on her. She also turns small situations into big things, such as Jess slapping her. Jess later on apologized and it should&amp;#39;ve boiled over by then. She also blames Alex for every sexual case of sexual assault that she&amp;#39;s been faced with, when the fact of the matter is, that was the choice of each individual and not Alex&amp;#39;s complete doing. Bryce was a known douchebag, and him grabbing her ass was his doing. Not Alex&amp;#39;s. Matter of fact, Hannah dumps a bigger load on everyone than they deserve. With the exception of Bryce and Tyler. Both situations in which she SHOULDVE thought to contact the police first. Now in cases like with Ryan, Ryan was trying to do Hannah a favor, and could&amp;#39;ve released her identity if he wanted to cause her actual humiliation and yet he didn&amp;#39;t. And he deserves to have her suicide pinned on him? Hannah killing herself already turned their worlds on its head, and then to add insult to injury she had to send around tapes and guilt them into why she killed herself? Her notes serves as her trial against them, when in certain situations she could&amp;#39;ve turned it on herself. As in when she saw Jessica being raped. Hannah acted selfishly and didn&amp;#39;t inform her, and then had the audacity to record it on the tapes for OTHERS TO HEAR something that should&amp;#39;ve been PRIVATE and then she cites it as a reason for her suicide? The rape had nothing to DO with Hannah. She&amp;#39;s constantly making everything out to be about her. She had no right to share that story and cry victim. As if her suicide was some sort of victory against them? she didn&amp;#39;t even leave a note for her parents. The ones who needed an explanation most. Hannah just left all her problems for the rest of them to unpack while she got to taunt them from the grave. Hannah was a selfish bitch. Her blood is on no one but her.
