I can write a book and sell you the rights for the US edition, op for the UK version  and keep the Canadian and Australian versions for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And 25 years from now when someone wants to make a movie on that book they need to negotiate separate deals for each country.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Movie and tv studios are huge inter woven messes, with decades of agreements between them which is part of what makes it hard.  Whomever paid for the exclusive distribution rights for star wars in France in 1976 or 77 wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about rogue one in 2016, but that entity has rights in France etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Eu has worked hard to harmonise rules, but the rest of us... Not so much.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think any of these rules even make the movie studios happy really because it just costs a shit load of money for lawyers.
