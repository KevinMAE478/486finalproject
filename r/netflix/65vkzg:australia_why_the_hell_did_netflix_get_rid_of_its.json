Simply, because if something is borderline, people tend to go &amp;quot;meh&amp;quot; and give it a thumbs-down, and on top of it, they&amp;#39;re mostly angry about the new system, instead of liking it. So that&amp;#39;s an additional psychological, subconscious factor that gives a (former) three-star ranking a thumbs-down. After several months, Netflix will have more thumbs-down than thumbs-up.  When on the fence, people generally feel &amp;quot;nargh, not good enough for me&amp;quot;, and combined with anger over the new systems, we&amp;#39;ll see more three stars becoming thumbs-down than thumbs-up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "netflix", "name": "t1_dge2g5u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489719.0, "created_utc": 1492460919.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qoxj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkzg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qoxj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkzg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeenoi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "practicalguy", "parent_id": "t1_dgdvj02", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/netflix", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I heard that, what was all that about and any facts?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah I heard that, what was all that about and any facts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "netflix", "name": "t1_dgeenoi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492504921.0, "created_utc": 1492476121.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qoxj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkzg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge28o8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cainoom", "parent_id": "t1_dgdvj02", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/netflix", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yepp, especially her.
