I figured I&amp;#39;d not be happy with the framing device and the changes to the show, but wanted to try and give the actual riffing a fair shake so tried to watch it on the weight of its own merit. It&amp;#39;s definitely differently paced, slower with less jokes thrown at you per minute. Also they seem to not go for some jokes that would seemingly be obvious, not entirely sure why. Could it possibly be more aimed at a children&amp;#39;s audience moreso than prior shows? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also it seems strange to have the new guy making callbacks to other season&amp;#39;s jokes, mebbe if just Crow/Tom did so? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan to keep watching, but right now it sort of feels like it&amp;#39;s unjustly trading on the earlier seasons, making flat references to earlier better shows.
