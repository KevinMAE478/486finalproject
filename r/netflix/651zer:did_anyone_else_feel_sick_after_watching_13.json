Drinking, smoking, drugs, stalking, rape, fighting, lying, sex, etc. We just gave ammo to the teenagers already doing these things.\n2nd Those who are being treated like this now have and idea or ideas for revenge. do we really want a victim facing criminal charges because of revenge. they are a victim and in need of help.\n3rd A lot of kids are just naive to these things. Do they need to be exposed in such a real way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sure I will get down voted by teenagers and parents who let their kids smoke weed and drink. But the truth is no teenager should even be thinking about what goes on in this show. And if a child is being abused as this girl was they need to know there is help. (spoiler I read about the ending) She sought help and there was none there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have known people who have committed suicide.
