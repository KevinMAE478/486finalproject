It had offices and a brake room and even cells. And as early teenagers, my friends and I went wild and transformed the derelict into our club house, moving couches and games in and drawing all over the walls. There were a lot of other children in my street and as the police station was so close it became the default hang out for us; if you wanted to hang out you&amp;#39;d just walk to the station rather then to one of your friends houses. The building was very dark as it had no power and most of its windows were smashed, it was a dump, but none of us were ever scared or paranoid there as we were so used to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this insistent happened, like I said, when I was around 13. One morning at around 10 I walked to the abandoned police station to see if my friends were already there. When I arrived I called out and looked through the building, but it was empty. For a while I screwed around in one room at the back which was our main hangout with the couches. After I&amp;#39;d been in the building for maybe 5 minutes I heard some sort of creaking shifting sound, like floorboards straining or your house creaking in the wind. It was coming from the front of the building and I immediately assumed it was my friends arriving. I followed the noise towards some small office rooms near the main entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned into the room I was met with a shadow person, textbook definition; figure of a human, no details, blacker then black. However unlike most shadow person encounters it wasn&amp;#39;t hidden in my peripheral vision, it was standing, perfectly still, about two meters in front of me. It was very tall and although it had no face I felt like it was looking at me. I was so shocked that I seemed to freeze, just staring at it for what felt like minutes but would have only been a handful of seconds. At this point my eyes were watering out of fear, I snapped out of my shocked daze when the shadow person moved its leg and started to step towards me. With this I instantly turned and fled, sprinting through the derelict and not looking back. Once I was outside I looked back and saw it standing just inside the doorway, in this entrance foyer. It was still and facing me like it was before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went strait to my main friend&amp;#39;s place and told him, slept there the night too. Most of my friends believed me but plenty said I was full of shit. My mother could see I was scarred but just thought I&amp;#39;d gotten myself paranoid. My friends and I went back to the building eventually, and we didn&amp;#39;t find anything out of the ordinary, a few years later it was brought and renovated into a home. To this day I doubt what happened, thinking logically I tell myself I was just an overly imaginative child, but it felt so real and vivid and out of the blue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing I distinctly remember was this feeling I got when I looked at it.

A shadow used to come in to my room at night. It changed in sizes but was always in the shape of a diamond. It would float but moved like ink under water. I could never tell if it was smoke or water, more like a balance of black ink-water-smoke that would ripple and catch light oddly from a source not in the room. It seemed almost like smokey velvet. It would fk with me during the day, it was pretty bold but usually only bothered me and would usually only show himself at night. After we moved out of that house from when I was 4-8 the house made the paper 3 months after we moved. It made the front page, it had almost burned down and the only room that burned was my room. I can never forget, it's really traumatizing, believe kids if they tell you these things. Especially if they're crying their guts out and screaming, don't be slow to act like my parents.

Wasn&amp;#39;t until I was 13 I decided to believe in myself and ignore the asshole adults that never believed me. I remember it, what happened, there are no explanations in mainstream but I am not crazy or have an over-active imagination or whatever bs other people tried to make me believe because of their fear or doubt. A shadow used to come in to my room at night. It changed in sizes but was always in the shape of a diamond. It would float but moved like ink under water. I could never tell if it was smoke or water, more like a balance of black ink-water-smoke that would ripple and catch light oddly from a source not in the room. It seemed almost like smokey velvet. It would fk with me during the day, it was pretty bold but usually only bothered me and would usually only show himself at night.
