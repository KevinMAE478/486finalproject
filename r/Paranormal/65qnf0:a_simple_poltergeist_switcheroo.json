But I&amp;#39;m writing about it now because it just happened and it&amp;#39;s been a longgg time since anything this obviously glitchy happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run a couple vintage booths and have to write manual tags for everything. I use two sizes of manila tag, I think a 1.5x3 and a larger business card size, 2.5x3.75 or so. I&amp;#39;m running out of the larger size because, like my Reddit posts, my tag descriptions can run long. The more history or info about an item, the better it sells. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was pricing some military surplus jackets, and I had exactly four large tags in my hand to use on them. I placed them on my desk in front of my computers. Only other things on desk were a few smaller tags and hemp string. \nThen, standing in place, I turned 180 degrees to get the jackets off my work table, then 90 degrees more to get a sharpie from a supply cart. A second later I turn around and the tags are gone from the desk. Vanished. I look on the floor, I physically move the small tags to make sure the big ones aren&amp;#39;t mixed in. Gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So im annoyed because I&amp;#39;m almost out of these tags, and haven&amp;#39;t ordered any more yet. I check my supply box on the work table to see if I can scrounge any more out, and I do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turn around and my original 4 missing tags are back on my desk behind me. The desk I searched for them. And they weren&amp;#39;t even in the same arrangement from when I placed them down haphazardly before- they are stacked and fanned out like a hand of playing cards! Almost like who/whatever &amp;#39;stole&amp;#39; them brought them back and displayed them for maximum attention, like &amp;#39;look what I can do! Are &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; what you were looking for?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I literally get a chill. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I had the first four tags on the desk and still have the 4 new ones in my hand- just to clarify that I didn&amp;#39;t somehow pick up and put down any since the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had keys or wallet go missing from the spot where I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; put them only to have them reappear &lt;em&gt;in that spot&lt;/em&gt; only when I&amp;#39;m frustrated and have given up on going out. Same is true for everyone. You kind of start to assume that, okay, you&amp;#39;re just forgetful, or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this happened within a minutes time in the maybe 8x8 radius of my home studio- and the fanning of the rematerialized tags is the eerie cherry on top.
