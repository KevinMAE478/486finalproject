When I asked, he turned around real quick and said &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; and he had a funny look on his face.  I have no intention of just straight up coming out with all this to him, but if he asks me a question, I&amp;#39;m not going to lie to his face.  So instead I just said &amp;quot; Because I can see straight down into that bedroom at night and it&amp;#39;s dark.&amp;quot;  He said &amp;quot;so&amp;quot; and I could tell something was not exactly wrong, but not right with him and I said &amp;quot;are you really sure you want me to tell you?&amp;quot;  He just looked at me and finally said, &amp;quot;Nope. But I can tell you right now that there&amp;#39;s no fucking way I&amp;#39;m ever touching that door down there again.  Close our bedroom door instead, please.&amp;quot;  So I did.  We went out of town Saturday morning and went straight up to my house.  Now I&amp;#39;m sorta torn. I want to know why he reacted the way he did, but I don&amp;#39;t want to freak him out. And to be clear, nothing about him is weak or however you want to put it.  He&amp;#39;s a big guy, he doesn&amp;#39;t put up with bullshit, etc.  But I feel like if I say to him whats happening, he&amp;#39;s going to flip out and start packing and honestly, I have no desire to move again....  (which makes me sound like a complete asshole.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So mid February my boyfriend and I rented a house together in the town he lives in.  I actually live in a small town 3 hours away and we are basically always at my house, except every other weekend.  Basically, we rented this house to use for a total of 5 full days out of the month....it&amp;#39;s ridiculous but that&amp;#39;s not really part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had an incident in his previous house (structural related) and had to find a new place very quickly.  So I found this house in a very nice neighborhood and we went and looked at it.  The family living there at the time was half way packed up (they had 5 kids) and they had broken their lease after only a couple of months, because according to the homeowner, the husband had a new job offer about 8 hours away and they were moving.  I didn&amp;#39;t think a single thing of it, he was in basically the same field as my boyfriend and this is a pretty common occurrence.  There was really no check on us at all, we talked, he sat down with us and we signed a lease.  Easiest house I&amp;#39;ve ever rented in my life.  So a few weeks later, we get keys to move in and we were pretty excited.  We brought a blow up bed and bedding and moved the tv in so we would at least have that for our first night.  We got a pizza and had a little picnic on the bed, watched a movie and everything was good.  We went to bed pretty early, around 8:30 I think, so we could get up early and get as much done as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I go further, let me give you a layout of the house.  Think of a rectangle with the kitchen and living room on one end, then going forward the dining room and hall way and a bedroom run parallel and then it dead ends at the hallway which runs across it with 2 bedrooms and a bathroom at one end and the master bedroom at the other end. (See my weird drawing below - not the best but you get the idea )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Weird drawing didn&amp;#39;t work.  It&amp;#39; was all skewed.  You&amp;#39;ll have to imagine it instead.  Sorry guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SO, we put our blowup bed where the edge of the hallway is by the living room (Where the L is in Living Room).  At some point in the middle of the night, I woke up (I don&amp;#39;t sleep a lot) and sat up looking at the end of the hallway and there was a man standing there.  I sucked most of the air right out of the room and started to jump up and he was gone.  Not like he walked off...he was just gone.  My boyfriend rolled over and asked if I was ok and since I thought I was dreaming I said yes and he went back to sleep.  As soon as he was back to snoring, I got up and went down the hall and stood there (I don&amp;#39;t know why....because I&amp;#39;m totally stupid is the only thing I can come up with).  Every hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I was sort of vibrating, not shaking exactly, more, almost like when you shiver because you&amp;#39;re cold.  I just stood there because I wasnt&amp;#39; sure where he went and I wasn&amp;#39;t even sure I was awake when I saw him.  I didn&amp;#39;t hear anything or see anything else so I went and got back in bed.  I laid there for a really long time trying to figure out if I saw something, or if I was asleep and at some point, feel back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next night, after moving a bunch of stuff and getting smacked pretty hard in the forehead with a china hutch, we went to bed in the same place.  A little after 3 I woke up because I could feel someone breathing directly on my face.  I thought it was my boyfriend and my first thought was to push him over away from me.  So I opened my eyes expecting to see him and I was facing the opposite way from him, towards the kitchen.  Obviously it wasn&amp;#39;t him breathing on me.  I laid really still and just listened.  All I could hear was him. I was laying there, trying to figure out what it was and &amp;#39;someone/thing&amp;#39; said my name.  Didn&amp;#39;t sound like my boyfriend by I said &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; anyway.  It jarred him awake enough to say &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s wrong&amp;quot; and I said something like &amp;quot;I thought you said my name&amp;quot; and he said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and went back to sleep.  At this point, I&amp;#39;m laying there, thinking I&amp;#39;m losing my ever-lovin mind, trying to figure out what is going on.  I&amp;#39;m over tired?  Just a new place?  Vents? Tricks of light? The smack in the forehead? I convince myself it&amp;#39;s all bullshit and go back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday we get up, get some things done and drive the 3 hours to my house so we can get to work all week....everything is normal, nothing weird, all is right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday, back up to the new house.  Spend the night in the living room again and I can&amp;#39;t sleep....like at all.  I&amp;#39;m wide awake and extremely annoyed because we were having furniture delivered Saturday morning and a bunch of other stuff.  It was going to be a crazy day.  I would close my eyes and it was like they had a mind of their own and they would pop open.  SO I put a movie in (Deadpool) and sat up to watch it.  At the angle I&amp;#39;m sitting at, the hallway is still in front of me off to my left.  I&amp;#39;m watching the moving, taking a mental inventory of all the crap we are doing tomorrow and there he is, at the end of the hall, watching me watch tv.  I could see him out of the corner of my eye but I didn&amp;#39;t look at him.  I just sat there staring at (well basically through) the tv.  Nothing happened, he didn&amp;#39;t move at all or anything.  I finally looked directly at him and he was gone.  Now I&amp;#39;m starting to think I&amp;#39;m nuts.  Like seriously nuts.  So I sat there and waited...and nothing.  I finally fell asleep about 4:30 and we were up by 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the following weekend.  Friday night we go to bed in our new bed in our actual bedroom.  So if you look at the &amp;quot;drawing&amp;quot;, our bedroom is on one end and there is another bedroom all the way down the hall, straight across from ours.  The doors open straight at each other.  We&amp;#39;re in bed watching a movie and the boyfriend falls asleep.  He&amp;#39;s asleep maybe 20 minutes when I roll over, towards the door to try to go to sleep.  I can see straight into the room at the end of the hallway, which is empty.  Someone is standing there.  I get out of bed, I&amp;#39;m looking at him and I walk straight down the hall to the bed room and flip on the light and - nothing.  I seriously wanted to jump up and down and have a full blown temper tantrum.  This was really starting to make me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since that night, I have seen this &amp;quot;man&amp;quot; almost every single night I&amp;#39;ve been there.  My boyfriend has been at the house a few times now by himself and he has called me late at night and said that the house creeps him out but he doesn&amp;#39;t know why.  I haven&amp;#39;t said a single word to him about any of this. If he knew, he&amp;#39;d freak out and pack up and move.  I don&amp;#39;t know what it is, if anything.  I used to see a man standing in my hallway in another house, my daughter saw him too (oddly enough she moved out a couple weeks later) and he looks very similar to the man in the new house. The only way to describe him is if you have ever seen the movie &amp;quot;I know what you did last summer&amp;quot; and you can remember the guy in the fishermans rain gear and the hook....yeah, like that more or less.  I&amp;#39;m headed back up there tonight.  I REALLY want to set up a video camera and see WTF is going on...like maybe I&amp;#39;m dreaming it - you know, every single night I&amp;#39;m in the house and not on any other nights - or maybe it&amp;#39;s something.  But I&amp;#39;m waaaaaay more afraid of what I might find in the video.....or hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "EDIT: Nothing overly interesting, but I went up Friday night and tried to very casually ask my boyfriend if he would mind if I closed the bedroom door down the hall when we went to bed.
