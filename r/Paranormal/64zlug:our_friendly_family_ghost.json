It&amp;#39;s not the scariest paranormal story ever, but when something like this happens to you, it&amp;#39;s terrifying in that moment. And it becomes a memory that sticks with you forever. Okay, here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2007, when I was 15, my family moved into a nice, 3-story house built in the 1980&amp;#39;s. I was excited to move to a new place and make new friends and just start fresh with school and with life. Anyway, a few weeks after we moved in, we started to notice some weird things happening in our home. Some of our belongings would be moved around to different places of the house, we&amp;#39;d occasionally hear footsteps when no one was walking around, and our dog would bark at random empty spaces in the rooms. Stuff like this happened for months. I used to joke to my friends about the house being haunted, even though at the time I didn&amp;#39;t actually think it was. But about a year after we moved in, more intense things would happen. At one point, I was in my room when I heard a heavy breath sigh into my ear at the same time my bedroom door slowly began to open. No one was there, of course. That&amp;#39;s when I realized that our house definitely had an uninvited guest in it. But whatever it was didn&amp;#39;t seem to be harmful in any way, so to make myself less scared, I gave the ghost a name (Roger) and pretended he was just like a roommate. \nFast forward to when I&amp;#39;m 17 years old. It was a Saturday night and my parents went to their friend&amp;#39;s house for drinks. They usually stay there pretty late so I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting them home until at least 1:00 am. My brother was staying at a friend&amp;#39;s house so my parents left me in charge of taking care of the animals. 11:00pm rolls around and I had already crated my dog for the night and was watching tv in the tv room. The tv room is directly across from my bedroom. I was lying on the couch watching tv when the door to the tv room swings open SO fast and stops just as quickly. I can&amp;#39;t explain it. There&amp;#39;s no way it was a gust of wind. Not the way it stopped so suddenly. I actually jumped off the couch and stared at the door. I assumed it was my brother who came home from his friend&amp;#39;s house and was playing a prank on me. &amp;quot;Alan??&amp;quot; I called out. &amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; There was no answer so I walk over to the door. I stare across the hall and in the doorway to my bedroom, just 10 feet from me, I saw the outline of a very tall, skinny man. Now for those of you who have never been in a situation like this I can only explain it as your mind being so terrified that your body takes over and you can hardly control your reaction. Well my instant reaction was to hit the light switch in the hall, which was halfway between the two rooms. So yes, I ran towards the figure to turn the lights on. But I didn&amp;#39;t tell myself to do it, I just did it, like a reflex. Anyway, the light turned on and suddenly there&amp;#39;s no one in my doorway anymore. After a minute, I compose myself, trying to piece together what I saw. I slowly crept towards my room and turned the bedroom light on. No one was in my room. I thought.... Maybe it was my brother. Maybe he somehow snuck past me in my state of terror when I jumped towards the light switch. So, I decided to go to the down the hall to  where my brother&amp;#39;s room is. I&amp;#39;m calling out his name as I walk to towards his room. I open his door and go to flip the light switch....but the lights didn&amp;#39;t turn on. All you can see in the room is the faint moonlight coming through the windows. Well, I look up after failing to turn the lights on and I see a big, black, shadowy figure quickly glide across the windows. My heart skipped a few beats, and this time, my reflex was to run. I sprinted back down the hall and went back into the tv room, closing the door behind me and locking it. I was starting to have a panic attack and could barely breathe. I grabbed my phone and called my best guy friend who lives just a few minutes away; much closer than where my parents and my brother were that night. He picks up the phone and I&amp;#39;m gasping for air, trying to explain what just happened.\n&amp;quot;Wait, wait...there is someone in your house??&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;No...I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot; I was gasping.\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m coming over.&amp;quot;\nLess than 10 minutes later, my friend shows up, and I&amp;#39;m a little more put together. I explain to him exactly what I saw. We turned all the lights on in the house, let my dog out of her crate because I knew she would protect us if there was a real intruder in the house, and went into every room of the house to make sure no one was there. We also went back to my brother&amp;#39;s room, and low and behold.... the light switch worked this time. I swore to my friend that it didn&amp;#39;t work before. And it&amp;#39;s the only switch on the wall right here, so it&amp;#39;s not like I was hitting the wrong switch.\nMy friend stayed with me until my parents came home. I didn&amp;#39;t even tell them what happened because I knew they wouldn&amp;#39;t believe me.\nI refused to sleep in my bedroom for the next week or two because of what I saw standing in the doorway that night. I slept in the tv room with the door locked.\nA year later, at age 18, I went to college and moved out. And 7 years later, to this day, when I visit my parents I still feel like Roger the ghost is there, watching me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: I actually have an old video on my phone from a few years ago when I was back from college, and before I bought my own home where I live now. I just uploaded it onto YouTube just so I could share the link with you. It was late at night and the dog and cat were both staring at my bedroom door so I thought I would take a video to show how weird they were being when my door started to open. I still show this video to my friends sometimes and they all freak out and refuse to ever visit my parents&amp;#39; house. Lol. Whether you believe me or not, I can promise you that there was no draft and no one was behind the door.
