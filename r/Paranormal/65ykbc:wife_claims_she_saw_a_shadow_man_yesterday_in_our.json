The house is 90+ years old and we did an extensive remodel after buying it. I have a wife and two kids. He had a wife and two kids and moved in during the 60s I believe when his kids were approx the same age as my kids. Also a boy and girl. Kids grew up and moved out. Wife died. And he lived here a few years, very healthy and happy until he died in the house at 92.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I had completely forgotten he died in the house until I started this post. It wasn&amp;#39;t even the reason I started it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I started it because my wife&amp;#39;s story reminded me of a story an ex told me 20 years ago. She was an extremely rational person, didn&amp;#39;t believe in ghosts or astrology or anything. But told me such a creepy story that when we reconnected on FB, I asked her to write it up so I could see if it&amp;#39;s what I remembered. It was. And here it is, in her own words. Just wondering if anybody&amp;#39;s had similar experiences:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was in my apartment about 1 week when I started noticing something out of the corner of my eye. I would do a double take, but nothing was there. This continued for a few weeks. I kept noticing I would think I saw something out of the corner of my eye, but again, nothing was there. My attitude about it was not defensive or a scared feeling, I was indifferent to it with an \u201cOh well\u201d attitude. Since I decided I was not afraid of the possibility of a potential entity I call \u201cshadows\u201d, I just went about my business and life seeing the shadows from the corner of my eye. Over time, the shadows allowed me to actually see them. No longer from the corner of my eye, but I could stare right at them moving around. These shadows were light grey in color and about the size of a small fist. They moved around the edges of my coffee table and end tables at a fairly fast pace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shadows definitely stayed moving around specific pieces of furniture. They started around a large coffee table I had. This table was built for me (along with corresponding end table pieces) buy a family friend\u2019s son in High Scholl woodshop. Over time they stayed the same size but multiplied and expanded their movement to other pieces of my furniture but only in my living room. Over the next year or so, the shadows started blending together becoming larger and slower and became a slightly darker grey color. This still did not bother me, I lived alone and kind of felt they were watching over me. This lasted for the entire time I lived at my apartment which was about 4 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because I was going back to school to obtain my Undergraduate degree, I moved back into my child hood home with my parents. I had two bedrooms to myself, one in which I had as my living room with my living room furniture, TV etc. I was somewhat surprised when after I settled in to my new living space, my shadows were back still moving around the living room furniture, nowhere else in the house. I did notice that they were bigger and darker from when I was at the apartment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because I was busy with work and school, not being home too much, I did not pay a lot of attention to the shadows nor did I think about them much. I was still not bothered by them. After a while (approx. 1 year) I noticed the shadows moved with me between the little living room I had and my bedroom staying along sharp edges of furniture and walls. I still was not worried. They did start getting darker and larger. This kind of made me feel a bit nervous. One day in a causal conversation with a couple of friends, I mentioned my shadows. One was interested and one was angry with me and felt I needed to stop acknowledging and accepting them. Shortly after this discussion the shadow(s) started forming into one large very dark shape and would stand at the foot of my bed in the middle of the night. At this point the small grey shadows were not longer, just the larger shape at the foot of my bed. Every night I would wake up and it would be there. Each night it seemed to be larger than the night before. This kind of scared me. The large size and dark color was not as comforting as the small grey shapes were. The shape grew larger, darker and appeared to take on a blurred human outline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was not sure what the intent of the shape was or what I should do about it. It seemed that the shape was growing and changes were happening rapidly. I talked to a counselor about this and she recommended that I confront the shape as to what it wanted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I finally worked up the nerve to confront the large dark shape at the end of my bed one night. I sat up and looked directly at it and loudly asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d I lied back down with my heart racing. It took me what seemed like an hour to look up again to see if it was still there. It was gone. It never did come back. No other shadows remained. They were all gone and I never saw anything like them again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I should also point out, that just like this girl, my wife told me this morning that she was not at all afraid of the shadow person.
