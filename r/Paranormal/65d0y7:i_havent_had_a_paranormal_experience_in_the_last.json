other experiences i had a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i would hear someone or something calling for me.\ni would be home alone and i would hear my name being called for.\nof course i had the common sense not to respond because, well, im obviously home alone and the thought of someone knowing i was at home all alone with no muscle to back me up was terrifying in itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i would see a shadow of a figure quite often.\nthe figure would just linger around mainly at night when i was trying to sleep. sometimes it would get really close to me, and the most horrific thing that ever happened to me is when it was holding me down on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;after all that lil ol me adopted a cat from the humane society and ever since then

room under my bed or in my closet. i looked all over the house for her in ever nook and cranny but i couldnt find her. i dismissed it as she usually takes naps in odd places.\ni closed my bedroom door and went to sleep.\ni woke up what seemed to be a minute later and i felt something pulling me off my bed and screaming. but its not like an audible scream you know you heard but rather it was inside my head screaming? if that makes any sense?\nanyway i got really fucking scared and i went to my moms bedroom and fell asleep in there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this morning my dad told me that he saw something lunging at him in the dark in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i guess i took up all the space in my parents bed so he decided to sleep in my room.\nmy dad said that he went to sleep and
