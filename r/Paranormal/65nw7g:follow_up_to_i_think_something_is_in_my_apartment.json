We had a rather heavy clay platter that my wife had made in the bathroom. This thing was a good 15 pounds at least, and full of shells, sea glass, and shark teeth (shes a marine biologist). It ended up shattering all over the floor one night while I was brushing my teeth in the dark so as to not disturb her (my wife is ALWAYS asleep when these things happen). I was in the same room, but was several feet from it. It scared me so bad. So we decided tro do something about what ever this was, as it had been slowly escialting for several months by this point.\nNow onto the interesting bit:\nWe have an antique bone-china bowl sitting in our dining room that we got from a relative as a wedding gift. It was actually sitting on the dinning room table right next to where the apparition appeared (see earlier post). As nothing we have tried seemed to work, we decided to put a few of our antiques in storage. We figured it was worth a shot, but didn&amp;#39;t really hope for it to work. (We have many, some family heirlooms, some bought at antique shops.) The problems I was having have stopped all together. So we have a haunted bowl. We knew it was the bowl, because it started shortly after moving into this apartment, and the only new addition to our collection (besides our very antique apartment, anyway) was the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the bowl has a lot of sentimental value (as well as actual tangible value). So we would like to find a way to cleanse it, as whatever is attached to it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want to leave on its own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its so weird honestly, a few months ago I was aware that sometimes stuff happens that we cant yet explain, but never thought something like a haunted object could possibly exist. Thanks for reading, and if you have any advice or just want to know more, please comment!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So a few weeks ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/60k2to/i_think_something_is_in_my_apartment/\n\nRecently the problems have been getting worse.
