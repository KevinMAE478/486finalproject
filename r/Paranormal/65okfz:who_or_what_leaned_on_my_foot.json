(I wear an eye mask and earplugs when I sleep FYI but I very much &amp;#39;feel&amp;#39; the end of the bed dip). At first I just thought it was my husband coming in and sitting down but a few times I&amp;#39;ve turned my head and took the mask off to say hi and there&amp;#39;s no one there. He wouldn&amp;#39;t have time to get up and leave the room in the time it takes me to lift the mask.  Usually it&amp;#39;s at the end of the bed but once I felt it right beside me at the top of the bed. And it&amp;#39;s not an issue with the bed as we bought a new bed (not because of this, lol) and it still continued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I felt what I assumed was my husband &amp;#39;tucking me in&amp;#39; as he often does (due to insomnia I often nap during the day) and on this day I felt 4 separate firm touches, ankles, back of thighs, lower back and upper back. I turned my head with a smile and said &amp;quot;Thanks &lt;em&gt;Husband&amp;#39;s name&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;... but the room was empty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t feel scared at any point during these encounters, it all felt very protective and almost maternal (BTW my own mum is still alive). I also heard a clear &amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; in a female voice in the room but all electronics were switched off at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a theory though, this all started when I was gifted some jewellery from my late Aunt and I think she might be coming to check up on me (I&amp;#39;m not in the best of health.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing else happened for a long time then a few nights ago I was lying in bed trying to sleep and I had one foot curled under me and the other straight out at the bottom of the bed. Suddenly I felt a strong pressure on that foot as if someone was leaning on it, I actually felt my foot press into the mattress!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My rational brain immediately tried to find a logical explanation, perhaps it was already morning, perhaps my husband had got up and was balancing himself against the bed to switch the plugs on at the wall as he usually does etc.. but when I peeked out from under my eyemask it was still dark and only 10 minutes or so since I last checked the clock and the Man was snoozing beside me. \ud83d\ude2f&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly I still didn&amp;#39;t feel afraid though. I have caught various EVPs in my bedroom, a couple sound quite masculine. I think this might be my cousin who we lost very unexpectedly. He often &amp;#39;visits&amp;#39; me in my dreams.
