This was 2003 or so, when the internet was more than Facebook, reddit, and you could search Google to get actual results on the first page instead of nothing but ad listings in the form of search results. Strange concept. \n\nOne night we were feeling like we needed a scare. So, to Google we went. \"Ghost pictures\" was our first search. This plopped us on a page with EVPs. He was about three years younger than me, so he was maybe 12 or so. Being younger, he usually didn't want to see or hear the intense ones, so we usually stuck with the ones that sounded like they would be funny. For example, ones that said \"fuck you\" in response to \"is anyone here?\"\n\nMy mom woke up at some point and was in the bathroom. Her bedroom being across the house, we didn't usually have to worry about being too loud. Well because we were both giggling like school children about the image of a disembodied voice cursing at someone, she poked her head in.\n\nAt this point, we were listening to an EVP that was listed as \"asshole asshole\" so we went in ready to giggle some more. Mom asked what we were doing, so I told her. She wanted to hear that one with us.\n\nI click play.

This was 2003 or so, when the internet was more than Facebook, reddit, and you could search Google to get actual results on the first page instead of nothing but ad listings in the form of search results. Strange concept. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night we were feeling like we needed a scare. So, to Google we went. &amp;quot;Ghost pictures&amp;quot; was our first search.

For example, ones that said &amp;quot;fuck you&amp;quot; in response to &amp;quot;is anyone here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom woke up at some point and was in the bathroom.
