I am from Norway so sorry for my language handicap! \nI swear on my familys life that this is 100% true and real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 5 or 6 years ago me and my friend had been at a birthday party of a friend. We had some moonshine, or he did, I barely drank, before we found out that we had to walk home. This was at the other side of the town we live in.\nSo we had this very long walk, clock was about 3 am when we got to the school I went to, and after the school there&amp;#39;s this long road thing for people who walk or ski. It&amp;#39;s located on a mountain not-mountain, kind of a hill but very long and theres a forest and all  (sorry don&amp;#39;t know how to properly describe it). It takes about 40 mins to walk through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we enter the forest we smelled this awful, disgusting smell and we both were like &amp;quot;wtf dude, did you fart&amp;quot; (we were 15) but it did NOT smell like a fart. We just continued walking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is winter in northern Norway, So it&amp;#39;s really dark and the trail we walked on were very dark, but there was some light lamps whatever there along the trail. To the sides it&amp;#39;s just trees and u can barely see the fjord. \nWe walk, but don&amp;#39;t talk. We were very tired and had walked for over one hour, but something took my attention.\nThere was really creepy whispering noise, like alot of people around, like, I couldn&amp;#39;t tell what they said but you could hear the vocal focus on the vowels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first thought that it was the wind but this was constant, it didn&amp;#39;t stop. And the atmosphere was insanely eerie and sinister. I tried to ignore it cause I thought it was just my imagination. The more we walk the louder and &amp;quot;harder&amp;quot; / violent the whispers get. We just walk, two boys, in the woods, surrounded by Dolby Surround Sound whispers from hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we get to the halfway point there&amp;#39;s this bench with a nice view over the fjord, but this night nothing was nice. As we got there we hear a woman scream in the forest, direction where we are supposed to go. After all this mental torture by the constant whispering I just break.\nI freak out. I panic. I get a breakdown and start saying &amp;quot;What the hell is going on?! And do you hear the whispering?!&amp;quot;. Wanna know what he replied? He said &amp;quot;No I don&amp;#39;t hear anything&amp;quot;.\nWe continue to walk, and the whispers are everywhere still. I was sure I were going batshit crazy. \nWhen we get to the end of the forest there&amp;#39;s this long hill down, very steep. We get forced to run cause of it, while trying not to fall in the snow. We run down and stop in the middle of the hill and we catch our breaths. We aren&amp;#39;t and weren&amp;#39;t very sporty. \nSo we&amp;#39;re just standing here, catching our breaths when I look at the top of the hill, I get shivers form writing this, but there was a woman in a white dress with black hair standing there. Watching down on us. My blood froze completely. She just stared at us, before she just turned to her left and took 3 steps and vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have NEVER ran so hard in my life, So far. I have NEVER been that afraid before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While walking back he told me he heard the whispers all along, and that &amp;quot;your not supposed to speak sbout it when you are in haunted areas&amp;quot; or something like that. We also talked about how the whispers sounded Russian, but they didn&amp;#39;t sound like a man or a woman. And they were around us, not just coming from a single direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: There&amp;#39;s a graveyard next to this forest road thing, and there is a big memorial stone, cause annoy of Russians died there in the 2nd world war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun fact 2: When I was in 6. Grade we had a teacher who said he once were skiing there at around midnight when he saw a man in a big fur coat walking in boots there, When there was a lot of snow. In the end he thought &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll outrun him&amp;quot;, and this teacher is VERY athletic and skiing is way faster than walking in 50cm snow. He gave his all to try to outrun him, but next time he turned, This man was closer. Never believed him until after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s a big cliche that there is a woman in white, but honestly, that&amp;#39;s what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I recently told this story to a friend and he said that the smell might be sulfur, which would mean I met demonic shit. When I realized i got this feeling of terror, even though it&amp;#39;s 5+ years ago....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed it.
