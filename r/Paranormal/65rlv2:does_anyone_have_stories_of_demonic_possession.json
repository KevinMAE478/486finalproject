I think I'm okay with sharing it now. \n\nWhen I was about 16, I had an experience I will never forget. I am very skeptical, even with the experiences I had through my life, so even telling this story still makes it seem surreal. There's a bit of background story, but since I don't want to \"puke\" out my life's story, let's just say that from a very young age, my life was constantly filled with negativity, and I believe everything that happened before this experience, definitely had something do with it.\n\nI was friends with a group of people who practiced Wicca, and it was something I was interested in so I learned a lot from them before this happened. It's a beautiful craft, and so open and welcoming. They were more experienced, as they had a few years of practicing before I even entered the picture.\n\nAnyway, on Halloween, or Samhain, we wanted to pay our respects to those who had passed, and so we decided to cast a circle in our local cemetery. The circle was cast by an angel statue that had been built for the children buried in the cemetery. Now, normally the \u201cdoor\u201d to the circle is closed, but we left if \"open\" to invite any spirits to the offerings (food and drink). My friend, Kate, went off on her own to \u201cspeak\u201d with someone who had just died a month before and my other friend, Meg, and I stayed in the circle, both silent as we did our own thing. I was upset, and already at a vulnerable point in my life as I was dealing with depression from the death of my father. He committed suicide when I was 6 and I wanted some peace; I wanted to hear from him and understand how he could leave his family like that. I opened the door even wider.\n\nA rush of wind came in the circle, and knocked Meg over on her butt, landing on her black mirror (a black mirror is used for scrying in Wicca), breaking it, which means bad luck.

The best way to describe it is like something is invading your space. It\u2019s uncomfortable and it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s trying to shove you out of the way to make room.

I remember saying, \"Something's wrong\" and then they grabbed me by the arms to keep me still, and started saying a Wiccan prayer. I tried saying it with them at first, but I literally growled, before I could finish the sentence. I felt like I had no control; I felt hatred and anger. But I kept on trying and eventually I could say it, and began to feel like a weight had been lifted off me. \n\nWe closed the circle, went home, and that was that. We didn't talk about it. I laid in bed thinking I would never be in a vulnerable state like that again, that I would be strong. I imagined a white shield surrounding my house and myself. I started working more with energy and stepped away from any type of religion, focusing more on the spiritual (not because I didn\u2019t like Wicca). I knew things had to change.\n\nI never told my mom or any of my friends. It was just the two of them and me. Was it demon? Who knows. People think Demons are the only things that can possess, but when a spirit has enough energy, there is a whole lot more they can do.\n\nSo nothing extravagant. No speaking in tongues or throwing people twice my size.

I think I&amp;#39;m okay with sharing it now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was about 16, I had an experience I will never forget. I am very skeptical, even with the experiences I had through my life, so even telling this story still makes it seem surreal. There&amp;#39;s a bit of background story, but since I don&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;puke&amp;quot; out my life&amp;#39;s story, let&amp;#39;s just say that from a very young age, my life was constantly filled with negativity, and I believe everything that happened before this experience, definitely had something do with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was friends with a group of people who practiced Wicca, and it was something I was interested in so I learned a lot from them before this happened. It&amp;#39;s a beautiful craft, and so open and welcoming. They were more experienced, as they had a few years of practicing before I even entered the picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on Halloween, or Samhain, we wanted to pay our respects to those who had passed, and so we decided to cast a circle in our local cemetery. The circle was cast by an angel statue that had been built for the children buried in the cemetery. Now, normally the \u201cdoor\u201d to the circle is closed, but we left if &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; to invite any spirits to the offerings (food and drink). My friend, Kate, went off on her own to \u201cspeak\u201d with someone who had just died a month before and my other friend, Meg, and I stayed in the circle, both silent as we did our own thing. I was upset, and already at a vulnerable point in my life as I was dealing with depression from the death of my father. He committed suicide when I was 6 and I wanted some peace; I wanted to hear from him and understand how he could leave his family like that. I opened the door even wider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A rush of wind came in the circle, and knocked Meg over on her butt, landing on her black mirror (a black mirror is used for scrying in Wicca), breaking it, which means bad luck.
