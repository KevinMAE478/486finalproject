There is no obvious digital editing in any of the photos, but due to the lower quality the images are saved at and the fact they could've been resaved multiple times (which slowly degrades the image quality and erodes signs of digital editing), it is possible they were edited originally and then purposefully degraded over multiple saves and lower JPEG quality to mask the edits\n4.

I looked at it very closely and I can see how it can be part of the general shadows that are on the reflected wall. It does not look out of place to me, and the spot where the face is does not look face like at all, so I really think these are just some shadows on the wall.
