In the interest of anonymity, all names and locations have been changed. \n\nThe call came out as a simple suspicious person at a large nursing home with not that many more details. Myself and a buddy showed up to find a woman waiting out front next to her vehicle. The vehicle was off and she carried a baby with her. Maybe 3 years old, but still with those cherubic baby angel cheeks. \n\nThe administrator tells me the woman in question, whom I'll refer to as Tracy, is a contracted worker for them. A sort of nurse who comes in from time to time to help out with their elderly patients. She shows up on her day off and starts talking to this elderly gentleman, Joe. Tracy places her baby in Joe's lap and wheels him out of the facility, Joe screaming the whole time. They stop her and she gets mad because they're holding her grandfather hostage and she just wants to take him for a walk. Only thing is, Joe is not related to Tracy and is a retired cop himself. Tracy then gets distracted, tries stealing medication, and scratches another nurse when they stop her. \n\nBy all accounts, not six hours earlier, Tracy was an ordinary woman. She went to work without complaint, seemed happy, and then went home. No history of drug use. No history of mental illness. The facility was reluctant to pursue charge due to the sudden abrupt shift in her personality, like she'd been replaced with another women who looked just like her but was criminally insane. \n\nWhile speaking to her, Tracy seems normal. She tells me in a very calm and obviously 'not crazy' voice what she's doing and why. She gives me all information and doesn't cause any problems or give me reason to take her into custody (Joe didn't want to press charges and the facility declined as well). The only thing giving me cause that something was wrong was Tracy insisting Joe was her grandfather which we proved she was not. My only other recourse was a sort of Emergency Custody Order (Mental health) but I had no reason to do so. Her son looked well cared for, so we elected to call for family to arrive. \n\nHer father showed up and confirmed that Tracy was ok. She didn't take drugs and had never complained about mental health or physical ailments that would lead us to believe something was wrong. I even spoke to a Magistrate about securing charges to get her treated, since she refused to do so on her own, but he declined right off. The only option we had was the father trying to get a custody order against her. \n\nHe took a few minutes speaking to her before pulling me aside and saying, \"I can tell you that that woman looks like my daughter, but that's not my daughter.\" \n\nAs this is happening, I hear the car door open and the doors lock. My stomach dropped though I couldn't tell you why. Consider it a sixth sense all cops have or are issued after time spent on the force. Sometimes someone sets off a trigger you can't explain and you better listen to it. \n\nInside the car, Tracy is holding her bouncing little boy in her arms. I knock on the window and ask if we can talk some more. She refuses. I ask if her father can hold the baby, she tells me \"That's not my father.\" I try to negotiate while my supervisor (who witnessed the whole thing thankfully) tried other doors. He took over talking to her while I positioned myself on the other side of the car, trying to open door handles. Both of our warning flags were going off and we couldn't say why. She gave no reason and we had no cause. \n\nThen Tracy says, \"You're just trying to take away my baby.\" She pulls the baby into her chest and the baby stops laughing. It stops breathing and the little jerks on it's hands and feet tell me it's not breathing. \n\nIt took three swings of my baton to break the glass all the while my supervisor is screaming at me to get in...*get in there, Goddammit.*\n\nI crawl across the broken glass and reach across the seat, pulling the baby's head from from her arms. It lets out a bloody wail and Tracy turns to look me in the face. I see the driver's side door open and Tracy just fucking smiles at me. \"You're just trying to take my baby, you white devil.\" \n\nIt felt like it happened in an instant. Tracy bares her teeth and bites the baby. I hear the baby screaming now in pure pain. I reached forward, wrapping my arms around her lower jaw and upper forehead and pulled her off. Tracy goes limp and Grandfather takes the baby inside to be treated. He lived but we never found his ear.\n\nI saw her later in court after all the charges were dismissed in lieu of lifetime commitment to a mental institution. All the life gone from her eyes just like that night. The lights were on but no one was home. I still can't explain how an otherwise healthy and vibrant person can go from zero to crazy like that it but it haunts me to this day more than any ghost story I've ever heard. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got one.

We were out of sight from the building and neither one of us ever responded to the house prior to that night so we did not know what it looked like. \n\nMy FTO looked at me and said the typical training officer thing, \"What are you going to do, Trainee?\" I told him that he and I will make our approach and ask for an additional since it sounds like we're out numbered. That is exactly what we did. As we approached the house on foot, the house was completely dark and the windows were boarded up with a city notice indicating the house was not safe for human occupation. Figuring it was a bunch of tweeters, we stood by for the additional unit before throughly searching. After the unit arrived, we searched surrounding area of the house, which lead into desert, but we were unable to find foot prints or people. We turned our attention back to the house and entered the building through the back. \n\nI took point. I announced our presence and heard shuffling inside the building. I indicated to my partners I heard shuffling and my FTO agreed as he was by the door prepared to open it. \n\nThe smell was horrible - it reeked. \n\nThe house was pitch black as we entered, I turned to my left and held position as my partner followed in. We were standing on the outline left by the corpse from a few weeks prior. None of us been to the house before so w were disoriented inside the pitch black room. My partner shined his light down the hall way after we secured the entry way. He immediately started to run down the hallway telling whatever he saw to stop. My FTO and I followed suit. We were lead into the master bedroom where we stopped. My partner was thoroughly confused and told FTO and I what he had seen. \n\nHe saw a white face, about 4'12\" from the ground grin st him and turn around heading to the master bed room. The room was empty, clear of all furniture. We searched the rest of the house and found nothing - not even an animal. \n\nWe exited the house and left. About 2 hours later we received the same call again. Again we searched and found nothing. \n\nThe next morning we reviewed the body cam from the partner and saw what appeared to be half a face. We also reviewed audio and found several murmuring in the background that we did not hear at the time.

She&amp;#39;s a little bloody but really it seems to be more psych than anything and she&amp;#39;s really not doing much helping us figure out what&amp;#39;s going on. After about 5 minutes a county deputy pulls into the meadow and gets out and comes over to us. He seems really nervous and keeps looking around which seemed really weird and puts all of us a little more on edge. Another minute or two passes and we all notice it&amp;#39;s gotten really really quiet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is Oklahoma in the middle of the woods in summer, the bugs had been making a huge racket. Now just silence. All the hair stands up on your neck and one of the guys I was working with pulls out a gigantic spot light from the truck and scans the tree line. Blood runs completely cold. There were about 20 guys with rifles standing around the edge of the meadow just watching us from the darkness. They weren&amp;#39;t pointing them at us but talk about sphincter tone going from 0-100 in no time flat. We all are kind of just frozen but after what seemed like 10 minutes the deputy breaks the silence by simply saying &amp;quot;yeah... we should go...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we did. We climbed in to the ambulance, dragged the patient with us and booked it out of there. People from urban areas or even small towns don&amp;#39;t realize it but there are definitely &amp;quot;hill people&amp;quot; still out there who live completely separate from society. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "name": "t1_dgbfssw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492332609.0, "created_utc": 1492303809.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cqxt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga7cu7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SouthernCharm1856", "parent_id": "t3_65cqxt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Paranormal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "honestly? the hanging suicides. \n\nNothing particularly noteworthy to make then spooky, just the whole scene in itself. you don't forget those.
