Have to say that is a pretty close encounter? Mind if I ask you whereabouts this was (generally speaking, no specifics needed), because this sounds like something that would go down near Hamilton or something.\n\nI've had my fair share of experiences since I grew up living right next to some hills that were on the northern tail end of the Moehau (Coromandel) ranges. I moved to Auckland in 2012 by myself, but my family still live in the same place and this is actually the 17th year my family has owned that tiny farm.\n\nI'd felt drawn to one of the hills that backed onto my family farm for ages. But to get there, i had to cross a river (not that wide, but very rocky and of varying depths). And trespass onto my neighbour's land...but nobody noticed even when I came back through my neighbours paddock and most properties/houses look down onto the river from above (it's a very bowl shaped valley). Anyway, when I crossed the river, I had to cross the main part of the river, then go around this tiny peninsula and waded into a stream. I remember the water being fucking cold so it was probably sometime around October, November and I had finished school for the year, but parent's were still working (their time off work coincided with mine). Plus, the days were short, but getting longer. \n\nANYWAY (again), when I walked into the stream, I was immediately hit with how beautiful it was. Literally, it was like walking into the past as the water was incredibly clear, the rocks and stones covered in moss and some were perfectly clear and smooth. The trees on the banks formed a canopy above the stream and the sunlight was filtering through. I know, sounds like a movie right? Sure felt like it. That stream was virtually untouched by any human interference, apart from a very old fence hanging across the stream which I had to duck under, and a small track leading into the bush which was probably widened and used by other animals like pigs, stray horses (neighbours are hippies who Can. Not. take proper care of their animals and just release them whenever they fancy), goats and whatnot. My dogs were loving it, and I had to keep whistling and calling them back to make sure they didn't go too far or bark (not really supposed to be there. I did tell them to stay home but I didn't know how long I'd be gone so thought it safer if they were with me as they could alert me to anything out of the ordinary. Plus, they don't do a very good job of staying put). The colours in this stream really did pop out as the banks and almost everything was covered in moss, algae and lichen. I still can't get over how clear and still the water was. Magical.\n\nI spent a good few minutes sitting on the track, squeezing the water out of my bush pants and socks. And draining the water from my gumboots. It didn't bother me too much as it was in the middle of the day, but still a little chilly. When I was finished, I collected myself and carried on walking into the bush. Now, this is where it starts getting weird. When I walked back onto proper ground coming from the stream, I walked across the hippies land, came across an old as fuck tractor covered in grass. Though it looked like they were planning to move the tractor as there was a red petrol box (lying in the sun I must say), and some half-hearted attempts at cutting the grass down. I did spend a while looking at the tractor as seeing that sight was pretty cool, but since there was visible recent activity, thought it best to move on so as not to be caught. I walked through clear tracks made by the tractor and motorbikes (the hippies). FYI I did not see any weed anywhere. Don't think they're those kind of hippies. But when I hit the real bush, where the hippies had neglected the land for so long that things grew back, I was stumped.\n\nThe trees, gorse and whatnot actually formed a literal wall. I couldn't even press my body into the wall and I kid you not, my body went numb from being pressed into gorse so many times. I gave up and walked a little east, where I found a steep ridge that seemed to drop down to the stream, but couldn't actually see where the edge of the hill ended as the titree trees were so thick. I carried on walking for a while which was a good part of the day as the sun was in the highest part of the sky while I thrashed around the bush, so must have been 3-4 hours of walking. I guess this because I went in at about 10.30 am, when I was sure everyone in the valley was at work and no cars would pass the river (road is right next to the river). It was so difficult as the bush just seemed to be getting thicker, and thicker. Almost like it had developed a staged system for keeping humans out. By this time, I was on my other neighbours' land.\n\nI finally reached one of the hills that was directly in front of the one I wanted to get to, but the one I wanted to get to towered over this one. It was probably around 3-4pm as I remember thinking \"should get back home as the sun will set soon\". This is where it gets weirder as when I looked at the hill in front of me, it seemed to shake in and out of focus, and move back and forth rapidly. I remember thinking \"what the hell?\" and it was then that I felt something trying to get me to stay. This carried on for a good few minutes before I decided to listen to whatever it was that was trying to get me to stay and headed back home with my dogs, who were still enjoying themselves as they had already eaten several possums by this point.\n\nThe next year when I went back to school in Auckland, I remember telling my kaumatua (Maori elders), who worked at the school and I was also close with about what happened. They both then explained that whatever it was, it was most likely the spirit of an old Maori chief who pulled me back and stopped me from going further, despite me not being Maori. There is a tiny rumour that my father's ancestors sailed to NZ from Peru, undocumented and possibly sailed back or onwards, so the land may have been calling me for millennia because of this. I honestly don't know, it probably helped that I had many Maori friends, respected the culture and myths. But it kind of doesn't make sense as I'm half-Pakeha, and my white ancestors were definitely not good to the Maori. Despite this, I'm closer with my Maori friends than my own white family - I just feel so different to them.\n\nAs for the hill doing that weird thing (moving back and forth, in and out of focus), the kaumatua said it was probably the spirit there who was pulling me there and spazzing out when I got there. Possibly many more. Or the work of the Maori chief spirit who was pushing it away. They were glad I didn't actually get there as  they have heard stories of people who were drawn someplace, and never got out due to unfortunate accidents or unknown causes. It was then that I realise that I was lucky that I turned back when something didn't feel right. The kaumatua also said it was weird that the bush seemed to get increasingly thicker as I progressed. One more thing - that particular hill actually stands (figuratively) on it's own and all the others to the east of it seem to be bunched up, pulling away from it if you look and think about it. Shit's weird.\n\nI've had other incidents with that hill too. Many times I've been walking around the deck of my family house, our land or next to the river when I've turned around and the hill is literally right behind me. Imagine someone being far away and then literally right behind, standing over you. That's how it felt and looked. Everytime that happened, I run back to the house which always feels safe. The house also has some stories but not of the creepy kind. More like it developed over time into being a haven against the weirdness of the place. When I got home, I obviously looked very dirty and lied about where I went, saying I went into our bush which is to the east. I went west.\n\nI also had an experience with a possible Taniwha once. Was on the trampoline once, and looked out towards the bush that bordered the hippies house. This was looking northwest, as to the front of our property, no hills are directly in front, but on the sides. I was looking at the trees that were pretty golden looking from the summer sun (different year) and when I looked between a couple, I saw something walking down towards the river, but the river was a little bit below from where this thing was. I actually thought it was one of the hippies as they sometimes walk around the bush and even camp as my mind was thinking about something completely different, but my brain clicked when I compared the size of this thing to the trees. Immediately I stopped bouncing and stared. It looked reptillian, but also a bit crocodile-ish. It was quite a way off in the distance and my distance eyesight isn't so great when focusing on detail, but the face definitely looked reptiillian. The colour I saw was a yellowish-brown-green. It seemed to be walking or lumbering casually, until it paused, looked up and I swear caught me staring. I got the feeling that it was intelligent, just from it's posture and the way it walked. I would put it's height at probably 10 to 12 feet tall because it was just under half the height of some of the pine trees in front of it. A few seconds after it saw me, it immediately turned around and ran back in the direction it came from, tail swishing and all. I stood on my trampoline, equally shocked and ran back into the house at the same time. Never saw it again, but apparently when I was a toddler, I would not shut up about the 'dragon' that lived in our hedge and how it was my friend. Now, I think I saw the 'dragon' that day. Definitely one of the biggest 'what the fuck?' moments I've had.\n\nI have a story about my house, but I think I've written enough for today.\n\nTL;DR - Weird walk in the bush when I was actually trespassing. 8/10 would not recommend if you want to feel your hands at the end of the day.

My family used to own a cabin in NW Wisconsin, I basically grew up there in the summer, I knew the woods well, but at night it was wise to stay in the cabin or at least by the bonfire by the beach, because of bears, wolves, and cougars. One of the creepiest things was if you were having a bonfire, the treeline was visible from the fire pit and beach, and at night you always felt like you were being watched from that treeline. But during the day the woods always seemed normal, not so creepy, that is until this incident. So this happened somewhere between 1200-1400. Me and my cousin were having an airsoft battle, I was in full woodland camo, he was not, I retreated onto the ATV trail into the woods for a tactical advantage and our battle took us about 200 meters in to about a third of the way up the trail. We had enough at this point and were standing at the edge of a clearing on the trail talking and he was maybe 10 feet from me, when I decided to mess with him, I shushed him and said \"we're being watched\", he froze, then I realized the woods were dead quiet and I got spooked and started scanning the treeline and the other edge of the clearing from left to right when I saw it. It's teeth gave it away, it was panting and staring at my cousin, I don't expect you to believe me, but what I saw was a wolf as big as a black bear, at least 300lbs, but it wasn't normal, this wolf was on 2 legs crouching next to tree with its arm grasping the tree, grasping with a clawed hand, it had reddish brown fur. I told my cousin that \"we have to go\" and next thing I know he is sprinting and I look back at wolfy who had locked on and sprinted a few steps on two feet and then I turned and ran when it looked like wolfy was dropping to all fours, it charged us and sounded right on our asses barreling through the brush, but for whatever reason let us go when we broke out of the tree line and headed for the cabin. What stuck with me the most was the sheer size, wolfy appeared to be nearly 7' tall when upright, and that where it should've had front paws it appeared to have large clawed hands. Now I'm not sure how to explain it away rationally, I have heard wolves will occasionally kind of walk upright but as far as I know they can't sprint on 2 legs, nor do wolves get that big, and black bears more waddle on 2 legs. The closest description is silly, a werewolf or dogman.

It was pretty far away, so we kinda ignored it. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a minute later, we hear the exact same sound. Only a bit closer. My boyfriend started kinda getting nervous, but I decided it was still to far away and we didn&amp;#39;t need to worry about it. So we shrugged it off assuming it was a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same amount of time passed when we heard it a third time, right at the edge of the clearing of where the cemetery was. At this point I decided it was kinda spooky and I wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We made our way up this hill to where the car was parked, and we both noticed something reflecting off the beam from the flashlight. \nAt first I thought it was a beer can that was ripped in half or some sort of trash.\nAs I got closer, I realized it was an animal. Very still, maybe a raccoon or a opossum, but we freaked it out and it wasn&amp;#39;t moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we actually reached the car, we both immediately realized it was something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what it was, but it had a long head almost like a doe, but with sorta dog like ears, like a pit bull with clipped ears? And it had a humanoid body, up on two legs but hunched over, with really long thin fingers. \nIt also looked like it may have been fuzzy a bit, like maybe very short fur but it was a reddish brown color.\nJust sitting there watching us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I instantly told my boyfriend to get in the fucking car, but he wanted to try to get a picture. I was so scared that I told him that I was going to leave his ass there, so he didn&amp;#39;t get a picture. I sorta wish he had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made him tell me what he saw on the drive home, and he described the exact thing I had seen, so I knew it wasn&amp;#39;t my eyes playing tricks on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, we never went back...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorta wanna go back now, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "name": "t1_dg8kd2t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492162488.0, "created_utc": 1492133688.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65606h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65606h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8xdl6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Humbabwe", "parent_id": "t1_dg82zwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Paranormal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A *pigman*, Jerry!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;pigman&lt;/em&gt;, Jerry!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "name": "t1_dg8xdl6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492187113.0, "created_utc": 1492158313.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65606h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgabozw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LacedSpaceDaze", "parent_id": "t1_dg82zwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Paranormal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "ManBearPig", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ManBearPig&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "name": "t1_dgabozw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492262095.0, "created_utc": 1492233295.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65606h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg95dt5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aguynamedmason", "parent_id": "t1_dg82zwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Paranormal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Reminds me of American Horror Story.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of American Horror Story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "name": "t1_dg95dt5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206656.0, "created_utc": 1492177856.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg82zwo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShitFacedSteve", "parent_id": "t3_65606h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Paranormal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I used to live on heavily forested property with my family.

Once, I recall we were miles out on this mountain, we drove past this funny little shed. It struck me as odd because there weren't any buildings for miles in any direction, but here stood this weathered white shed, a chain wrapped all the way around it and secured with several padlocks in addition to what looked like deadbolt on the door. I felt instantly nervous, like we were somewhere that we shouldn't be. The trees gave way to tall grass and a large circular clearing where the shed sat, on one side of the clearing was a gentle hill that sloped back up toward the tree line. The grass was SO long and green that I put my hands out the side and let it tickle my palms as we rode. The ground beneath that tall grass was soft mud under about two inches of water and as soon as we hit it we had to slow down to avoid getting stuck up in the mud. A spider fell into my leg, then got stuck in the hem of my pant leg, so naturally I freaked out and went to brush it off. When I sat up I glanced by my father's line of sight up that hill to our right where there stood a wooden post. On the post was a head. I remember immediately guessing that it was an animal head because some hunter had probably dressed an animal out there. I was only 12 or 13. As we rode closer the face looked grotesquely human and I became upset. My dad looked straight ahead the rest of the way, and where my hands braced his shoulders I could feel him tense. My eyes were glued to this thing, trying to find my way to a rational conclusion all the while as we got closer and rode past (around 50 or fewer yards away, I'd guess but I'm terrible at estimating distances). To this day I don't think I'll ever forget that head, the slack in the jaw and the dark gorey bits that hung from the neck. The skin was browning from decay and exposure and birds and insects had done a bit of work already... The creepiest part was the hair. Long, straight, and pitch black. It was tangled into the tall grass around it, knotted into itself with matted protrusions poking out.\nMy dad later insisted that I not tell my mother, then assured me that it was a Halloween mask and someone playing a sick joke.

During High School when we could get our Driver's License at 16 the popular thing to do was go drive out to different stoner spots (or your own) and smoke some weed, drink a couple beers and listen to some music. Luckily I was the friendly neighbourhood pot dealer so I benefitted from this practice. My life changed after this night some years ago...\nIt was a school night and getting late. It was getting close to midnight so I began shutting my compputer down and call it a night when there was a knock at my front door. My mother didn't care that I sold pot at 16 because I had a very good system limiting all sales through only the people who understood my rules and obeyed them, ensuring nothing ever went down, my friend at the door was one of them. You have to understand that I've known this guy since kindergarten and know him, he is not capable of this level of imagination, he's into engines, beer, and women; this is what happened. My bedroom door flew open and he stood in the doorway sweaty and pale, \"Roll a fucking joint right now.\" he anxiously demanded. I looked down at his hand which was shaking by his side, he had never sworn at me like that in my entire life. I thought about the fact that he had just bought a new Ford Eplorer and I figured he hit someone. I was about to be made an accomplice if he told me.  As he stepped in the room to sit down on my bed there was a girl behind him who I knew from High School, another credible person yet she wouldn't even look me in the eye. Her hands were collapsed in each other covered by her sleeves as she purposefully dodged eye contact biting her lip, resigning to hunching over behind my buddy on the bed. These two had the fear of god on them, I began rolling, he began talking. \nThey had driven up a comparatively little ways up a local mountain that was actually in the heart of a residential area but this road snaked up it until it disappeared. They drove up to a part where only four by four can cross over the ditch into a wooded area. It's a totall stoner spot but one not frequented because of the big ditch.They face the trees and parked, in the dark they sit there listening to music and having a coupe beers. He tells me suddenly she pointed out the front windshield and told him to look at a star that was shining on them. He told me he leaned over to look up through the windshield and sure enough it was as if some spotlight from far up was shining on them but there was no sound like a helicopter, nothing. He told her, \"That's not a star.\" and the truck shut-off. He had just bought the truck and looked it over and it was fine so he was trying to diagnose what the hell was going on as he turned the key and listened to the ignition roll. He was puzzled when all of a sudden the girl grabbed his arm and with pure terror pointed out the front windshield and asked him,\"Look! WTF is that?!\". He looked past her finger and told me that some 50-60 yards out something long and white standing about 9-10ft tall was behind a tree leaning out to watch them with long white fingers wrapped around the tree. She burst into tears and he froze, he said he just couldn't move, coudn't think, even with that girl crying and begging him to go he couldn't. Whatever this thing was split to their left into the woods so fast they could barely see it, he said it was bending trees. The girl terrified for her life started shaking him but before long this thing came outta the treelie and ran into his new vehicle lifting two side tires off the ground. It went over the front hood and behind the vehicle into the woods again with a speed unlike anything, making it impossible to see it in detail. Again it watched them this time from 30-40 yards from behind a tree. He said in that moment he was so scared he couldn't even piss his pants or remember his own name. The girl now hysterical began hitting him screaming. Suddenly he snapped into it and turned the key, the ignition caught and the truck started. They drove directly to my place and told me this story. Afterwards he brought me outside and showed me his new truck. It had a circulor impact dent about 2feet in diameter with no paint scrapes, meaning it wasn't metal or hard whatever did this, there wasn't a scratch! I didn't know what the hell to think, I knew this guy my whole life. Couple weeks later I see him at a bush party and ask to talk to him, I had some questions I had thought of, but when I brought it up he had no idea what I was talking about. Creepy thing is neither did the girl. They both looked at me like I was crazy! I tried bringing it up ony twice with them and have never tried again, they don't remember! There have been some stories with similarities up that mountain but I have never heard of anything like this my whole life. You have no reason to believe me but I'm telling you they could not have made this up. The only real question I ask myself now is what the hell was it doing with them up there?

It was about 7 1/2 or 8 feet tall and brown, standing on 2 legs. it was about 100-150 feet from me and as soon as i saw it I braked and it left the trail and went into the (very) dense woods at the edge of the trail. I was with another person riding and they had seen it as well. We left quickly because while my machine could probably outrun it, the minibike the person I was with was on probably wouldn&amp;#39;t (only goes about 22mph). The ground was hard in the trail from vehicles so no tracks, and the grass at the edge of the trail was very tall and I didn&amp;#39;t want to stick around too long to look for any out there so I guess I have no proof but it definitely was not a bear, as it wasn&amp;#39;t structured right to be a bear, and it walked off on 2 legs as well. While it scared me, I love the area and wouldn&amp;#39;t stop going there for something as simple as that. I would like to see it again if I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "name": "t1_dg8v5a0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492180822.0, "created_utc": 1492152022.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65606h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgac6hp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "seness", "parent_id": "t3_65606h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Paranormal", "controversiality": 0, "body": " Around 3 or so years ago I was bear hunting in Clinton County ,Pa.
