This story is one my dad told us when we were younger and as I have browsed this sub Reddit I have brought up that I think his story is a skinwalker. If not, feel free for suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is in central WI when my dad was around not even a teenager yet. WI was even more rural back then and the area has since become more city. Anyway, story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad and his friend grew up country and always walked woods, trails, swamping land etc. not much else to do but my dad said him and his friend were walking a path in one of these spots one day and this black cat kept following them, anytime they stopped to look the cat stopped and looked at them. He said they would try using stones etc but the can&amp;#39;t wouldn&amp;#39;t get scared and after a few minutes they started walking faster and the cat kept following. Apparently they both got a very bad feeling and said don&amp;#39;t even look back anymore. Once they said that and started walking again they heard this dark evil laughter and turned around to see a man in super old school all black attire walking away laughing into the brush. So they freaked out obviously and ran away. \nPart 2! So this part was something my dad told me last year I did not know. My grandpa was friends with this other old guy who lived around the area and I guess my dad knew him and would stop by. After this cat thing my dad came by one time and started telling this story, apparently it freaked this guy out real bad. He said he had been outside doing whatever and all of a sudden this pure black dog comes by and starts just staring him down, then growling and the guy had a super uneasy feeling and started backing up to his door. Apparently the moment he turned his back he rushed in and slammed the door shut and this dog had lunged at the door barking and scratching crazy for a minute then went silent. The guy said he then heard this evil laughter and looked out the window to see the same guy my dad saw. All black, old school clothes from like 1800s walking away laughing and disappear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad swears to this day he didn&amp;#39;t make it up and does not tell anyone, he hates me ever sharing it as well because this shit is so unbelievable and he hates people ever thinking he is dishonest. So I have NO idea what this really is, but wanted to share. I check this sub usually every night so feel free to comment!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys!
