I held it up in front of me and it found my face and another seemingly invisible face. She got scared and left the room. Later that day my pin board was skewed, and not slightly, but maybe by 20 or 30 degrees. I corrected it. Later that night it happened again on its own. There&amp;#39;s an automatic scarecrow in the field behind my house, yesterday I walked up to it because I didn&amp;#39;t know what it was and deduced it was a scarecrow, today it started blaring its sirens and inflating on its own, with nothing around it. (I recorded this and will upload it after this post). After recording the scarecrow incident I went to the bathroom, came back and a cupboard full of towels was open and the towels were thrown across the floor. I&amp;#39;m home alone too. Freaked out to be upstairs I went and grabbed coffee and sat by the TV with my cat. Items off of the book case are then thrown, literally thrown off of the top of it towards me. Nothing hit me but it was obvious they were thrown towards me, bear in mind I&amp;#39;m maybe 10 or 15 feet away from the book case so for something to fall off, it would land a foot or two away from it, this reached me. &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/6Z2iG\"&gt;Here is an illustration.\n&lt;/a&gt;\nAll of this has happened after watching the ghost video with my girlfriend, is it possible these videos anger spirits IF I am being haunted?
