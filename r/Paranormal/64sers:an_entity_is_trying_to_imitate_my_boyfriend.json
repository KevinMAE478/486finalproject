We have been living in our current apartment since January of last year. The apartment is the entire first floor of an older house including the basement. No weird happenings since we&amp;#39;ve lived here. Neither of us are spiritual, religious, or hold any serious beliefs about anything paranormal but this past week I have had two experiences that are making me question that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last Thursay, it was sometime after midnight. My boyfriend was asleep in the bedroom and I decided to take a quick shower before I went to bed. As I stepped out of the shower I felt a distinct &amp;quot;presence&amp;quot; between me and the door. I could feel heat coming from it and even my hearing was slightly dulled on my right side as if someone was standing very close. It gave me a definite creepy feeling but I managed to shake it off, telling myself it had been a long work week and I was very tired, etc. I threw my robe on and as I was walking to the bedroom felt it again on my left side. At that point I was freaked out and high tailed it into the bedroom and shut the door behind me. As soon as I did that our next door neighbor&amp;#39;s dogs started freaking out inside their house barking and howling so loud I could hear it in my apartment. This is possibly unrelated but worth noting IMO as we live in a very quiet neighborhood, mostly old people and it&amp;#39;s rare to see so much as a living room light on after 10pm on our block.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday, my boyfriend had texted me saying he was heading over to a friend&amp;#39;s house after work and wouldn&amp;#39;t be home when I got home from work. Normal occurrence. Sometime between 530 and 6pm I was folding laundry in our bedroom. From where I was standing I could see through the bedroom doorway into the dining room. We have a side door that comes in from the driveway to the dining room and the basement door next to it, both were in my line of view. I heard what I thought was my boyfriend put his key in the door and turn the handle. I looked up to say hi and watched the basement door fly open with such force it hit the door next to it and bounced back halfway shut. Nobody had been in the basement that day and we always keep the door shut and latched so that our cat doesn&amp;#39;t go down there. I was paralyzed for a second but managed to run over and shut and lock the door. My boyfriend didn&amp;#39;t come home for almost 2 hours after that. This incident particularly gave me the creeps - the door flying open would have startled me but whatever or whoever did it imitated my boyfriend unlocking the door first, possibly knowing I would look up to see the basement door open on its own so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to brush it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither of us has had any deaths close to us recently and I find it strange that this is happening after so long living here. I told my boyfriend about both incidents after he came home Sunday and he agreed it was freaky, and he is an even bigger skeptic than I am.
