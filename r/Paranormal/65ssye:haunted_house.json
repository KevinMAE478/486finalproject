I ghost hunted frequently as a hobby so I have a few stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a ghost hunting story actually. It&amp;#39;s more of a personal experience. My cousin, who is like a brother, to me rented out his first house when we were 18 or 19. This house was about 1/2 a mile into the woods and extremely secluded. There was a gravel drive way and that was the only access point. The house was built in the early 1800s and had quite a few deaths happen on the property. In fact there was a graveyard about 50 feet away from the house with some of the original family members. (Not uncommon for that time period) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well everything was almost too good to be true at first. Half decent house, 3 bedrooms, tons of land, cheap rent, honestly couldn&amp;#39;t complain. There was 3 people living in this house at the time not uncommon for young people to split up rent just to save a buck. Then stuff started happening, cold spots in the middle of summer in a house with no A/C, picture frames falling off the walls, orbs in pictures etc. No one really brought it up at first but it was kind of like an unspoken common knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is when things got really weird. You would be outside having a cigarette and you&amp;#39;d hear a woman scream in the woods, or see what look like a shadow person in the driveway/fields, a full face of an elderly tall man appeared in several picture. So we sat down and talked to the owner. Apparently that would have been her great grandpa or something along those lines and he had died by falling down the staircase in the farm house. That very night as we were discussing it over a beer in the living room all by itself the hand railing was ripped out of the wall. We had all been ghost hunting together many times as hobby but we had no experience with living with it so we were pretty lost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple months later everyone had moved out for their own separate reasons. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone lives there right now but that house was damn scary to the point no one slept in it by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is my second post on here.
