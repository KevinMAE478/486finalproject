They have that cliche super creepy 1960&amp;#39;s two story home where it&amp;#39;s like super old fashioned with a creepy attic and everything so being in this house alone during anytime of the day has a weird and unsettling feeling about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway the experience starts out on a random Saturday during the summer. At the time the only people in the house were myself, my cousin, my older brother (he lived with my grandparents) and my grandparents. My cousin and I were visiting for the weekend. My cousin and I woke up early and started to play the PlayStation in the family room. My grandparents walked out of their room and told us they were leaving for my grandmothers doctors appointment and to run errands so they would be gone for a couple of hours. We were like &amp;quot;cool we have the house to ourselves.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My older brother at the time was living in one of the rooms upstairs and he came down to get breakfast and also told us he would be leaving sometime in the afternoon to go to his dance rehearsal for a show he was in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my cousin and I just chilled in the family room and continued playing games. Meanwhile we could hear loud music and foot steps moving around upstairs, we thought obviously my brother is dancing around and practicing, which he was. The music had stopped at some point but occasionally my cousin and I would hear my brother dancing still. We got bored of the games and started to watch movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About another two hours go by and my cousin and I were hungry so he suggested we hit up the burger joint down the street from the house. I agreed and we thought maybe my brother might be hungry too and we could still hear his foot steps upstairs so I called his cell phone and said &amp;quot;aye bro, me and Gary are going to Dan&amp;#39;s deli you want us to get you anything?&amp;quot; And my brother goes &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not home, I already left to rehearsal.&amp;quot; I was confused and said &amp;quot;wait like just now?&amp;quot; And he said &amp;quot;naw dude I left like 30 minutes ago.&amp;quot; My cousin and I looked at each other cause we could still hear the foot steps, then I said &amp;quot;are you for real? Did you go out the back door?&amp;quot; He said &amp;quot;yea man.&amp;quot; We got off the phone and my cousin and I were looking at each other like wtf? We can hear foot steps upstairs as we are speaking and we thought my brother was playing around with us so we started to yell his name from down stairs, he didn&amp;#39;t respond and we went to the back room and stared up the staircase and we both look at each other and bolted out the house and sat on the curb out in front of the house. We were like &amp;quot;hell nah!&amp;quot; We are not staying in that house!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We waited outside for about another hour or so and my grandparents finally came back. We told my grandpa what happen and he said &amp;quot;yea sometimes there&amp;#39;s spirits in the house&amp;quot; we were like &amp;quot;ummm what?!&amp;quot; and then my grandpa proceeded to tell us about how he saw his mom&amp;#39;s ghost in the house before and my grandpa was a pastor so I don&amp;#39;t think he would lie about something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yea something was definitely upstairs moving around and my cousin and I were not gonna find out what that was, black people be dying first in horror films and that was not about to be us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yea that was one of my unexplainable moments I&amp;#39;ve had, I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m not the only one who&amp;#39;s experience something paranormal haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I don't really believe in ghost and stuff because I feel like once you start to believe in that stuff, you begin to experience these type of things more often, but I feel like a nice chunk of people have experienced some unexplainable things and here's one of mines.\nSo this happened when I was like 15 ( I'm 21 now) this took place at my grandparents house.
