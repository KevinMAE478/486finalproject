Once in a while we have to go through that trail, since it's a shortcut to the kayak launch and when it's 95 degrees outside you're ready for anything that'll make your trip shorter. \n\nWhen I started there one of the first things I did was to familiarize myself with all areas of the preserve. So I spent quite a bit of time hiking through all of the trails, even the rarely used ones, since I have to know my way around to navigate groups or go \"rescue\" someone if they get lost (which happens). One part of the preserve is an old homestead site of a now-abandoned pineapple plantation. It was settled in the 1890s. We don't know much about the family beyond the name and the approximate year they settled there, and the approximate year the homestead was abandoned. This is in southern Florida and there are thousands of similarly abandoned homestead sites. The early settlers of that area had to be tough as nails. This was pre-railroad area, the nearest town was about five miles south through what would have been wilderness with no real roads. So these guys were on their own in a land absolutely bursting with mosquitos, panthers, bears, and bad water (water table is high and fresh water can be easily contaminated by the salt water nearby). In other words, early homesteaders were badasses because that was the only way they'd survive. \n\nThere is a narrow trail through what was once the homestead site. On one of my first days, I decided to trek through there. I got about a half-mile in when I started to get some weird vibes. I've always been sensitive to my surroundings and have spent enough time in isolated natural areas to know that if something doesn't feel right, it probably means your instincts are picking up on something you should pay attention to. Usually this means your brain is picking up on minute movements on the ground that indicate an unfriendly snake may be nearby or another animal you don't want to confront (while the panthers are nearly gone, we've got aggressive wild boars and bobcats that freely roam). \n\nSo I stopped dead in my tracks and let my mind go quiet, looking around carefully for any warning signs. There weren't any, and I didn't see any recent tracks, but the bad vibe feeling was still there. I shrugged it off and kept going, the trail getting narrower. And the bad vibes kept growing deep in my gut. I felt I was being watched and followed. Now, this is an isolated area so the possibility that a person was following me was remote, but possible. I stopped every few meters but there were no sounds. Actually, none at all, not even birds. I started to sweat and my heart started to race. One thought kept echoing in my mind: You are not welcome here. You are not welcome here. Turn around. You are not welcome. \n\nWell fuck that, I thought. Just jittery from nervous new job feeling, I thought. I came to a bend in the trail and I stopped. My feet would go no further. In my mind, the phrase got louder and louder: You are not welcome here! YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE! I heard a crash coming from behind me, but when I turned to investigate, there was no one. Not animal, not human, nothing. The vegetation was sparse enough I would have been able to see something. I turned around and left. \n\nI put it down to nerves or me being a wimp or something, and sort of forgot about it. About a month later, I'm taking a camp group through to the kayak launch where our kayaks await us. I decided to take the kids through the narrow trail to save us about ten minutes. We get to the same bend of the trail and the kids have gone silent. These are 9 yr olds in summer camp. They are not silent. They're never silent. I look behind me to one kid who looks as though he's scared shitless. \"I don't like it here,\" he said. \"Why not?\" I asked. \n\nHe looked me dead in the eye and said \"I feel like we shouldn't be here.\" \n\nI couldn't turn around at that point so we hustled to the kayak launch and all was well, but we were all a little on edge. I took another group through the trail a week later and again the kids were silent at that bend in the trail. For that whole summer, whenever I took the shortcut, kids would get silent and I'd get those bad vibes. \n\nI try not to go down that stretch of trail anymore if I can help it. Obviously this is nothing more than a gut feeling on my end but only a few other times in my life have I felt a gut feeling about a place that strongly. I don't know if it's the spirit of whatever homesteader was there or something else, and it's hard to describe, but it doesn't want people trespassing. As far as I know it's never hurt anyone but it seems to make everyone feel the same way: you're not welcome. \n\nEdit: I can go take some pictures of the bend in the trail if anyone really wants to see.\n\nEdit #2: This preserve is on the way to my friend D's house, where I spent Easter drinking and floating in a pool, so I stopped and got some pictures for you guys.

He raised his kids in suburbia and wants to get them outdoors and off the xbox. These are clearly suburban kids. After a walk in the woods you can usually tell how outdoorsy someone is. Folks used to being outside care about where they put their feet. Folks who hunt not only care about where they put their feet but won't step on game sign as a habit and move quietly. \n\nThese kids: Grew up on pavement. You could explain to them that there was a pile of shit near a thicket of poison ivy and they would step on all the [jewels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impatiens_capensis) in between. They did not care where their feet fell nor did they care about what they touched. To them, the woods weren't seen as an ecosystem unto itself but rather like someone tipped over a plant in the living room. It was dirty and devoid of value.

It's not uncommon to run into other people at the edges of the woods, it's fairly uncommon to run into people in the middle of the woods (even during hunting season) unless you're on the trails (which I wasn't), and it's decently common to run into the ruins of buildings from the 1800s. I happen to be hunting a new valley I was pretty sure had a crossing in it so, to set the view, I'm sitting on the top of a very steep shale slide looking down into a valley with a creek running through it. Approaching this plateau, there's a knife edge that runs up and down the ridge but there's really no way to get up to this spot except for the seriously determined, the drunk, and the foolish without walking up or down the edge. Getting up here creates quite a noise from the stones sliding on the stones, which means I know I need to sit up here for an hour to let things settle back down after I made the ascent. Since it's such a pain in the ass, I left my day pack at the bottom under a pine tree and only had a rifle, binoculars, water, and an energy bar.\n\nI'm up here for about 3 hours glassing this little piss of a stream looking for something to cross it and seeing nothing but squirrels and birds and I finally decide to start glassing the opposite hill out of sheer boredom. I am 90% sure I chose a poor spot and wasted an afternoon looking at nothing. Such is hunting, it's got really interesting days, and it's got really boring days, and this is why it's called \"hunting\" and not \"shooting\". As I'm screwing around with the focus on the binoculars I catch a glimpse of something which almost looks like a person if they were wearing dark blue clothes and about 4ft tall. 99% of the time the day hikers just pass by without realizing I'm here even with the blaze orange requirements. Or they pretend to ignore me, but you'd be amazed how many times someone has almost walked through my stand. Anyway, this person wasn't moving, which started to make me think I was wrong. It was just standing there, behind the cover of some low scrub brush and tree branches and I would have missed it were it not for the color.\n\nI zoom out a bit and realize I'm not looking at a person, but it's actually a collapsed cabin, and I was looking at where the door would be. Except it really looked like a person. And cabins aren't blue. I move the zoom back onto the door and play with the focus for about 5 minutes and I can't get the \"person\" to come back. In fact, the cabin door now has some light from the setting sun visible through the holes in the walls and roof. Whatever 4ft tall thing I was looking at has moved. \n\n\"Sigh. Teenagers, right?\"\n\nI have that thought and then realize something else. I still can hear birds, and squirrels, and all the other things in the woods which typically go quiet when they notice something. Which means that they didn't notice me, but that also means they didn't notice whatever was in the cabin door a short time ago. I'm doing my best to stay quiet and not move and whatever it was certainly did move. I would expect everything in the woods to have gone for cover with a teenager crashing through the brush, but the noises almost made it worse.\n\nThere was stuff moving in the brush. The problem was: *stuff was moving around in the brush.*\n\nI started to think it was a trick of the light, since the sun was setting, and it was getting to the part of the day when treestumps looked like deer. I knew I would have to move soon and figured I might as well pack it up since I still had to get down off the shale and back to the pine tree where I had planned to throw a tarp and sleep. At this time I realized it wasn't dark per se, but it was overcast now. Again - the creepy experience isn't that there's something obviously wrong, it's that everything is so completely normal for what I would expect were I alone.\n\nAbout this time a fog rolled into the valley, which the combination of overcast weather conditions, sunset, and a ground fog coming up in the wet, low valley had signaled it was time to leave. I checked my safety, put the caps on my glass, and reached up to take down my orange flag.\n\nThe moment I grabbed the flag, the Dread came. That's the only way to describe it, the woods went from \"animals going home to sleep\" to full on \"you're fucked\". The movement had attracted what I could only describe as a thousand invisible eyes which all turned in unison as they noticed me. Even wonder what a deer feels in the headlights? This is it. \n\nThen I heard children.\n\nI heard children laughing. Not teenagers. Not adults. Not women. But full on five year old kids laughing like they caught a firefly.\n\nI had hiked in 5 miles the previous day through woods and put down two more today when I woke up to get to this spot and I distinctly hear children laughing during what I could only describe as the most creepy moment I've ever had in a valley I know is completely unoccupied having stared at it for the last four hours or so.\n\nI am pretty sure my feet only touched the shale three times getting down from the knife edge, and I made a ton of noises doing it too. At this point I didn't really care. I grabbed the pack and my flashlight and absolutely full on fucking rucked it to the next hilltop. I killed my light halfway up the hill, and then went to the top of the hill, where I threw down the tarp and unrolled my foam, and there I sat all night watching the hill I just came from.
