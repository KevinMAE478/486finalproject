I'm posting with a throwaway because I don't want this linked to me.\n\nI don't believe in most of the things that I read on here.  I like reading the big threads in askreddit and stuff because I enjoy the creepiness, but honestly I think 99% of what I read here is either a hoax or someone seeing what they want to see.  This story isn't particularly spooky either.  With that said...\n\nI grew up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.  There's a stream that runs by the house, and a old deciduous forest that kind of wraps around one side and down the back.  My parents owned (and my mam still lives there, my parents are now divorced) some land behind the place that goes down into the forest.  On the other side is a planted forest, with  &gt; 40ft trees.  The other side is a road that the house used to service as a staging post type deal, a place where you could get supplies before you head north into the wilderness or a bed and a wash on your way south.  The place is old, I think the building is about 300 years old maybe.\n\nMy parents bought the place from an old lady in the late 80s.  My dad is a builder and he tore down the back wall facing the forest, rebuilt it in modern brick, and used the reclaimed stone to build an extension which had a living room and a kitchen in it.\n\nSo, now that's out the way: that forest is horrible.  Coming from rural Scotland I've spent plenty of time in the woods.  There's a feeling you get when everything just goes quiet, and you just get this feeling that you shouldn't be there.  That's all the time from this place.  My mam has fenced off half the area because she doesn't want to go down there.\n\nWeird stuff used to happen all the time.  Things would move in the kitchen or living room, but never anywhere else.  At night you'd hear glasses clink together, or you'd hear something being slid on the counter etc.  You'd get up in the morning and things would be just slightly moved.  I thought I saw someone walk past the door once, but I can't be sure.  I never saw anything directly.  Nothing particularly weird.\n\nMy parents divorced, I moved out.  About 10 years ago I started having dreams about the house.  Maybe once a month I'll have the same dream: I'm standing in the kitchen and I'm looking out the window at the forest.  I'm a grown man as I am now, but the house is the same as it was maybe 20 years ago.  There's some very distinctive things that I remember from when I was a kid.  Every time I had one of these dreams it would bother me, I don't remember them and these are extremely vivid and clear.\n\nThen, about a month ago I had another dream.  I'm down at the edge of the forest and there's someone in like a dark red hood/cape thing.  I didn't see a face or anything, just that cloak which had like embroidery on it in a similar colour.  Then I walked back to the house, up the broken path to the house, and I went into the kitchen.  I looked out the window and Red Cloak is gone.  Then three... uh... weird things come up to the edge of the forest.  They look hunched over like gorillas, but they have weird heads: one looked like a human skull with white eyes, one like an owl's head with yellow eyes and one like a deer or horse skull with horns, and yellow eyes.  The three of them came up out the forest, they looked at me and I just stared back at them, and they left.  The day after I was pretty distracted by the whole thing.  I thought about posting it on here, I wrote it all out on my phone and then deleted it.  I drew the creatures in my notebook so I wouldn't forget them.  I got barely any work done.  I made an excuse to visit that weekend and I felt like I wanted to go down there.  It's never a feeling I've had before.  I keep thinking I should go visit and take a walk down there.\n\nAnyway, a week or so after I went to see my dad.  I brought up that I visited my mam, and the house still gives me the creeps.  And you know what's weird, I dream about the place a lot.  My dad says to me \"huh, that's strange.  For about the last 10 years I've been having dreams about the place too.  I'm standing in the kitchen looking out the window, then I look down and there's no floor just like when I was renovating the place\".  So that would date the house to about 10 years before it is in my dreams.\n\nI don't know what to think of it.  If I was pressed I'd say that I thought it could be some forest spirits or something, those are pretty common in folklore here.  I don't think there's enough evidence to say it's paranormal, but it's a pretty strange coincidence that we've been having the same dream for a decade.  I don't know, I just feel the need to talk about it.  Make of it what you will.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m from Scotland.  I&amp;#39;m posting with a throwaway because I don&amp;#39;t want this linked to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe in most of the things that I read on here.  I like reading the big threads in askreddit and stuff because I enjoy the creepiness, but honestly I think 99% of what I read here is either a hoax or someone seeing what they want to see.  This story isn&amp;#39;t particularly spooky either.  With that said...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.  There&amp;#39;s a stream that runs by the house, and a old deciduous forest that kind of wraps around one side and down the back.  My parents owned (and my mam still lives there, my parents are now divorced) some land behind the place that goes down into the forest.  On the other side is a planted forest, with  &amp;gt; 40ft trees.  The other side is a road that the house used to service as a staging post type deal, a place where you could get supplies before you head north into the wilderness or a bed and a wash on your way south.  The place is old, I think the building is about 300 years old maybe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents bought the place from an old lady in the late 80s.  My dad is a builder and he tore down the back wall facing the forest, rebuilt it in modern brick, and used the reclaimed stone to build an extension which had a living room and a kitchen in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now that&amp;#39;s out the way: that forest is horrible.  Coming from rural Scotland I&amp;#39;ve spent plenty of time in the woods.  There&amp;#39;s a feeling you get when everything just goes quiet, and you just get this feeling that you shouldn&amp;#39;t be there.  That&amp;#39;s all the time from this place.  My mam has fenced off half the area because she doesn&amp;#39;t want to go down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird stuff used to happen all the time.  Things would move in the kitchen or living room, but never anywhere else.  At night you&amp;#39;d hear glasses clink together, or you&amp;#39;d hear something being slid on the counter etc.  You&amp;#39;d get up in the morning and things would be just slightly moved.  I thought I saw someone walk past the door once, but I can&amp;#39;t be sure.  I never saw anything directly.  Nothing particularly weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents divorced, I moved out.  About 10 years ago I started having dreams about the house.  Maybe once a month I&amp;#39;ll have the same dream: I&amp;#39;m standing in the kitchen and I&amp;#39;m looking out the window at the forest.  I&amp;#39;m a grown man as I am now, but the house is the same as it was maybe 20 years ago.  There&amp;#39;s some very distinctive things that I remember from when I was a kid.  Every time I had one of these dreams it would bother me, I don&amp;#39;t remember them and these are extremely vivid and clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, about a month ago I had another dream.  I&amp;#39;m down at the edge of the forest and there&amp;#39;s someone in like a dark red hood/cape thing.  I didn&amp;#39;t see a face or anything, just that cloak which had like embroidery on it in a similar colour.  Then I walked back to the house, up the broken path to the house, and I went into the kitchen.  I looked out the window and Red Cloak is gone.  Then three... uh... weird things come up to the edge of the forest.  They look hunched over like gorillas, but they have weird heads: one looked like a human skull with white eyes, one like an owl&amp;#39;s head with yellow eyes and one like a deer or horse skull with horns, and yellow eyes.  The three of them came up out the forest, they looked at me and I just stared back at them, and they left.  The day after I was pretty distracted by the whole thing.  I thought about posting it on here, I wrote it all out on my phone and then deleted it.  I drew the creatures in my notebook so I wouldn&amp;#39;t forget them.  I got barely any work done.  I made an excuse to visit that weekend and I felt like I wanted to go down there.  It&amp;#39;s never a feeling I&amp;#39;ve had before.  I keep thinking I should go visit and take a walk down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a week or so after I went to see my dad.  I brought up that I visited my mam, and the house still gives me the creeps.  And you know what&amp;#39;s weird, I dream about the place a lot.  My dad says to me &amp;quot;huh, that&amp;#39;s strange.  For about the last 10 years I&amp;#39;ve been having dreams about the place too.  I&amp;#39;m standing in the kitchen looking out the window, then I look down and there&amp;#39;s no floor just like when I was renovating the place&amp;quot;.
