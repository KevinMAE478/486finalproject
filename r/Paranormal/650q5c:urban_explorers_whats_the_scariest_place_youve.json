Over the years this place saw things from an injured or possibly dead teen, to a crazy homeless man.\n\nThis place was huge, tucked in the bush behind the town, it was an entire factory, multiple buildings and a huge carpark. The whole thing was rusted and covered in graffiti, large sections including the main building had collapsed over the years. As it was relatively close to the township it became a sort of refuge for the local teenagers. My friends and I spend many days there, climbing the structures, drawing on the walls and skating.\n\nNothing downright paranormal happened there but there were several unnerving events that took place over the years until it was demolished around 2013:\n\nOne of the best things to do there was climb. The twisted rusted metal and the derelict chimneys made for perfect play equipment. One day when I was in early high school everyone was saying that there had been police cars and an ambulance at the \"Brick-O\" (what we called the abandoned brick factory). When we went there next there was a whole new fence around the site and portion of the ceiling that we often climbed on had completely collapsed, exposing ruined broken concrete and steel underneath. While I cannot say for fact, the general consensus was that the police and ambulance had taken someone who had been Injured or killed after the roof the were climbing on collapsed. \n\nOne of the creeper parts of the factory were the underground tunnels. Looking back I figure these must have been for ventilation as they were all connected to the chimneys and they were very small; As children we had to crawl to even get in. Nothing downright scary ever happened here but we would find a shoe or a hat or phone in the tunnels which would be enough fuel for us to say that something fishy was up. The tunnels were all level and only a few feet below the ground, that is except for one point; at the end of one tunnel there was a drop. The space became smaller, though we could have fit if we wanted too. This part of the tunnel went down at a very steep incline as far as we could see into the darkness. None of us were brace enough to venture down but this steep dark passage into the ground was the source of many a story of monsters or lost children. \n\nBy far the creepiest things that happened needs a little context. The factory was a popular hang out spot for the local teens when I was in early high school, but after it became prolific the police kept installing newer and better fences, and a security guard was often present. Due to this the factory became relatively empty for several years. By the time I was in late high school the security had eased and my friends and I went back. Before very long it became clear to us that someone was living in the abandoned factory.\nOne of the more intact buildings had chairs and couches and had been mostly boarded up from the inside. The news spread fast that there was a hobo living there. As we were terrible teenage boys many of my friends and other local groups took to hassling this homeless man. This resulted on him becoming very territorial. We could scream at any kids that came in and throw stones at the braver older boys. I only ever saw him in person a few times, from what I remember he had a dark beard and wore a sort of bomber jacket, but what stuck with me was that he looked relatively young and that his eyes always seemed so bloodshot as to be red. Anyway the more the local kids hassled him the more aggressive he got, eventually he put up these sort of sign/monument things to scare us. Basically they were a column or poll he would position at most of the entrances, he had written messages along the lines of \"stay out for your own safety\" and he decorated them with gaged rusted metal spikes and bits of rope and net and other junk so that they looked sort of like some cultist totem poll, or at least that's how I remember it. \n\nOne time when it was clear he wasn't 'home' we went into his sleeping room to check it out. It was filthy and dark, with not much furniture besides an old mattress and some plastic chairs. It was dusty and stank like piss but what I remember best was how he had a huge pile of old books and magazines and how he had stuck many pages to the walls, featuring strange pictures and articles that he had written and drawn over. We also found many porn magazines here, that were clearly... 'used'.\n\nLastly. I said earlier that the whole place was covered in graffiti. Well around the time that the hobo moved in there was this one type of graffiti that became very prolific. It was always in the same handwriting and was all over the site. But unlike your usual tag this graffiti was line after line after line of writing. It seemed messy and psychotic  in how it was written, and from what it remember it was usually deranged rambling about demons and free will and other philosophical stuff. I can't say for sure if this was the hobo, but it seemed to fit his M.O.\n\ntldr: there was an abandoned brick factory near my childhood town that was creepy and derelict and featured dark tunnels, one time someone fell through the roof and was taken away in an ambulance and there was an aggressive hobo with some strange hobbies that lived there.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school my friends and I always sought out abandoned places to explore.
