Her parents live in a section of Philly, known as Parkwood...she&amp;#39;s not the only one in that neighborhood that I know, who claims they have weird things happening in their homes. She knew the place was haunted from the moment she was adopted. Her brothers always had experiences too. We&amp;#39;ll start with what she has told me about her personal experiences, from before we met. Then I&amp;#39;ll make another post, talking about the things that I have seen there myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place has a very eerie vibe to it. It&amp;#39;s a row home, three floors with a garage that was converted into a basement and also had a back door that leads into their very large backyard. Her parents don&amp;#39;t (never have) used the second floor, which is the real living room. It has furniture and everything but they never sit up there. The living room is always cold, no matter what time of the year it is. Even during the winter with the heat turned all the way up, the place is freezing cold. The few times that we would sit up there during the winter, we would have to wear jackets, DESPITE having the heat cranked ALL THE WAY UP. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me say, that I believe there are multiple entities in this house. There is something very dark and very evil that lives in the attic. There is something playful but also, not very nice...I guess it&amp;#39;s a poltergeist. There was also a very negative experience my wife had as a child, that I won&amp;#39;t go much into detail about. It wasn&amp;#39;t paranormal but it was very traumatizing and seems to have left an imprint in the house. In short, she was abused by a specific member of the family and it went on for over a year. My guess is that the negative energy from this experience, created some sort of...thing...because to this day, things happen throughout the house such as people hearing my wife&amp;#39;s voice and the family members voice, arguing, when neither of them are even home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been pounding noises on her bedroom wall, that the neighbor has reported hearing...during the abuse, my wife pounded on that exact same wall to alert her neighbor who was not home during the actual incident. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other things that happen in this home, consist of shadow figures and I guess what some would call &amp;quot;dopplegangers&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is something there, that likes to appear as my wife. Many times, her brothers have claimed to see her in certain parts of the house when it wasn&amp;#39;t really even her. The attic door is one of those old fashioned drop down doors, with a latter attached. One day, she and her brother went up there to get the air conditioners at the start of the summer. The latter wound up flipping up and closing itself and they were trapped in the attic for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other times, the latter has been known to drop down on it&amp;#39;s own, in the middle of the night. The closet doors in my wife&amp;#39;s old bedroom would often open and slam themselves shut, or just simply start shaking, gaining attention from her cat, who would hiss and growl at the doors at 4 or 5 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we first started dating, there was an incident that seemed to make everything there ten times worse. Basically, my wife (girlfriend at the time) and her mother found a cat in the middle of the street, that had been hit by a car. They decided to give it a proper burial in the backyard. In the yard, there was this one spot covered up by bricks. Underneath the bricks were pebbles and stones that covered up a hole that was already there, before her parents even bought that house. My wife didn&amp;#39;t feel right moving any of this stuff out of the way, let alone burying a cat in a hole that was already there for reasons we still don&amp;#39;t know (there was nothing in it, but it was covered up by all this crap) My mother-in-law is a bit of an idiot though, so she insisted on digging this thing up and using it as a spot to bury the dead cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after that things started getting really bad around the house. Shadow figures started showing up much more often, voices could be heard at random and on the phone too. I would call her on their landline and be met with nothing but static and scratchy voices, that were mumbling things I couldn&amp;#39;t quite understand. Banging sounds in the middle of the night could be heard. Her brother was trying to sleep one night and something kept kicking his bedroom door. He wound up flipping out and when he went to open the door, it wouldn&amp;#39;t open. Their father had to physically remove the door by force, just so he could get out of the room. It was just straight up stuck and wouldn&amp;#39;t move for anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the things that have happened there. I have many more stories to tell, some of them that include me, as they took place when we were actually dating. It gets pretty scary. At one point, my friends and I were followed by &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; in our CAR and we&amp;#39;re confident that it came from my wife&amp;#39;s house, as it began following the car immediately after we dropped her off that night. That&amp;#39;s a story for my next post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not asking anyone to believe any of the things that I will post, regarding this house. Some of it sounds crazy but living it is even crazier. I&amp;#39;ve had small experiences of my own, but none of them compare to the things my wife dealt with in that house, or the things I saw myself there when we started dating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re also 90% positive that one of the things from that house, followed her here to my place when she moved in and is still attached to her. That particular entity is not actually from that home but has been attached to her, since she was about 3 or 4 years old.
