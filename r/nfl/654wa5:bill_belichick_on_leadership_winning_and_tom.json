Hard news and trade rumors are obviously an essential part of the sports journalism world, but we don't really need all of the \"Hot Take\" fluff from industry professionals. That's the type of dialogue you're meant to have with your buddies at the bar, and honestly the fact that it's been adopted as a television format has severely deteriorated the quality of conversations we can have as fans. The debates are now framed for us and the arguments on both sides come pre-canned.\n\nI'd love for journalists to shift toward reporting that actually utilizes their unparalleled access to players, coaches and league executives. I want more stories like the Rangers sealing the deal with Rougned Odor by dangling a pair of race horses, or how Bart Starr ended up switching his 3rd Round pick in the '83 draft from Joe Montana to DE Charles Johnson at the last minute. Go find some people who were in the war room that day, and write a story about how the debate unfolded. *That's* fascinating.\n\nI can come up with my own crazy theories and predictions based on publicly available stats.
