Your stomach will churn any time she gets upset with you. This is not the mark of a healthy relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following relationship I had, I was even more into this girl than the previous. After almost a year, she converted to Mormonism and started dating the guy that baptised her. You gotta believe that that hurt like a motherfucker. It was made worse by the fact that I worked with her (back when I was in college, I worked as a server for several years) like 4 days a week. I blocked her on every social media platform and ignored the shit out of her at work. The best days were Sundays because she didn&amp;#39;t work and I was usually scheduled a double shift. I could go the entire day without thinking about her. Despite being more into her than the previous girl, I got over her faster because I didn&amp;#39;t let myself open up the wound every day by &amp;quot;just checking her facebook to see how she&amp;#39;s doing&amp;quot;. I cauterized that shit and didn&amp;#39;t look back. I was able to gain a lot more confidence because I wasn&amp;#39;t meekly looking around for any and every way to make her try to like me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it isn&amp;#39;t easy, and you definitely won&amp;#39;t feel better right away, but it will happen. Every day you&amp;#39;re going to wake up and she&amp;#39;s going to be the first thing you think about. But one day, not too far away, she&amp;#39;ll be the second.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nfl", "name": "t1_dg5sow1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492029290.0, "created_utc": 1492000490.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmg3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sp93", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmg3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sp93", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg611x4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ajr901", "parent_id": "t1_dg5zf4m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nfl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You guys are making me feel like I'm in /r/wholesomememes!
