Therefore you let Nike do their &amp;quot;color rush&amp;quot; jerseys so they can make them without having to pay additional licensing for the old designs while owning all the rights to the current iteration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The no alternate helmet rule is just bullshit.  Make the team buy a couple copies of every players&amp;#39; helmet in whatever colors you&amp;#39;d like them to play in and add some equipment verification to the gameday rules (eg, if wearing alternate helmets, no other team helmet or color combo is allowed on sidelines).  Players already have extra helmets on the sidelines in case of reasons; having an extra set of matching helmet make/model with different colors seems like a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nfl", "name": "t1_dg4efsf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491952910.0, "created_utc": 1491924110.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ah1k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 87, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GulfAg", "parent_id": "t1_dg48zjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nfl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Seriously... how was this not the most obvious choice?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously... how was this not the most obvious choice?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nfl", "name": "t1_dg4ah1k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491948230.0, "created_utc": 1491919430.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 87}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg48zjo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 183, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thatguyfromnewyork", "parent_id": "t1_dg472nw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nfl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wish it was Throwback Thursday instead.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish it was Throwback Thursday instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nfl", "name": "t1_dg48zjo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491946260.0, "created_utc": 1491917460.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 183}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg472nw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 84, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fuckthepats_sb51", "parent_id": "t3_64qk69", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nfl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not the worst but I wish color Rush was actually color rush", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the worst but I wish color Rush was actually color rush&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nfl", "name": "t1_dg472nw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491943371.0, "created_utc": 1491914571.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 84}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmg3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qk69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg499uh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 40, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jbots", "parent_id": "t3_64qk69", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nfl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fucking up the original Ray Rice suspension.
