When he plays he is a top 5 wide out in the NFL, he posses the strength, height, speed, catching ability, he blocks, has agility and moves to make people miss and he isn't afraid to go up for those 50-50 balls. He has the tools teams dream of when they look for a bona-fide #1 Elite Receiver.\n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThis dude as you all know is a headcase, if it's not pot it's drinking, or the cryptic tweets or yesterday's snapchat debacle. He has the athletic ability of Julio Jones but the brain of Johnny Manziel after a night in Vegas. You feel for the guy, especially here in Cleveland. He is our guy, we took the chance on him and he delivered. He was our go to playmaker. But he can't keep it together. No matter how many times we gave him the benefit of the doubt or just held onto the thought of what he can be in this league, all of his hype seemed to go up in smoke.\n\nYesterday the series of Snapchats and his [tweet](https://twitter.com/JOSH_GORDONXII/status/851497884377899011) about wanting a new start alienated him from the fanbase that for the most part stuck with him, told him to get his life in order, sure we we're pissed about the suspensions but who wouldn't be, telling him to stop smoking and that he was throwing his career away was just passion,we don't get the flashy showtime players here, and when we have one we cherish them even if they hurt us time and time again. We're the girlfriend who goes back to the abusive boyfriend no matter how many times they hurt us, because we hope he can change for the better and know if he just took a second to evaluate his decisions he can turn his life around, but no we get shit on again.\n\nHonestly Fuck Josh Gordon, unless he was told he was getting cut there is no need to have this episode. Even then shouldn't he be thankful we stuck with him through all of his suspensions. Does he realize we control where he plays if he even plays at all. He is an RFA at the end of his contract he can't just walk out the door. \n\nPersonally I hope there is a trade in the works and  his agent got wind of it and told Josh. I hope he gets his life together but to bite the hand the fed you for so long is just pathetic, before you go well Hue said they were moving on, it was about last year, he was not playing so we moved on with who we had available to us when week 1 rolled around. There were reports here and there that our FO checked in on Josh to make sure he was in the right place. \n\nWe never quit on Josh, He quit on us.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My honest take on Josh:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Josh is electric, there is a reason he is called Flash Gordon. When he plays he is a top 5 wide out in the NFL, he posses the strength, height, speed, catching ability, he blocks, has agility and moves to make people miss and he isn&amp;#39;t afraid to go up for those 50-50 balls. He has the tools teams dream of when they look for a bona-fide #1 Elite Receiver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This dude as you all know is a headcase, if it&amp;#39;s not pot it&amp;#39;s drinking, or the cryptic tweets or yesterday&amp;#39;s snapchat debacle. He has the athletic ability of Julio Jones but the brain of Johnny Manziel after a night in Vegas. You feel for the guy, especially here in Cleveland. He is our guy, we took the chance on him and he delivered. He was our go to playmaker. But he can&amp;#39;t keep it together. No matter how many times we gave him the benefit of the doubt or just held onto the thought of what he can be in this league, all of his hype seemed to go up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the series of Snapchats and his &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JOSH_GORDONXII/status/851497884377899011\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about wanting a new start alienated him from the fanbase that for the most part stuck with him, told him to get his life in order, sure we we&amp;#39;re pissed about the suspensions but who wouldn&amp;#39;t be, telling him to stop smoking and that he was throwing his career away was just passion,we don&amp;#39;t get the flashy showtime players here, and when we have one we cherish them even if they hurt us time and time again. We&amp;#39;re the girlfriend who goes back to the abusive boyfriend no matter how many times they hurt us, because we hope he can change for the better and know if he just took a second to evaluate his decisions he can turn his life around, but no we get shit on again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly Fuck Josh Gordon, unless he was told he was getting cut there is no need to have this episode. Even then shouldn&amp;#39;t he be thankful we stuck with him through all of his suspensions. Does he realize we control where he plays if he even plays at all. He is an RFA at the end of his contract he can&amp;#39;t just walk out the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I hope there is a trade in the works and  his agent got wind of it and told Josh. I hope he gets his life together but to bite the hand the fed you for so long is just pathetic, before you go well Hue said they were moving on, it was about last year, he was not playing so we moved on with who we had available to us when week 1 rolled around.
