You'll need Grave Injustice or a shitton of CDR to get that cooldown down a lot.  Wear a Tiklandian Visage so you can hopefully avoid damage and you can get another 25% with a Krelm's Buff Belt.\n\n\nThe Krelm's is the toughest movespeed to maintain.  Another thing to test are the Warzechian Armguards to see what kind of boost you can get (I was too lazy to go try to test that one because it's annoying).\n\n\nYour rotation is Soul Harvest every time it's off CD (maintain 10 stacks), Horrify, chicken for 4 seconds, explode, Horrify, (if needed / available use SH), repeat.\n\n\nFierce Loyalty (15, because you'll be in combat) + Chicken (150) + Horrify (20 + 60 from RoR) + Soul Harvest (50) + lightning (25) + 25 PP = 345.

If you really want a boost (very short term) have Spirit Walk (Severence) on your bar for another 100 MS.  Rotation becomes SH - SW - Horrify - Hex.  In theory, if you haven't been hit from your Krelm's, you're 470.  Pull off the WA move and you're even faster.\n\nSpeed Pylons give you 80 I think.  Maybe 100?  Can't remember.  Nephelem Globes give you a little.  Not sure it's worth carrying w/e that item is that spawns more, as you'll see plenty of them on lower torments.  I ran through a T1 with the described build just to see how fast I could go and was pretty consistently bouncing around 420 (I realized at the end I forgot the WoL).  Grabbing a speed pylon when you've got everything going makes you zip even faster.\n\nI covered most of things I could think of and test on my WD, but it's late so I might have missed something.
