The build you are displaying is the meta-GR push build.  Might I suggest coming out with a separate video displaying the 2-PC Uliana with EP - Flesh is Weak rune and the mechanics behind that.  If anyone is interested, the tl;dr is that using 2-PC Uliana applies EP (bleed) on anything you hit with the last hit from a generator.  This gives the WD a lot of Blood Frenzy stacks for Pain Enhancer, so they can start stacking Haunt extremely fast.  Also, when you have EP - Flesh is Weak rune on your bar, 2-PC Uliana applies the rune to the monsters hit, which lets them take 15% more damage.  This build is primarily for speeds - EP bleed causes too much lag in high pushes when things aren't dying as fast.  There's been even more lag lately with the DH's Marked for Death stacking on top of the EP bleed.\n\n2. When you went over Inner Sanctuary runes, why did you completely skip over Temple of Protection?  The only 2 viable runes are Temple of Protection (CC immunity) and Safe Haven.  A lot of top tier pushes are done with either ToP or SH.  *Literally no one uses Intervene.*\n\n3. Unity should always be used over Guardians Path.  You don't need it at all as zDPS.\n\n4. It seems you completely forgot to talk about what's in your cube.  I'm assuming you're using Flying Dragon, Spirit Guards/Strongarm Bracers, and Band of Rue Chambers.
