It is supposed to not have an auto-attack. The idea is to run rifts, find elites, group them and spam cooldowns. Then run to the next pack of elites.  You should not just copy the builds you see on the ladder, but rather see what top people are playing and then find a guild on google for that build. \n\nLoN Bomb is a hard build to play if you are not used to this play-style. It is also very hard to gear for, as you need most of the gear to be Ancient. Try googling an Ivoker Thorns build for season 10, it's much more fun and you can use it to gear-up for LoN Bomb. Alternatively, the Hammerdin build is as powerful as LoN Bomb, but easier to gear for. Use websites like icy-veins.com to find good builds for this season. \n\nAlso, since you are a casual player, feel free to change the build so it is more to your liking :) If you don't plan on topping the ladder, feel free to be creative with you build.
