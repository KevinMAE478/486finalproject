I&amp;#39;m not the best at this build but I cleared GR75 and I think our gear is similar. One thing that helped me was cubing the belt and getting a Swami with Arcane Power on Crit so I could channel Ray longer and get Archon back faster.

Just to give an example - so far I've got to GR80 with ease, and haven't tried pushing farther as I'm currently working on my augments - which I farm at GR60 in 2.5 - 3 minutes per rift (wearing Nemesis, which is supposed to make me even more vulnerable, but things die in one hit).\n\nSince your gear is fine to do the same on that level, just maybe wanted to provide some game play tips that I've learned (sorry in advance if you're already aware of most of them).\n\n1. Using Healing Potion - Wizards are glass cannon, but Force Armour rune allows you to basically sort of ignore your health pool since it'll take three attacks to trigger your Unstable Anomaly. If you're in a tricky situation where you are being hit and don't want to lose the passive just yet - click that potion at around 30% health mark, giving yourself two extra hits threshold. Also, I'm not sure with what healing potions are best for this build, but I run with the one that fears nearby enemies for 4 sec and I find it to be really useful.\n\n2. Teleport - Calamity - At first I thought it was merely means of avoiding damage and mobility, while also providing a Tal Rasha stack. But the stun element on it can be used offensively. At lower level GR's (do not do this higher up), I sometimes just teleport into enemies to stun them and quickly recharge my cooldown with Ray + Zodiac (obviously you want to use it to reduce Archon's timer and teleport as little as possible, but sometimes battlefield calls for it if you get caught without Archon in a bad and crowded spot).\n\n3. Watching your Archon expire - sometimes it's best to know and pick a right place to drop Archon. If you watch the map and your timer, you'll be able to set up / pick a much safer spot where you could set up your Hydras and channel Ray to get the cooldown back. If you do this properly you will never find yourself outside of Archon for literally longer than 5-8 seconds max.\n\n4. Another important tip for recharging your cooldown with Ray is to always stutter-step. Don't just stand there and channel the skill (unless it's safe). If you're getting chased or surrounded, channel just enough to keep up or get your Gogok stack and move a little, then repeat.\n\n5. Goes without saying, but just in case - Zei + Starfire increase your damage by a lot, so try to shoot things from afar. Just the tip is the way to go here.\n\n6. Always teleport in Archon and command enemy movement. Always have your Slow Time up - it nullifies all the incoming projectiles. \n\n7. Gogok of Swiftness - is a must. However, it is also your responsibility to keep it at max stacks during Archon downtime. Sometimes at lower content I find my Hydra's one-shotting everything and I end up without the targets to keep my stacks up on. So be mindful.\n\n8. Trapped vs Stricken - I've seen a lot of strong opinions in this topic already, but for T13 / GR60 you absolutely do not need Stricken. I've never had my rift guardian live for longer than 1 sec and same applies to most of the monsters / elites and your gear is good enough to be erasing things from the screen.\n\nHope some of it helps and good luck!", "edited": 1492501470.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This season is my first time playing Wizard, and Lightning Hydra is pretty much the only build I&amp;#39;ve been playing so far (apart from DMO at the start), so I&amp;#39;m not quite sure how the playstyle compares to the Firebird, which is more familiar to you, but you definitely have the experience having cleared GR85.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m sorry to hear that you&amp;#39;re hurting playing this build, because with your gear you should be able to absolutely demolish T13 / GR60 content.
