Helltooth is pretty good solo but feels like it falls fairly hard around GR 80 mostly due to the fact you can&amp;#39;t really control pets and an arach build just feels too damn squishy for solo, though arachs is prolly one of the best trash clearing for groups. Crusader is solid af solo running a hammerdin but just not quite the same level as a DH or sorc(if i had to guess it&amp;#39;s due to the fact you lose a ton of damage after your hammers hit 3 enemies so it kinda limits their clear speed in higher GR&amp;#39;s). Monk is still arguably the best ZDPS, not sure about solo monk though, haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone pushing em high solo yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "diablo3", "name": "t1_dgdjrax", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468416.0, "created_utc": 1492439616.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdk25s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dehlert", "parent_id": "t3_65vo5y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/diablo3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dh is probably best but I've had issues getting right on targets before which can hinder your ability to kill faat", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dh is probably best but I&amp;#39;ve had issues getting right on targets before which can hinder your ability to kill faat&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "diablo3", "name": "t1_dgdk25s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468813.0, "created_utc": 1492440013.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8423", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MazeMouse", "parent_id": "t1_dgdu6ba", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/diablo3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Getting lightning cycle on my convention as a DH is also a fun time with the RG.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting lightning cycle on my convention as a DH is also a fun time with the RG.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "diablo3", "name": "t1_dge8423", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496491.0, "created_utc": 1492467691.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo5y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgetyhi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Blumenblatt", "parent_id": "t1_dgeed7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/diablo3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This ^    \n\nThere is so much in play that nothing is guaranteed for anyone", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ^    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is so much in play that nothing is guaranteed for anyone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "diablo3", "name": "t1_dgetyhi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492528145.0, "created_utc": 1492499345.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeed7e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "muppet70", "parent_id": "t1_dgdu6ba", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/diablo3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "All HC:\n\nIn solo dh's are way ahead of wd.\n\nLate season depends what you are shooting for, if your 4 man group will cap out at around 90 wiz is prob better than dh maybe even double wiz.\n\nI've seen 4man double wiz groups do 95 (S10).\n\nThe only person I know who have played above 105 (between s9 and s10) praised dh for rg snipe when going really high.\n\nDH complements the wd very well and also move normally, the wizard teleporting makes it hard for barb to keep everyone ip'd.\n\nIn HC it will also to some extent also depend on what DPS class rips most.\n\nBut a lot depends on group skill, I've had issues with WD on gr80 this season and breezed through 85 with supps that knew what they were doing.
