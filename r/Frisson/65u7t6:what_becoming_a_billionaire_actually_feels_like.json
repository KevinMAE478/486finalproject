To be completely honest, that attitude is the exact same thing that I had heard from every friend \"trying to help\" that had never experienced *real* depression, and it was also the one thing that would make me the most upset at these people \"trying to help\" because it trivialized the way I actually felt (the few who *had* experienced real depression were the ones that would say \"I'm here anytime you need, but you should absolutely find a therapist, because they're the ones who can actually make you better\"). \n\nI went from being depressed and unemployed to being depressed with a shitty job to being depressed with an ok job to being depressed with a very nice job (which is where I've been for the past few years now) - while the job and money flow improved, the only thing that made the depression better was the weekly therapy to discover the underlying issues behind my depression and treat it correctly. Having a job helped me to climb out of that hole because it gave me something to focus on as I was getting better, but that's about it. If I had won a few hundred million dollars in the lottery before starting therapy, or during one of the shitty jobs, I would be a guy with a few hundred million dollars who still couldn't find the strength to get out of bed in the morning, except now I wouldn't need to hold myself accountable to a boss and could just lie there all day feeling nothing.

The trick here is people assume that this answer must mean someone they are 100% COMFORTABLE with.... but that's not true. I first started connecting with my best friends over sushi or music. It started off innocent and soon when you get to talking you find out if you are compatible... Once you are compatible with similar interests and likes, start talking about you. What makes you happy. What has made you sad. Soon you'll start to open up more and develop a deeper connection with someone. This creates a sense of loyalty. \"Wow Ofcyouare just confessed something to me... he must really trust me with this\".... Share experiences you've been through and open up. I noticed that I have two best friends who are two different types of people. One is more open with me while the other tends to be a bit more reserved. The way I approach it is simple... Just be me... I am more open about my feelings and emotions and in turn the one who is more reserved feels more connected having seeing me entrust him with all my pain, happiness and experiences. He eventually started confiding in me about his life and experiences and says \"I have never told anyone this before and it feels good to let it out\".... I remember the exact moment him and I became extremely close... I was sitting in his living room going through some extremely hurtful times with school and family... but I never really told anyone... One day he noticed something was off and asked me what was wrong... I, in my state of vulnerability, told him everything and the moment I started crying, he jumped off his seat and embraced me and told me he would always be there for me....
