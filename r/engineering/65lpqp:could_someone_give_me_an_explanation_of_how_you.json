These require tapers in their respective directions to be able to slide out after the plastic solidify&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common CAD software has draft angle and wall thickness analyses tools build in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If your average wall thickness is 2mm, a ~4mm thick block will be problematic and cause sinks and holes in the plastic. (Depending on the plastic used and its additives)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3d Design workflow:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sketch/mock up part.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determine Placement in front/back moulds. (Position of split line).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consider plastic injection point (Preferably in a thick region in the middle of the part).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consider ejector points.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determine need for slides in other directions and accompanying dradfts and split lines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Draw part.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remove remove overly thick/solid pieces. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply draft angles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply edge fillets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Send file to (mold) toolmaker.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply toolmaker feedback/simulation results to model.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Applying edge fillets before doing the drafts is a common mistake and not recommended. It makes the drafting harder. You can also send the files to the toolmaker before applying edge fillets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make 3d prints often during design to test features.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "engineering", "name": "t1_dgdvug2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492482271.0, "created_utc": 1492453471.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpqp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc1nwv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pariel", "parent_id": "t1_dgbsp9c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/engineering", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A sphere is less optimal because it requires injection through a very small orifice.
