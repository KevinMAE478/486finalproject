Is it possible to use the smaller carbs, given the air inlet is the same, by restricting the air inlet? My thought is by restricting the air, the velocity goes up drawing more fuel from the smaller jets. Mostly a curiosity question, but may attempt if it is feasible--I can swap over the main jets, but the other two circuits are not transferable between the two.
