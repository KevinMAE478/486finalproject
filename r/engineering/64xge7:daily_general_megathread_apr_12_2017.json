For a little hackathon project my friends and I want to make an automatic drinks dispensing machine, with upside down bottles (or similar containers), using gravity to move the liquid through a small pipe/hose into a waiting glass.

I read that semi-direct operated valves would allow a higher flow rate at low pressures. Would using these valves provide sufficient flow rate (say 1 liter/m flow rate), especially considering it's operating under very low pressure?\n\n2) Alternatively, I've come across two other solutions. [Making my own pinch valve with a servo](http://www.instructables.com/id/Pinch-Valve/), or making a magnetic ball valve. \n\nThe ball valve would have a steel ball in a tapered plastic housing, normally it is forced down by gravity and the liquid above it creating a seal, but activating a small (but powerful?) electromagnet on the side of it would cause it to lift up, allowing the liquid to flow past. I'm not even sure if this would work, does anyone have any idea if it would? Is it doable as a DIY valve solution?\n\n3) What is your opinion on using the pinch valve - especially in light of the alternatives?\n\nThank you!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=\"/r/engineering\"&gt;/r/engineering&lt;/a&gt;, I have a question and this seems like the place to ask it.
