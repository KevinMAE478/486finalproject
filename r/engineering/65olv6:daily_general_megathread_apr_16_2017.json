This office is a new branch of a firm that has locations in other parts of Canada, and the engineers opening the office have had work and experience in the area. I was promised a position within the company once they were able to win some contracts. The first contracts they were applying to closed the tendering process in the beginning of April, with the results of my prospective company not winning the contracts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to be wary of the likeliness of the work and I am wondering if I should look for other opportunities as this company has not been successful in acquiring contracts. I would like to know how long should I expect for a new office to acquire their first contract and if this situation is normal for the tendering process in Ontario. How long should I wait to start this job or to look for different opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would finding a new position elsewhere and not join this new office be considered a rude or an unprofessional act?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "engineering", "name": "t1_dgcvda6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419871.0, "created_utc": 1492391071.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
