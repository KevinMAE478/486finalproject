That is a lot to deal with and getting a new dog (especially a high energy one) is stressful. Getting my dog was the second most successful diet I've had (first was having my gallbladder fail, I do not recommend), not due to exercise but because I was so busy with her that I just didn't have time to eat. If it makes you feel any better, my dog had kennel cough when I got her, diarrhea for the first 6 months, and warts (there's a type of warts that is very common at daycares, it just happens). The kennel cough cleared up in a couple weeks, the diarrhea cleared up (more on that in a bit), and the warts went away as her immune system kicked in. It gets better. Usually.\n\nSo it seems like a lot of your problems come from trying to deal with the barking issue. Why is she barking? Separation anxiety? Boredom? Seeing squirrels/people/ghosts out the window? You need to figure that out, and you probably have a good idea already. Separation anxiety can be helped with consistent training and drugs, if needed. Boredom can be alleviated- perhaps you will have to alter your routine to have lots of brain games and exercise before you leave so she's tired (but not too tired, because dogs can get cranky tired like toddlers). Block off her view to outside if that's a problem. I have had to do all of these (except drugs) with my dog and she's ... ok. She will bark if she hears me outside but she quiets down quickly if I just go away (and go out the right door because god forbid I go out a different door). Record her using your laptop or whatever when you leave so you know how long she's barking and what kind of barking and what else she's doing. My dog sounded like she was dying for like 30 minutes at first and then she just went to sleep. That let me know that it wasn't severe separation anxiety and we can work with it.\n\nThe promised diarrhea side note: I took her to the vet over and over and worried myself sick about why she had diarrhea all the time. She didn't seem distressed but... still. Fecal exam showed worms, fixed the worms, still diarrhea. I tried changing food, didn't help. Flagyl, nope nada. You know what it was? I would give her a large Kong of peanut butter whenever I left for the whole separation anxiety thing. That's a LOT of peanut butter for a 40lb dog. Started mixing kibble and peanut butter instead of just using huge globs of peanut butter = problem solved. You'll figure it out. \n\nAlso, and I don't mean this as a judgment, but considering that you've only had her for four months (?), that's a lot of transition- being at a rescue, to your apartment, new doggy daycare, vet visits, across the country with new people, an in-facility summer camp...  Stress could very well be a big factor here. Sometimes problems work themselves out with enough time after you stop trying to fix them.\n\nYou may want to consider hiring a dog walker to stop by and take her out during the middle of the day IF that doesn't just get her worked up from someone popping in and then leaving her again. We have something in my city where they take the dogs on long adventure walks through the woods and stuff. They love it.\n\nYou'll figure out the diarrhea. The warts will go away eventually. Her tail will heal. She's probably vaccinated for kennel cough already- most daycares require it. If you put the time and effort into it, you can probably address the barking issue (I know it's super frustrating, though- perhaps introduce yourself to your neighbors with cookies or something and a pre-apology- hey at least it's not during sleep time!). It'll gradually get better and in the not too distant future, you'll think about this time and be like, god that sucked. Because it does. But I bet she'll get better and you'll be able to do those training classes. \n\nAnd then you'll get new problems :) Ah life.\n\nGood luck\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, so sorry about all the troubles. That is a lot to deal with and getting a new dog (especially a high energy one) is stressful. Getting my dog was the second most successful diet I&amp;#39;ve had (first was having my gallbladder fail, I do not recommend), not due to exercise but because I was so busy with her that I just didn&amp;#39;t have time to eat. If it makes you feel any better, my dog had kennel cough when I got her, diarrhea for the first 6 months, and warts (there&amp;#39;s a type of warts that is very common at daycares, it just happens). The kennel cough cleared up in a couple weeks, the diarrhea cleared up (more on that in a bit), and the warts went away as her immune system kicked in. It gets better. Usually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it seems like a lot of your problems come from trying to deal with the barking issue. Why is she barking? Separation anxiety? Boredom? Seeing squirrels/people/ghosts out the window? You need to figure that out, and you probably have a good idea already. Separation anxiety can be helped with consistent training and drugs, if needed. Boredom can be alleviated- perhaps you will have to alter your routine to have lots of brain games and exercise before you leave so she&amp;#39;s tired (but not too tired, because dogs can get cranky tired like toddlers). Block off her view to outside if that&amp;#39;s a problem. I have had to do all of these (except drugs) with my dog and she&amp;#39;s ... ok. She will bark if she hears me outside but she quiets down quickly if I just go away (and go out the right door because god forbid I go out a different door). Record her using your laptop or whatever when you leave so you know how long she&amp;#39;s barking and what kind of barking and what else she&amp;#39;s doing. My dog sounded like she was dying for like 30 minutes at first and then she just went to sleep. That let me know that it wasn&amp;#39;t severe separation anxiety and we can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The promised diarrhea side note: I took her to the vet over and over and worried myself sick about why she had diarrhea all the time. She didn&amp;#39;t seem distressed but... still. Fecal exam showed worms, fixed the worms, still diarrhea. I tried changing food, didn&amp;#39;t help. Flagyl, nope nada. You know what it was? I would give her a large Kong of peanut butter whenever I left for the whole separation anxiety thing. That&amp;#39;s a LOT of peanut butter for a 40lb dog. Started mixing kibble and peanut butter instead of just using huge globs of peanut butter = problem solved. You&amp;#39;ll figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, and I don&amp;#39;t mean this as a judgment, but considering that you&amp;#39;ve only had her for four months (?), that&amp;#39;s a lot of transition- being at a rescue, to your apartment, new doggy daycare, vet visits, across the country with new people, an in-facility summer camp...  Stress could very well be a big factor here. Sometimes problems work themselves out with enough time after you stop trying to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider hiring a dog walker to stop by and take her out during the middle of the day IF that doesn&amp;#39;t just get her worked up from someone popping in and then leaving her again. We have something in my city where they take the dogs on long adventure walks through the woods and stuff. They love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll figure out the diarrhea. The warts will go away eventually. Her tail will heal. She&amp;#39;s probably vaccinated for kennel cough already- most daycares require it. If you put the time and effort into it, you can probably address the barking issue (I know it&amp;#39;s super frustrating, though- perhaps introduce yourself to your neighbors with cookies or something and a pre-apology- hey at least it&amp;#39;s not during sleep time!). It&amp;#39;ll gradually get better and in the not too distant future, you&amp;#39;ll think about this time and be like, god that sucked. Because it does. But I bet she&amp;#39;ll get better and you&amp;#39;ll be able to do those training classes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you&amp;#39;ll get new problems :) Ah life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dg3szgb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491910847.0, "created_utc": 1491882047.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o3wq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o3wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3v8ua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "penchantforbuggery", "parent_id": "t1_dg3u09n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks!
