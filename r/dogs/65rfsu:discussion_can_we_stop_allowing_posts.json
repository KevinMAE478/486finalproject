It is clear by the way it is worded that the OP is in need of some education on the matter and the dog is in need of training and possibly a behaviorist consult. \n\nThe first reply is an understandable but snarky 'have you discussed this with your vet' and the other reply essentially says the same thing but with a little more grace. The question itself has been downvoted to 0. And this is why I would also be against policing this sub to the point where people have nowhere to go in their time of need. \n\nI know, a call is free.  Not everyone is near a phone, vet, emergency vet, paved road. I love the anecdotes I read here and have no problem telling someone a vet is in order. Sometimes, the professional vet thing has already been done and a person may just need an ear and a random strangers opinion. I shared the other day about how my dog ate a box of Heartgard all at once and what my vet said about it. I also then told OP to call their vet with their current question. We are all individuals. If someone reads my Heartgard pantry break in of 2015 story and interprets that to mean it's ok for dogs to eat Heartgard like treats, that's on them. \n\nI can understand why /r/askvet is strict but I feel they should be more forthcoming.
