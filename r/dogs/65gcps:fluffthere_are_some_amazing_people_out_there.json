Getting increasingly more worried. not one sign of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So go home get a drink, since i hadnt even gotten one since id gotten up. reheated some leftover taco bell then continued the search. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As i was about to leave , my sister asked if there was a pound/shelter in town.

Thats gonna change though now that i got a job.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im not sure how long they had been there, i didnt ask. was too overjoyed to think about that. At least an hour, because they were dry and it rained recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive no idea who brought them to the vet, but they are an amazing person(s).
