On those days, my adjoining neighbour (semi detached house) who is retired and LOVES my dog (but too elderly to have her own), lets him into the garden about midday, has a bit of a fuss with with him and then leaves him with the garden and house. I feel happy leaving it open as my neighbour is in all day and we live in an enclosed area. (We also installed new 6 foot fences all sides when we got our dog). I get home about 3:45, so it&amp;#39;s only two days a week for less than four hours that he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;unsupervised&amp;quot; outside. (I say unsupervised because my neighbour is always outside doing gardening). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had him nearly three years and this is the routine we&amp;#39;ve been doing all this time. No ones ever mentioned anything about him barking, nothing. Hence why it was such a surprise to get this OFFICIAL letter through my door. (I also know my dog well enough to know that he&amp;#39;s not barking to seek attention, he only barks if he hears a loud/unusual noise or sees a cat. We also leave him with toys he&amp;#39;s ONLY allowed when we&amp;#39;re not there and they get rotated so they&amp;#39;re not always the same ones and they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;new&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked my adjoining neighbour and she said that he does occasionally bark, but she&amp;#39;ll call his name over the fence and he&amp;#39;ll stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We asked our neighbours the other side (our adjoining neighbour loves our dog too much and we wanted an unbiased opinion).

They said it can sometimes be annoying, but nothing they they can&amp;#39;t tune out and certainly nothing to complain about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this stage I felt highly embarrassed as I don&amp;#39;t want to be &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; neighbour with &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; dog.
