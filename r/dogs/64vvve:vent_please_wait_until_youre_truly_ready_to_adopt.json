I adopted my dog, in 2004 from a city animal shelter.  I was in my second year of college and my mom was still paying for everything so I didn&amp;#39;t truly appreciate or recognize the cost associated with a pet (i.e. food, unexpected vet bills, the cost of boarding when traveling).  I also didn&amp;#39;t realize that in 4 years, I would join the military (happened to be a decision I made after school).  I traveled a lot prior to that and my cousin took care of him while I was away.  Well when I asked that he take care of the dog while I was in bootcamp, and possibly a little longer til I was financially stable, he said he would take him but only on the condition his family keep him because his stepson (12ish at the time) was getting attached.  I could see where he was coming from at the time, and the stepson loved the pooch, so I agreed, on the condition that if they ever got to a point where they couldn&amp;#39;t keep him, they give him back to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to about five years ago, I get a call from my cousin, asking if he can give the dog to his sister-in-law, because their youngest son was highly allergic... allegedly.  I had adopted another dog at this point, and wasn&amp;#39;t in a place financially to afford two pets, so I agreed, again stressing that he get proper care.  Well.  Know the people the pet is going to, because apparently even family can&amp;#39;t guarantee proper care of the pet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About two months ago I got a call from my cousin saying the sister-in-law needed me to write a letter surrendering the now 14 year old pup to the pound, because he was registered and microchipped to me through their adoption records.  They said he wasn&amp;#39;t eating, was very sick, and needed to be euthanized.  I flew off the handle and said I wouldn&amp;#39;t, and under no circumstances would they surrender a fourteen year old dog to the pound, to be put to sleep like that, and that I would fly out (I am still military and live roughly 1500 miles away from my hometown; my cousin at this point also does not live in the same city as the sister in law), and be with my old dog to have him put to sleep humanely, myself.  I get told by my cousin, sure sure, not to worry, he&amp;#39;d handle the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I get a call.  Turns out the sister-in-law somehow was able to just dump the dog at the pound.  The pound was calling me, and surprise surprise, they want me to either surrender him to the adoption floor or come get him, because they don&amp;#39;t want to put down a perfectly healthy, happy pet.  I was FURIOUS.  At this point, I cut the family completely out and was lucky enough to have a friend that could pick up puppers from the shelter for me a few days after he&amp;#39;d be dumped.  So we sprung him and got him to the vet.  The sister-in-law had texted a picture of a bad wound his tail to my cousin to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; that he was sick and needed to be euthanized.  Well, the vet biopsied the wound, since we couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how it got there or what it was, and it was non-cancerous, so other than some bad gum disease, he is a perfectly healthy 14 year old pup.  Oh yeah, and he has a ravenous appetite.  He just needs softer food since his gums are bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final outcome has been that I am now financially very able to support two pets, so I flew out to my hometown a month later, rented a car, and drove the little guy back up to be with me and my 7 year old mutt.  They are getting along great, so the story has a happy ending, but I definitely realized when I originally adopted, I was in no way prepared to handle the responsibilities of a dog.  I couldn&amp;#39;t have lived with myself if he&amp;#39;d been put down for no reason, or spent his last years alone in a pound, because we all know how hard it is to get older dogs adopted - especially when they have health issues like gum disease.  Your dog is your family, and if you can&amp;#39;t fathom dumping a child, or family member, that you just don&amp;#39;t care for anymore into prison when they&amp;#39;re old, then you shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to fathom doing the same to a pet.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new siblings are getting along great, and &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/1hx3j\"&gt;here they are on their first day together&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This post is somewhat long-winded and aimed at myself but I hope it helps anyone on here considering adopting a pet.
