If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This will be my second dog as an adult.  I grew up with a pug and a lab and now own a lab mix and a cat. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a &lt;a href=\"http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html\"&gt;reputable breeder&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m open to either. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)  Describe your ideal dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My ideal dog is calm and relaxed/laid back, a real cuddler, who also enjoys hikes, swimming, and fetch. It should be a breed that is good with cats or can be trained to be good with cats. I would also prefer a breed that is very people focused but not so people focused that it ignores or doesn&amp;#39;t like other dogs/animals. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I love pugs and labs having grown up with them. My husband really loves German shepherds but I could take them or leave them. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would like to train them for basic obedience and good manners but beyond that I don&amp;#39;t have any special doggy activities I want to be able to do. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care Commitments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m willing to devote most of my free time to interacting with a dog. I&amp;#39;m basically always being snuggled by my animals and the first thing I do when I get home is play with them until they&amp;#39;re tired of it (usually about an hour).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I walk Cali 3 times a day. There&amp;#39;s a shorter mile long walk in the mornings, a quick trip around the block at lunch, and a 1.5-2 mile walk in the evening. We hit up the dog park Saturday&amp;#39;s and sundays and there&amp;#39;s usually a floating trip during the week weather permitting. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I do all the grooming for both animals right now so I&amp;#39;d be willing to add a second dog to that rotation. Both are relatively low maintenance though so anything beyond brushing, baths, and nail trimming I&amp;#39;d hire out (for example if a long haired breed needed a hair cut I&amp;#39;d take them to a groomer) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9)  What size dog are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m fine with anything from pug to large lab sized. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shedding is fine, farts and snoring are fine. I&amp;#39;m not ok with barking unless it&amp;#39;s for a reason. Slobber is something I&amp;#39;d prefer to avoid but could deal with for an otherwise perfect dog. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recall is something very important. The majority of the dog park I frequent is not fenced and Id like to continue to enjoy the whole thing with my current dog. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dog Personality and Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I like snuggly dogs. My cat is all the personal space-needing animal I need. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I prefer eager to please. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mind barking when someone is in the yard or knocking on the door. I like a dog who greets people nicely but is excited. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not an option because of an existing dog. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would like to avoid any dog who is too high strung or prone to separation anxiety. Cali, my lab mix, is already this way and I don&amp;#39;t need two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The dog will be left alone every day for 2 periods of 3-4 hours at most at a time. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My husband would love a German shepherd. He would split care 50-50 with me. Personality-wise he prefers a more independent animal. He also prefers larger dogs. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have an 8 lb tabby cat and a 45 pound lab mix. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are lots of small children in my family and my husband and I are planning on kids soon so good with kids is a must. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We own a house with a fenced yard. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We live in the Kansas City Area on the Kansas side. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We have all 4 seasons with some extremes. Summer is a a regular high in the 90s with hot days in the hundreds. Winter temperatures hang out around freezing with cold spells in the teens and colder. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing this mostly for fun to try out the new form but a second dog is something my hubs and I have discussed and I&amp;#39;m curious what dog this sub thinks is a good fit for us. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25) Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\n1)  Will this be your first dog?

We also have a cat as well, but she is older and is not particularly fond of him, but he shows no aggression toward her at all. He&amp;#39;s super cuddly, loves to swim, hike and be active, and he loves EVERYONE. I definitely think you&amp;#39;d be happy with a golden retriever or goldendoodle :) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dgbnn2j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492344251.0, "created_utc": 1492315451.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
