They may be kill or no-kill depending on the individual organization. They also may have a kennel environment where most if not all of their dogs are kept. Shelters usually are funded by or receive at least some funding from the county or town they are in whereas a humane society typically is a privately funded via grants or donations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rescue in this case is an all breed rescue, they&amp;#39;ll pull dogs that are adoptable from other places and place them in foster homes, usually do more thorough vetting of adopters, some do transportation so they don&amp;#39;t adopt out to just locals but to anyone within a certain radius of their location. I would expect a rescue to be more knowledgable of the dogs they have than a shelter/humane society would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone with more experience working with rescues could probably explain it better than I can, but that&amp;#39;s the distinction I make when I think of those two .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dge844o", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496493.0, "created_utc": 1492467693.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge6t6d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SharpStiletto", "parent_id": "t3_65wiw7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What is the difference between a\n\n&gt; Rescue - A rescue who accepts all breeds.\n\nand a \n\n&gt; Shelter / ~~Humane Society - A county, city, town, or~~ privately run animal shelter.\n\nI'd be grateful if OP or anyone else can explain.
