That is too long to go without access to a way to go to the bathroom, though. In my opinion, unless your dog has some other access to bathroom facilities (e.g. he is paper-trained, or you have a dog door) you probably need to add at least one extra bathroom break in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many you need depends on the dog.
