I know some of the answers to the other questions (time, energy, slobber, etc.). But I wonder if I might be missing the basics!\n\nThis is going to be long and I apologize for that but it's very important to think about costs before getting a dog. Seriously think about the financial side of owning a dog. I'm not sure if you're going the breeder route or the rescue/shelter route so I'm going to try to cover both. It gets overlooked by so many people because they think owning a dog is cheap and easy. Dogs are neither cheap or easy. I never thought I would be spending this much money on a dog when I first started looking for one.\n\nA purebred from a breeder is going to set you back up to potentially $2,000. Maybe a little more depending on the breed. Now some breeds are less expensive in the $800-$1,200 range. Realistically from a responsible breeder you should have a healthy puppy with no health issues and your vet visits will be just basic things like shots, flea/tick/heartworm preventative, etc. Costs of course varies by location so I'm going to use my vet as an example. My dog goes to the vet 5 times a year for her basic shots (it will be less now that she has the 3 year rabies shot) and boosters because they happen to be spread out that way. A basic office visit sets me back $46 so I'm looking at $230 a year in office visits. Shot costs vary but tend to be in the $20-$30 range so I'm going to use $25 per shot instead of going to look up what I actually spent but it will be close. My dog gets 7 shots (one is optional but I choose to have it done) so there's $175 a year. Flea/Tick/Heartworm preventative costs me $180 a year (it was $236 before I switched medicines). She needs a heartworm test once a year that's $67 before I can purchase more preventative. All in I'm at $652 just for basic vet care. Depending on where you live it could be a little less or it could be a lot more. \n\nFood costs needs to be considered. What food will you be feeding your dog? A breeder will tell you what they've been feeding and you should buy that even if you want to feed something different so you can transition hopefully without the puppy having massive diarrhea from the change. Quality food can range from $40-$100/bag and if you're lucky you may get 2 months out of a bag. So there's another $240-$600 a year. Toys vary and you can either buy expensive ones or cheap one's so I'm not going to give a number for this because it depends on what kind of toys you want to buy the dog and how they treat them. Same goes for treats really but you're probably looking at $100 minimum a year. One time purchases like a crate, collar, leash, bowls, etc. can be $150-$250 depending on size of crate you need (if you crate). \n\nSo let's use a purebred puppy that cost $1,500 for our example. With all of the added costs you're looking at $2,642 - $3,102. Now if your dog gets sick or has an accident you can be looking at thousands of dollars more in vet bills.\n\nNow lets look at a shelter/rescue dog. Adoption prices can be as low as $40 (low end of shelter costs) to $600 (high end of rescue cost). Again I'm going to use my dog for the example. Adoption cost was $95 then I had to pay $3/yr for the county dog license (now it's $10 for a lifetime license because I moved to a different county). I was required to enroll my dog in a puppy training class because of her breed. That set me back $100 for a basic 6 week class at Petco. I went through a few different foods when she was a puppy until I found one she did well on then I started buying the larger bags. They were $42/bag and one bag lasted her a month and she was on puppy food for 6 months until she turned 1. That was $252 then we switched to adult food from the same product line that was $48/bag and lasted I believe 20 days. She was only on that for 3 bags which was $144. The next food was $84/bag and lasted 28 days for the largest bag, but I purchased smaller bags at first to see how she did on it. So far it has cost me $387.93, it would have been more but I started weighing her food instead of just using a 1 cup scoop and I cut back a little because she needed to lose 4lbs so she gets about 2 months out of a bag (scoops are horrible for measuring food, even the ones labeled as pet food scoops). I'm about to switch her food yet again because I believe she's having an issue with chicken (I have a vet appointment for one of her shots coming up where I will speak to the vet about it). The new food is going to be $91/bag and I don't know if I will get the same amount of days out of it. Best case scenario I get 2 months out of a bag and it only costs me $546 a year, worst case scenario I only get a month per bag and I'm spending $1,092 a year.\n\nI just recently added up what I have spent on my dog in the 20 months I have had her and it was $4,193.89 (missing a few random things I picked up at the grocery store or Wal-Mart). The breakdown looks like this:\n\n\n**General**\n\nFood.................$966.66\n\nTreats...............$530.96\n\nClothing............$49.18\n\nToys.................$449.86\n\nOne-Time..........$365.40\n\nTraining.............$234.96\n\nMedical..............$88.50\n\nCleaning.............$9.99\n\nGrooming...........$68.61\n\n\n\n**Veterinary**\n\n\nOffice Visits........$383.00\n\nShots.................$309.25\n\nTests.................$168.00\n\nPreventatives.....$448.95\n\nMedicines...........$55.81\n\nMisc...................$64.76\n\n\n\nI know someone is going to comment on that treat costs so here's the reason for it. I tried out a bunch of different treats finding ones that worked well for training class purposes and for ones that would be high value. Some of those treats she didn't like or caused diarrhea, most notably the smoked salmon treats. Those treats went to my cousin's dog because they didn't cause him issues. I also watched my cousin's dog a lot last year so I couldn't give my dog a treat and not give him one as well. The food cost is high because of trying 4 different ones and buying smaller bags when I first tried them. Toy cost is high but baring Christmas, her birthday, and her adoptaversary she doesn't get expensive toys unless they are 1) on sale or 2) I have rewards dollars from Petco that either cover the entire cost or most of the cost. That cost also includes Kongs which I went through 4 puppy Kongs and 2 Kong classics before ending up with our current 5 Kong Classic's and 1 Kong Extreme (for future use).\n\nAs you can see I've spent $1,429.77 at the vet in 20 months and we haven't even been yet this year for anything besides preventatives and to weigh her. We've been fortunate not to have any major medical issues in the last 20 months. Our biggest issues were a minor infection from scratching due to allergies and a strained muscle from playing with my cousin's dog (hence the medicines category). The Misc category is for the few times she's had her nails trimmed at the vet and the pack of dental wipes I bought.\n\nMy expenses break down to right around $2,000 a year and should hopefully stay in that range. However, my dog has environmental allergies that according to the vet may become more severe over time so I could potentially end up easily spending another $500-$1000 a year on medication if the Benadryl she is on daily stops being effective. The first few months of owning your dog are going to be the most expensive (assuming no major health problems i.e. hit by car). In the first 5 months of having my dog I spent $1,901.66 because of one time purchases, training, trying different foods, etc.\n\nCan you spend less on a dog? Sure. My cousin feeds her dog Pedigree which costs her $15 for a 55lb bag and lasts about a month and a half considering she doesn't measure and just uses whatever drink cup she has available as a scoop. So that's setting her back $120 a year. She doesn't get him optional shots like canine influenza, she doesn't get him the Lyme vaccination even though we live in a high tick area. She doesn't get him his Bordetella shot even though she boards him when she goes away now. She waits for the health department to have a rabies clinic and I wouldn't be surprised if he is past due getting his right now even though she can afford the cost of the vet. She tries to avoid the heartworm test that's required. He was at least on Trifexis for fleas and heartworm. Though I don't know if he is now because she doesn't want to pay for the test and she moved so I don't have any contact with her. She doesn't buy him any toys. His treats are whatever happens to be on sale at Costco. She doesn't walk him because he pulls and tries to slip his collar. She does no training with him even though he is a smart dog. She signed him up for a basic obedience class at Petco but I ended up taking him and doing the training while she sat in the corner of the training area on her phone texting. She ended up getting her money back after 4 weeks because he wasn't \"treat motivated\" in class. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact she didn't work with him in or outside of class. I taught him stay in the course of 5 minutes (and to speak when they yell her boyfriends kid's name because I'm an asshole and they yell for the kid to come to them a lot). I'm sure had they not moved I would have had him doing most if not all of the tricks my dog knows. All in she probably doesn't break $500 a year on him.\n\nThere is also the chance that the dog you get has separation anxiety and either need to be medicated or attend doggy daycare every day or requiring a behaviorist because it's reactive or aggressive which can cost up to a few hundred dollars per visit. The fact that you work from home means you likely wouldn't have to pay for daycare if the dog had separation anxiety like someone who works in an office 5 days a week would. But it's useful information for anyone else that may read this.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before considering all the rest of the questions, what are the basic things a first-time dog owner should be thinking about? I know some of the answers to the other questions (time, energy, slobber, etc.). But I wonder if I might be missing the basics!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is going to be long and I apologize for that but it&amp;#39;s very important to think about costs before getting a dog. Seriously think about the financial side of owning a dog. I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;re going the breeder route or the rescue/shelter route so I&amp;#39;m going to try to cover both. It gets overlooked by so many people because they think owning a dog is cheap and easy. Dogs are neither cheap or easy. I never thought I would be spending this much money on a dog when I first started looking for one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A purebred from a breeder is going to set you back up to potentially $2,000. Maybe a little more depending on the breed. Now some breeds are less expensive in the $800-$1,200 range. Realistically from a responsible breeder you should have a healthy puppy with no health issues and your vet visits will be just basic things like shots, flea/tick/heartworm preventative, etc. Costs of course varies by location so I&amp;#39;m going to use my vet as an example. My dog goes to the vet 5 times a year for her basic shots (it will be less now that she has the 3 year rabies shot) and boosters because they happen to be spread out that way. A basic office visit sets me back $46 so I&amp;#39;m looking at $230 a year in office visits. Shot costs vary but tend to be in the $20-$30 range so I&amp;#39;m going to use $25 per shot instead of going to look up what I actually spent but it will be close. My dog gets 7 shots (one is optional but I choose to have it done) so there&amp;#39;s $175 a year. Flea/Tick/Heartworm preventative costs me $180 a year (it was $236 before I switched medicines).

A lot of times puppies are adopted because they&amp;#39;re cute, fluffy, and so much fun. They people take them home and realize how hard it is to raise and train a puppy! No fault on their part, but they have to take the dog back. These dogs grow up in shelters and they have a hard time getting adopted because they are no longer cute puppies. When finding a companion, it can take time and maybe multiple shelter visits and that is perfectly okay!
