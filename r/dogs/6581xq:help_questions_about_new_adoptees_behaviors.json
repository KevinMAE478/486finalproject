Of course I understand that the lab and I are still getting to know each other, but he only seems to respond to commands (he consistently knows sit and come, and is iffy on heel) when they are said harshly/loudly/with a deeper voice. Someone suggested that he may have more a dominant streak and needs an assertive command? I assumed he may have just had a previous owner that communicated by yelling? He doesn\u2019t respond as well to anyone else. The kids or a friend telling him to sit doesn\u2019t get a response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Odd piece of behavior- when I get on to him he immediately comes to me and starts being affectionate. If I\u2019m sitting down, he will try to get in my lap. One thing I read suggested that might be a dominant behavior? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Bark park! This is the biggest thing that has been an adjustment. The beagle is a bit of a flight risk but didn\u2019t take too much tending to as long as I watched him near the gates when people were leaving. The lab is all over the place behavior wise. He never seems to get actually aggressive and has playful body language when playing/play fighting with other dogs BUT he has a serious bark and is sometimes very vocal when playing. Their body language will be fine, tails wagging, not actually biting, teeth aren\u2019t bared, etc- but it sounds like a scary dog fight. Should I be curbing vocal aspect of the play behavior?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only once did he hone in on a dog. There was a young GSD that picked a fight as soon as he came in and then my lab wanted nothing but to focus on that dog. And every time they interacted they would amp up behavior quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing- and I\u2019ve seen a few other dogs do this as well. He seems to think he is the sheriff of the bark park, if other dogs get out of hand he will immediately run into the thick of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) At home, he will occasionally chase the cats (or the other way around) but he never actually bites or threatens- and if I tell him no he leaves them alone.

I treat all dogs the same and expect the same behavior from them, so \"power\" really isn't an issue. People control horses all the time, and by no means is anyone able to overpower them. In any case, I would use tools to help me achieve this (use just a foot of leash when you walk the dog to prevent them from getting momentum to pull you, and some sort of anti-pull mechanism if you need it coupled with a training method of your choice), but my dogs range in size from 66 to 72lbs, and me being just 128lbs,  have never had issues controlling all three at once with proper training. \n\n2. Don't dwell on dominance, focus on presenting level-headed persistent leadership similar to a way a good parent would. When you give commands, *only give them once,* and insist on follow through. If you don't think the dog is likely to follow through, don't give a command. Otherwise, this teaches your dog to learn to ignore what you say. Start slow, use food if you'd like, and lots of repetition. If you implement the training method, \"Nothing In Life Is Free,\" where you require the dog to offer you a basic behavior before you do ANYTHING it wants (going out the door, getting a leash on, being fed, etc.), it will pick up on commands very quickly and learn that you mean what you say. \n\n3. Again, don't focus on dominance. Dogs are more mentally puppies than anything, and aren't spending all their time trying to figure out how to dominant you. More so, I'd focus on setting appropriate boundaries and asking that he respect your space. Unless I call my dogs over for pets, I expect them to respect my space bubble, and they all learn this quickly. Tell the dog to do something else...going back to that \"NILIF\" training (dog must sit and/or down before pets are given). \n\n4. Don't take your dog to the dog park until you brush up on training. You are putting everyone else at risk until you have a solid relationship with the dog and he learns basic manners and to respect you, which he seems to be lacking. Take a training class with him if need be, but from everything else you've said, this is a recipe for disaster. \n\n5. Make sure your cats have places they can go to get away from the dog. Google Super Cat Highways and make sure your cats can navigate the doggy-areas of your home without having to touch the floor or be on level with the dog. I'd also be restricting the dog's range of motion until this sorts itself out via baby-gates and whatnot to keep him in view and prevent any \"out-of-hand\" behaviors.
