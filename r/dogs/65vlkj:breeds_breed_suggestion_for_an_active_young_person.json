If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nope. I grew up with lots of dogs and currently own a sheltie. I have a lot of experience with dog training and have worked in the field professionally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking to get another dog sometime in the next couple years, as I&amp;#39;ll be starting my career and not going to college and working full time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a &lt;a href=\"http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html\"&gt;reputable breeder&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reputable breeder.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)  Describe your ideal dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent, active, confident and friendly. One I can train to trust off leash and go hiking with me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some retrievers. I like their enthusiasm for life, though I don&amp;#39;t like their prey drive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love border Collies but I&amp;#39;m not sure if I could handle a neurotic one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic obedience, off leash walking, other tricks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care Commitments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Several hours. 3+ mile walks daily with the occasional dog park trip.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ mile walks daily with the occasional trip to the dog park. I live in a fairly rural area and probably always will, so off-leash walks will be commonplace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m open to lots of brushing and cleaning ears/cutting nails. However, I don&amp;#39;t want a non-shedding breed that I&amp;#39;d have to take to the groomer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9)  What size dog are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Anything except the extra large dogs that only live like 8 years. I love them but I don&amp;#39;t want a dog that have super short lifespans.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mind shedding. Barking is okay but I don&amp;#39;t want it to be constant. Slobber is okay as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very important to me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dog Personality and Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Snuggly. I love velcro dogs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Definitely eager to please. I don&amp;#39;t really like aloof dogs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An alert bark is okay but I&amp;#39;d really prefer the dog not even react (something I could train it to do). My sheltie right now is very shy with strangers despite a lot of socialization and that is something I&amp;#39;d like to avoid in the future. I&amp;#39;d like a dog that lets a stranger give it a pat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not at all.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Guarding, general reactivity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At most a few hours, with the other dog and my cat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No preference. He would probably give attention while I&amp;#39;m gone and take them out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sheltie and a cat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not now but probably in the future.

I live in New England.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Summer- 75 farenheit\nWinter- 20 farenheit, can get below 0.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25) Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;N/A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\n1)  Will this be your first dog?
