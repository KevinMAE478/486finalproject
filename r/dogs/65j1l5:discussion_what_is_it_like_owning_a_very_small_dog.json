Most small breeds will keep up with you as well as a larger dog if you're a recreational hiker. Plus, if there's an accident, it's much easier to carry a small dog out of the woods quickly. \n\n- I tend to pick my small breed up and carry her around, and you can't do that with a big dog. Unless you are holding them 100 percent of the time, picking smaller dogs up isn't going to warp them or make them poorly behaved. My little dog does it for comfort mostly. \n\n- Health depends a lot on the breed in question, but generally there's a lower risk of hip/elbow dysplasia in small breeds but a higher risk of luxating patella and dental issues. As puppies, you have to be aware of small breed's eating schedules, because they can get hypoglycemic. Small breeds also dehydrate faster.\n\n- The behaviors people don't like about small dogs are sometimes good sense on the part of the dog. Like being wary of larger dogs and people - a lot of times people bend at the waist to pet dogs, which causes you to loom over them. That's a lot scarier for a 10 pound dog than it is for a 50 pound one.
