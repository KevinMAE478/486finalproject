What a cutie!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the basics - bedding, water/food bowls, lead, collar, dog tag with your number on it, toys, food (preferably the same as what he/she has been eating).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decide where the dog is going to sleep before it arrives. I always think it&amp;#39;s best not to let a dog have free reign of the house and a baby gated off laundry is a good idea for overnight - just be sure to move anything the dog may eat/chew on up out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decide whether doggo will be allowed on furniture or not - if not then be consistent with not allowing it on the furniture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be hard to know what to work on until it arrives. But the things we have taught our dog are sit, wait (especially for food), leave it (which I not only use for things I don&amp;#39;t want him to eat, but also if he&amp;#39;s about to react to another dog on our walks). We&amp;#39;ve taught him other things too like shake, high 5, and &amp;#39;lift&amp;#39;, where we&amp;#39;re drying his feet off and all we have to do is gently tap the foot we want him to lift and he&amp;#39;ll lift it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck!
