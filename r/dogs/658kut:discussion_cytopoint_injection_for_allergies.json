Her skin gets red, she chews on herself until she bleeds, bites and scratches chunks of fur off, can&amp;#39;t relax or sleep and paces relentlessly at night, etc.  I had tried multiple treatments including food elimination diet (no change, her allergies appear to be to grass or pollen), steroids (minimal effect, required a high dose the vet didn&amp;#39;t recommend long term), allergy shots (minimal effect), and antihistamines (no effect).  Basically I had exhausted all the usual treatments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At her last vet visit, the vet recommended a drug called cytopoint.

Within 8 hours her scratching was greatly reduced, and within 24 hours it was gone.  That was 2 weeks ago and her skin is no longer red, her fur is growing back, and she is just a new dog.  She doesn&amp;#39;t pace at night anymore, she sleeps well, her energy and appetite are normal, and I no longer get woken up by scratching all night long!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So like I said, since this is such a new drug and there&amp;#39;s not much info, I just wanted to share our experience.
