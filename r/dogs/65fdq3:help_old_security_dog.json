I went for a run one morning and found it wandering around the town so i took a leash and bring it back to the factory, the security lady that had shift there said that the dog almost never sees outside of the cage it lives in (what&amp;#39;s the point of having it as &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; dog then? smh). So i volunteered to go for walks with it. That&amp;#39;s been like a month ago, and I&amp;#39;ve been trying to train her a little bit, the problem is, no one ever trained the dog. So i tried the basic thing, calling out the dog&amp;#39;s name and if she responds i would give her a treat, the problem is she responds like 1 out of 15 times i call her. She also never makes eye contact. I&amp;#39;ve been told that she spent most of her life in dog shelter and isnt really used to people giving her attention. My question is, should i keep trying to train her? Or is it lost cause? I tried letting her go off the leash once and she was following me for most of the time but then she smelled a trace of some animal i think, and just started ignoring me and went after the trace (i had trouble catching her).

Incorporate praise as well, it&amp;#39;s not really about what you say, just the way you say it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be consistent with the training, and keep each session short, you don&amp;#39;t want the dog or yourself to get frustrated and give off bad vibes due to this. Unlike us, dogs excel at reading body language so try to relax and if he seems uptight or cautious about something you do, just take it slow and make everything non-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: If the dog seems to be at a loss of what you&amp;#39;re trying to teach him, remember this: Most of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t have to do with the ability of the dog to learn, but rather the trainer&amp;#39;s ableness to communicate what he wants the dog to do. Always train with a leash on, if he doesn&amp;#39;t listen or seems distracted, give it a little tug, just to remind him you&amp;#39;re training and not hanging out, that comes later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you still have a lot of difficulty getting him to focus, you can try several things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Instead of feeding the dog treats, try with affection or with toys.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Move to a small room with no distractions so you&amp;#39;re the focus of his attention. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be a fun and silly teacher. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t give out consolation prizes (If he doesn&amp;#39;t do something, don&amp;#39;t give a treat out of pity). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Train first and then reward by taking him to a walk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dga4php", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492250889.0, "created_utc": 1492222089.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fdq3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fdq3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaiiq8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eskdee7", "parent_id": "t1_dgah81q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just love animals and i wouldn't be able to just leave her there, it's against my nature.
