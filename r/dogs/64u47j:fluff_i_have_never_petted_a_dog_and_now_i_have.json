You don't want to get bitten by an overprotective mother.\n\nAs far as petting the mother goes - like everyone else says, be very careful and thoroughly wash your hands afterwards. If you're set on trying it (or on continuing to interact with the strays at all, for that matter), watch her body language. Try to avoid being threatening, or trapping her, but don't be afraid, either. Be calm, and keep your movements slow, and when you go to pet her, slowly hold your hand out and see how she reacts. If she shies away, or if she bares her teeth, then back off. If she doesn't, then hold your hand out to her for a little bit. She might sniff it, or even lick it. If she licks your hand, you're probably right to gently scratch her behind the ears, but still be careful, and stop immediately if her demeanour changes. If she's friendly, her tail should be gently wagging, and while her mouth might be open, her teeth shouldn't be bared at you.\n\nMost dogs will give some sort of warning before they bite, but you've got to actually be watching for that warning, and not just assume that every dog is going to be super okay with you touching them. I think the reason a lot of people get bitten is because they ignore the warning signs. That being said, I also think I'm probably a bit too recklessly friendly with unknown dogs, and the vast majority of dogs I've met have been pets, not strays.\n\nHonestly, if all you want is to pet a dog - any dog - then you're much better off finding someone walking their dog on the street and asking them if you can pet it. Or, even better, asking a friend who has a dog. People will say yes to that more often than not, and if they do say yes then it's a good indication that the dog is friendly and safe to pat.\n\nI don't know how people on this sub feel about strangers asking to pet their dogs (I guess it might be a bit of a nuisance if people do it all the time), but where I'm from nobody seems to mind that much.
