It was relatively easy to fix!\n\nHere's how i would approach it if i where in your shoes:\n\n- Stop avoiding the dog. (duh)\n- Find things that drive your dog most. This can be food, can be toys, can be affection. Could even be contact with other dogs. Use that to reward the dog from now on. Forget the happy, high pitched GOOOD BOOYYYYYY and everything else you probably learned.\n- Do not correct your dog using your voice. Do not talk to your dog at all. Use only soft energy. For inspiration, look at videos of mother dogs  handling and correcting their puppies. I've learned that using my voice is fine with most dogs, but insecure dogs will trust me faster if I don't talk to them. Only pet her when she approaches you. Did you know that just an angry look at a dog will already make an impression? \n- Take the dog on long walks, adventures if you will. Do not bring your other dog, or your wife. You need quality time filled with positive experiences and just joy overall in order to (re)build a relationship with trust. I found after each walk my relationship improved. Mind you, these are walks where i find things that challenge the dog. My current dogs loves to dig holes in the ground to find roots and play with them, so that's what we did. You can play hide and seek, you can throw a ball for hours on end. You can go swimming. Just find something that your dog likes, and make it a special adventure just for her. Again, don't talk to her during these walks. \n- When you do get home in a situation where she pees, don't say anything. Ignore her completely. Just clean it up and pretend nothing ever happened. \n- Fearful, sensitive dogs need to be on a schedule. If this is possible for you, make sure your dog knows exactly on what time of the day she's fed, she's walked and when you come home. Establish routine, especially at those high-stress moments. When you get home is a crucial example of this. Make sure the dog knows exactly what to expect from you at moments like these.\n\nAgain, you messed up. Time to fix it.
