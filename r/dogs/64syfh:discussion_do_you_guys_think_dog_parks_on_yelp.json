I actually saw one of the kids chasing various dogs with a stick and hitting them the parents did nothing. At the time my dog was laying at my feet chewing a tennis ball she was tired of chasing it so she just wanted to chew on it which was fine. One of the brats they brought in decided they were going to take her ball and so she growled at him. The parents started bitching because my dog was being aggressive. I flat out told them that a random kid she is not familiar with and who has been running around hitting other dogs with sticks is now trying to reach in her mouth to grab one of the balls we brought in here and you don't think she's going to growl. Then the kid went and got a stick and came at my dog with it I told the parents if your kid hits my dog I WILL reward her for attacking him and I will file animal cruelty charges against you guys.

I flat out told them that a random kid she is not familiar with and who has been running around hitting other dogs with sticks is now trying to reach in her mouth to grab one of the balls we brought in here and you don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s going to growl.

You have some valid concerns about behavior, risk, and responsibility. But to me, the approach you suggest gives up too easily on reasonably managing those concerns. Instead, it implies that we should simply avoid them altogether, and demand that others do so, while sacrificing important benefits.\n\nFirst, let's identify the problems *specifically*. We want to avoid getting into a situation where we justify a position by just claiming some form of, \"this is for X and not for Y\" or \"I shouldn't have to 'deal with' Z\" without really pinning down the harm. That's how practical, resolvable conflicts [get infused](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/64syfh/discussion_do_you_guys_think_dog_parks_on_yelp/dg5h6ei/) with social prejudices or tribal suspicions and become intractable. \n\nFrom what I can tell in the thread and in general, there are a few specific risks and sources of conflict that we're worried about when children are in a dog park. In no particular order:\n\n- (1) Very small children don't know how to handle dogs and can hurt or antagonize dogs unknowingly (e.g., grabbing fur, pulling tail...). Some children who are a little older also scare/discomfit dogs and owners alike by not being willing or able to control their squeal volume. \n\n- (2) Children who want to play on the equipment or use the space in a dog park can get in the way of dogs' enjoyment of it. \n\n- (3) Children have different risks of being injured or distressed when playing with dogs because they tend to be smaller, more easily knocked-over, less aware of their surroundings, and less skilled at displaying calm and de-escalating play when they feel overwhelmed. \n\n- (4) Dog owners feel they are at risk of civil litigation or other similar consequences if a child is hurt in the course of playing with or around others' dogs, even if it's a normal, foreseeable consequence of contact play and there was no aggression involved. Therefore, dog owners feel that they must stay away or keep unreasonably tight control of their dogs when children are present.\n\n- (5) If a dog really is aggressive or snaps, children may be at higher risk of serious injury because of of their small size and lack of strength, coordination, or defensive skill. \n\nWhile we're at it, let's remind ourselves of some of the positive benefits of dog parks being open to children:\n\n- It's an opportunity for families who may have very little time and/or money to get their dogs the exercise and socialization that they need, to spend quality time together, and to avoid having to outlay on childcare or expensive retail recreation or else stay home.\n\n- It can be fun, relatively unstructured exercise and wholesome endorphins for children. So many kids in the developed world now are chronically weighed down by [stress](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/01/stress-kids.aspx), paranoid [restrictions on their freedom to play and explore](http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar06/childhood.aspx) (especially [in nature](https://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/naturalthinking_tcm9-161856.pdf)), and [literal weight](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm). Running around with dogs may be one of the mentally and physically healthiest things a kid gets up to in a week.\n\n- Hanging out at the dog park can be an opportunity for kids to casually interact with strangers and watch others do the same. [Mostly irrational fears](http://socialscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Volume-1-Issue-3-Article-2.pdf), as well as other social forces, seem to have shunted children's experiences and \"family\" spaces into an ever more [isolated bubble](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-playground-ban-20161227-story.html), and now it seems like many are tempted to [mirror that segregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/64syfh/discussion_do_you_guys_think_dog_parks_on_yelp/dg4sa05/). And we're already [awfully segregated to begin with](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/) by race and class, with our [children maybe having it even worse](http://www.epi.org/publication/modern-segregation/). Many children may have virtually zero chance on a given day of having any meaningful interaction with an even halfway-random person, let alone a positive one around a common interest like dogs. For that matter, plenty of *dogs* are in a similar situation!  \n\n- Dog parks may be an invaluable part of *teaching* children to develop those very skills of dog handling that we keep being so frustrated are missing in so many adults. If we want people to be responsible and confident keepers of their own dogs and neighbors to our dogs in the long term, then we're setting ourselves back by anxiously isolating them from our dogs and from us in their formative years. \n\nOkay, so now let's ask ourselves: are the risks so imposing that the best way to address them is with a total ban on children? Surely there is *plenty* we can do from a rules standpoint to responsibly mitigate risks without resorting to such a failure mode.\n\n- (1) Children lacking fine motor skills - up to around 4 or so? - should have to be in arm's reach of their adults. That one's easy: no grabbing of tails because you're right on top of it or you're not there at all. That also means, as a convenient consequence, that the smallest and most physically vulnerable children will not be allowed to wander around anyway. Rules should also be clear that children who squeal loudly at the dogs can be warned and then made to leave if they can't control it.\n\n- (2) If the dog park is crowded (never really an issue where I live), priority should clearly be to people there with dogs, and others with or without children need to leave to make room. Play equipment priority should also obviously be with dogs, and ordinarily no children should be hogging it. I acknowledge that both of these things are difficult to formalize into strict rules -- it's hard to do *capacity* calculations for a dog park, and sometimes child and dog are playing together on something. But we should be able to enforce those priorities when there is an active crowding conflict and also be willing to refrain from using there mere prospect of a theoretical crowding conflict as a reason to ban or discourage people. \n\n- (3) and (4): I'm all for the division of many dog parks, which have the space for it, into larger-dog and smaller-dog areas, which also means there is s space where there is a much lower risk of being bowled over. \"Adult swim\" times for people whose dogs have special hangups about children or who are struggling with being incorrigably rowdy/pushy/jumpy with people also sound good.  But we don't ban 95-pound, 4'10\" women from dog parks for being too small. A quarter of US girls are heavier than that [before they turn 11](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/wtage.htm#females). Everyone just needs to make common-sense decisions about what dogs they and their children are rugged enough to play around. Dog owners should, of course, be responsible for curbing repeated jumping/pushiness by their dog against a child just the same as against another adult.\n\n    But mainly, it just needs to be clear both in formal park rules and in society that dog parks are places where dogs run around, wrestle, jump, bark, run into things, lick other creatures, poop, and have the occasional scrap, and it's on you if you or your child has an unlucky experience with that. One way to start is to [remind *ourselves*](https://dogbitelaw.com/dog-parks-liability-for-dog-bites/assumption-of-the-risk) that plenty of our idle talk about lawsuits is speculative and overblown. It's often become more of an excuse we use not to deal with risks or conflict rather than a truly serious threat of ruin.\n\n    OP: consider your anecdote in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/64syfh/discussion_do_you_guys_think_dog_parks_on_yelp/dg4uu2u/). Your dog was playing and knocked a kid over. The kid and mom were fine, and she even sought to use it as a growth opportunity (which you resisted!) for her son to learn that the dog is still a friend and didn't mean any harm. And you use this as an example to support the idea that children shouldn't be allowed in dog parks? I saw a [similar anectode](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/off-leash-dog-parks-lawsuits.2393195/) with a similar story: no harm, carer takes responsibility, so cue scary amateur legal opinions and calls for banning children.\n\n    Assume rules clearly state the obvious risks assumed by parents, and law backs them up. Are we really so averse to standing up for ourselves (and our dogs) that rather than take advantage of that and confidently open ourselves up to all the friendly/positive/reasonable interactions, we'd instead rather support banning tens of millions of people from these public spaces to avoid the possibility that we might ever have to *assert* ourselves to an unreasonable parent?  Would we rather, in fact, wring our hands about encounters with friendly parents who have a reasonable attitude about risks because they merely *reminded* us of the *idea* that one day we might have to stand up to an unreasonable person in their place? That's not how to make healthy public policy or a healthy society. \n\n- (5) A known aggressive dog clearly shouldn't be running lose at an all-comers time in a dog park. That's on the dog owner rather than on anyone else, regardless of the other person's size. Now, of course there's the lingering (but very small) background risk of a dog totally unexpectedly doing something violent, and a child wold be more at risk of serious harm or death there due to size. But the law even [protects dog owners more than you might think](https://dogbitelaw.com/one-bite-rule/one-bite-rule) in many jurisdictions. And in any case, is that lightning-striking possibility really going to be the basis for such a draconian policy approach? I'd vote no.

Some children who are a little older also scare/discomfit dogs and owners alike by not being willing or able to control their squeal volume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Children who want to play on the equipment or use the space in a dog park can get in the way of dogs&amp;#39; enjoyment of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) Children have different risks of being injured or distressed when playing with dogs because they tend to be smaller, more easily knocked-over, less aware of their surroundings, and less skilled at displaying calm and de-escalating play when they feel overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) Dog owners feel they are at risk of civil litigation or other similar consequences if a child is hurt in the course of playing with or around others&amp;#39; dogs, even if it&amp;#39;s a normal, foreseeable consequence of contact play and there was no aggression involved. Therefore, dog owners feel that they must stay away or keep unreasonably tight control of their dogs when children are present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) If a dog really is aggressive or snaps, children may be at higher risk of serious injury because of of their small size and lack of strength, coordination, or defensive skill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#39;re at it, let&amp;#39;s remind ourselves of some of the positive benefits of dog parks being open to children:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an opportunity for families who may have very little time and/or money to get their dogs the exercise and socialization that they need, to spend quality time together, and to avoid having to outlay on childcare or expensive retail recreation or else stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be fun, relatively unstructured exercise and wholesome endorphins for children. So many kids in the developed world now are chronically weighed down by &lt;a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/01/stress-kids.aspx\"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, paranoid &lt;a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar06/childhood.aspx\"&gt;restrictions on their freedom to play and explore&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/naturalthinking_tcm9-161856.pdf\"&gt;in nature&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm\"&gt;literal weight&lt;/a&gt;. Running around with dogs may be one of the mentally and physically healthiest things a kid gets up to in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanging out at the dog park can be an opportunity for kids to casually interact with strangers and watch others do the same. &lt;a href=\"http://socialscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Volume-1-Issue-3-Article-2.pdf\"&gt;Mostly irrational fears&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other social forces, seem to have shunted children&amp;#39;s experiences and &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; spaces into an ever more &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-playground-ban-20161227-story.html\"&gt;isolated bubble&lt;/a&gt;, and now it seems like many are tempted to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/64syfh/discussion_do_you_guys_think_dog_parks_on_yelp/dg4sa05/\"&gt;mirror that segregation&lt;/a&gt;. And we&amp;#39;re already &lt;a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/\"&gt;awfully segregated to begin with&lt;/a&gt; by race and class, with our &lt;a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/modern-segregation/\"&gt;children maybe having it even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Many children may have virtually zero chance on a given day of having any meaningful interaction with an even halfway-random person, let alone a positive one around a common interest like dogs. For that matter, plenty of &lt;em&gt;dogs&lt;/em&gt; are in a similar situation!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dog parks may be an invaluable part of &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; children to develop those very skills of dog handling that we keep being so frustrated are missing in so many adults. If we want people to be responsible and confident keepers of their own dogs and neighbors to our dogs in the long term, then we&amp;#39;re setting ourselves back by anxiously isolating them from our dogs and from us in their formative years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now let&amp;#39;s ask ourselves: are the risks so imposing that the best way to address them is with a total ban on children? Surely there is &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; we can do from a rules standpoint to responsibly mitigate risks without resorting to such a failure mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Children lacking fine motor skills - up to around 4 or so? - should have to be in arm&amp;#39;s reach of their adults. That one&amp;#39;s easy: no grabbing of tails because you&amp;#39;re right on top of it or you&amp;#39;re not there at all. That also means, as a convenient consequence, that the smallest and most physically vulnerable children will not be allowed to wander around anyway. Rules should also be clear that children who squeal loudly at the dogs can be warned and then made to leave if they can&amp;#39;t control it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) If the dog park is crowded (never really an issue where I live), priority should clearly be to people there with dogs, and others with or without children need to leave to make room. Play equipment priority should also obviously be with dogs, and ordinarily no children should be hogging it. I acknowledge that both of these things are difficult to formalize into strict rules -- it&amp;#39;s hard to do &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; calculations for a dog park, and sometimes child and dog are playing together on something. But we should be able to enforce those priorities when there is an active crowding conflict and also be willing to refrain from using there mere prospect of a theoretical crowding conflict as a reason to ban or discourage people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) and (4): I&amp;#39;m all for the division of many dog parks, which have the space for it, into larger-dog and smaller-dog areas, which also means there is s space where there is a much lower risk of being bowled over. &amp;quot;Adult swim&amp;quot; times for people whose dogs have special hangups about children or who are struggling with being incorrigably rowdy/pushy/jumpy with people also sound good.  But we don&amp;#39;t ban 95-pound, 4&amp;#39;10&amp;quot; women from dog parks for being too small. A quarter of US girls are heavier than that &lt;a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/wtage.htm#females\"&gt;before they turn 11&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone just needs to make common-sense decisions about what dogs they and their children are rugged enough to play around. Dog owners should, of course, be responsible for curbing repeated jumping/pushiness by their dog against a child just the same as against another adult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But mainly, it just needs to be clear both in formal park rules and in society that dog parks are places where dogs run around, wrestle, jump, bark, run into things, lick other creatures, poop, and have the occasional scrap, and it&amp;#39;s on you if you or your child has an unlucky experience with that. One way to start is to &lt;a href=\"https://dogbitelaw.com/dog-parks-liability-for-dog-bites/assumption-of-the-risk\"&gt;remind &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that plenty of our idle talk about lawsuits is speculative and overblown. It&amp;#39;s often become more of an excuse we use not to deal with risks or conflict rather than a truly serious threat of ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OP: consider your anecdote in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/64syfh/discussion_do_you_guys_think_dog_parks_on_yelp/dg4uu2u/\"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;. Your dog was playing and knocked a kid over. The kid and mom were fine, and she even sought to use it as a growth opportunity (which you resisted!) for her son to learn that the dog is still a friend and didn&amp;#39;t mean any harm. And you use this as an example to support the idea that children shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed in dog parks? I saw a &lt;a href=\"https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/off-leash-dog-parks-lawsuits.2393195/\"&gt;similar anectode&lt;/a&gt; with a similar story: no harm, carer takes responsibility, so cue scary amateur legal opinions and calls for banning children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assume rules clearly state the obvious risks assumed by parents, and law backs them up. Are we really so averse to standing up for ourselves (and our dogs) that rather than take advantage of that and confidently open ourselves up to all the friendly/positive/reasonable interactions, we&amp;#39;d instead rather support banning tens of millions of people from these public spaces to avoid the possibility that we might ever have to &lt;em&gt;assert&lt;/em&gt; ourselves to an unreasonable parent?  Would we rather, in fact, wring our hands about encounters with friendly parents who have a reasonable attitude about risks because they merely &lt;em&gt;reminded&lt;/em&gt; us of the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; that one day we might have to stand up to an unreasonable person in their place? That&amp;#39;s not how to make healthy public policy or a healthy society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) A known aggressive dog clearly shouldn&amp;#39;t be running lose at an all-comers time in a dog park. That&amp;#39;s on the dog owner rather than on anyone else, regardless of the other person&amp;#39;s size. Now, of course there&amp;#39;s the lingering (but very small) background risk of a dog totally unexpectedly doing something violent, and a child wold be more at risk of serious harm or death there due to size. But the law even &lt;a href=\"https://dogbitelaw.com/one-bite-rule/one-bite-rule\"&gt;protects dog owners more than you might think&lt;/a&gt; in many jurisdictions. And in any case, is that lightning-striking possibility really going to be the basis for such a draconian policy approach? I&amp;#39;d vote no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dg6b6yc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492050566.0, "created_utc": 1492021766.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64syfh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64syfh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64syfh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg56q9i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HuskyInfantry", "parent_id": "t1_dg55jvt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I see kids all the time at my local dog park.
