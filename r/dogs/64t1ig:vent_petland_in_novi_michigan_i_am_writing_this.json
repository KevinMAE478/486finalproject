How? By charging obscene amounts of money to the buyers and pet store owners (who in turn jack the price up even further). Thus, because the American population is obsessed with dogs and cats, they churn out dogs and pets like a product for mass consumption. In addition to these companies churning out dogs over and over again, the U.S. has very few regulatory laws in regards to dog and cat breeding. The result: puppy mills. What does a puppy mill look like, you ask? To put it in the most basic terms, it is a place that has between 20-100 animals (typically cats, dogs, exotic birds). However, this isn&amp;#39;t like a TV show or your local zoo where they are taken care of, often they are mashed in cages too small for them, with wire flooring (that&amp;#39;s the flooring with squares in it) and are under feed, not hydrated, and live in their own shit. Additionally, they are often inbred (i.e the mom has sex with her son or niece or brother) resulting in recessive, abnormal traits. These traits can lead to various diseases that can commonly result in death or poor quality of life for the animal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, you might ask, how do you know this has to do with Petland? They tell us that they are AKC registered, USDA approved, and from states that have better regulations than Michigan? Well, for the first question, USDA approved areas are typically not fit for quality life in the first place. The ASPCA  warns potential buyers of this exact caveat that pet stores use, &amp;quot;Being registered or \u201chaving papers\u201d means nothing more than the puppy&amp;#39;s parents both had papers. Many registered dogs, as well as pedigreed dogs, are sold in puppy mills. The only way you can be sure that a puppy came from a reputable source is to see where he or she came from yourself&amp;quot; (ASPCA). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next question, what about the fact that these puppies come from &amp;quot;more highly regulated states&amp;quot;? Well, if you do your research (or actually ask follow up questions as opposed to simply believing everything you read like a horoscope) you would of asked the sales man or woman which specific states they are talking about. Fortunately for you, I did. The states that Petland Novi gets its puppies from include Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas. According, again, to the ASPCA, Arkansas is the state with the highest offense of puppy mills, with Missouri at #8, and Ohio at #11. Michigan was not found on the list (ASPCA). These states have higher regulation than Michigan BECAUSE they have so many problems. Take a classroom example, would you allow the kid who eats glue to be able to watch over the classroom&amp;#39;s glue? No, because of that child&amp;#39;s previous actions. The same goes for these states. They have these laws in place because of the high accounts... and the numbers have not subsided. You are basically playing russian roulette by blindly accepting to get a dog from those states. 9/10 you will end up with the chocolate that has the pepper inside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am talking pedantically to you because this is pretty simple and well known. I knew about puppy mills at the age of 14 and I am not even an animal advocate. Unfortunately, most of these people who buy these dogs will not read this. They are too busy believing the idea that a dog is a toy and not a ten to fifteen year responsibility. When I read reviews on this site, it is typically people who write 5 star reviews for free discounts or previous buyers who had a dog die or an unhealthy one with recessive traits. These people are idiots and are buying a dog on a whim. A dog is not a toy or something you get for Xmas for your kids because they are so cute.

We got a puppy when I was a very young child and I don&amp;#39;t know exactly where it came from, but he got parvo and my mom gave him back to them. I remember her yelling at the guy, I don&amp;#39;t remember if it was a pet store or not- just my 5 foot 100 lb mom fucking giving this dude a piece of her mind. She said she always regretted giving him back and wished she had tried to treat him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom then told my dad to get a small dog for us and he came home with a german shepherd/akita mix lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dg5dv6r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995277.0, "created_utc": 1491966477.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg57vqx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sadperson123", "parent_id": "t3_64t1ig", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It seems like every time someone gets a dog from there it dies of parvo after 3-5 days and $1000s in vet bills.
