In fact, I can see this law doing more harm to the business community from the fact that Eugene is a very outdoorsy/active-lifestyle kind of town, which means visitors and residents probably spend a lot of time outdoors with their dogs - all of whom just got banned from the core downtown area (since, only people who live/work in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; area of Eugene appear to be exempt).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People found to be in violation of the law will be issued a $100 fine, but cannot be arrested and animals cannot be impounded. So, the police will spend time and resources to issue a lot of tickets that probably won&amp;#39;t ever be paid, and the judicial system will get to spend their energy and resources attempting to collect on those unpaid fines. How many homeless people do you think will follow the law if they face no real punishment for violating it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the event they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; follow the law and the homeless population spends their time elsewhere, then it just moves the homeless population to other parts of the city - so, the downtown core area has been &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;, but now other parts of the city has an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dogs", "name": "t1_dg4drys", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491952168.0, "created_utc": 1491923368.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qbs9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qbs9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qbs9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4efph", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "longhaultrekkers", "parent_id": "t1_dg4e3jg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're absolutely right.
