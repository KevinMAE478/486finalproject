His mother ended up splitting the cost of a diamond ring with her mother (SO&amp;#39;s grandmother). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as big or fancy as I could have gotten with moissanite, but the fact that his mother and grandmother spent the time and money on choosing a ring for me tells me that they&amp;#39;re happy and excited to accept me into the family, and that, to me, is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that kind of makes me uneasy is that his mother constantly tells me that the ring was expensive and that she used her savings for it. (I don&amp;#39;t know how to respond to this other than with &amp;quot;thank you it&amp;#39;s beautiful&amp;quot; -- I didn&amp;#39;t ask for this ring and I wasn&amp;#39;t the one who chose it!)
