Obviously using the library is totally unlike attacking ships and stealing cargo. Is it like copyright infringement? No, it's not illegal and not infringing copyright.\n\nIs there any significant economic or moral difference between tons of people sharing books via the library or copying ebooks for each other? Not enough to care about. The library is so massively positive for society, and sharing of resources online is obviously extremely similar. This is the most important point to recognize that the entire demonization of sharing as \"piracy\" is garbage. If funding for creative work is based on people not sharing, then it would fall apart if only everyone used the library.\n\nTo put another way, there would be *massive* economic ramifications if everyone actually joined and followed the ideas of /r/Frugal \u2014 our economy is largely built on exploitation and waste that we here aim to avoid.
