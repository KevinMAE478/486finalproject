Here are the things I would consider:\n\n* Who the insurer is. There are many \"low cost\" insurers who have a tendency to screw over their insureds when a claim is ultimately made. The claims handling practices of insurers often vary significant from state to state, so you can't rely on national reputation. Most people have extremely limited anecdotal experience in dealing with claims, so you can't rely on personal or online reviews. I would call a local injury lawyer and ask for insurers they recommend. You should not be charged for that conversation; it's not legal advice, and I'm happy to give it just to have you recommending me to anyone who actually needs a lawyer in the future. \n\n* Decide what you're getting *before* shopping premiums. It's the only way to compare apples to apples. \n\n* Buy more coverage than you think you need. Besides liability insurance (defends you in the event of a claim against you), most states require insurers to issue or at least offer uninsured / underinsured motorist coverage. The specific effect depends on the jurisdiction, but in a nutshell, it pays claims when *you* are injured by another driver who doesn't have enough liability insurance to pay your total losses. I've represented people who were permanently paralyzed who recovered only $25,000 for their lifelong needs because that's all the insurance that was available. You\u200b can easily - and cheaply - protect yourself by upping your own insurance to have enough UM/UIM. Going from $500,000 to $1m in coverage, for example, cost me an additional $13/year. Totally worth it. \n\n* Consider an umbrella policy. Most insurers offer them, and they are usually cheaper to get the same amount of coverage. The umbrella policy applies on top of your base policy. For example, if you have a $250,000 base policy, and a $1m umbrella, the vase policy is used up first before the umbrella has to pay anything. Because the umbrella is rarely ever going to be used at all, the risk to the insurer is relatively low. So you can usually get a base policy plus umbrella cheaper than a base policy with the same total coverage. You usually don't have to get the umbrella policy from the same insurer that carries your base policy. However, insurers typically have strict requirements for the amount and type of base policy coverage you must carry to qualify for an umbrella policy. It requires extra shopping around, but you can save a good bit to get a ton of coverage in the event of a catastrophic loss. \n\n* It's usually more cost effective to put all of your liability insurance through one carrier. They give very good bundling discounts. So shop for rental / home insurance at the same time, and get a total policy quote.
