When I get apricots on sale this recipe runs me less than $5 for a batch. My other fav recipe is 8 oz pepperjack cut into cubes, small jar of green olives, maybe a can of artichoke hearts cut into quarters, topped with a dressing made of sherry vinegar, olive oil and italian seasoning. Banana bread is cheap too, one to take and one to keep for breakfasts(freeze it).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Frugal", "name": "t1_dgbrvie", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492352420.0, "created_utc": 1492323620.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kz4o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbuo0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wivsta", "parent_id": "t3_65kz4o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Frugal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fresh cut fruit.
