It was 1/4 mile from my parents house so my family all stayed at their house.  Hubby and I stayed at B&amp;B the night before and night of the wedding ($200 for two nights).  In Laws and his side of family all rented their own rooms at the B&amp;B.  Because we rented the whole place out, the owners gave us use of the Living Room and enclosed porch for the wedding.  It was beautiful!  We had full use of their dining area with tables, linens, etc... free.\n\n**Dress:** My Mom bought my dress, it was $200 online at Davids Bridal.  Hubbys Mom bought his suit, $150 online at JC Penney.  Both were really nice and he has worn the suit many times since.  I bought a $30 wreath style head piece on ETSY, $20 sandals at Target, and had my BFF do my makeup and hair.\n\n**Food:** We had pasta buffet catered.  They provided 3 pasta dishes, salad, rolls, condiments, chaffing dishes, sterno, serving spoons, and all Plates/utensils/napkins.  I think it cost about $12/per person.  They set up and cleaned up.  \n\n**Drinks:** I bought sparkling lemonade, iced tea, and a few bottles of red/white wine, all totaling about $100.\n\n**Music:** Hired local musician with acoustic guitar/singing.  He played/sang for my entrance and during the reception.  $250, well worth it.\n\n**JP:** I think we paid her $50 and she ate at the reception too.\n\n**Decorations:**  The only flowers were my bouquet, his boutinier, and coursages for our Moms/Grandmas.  Under $100.  I went to a Christmas Tree Shop (It's a New England thing) and bought candles and various glass/metal candle holders.  These were places all over throughout the room where the ceremony was.  I bought glass drink dispensers, cups, a tiered cupcake holder, and a few other misc things.  Total around $100.\n\n**Cake:**  We like ice cream so we bought the little \"Sample\" sized Ben and Jerry's in various flavors and they fit perfectly into the cupcake holder.  It looked so cool... just like a cake, and everyone loved it.\n\n**Bridesmaid:** My BFF bought her own dress, shoes (same as mine), and did her own hair/makeup.\n\n**Photos:**   A great friend of mine is an amateur (now professional) photographer.  He took all photos and gave me a thumb drive so I could have them printed and make my own album.  I paid him $200 and spend another $100 to make the album(s) on Shutterfly.\n\nWe had 30 people at the wedding.  It was on a Sunday afternoon.  I loved my wedding and would not change it for the world.  I chose the venue because it was beautiful in itself and required minimal decorating.  The wedding was so relaxed and fun for everyone.  My Dad hand carved a beautiful ring box for us.\n\nMy parents threw a BBQ for us the day before.  They paid for the whole thing as their gift to us and my Mom arranged the whole thing... we literally just showed up and had fun.  It was awesome, everyone brought food and we grilled and just had a good time.  It was a really fun way to see everyone (over a hundred people showed up)before the wedding and just kick back and relax.\n", "edited": 1492006384.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wedding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venue:&lt;/strong&gt; Bed and Breakfast.

He played/sang for my entrance and during the reception.  $250, well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JP:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we paid her $50 and she ate at the reception too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decorations:&lt;/strong&gt;  The only flowers were my bouquet, his boutinier, and coursages for our Moms/Grandmas.  Under $100.  I went to a Christmas Tree Shop (It&amp;#39;s a New England thing) and bought candles and various glass/metal candle holders.  These were places all over throughout the room where the ceremony was.  I bought glass drink dispensers, cups, a tiered cupcake holder, and a few other misc things.  Total around $100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cake:&lt;/strong&gt;  We like ice cream so we bought the little &amp;quot;Sample&amp;quot; sized Ben and Jerry&amp;#39;s in various flavors and they fit perfectly into the cupcake holder.  It looked so cool... just like a cake, and everyone loved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridesmaid:&lt;/strong&gt; My BFF bought her own dress, shoes (same as mine), and did her own hair/makeup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos:&lt;/strong&gt;   A great friend of mine is an amateur (now professional) photographer.  He took all photos and gave me a thumb drive so I could have them printed and make my own album.  I paid him $200 and spend another $100 to make the album(s) on Shutterfly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had 30 people at the wedding.  It was on a Sunday afternoon.  I loved my wedding and would not change it for the world.  I chose the venue because it was beautiful in itself and required minimal decorating.  The wedding was so relaxed and fun for everyone.  My Dad hand carved a beautiful ring box for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents threw a BBQ for us the day before.  They paid for the whole thing as their gift to us and my Mom arranged the whole thing... we literally just showed up and had fun.  It was awesome, everyone brought food and we grilled and just had a good time.  It was a really fun way to see everyone (over a hundred people showed up)before the wedding and just kick back and relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Frugal", "name": "t1_dg5wh92", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034793.0, "created_utc": 1492005993.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 115}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtds", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6anza", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LawBot2016", "parent_id": "t1_dg61dkz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Frugal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The parent mentioned [**Justice Of The Peace**](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Justice_Of_The_Peace).

Just pick colors, borders, and a font you like. If you go that route, I&amp;#39;d suggest making your invites, reception cards, and RSVPs out of your standard 8.5 x 11&amp;quot; paper size. Flip it landscape, cut it down the middle. Cut one of the halves in two. This should give you one 8.5 x 5.5&amp;quot;, and two 4.25 x 5.5&amp;quot; pieces. The big one is your invite, the other two are your reception cards and RSVPs. Publisher makes it really easy to divide the paper up this way and create margins, but I know there are other free programs that would do it just as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For my save the dates, I splurged a tiny bit, but still saved money. I designed them on VistaPrint&amp;#39;s site, and printed them as business card sized magnets (the wedding section is gorged, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t bother). I used double sided tape (semi-tack glue doesn&amp;#39;t work as well, learned the hard way) to stick them unto colored, unlined index cards. Bought a stamp that said &amp;quot;Save The Date&amp;quot; on it, and some additional accents, and stamped the other side. They turned out pretty amazing, and the extra save the dates that I didn&amp;#39;t use became fridge magnets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Frugal", "name": "t1_dg62owx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041832.0, "created_utc": 1492013032.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtds", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5w2w1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LindyLovesLipstick", "parent_id": "t1_dg5t7vx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Frugal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We went to Michaels and purchased beads and pendants that coordinated with their dresses.

Or if you have a gorgeous place to get married, forget the decorations and let the beauty speak for itself!\n\n- A wedding dress can cost thousands but I bought a gorgeous cream colored chiffon bridesmaid dress that looked absolutely stunning for $300 and added a sparkly sash. There is no need to pay all that money for 1 outfit you wear 1 time. A tux can easily be rented for pretty cheap as well. \n\n- Pick a date that is 'off season' or look at a Friday or Sunday. They are generally cheaper as far as venues go. \n\n- You don't need to feed everyone some giant meal. We had a 7 PM wedding and only served apps and dessert. We were very clear on all the invites and messages that dinner would not be served (though some still expected it....). And the cake for that matter - it's expensive and I've found that not many people like cake, they just eat it if it's there. Especially if you don't like it, then get something else: cupcakes, cookies, pies, fruit, pastries, etc. \n\n- Guests do not need a cheesy (or any) gift to leave with. A hug and heartfelt thank you will be much more appreciated than a little bag of candy, a pic of the couple, a mini wine bottle, a plant, or a bottle opener (all of which I've received - nice but unnecessary). \n\n- Guests also do not need you to pay for their: special outfits (unless they are in the wedding and you want to help them out), transportation, drinks, rehearsal dinner, day after brunch, or whatever else people say you are 'supposed' to do. You do what you can, and the people who care about you will understand. Those who do not understand, should probably not be invited to your wedding....\n\nAlso, for the sake of your sanity and that of your SO, don't let anyone - even us strangers on the internet - tell you what to do.

We didn't do this, but I've heard a lot of people recommend going to Trader Joe's or Wegmans or whatever and just buying a bunch of their flowers and having one of the wedding party arrange them.

There was about a week or so where we seriously considered having chipotle cater our wedding (we nixed that idea after I got food poisoning from chipotle, lol). \n\n- Drinks - hate to say it, but if you do a dry wedding it's a llooooot cheaper. Not only in alcohol supply costs - we would've had to get extra insurance for the venue if we'd had alcohol on the premises. For some people it's a dealbreaker, but whatever - it's your day!\n\n- Lawn games are great. If you've got a friend who has some cornhole boards, coordinate to get them out. Bocce is good too. \n\n- Ooh, I just remembered another thing we did to decorate at the reception. We went to used bookstores and library consignment sales and got a ton of fairly nice-looking hardcover books for VERY cheap, and then had a stack on each table with a little lantern.
