I have since moved on to another field, but I wanted to share some updates with you all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share some insights, advice and cost saving tips with you. This advice is mostly applicable to the US and US law, but there are some things that apply worldwide.  Funerals are a touchy subject, and a difficult one.  It can often be difficult to be frugal in a time of grief and loss.  However, with planning and some prior insight, most unnecessary costs can be avoided.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Have a plan written down somewhere about what should happen to you in the event of your death.  This does not seem like something that a 30 year old should have to consider, but accidents happen every day, and we do not always have the luxury of time to consider options.  A rough funeral plan can be done in about 15 minutes.  You should address the issue of burial vs. cremation vs. donation, where you would like to be laid to rest, and any special requests.  There are a couple of special conditions that require special thought to your plan.  If you are married, or have a child, participate in activities with a high risk of death, or are over the age of 50, you really do need to have a plan written down. It is a somber thing to do, but should not take too long. If you have not taken the time to do this, do it today. Talk to your loved ones and let them know what you want. Also remember this is a good time to tell them how much you care about them. The reason it is so important to have a plan is that it is very easy to spend a lot of money in a time of grief that could be used for other, more important things. Having a clear plan on what you would like to have happen is one of the kindest things you can do for your loved ones while they grieve for you.  No one wants to go casket shopping when they are grieving.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to get to the nitty-gritty of the pricing and your options.  Funeral homes are required by law to provide a price sheet if you ask for one, so ask around in your town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are three main options for what happens to your body after you die. Burial, cremation and donation. It is important to remember that funerals are separate. More on funerals later.\nBurial is going to be the most expensive. You will be paying for the services of the funeral home, a casket, a vault(a concrete liner for the casket), a grave space, and an open/close fee. In most states, this will start at a minimum of 6,000 dollars and only go up from there. I have worked funerals that were over 25,000 dollars, all told, and I live in one of the cheaper states. Here is what you can do to get this a little cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, embalming is only required by many funeral homes if there is going to be a viewing. Not doing an open casket will allow you to skip embalming(a nasty, disgusting process that is terrible for the environment), and save 500-1000 dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, funeral homes are required by law to allow you to provide your own casket. Walmart and Costco both offer caskets at very reasonable prices. If you are a carpenter, you can build your own. Plans are available online. This is one of the places the most money can be saved.  Most funeral homes will price match one of their caskets to match Wal-mart or Costco if you tell them you intend to take that route. In the event that they don&amp;#39;t, order one online and pick it up in a van or truck. Caskets will fit in both minivans and small trucks. Also realize that this is a box that you will put in the ground. You will see it for less than 5 hours, and there is little difference between a high end casket and the cheapest one on the market. Don&amp;#39;t spend 4,000 dollars on a box that goes in the ground. Spend about 900, get basically the same product, and use that 3,100 for almost anything else, funeral related or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, find a cheaper funeral plot and have the service on a day and at a time when open/close fees are less. Every municipality has different fees and different costs. This requires a little shopping around, and a little work, but is worth it.  Planning in advance and having a cemetery and plots picked out will save a lot of hassle and a lot of money. If you plan to be buried next to a spouse, buy your plots together. Understand that these are 9-5, M-F government employees.  If the open or close fee is outside of these times, they will likely charge more money and have to pay overtime.  Never bury someone on a federal holiday unless you have too, for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cremation is a cheaper option. If you choose to cremate someone, DO NOT CALL A FUNERAL HOME. Lookup cremation services on google. They will do a cremation for 500-1000 dollars(Don&amp;#39;t forget to ask for a discount!), while a funeral home will charge you 2000 dollars, then pay the cremation service to do the same thing. Never pay for an urn through either service. Amazon has a great selection of urns for a fraction of the price that you will pay. Watch out for hidden fees as well. Make sure to review everything before you sign anything. With cremation, you can choose to keep the urn or have it buried somewhere. Burial plots in cemeteries for cremated remains are very cheap and reasonable, often under 100 dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donation is the cheapest option. If you donate your body to science, most places will cremate you for free after they use what they can. This is a good option because it is free, moves forward science and medicine, and places no burden on anyone. Look into this long before you die. If this is what you desire, put it into your will.  This requires advance planning.  There are conditions as well, and your family will not be compensated, but they will receive your cremated remains when the scientists are done with you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now onto services. Remember that services are separate from disposing the body.  Funeral Homes often offer a complete package of services that you may or may not need.  Many churches will do a service for free or a small fee. If you want to do a funeral cheaply, have them cremated, but still hold a service in a church. This way you can still have a service, but aren&amp;#39;t paying marked up funeral home prices for everything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Floral arrangements can be found cheaply at Costco and smaller floral shops. Don&amp;#39;t buy them through a funeral home, you will pay mark-up on them. Obtain them yourself.  I have been at many funerals where the flowers were the largest expense.  I recommend getting a total of 2 different arrangements, a flower stand and a flower spray for the casket.  You do not need to have any more than that for a tasteful ceremony.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, remember to negotiate. This is best done before death. Once someone dies, you have a short time to choose a funeral home. Ask them to price match, beat a competitor, etc. The worst they can say is no.  Understand that this is a business, and they do have to make money from offering a service.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a way to make the funeral more memorable, I would recommend doing something a little different with some of the savings from the services that you did not want or need.  I have seen a bagpipe regiment play, a horse drawn carriage carry the casket, releasing of doves, a BBQ after party(150 racks of ribs), and a scattering of ashes in a national park( There is a small fee for this as well).  Make the funeral meaningful, personal, and have it help you work through your grief, but make sure you are getting as much value as you can from it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this is helpful, and you don&amp;#39;t need any of this advice any time soon.  I will be around for a while this morning if anyone has any questions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is a 3 year update to a post I wrote about the funeral industry.
