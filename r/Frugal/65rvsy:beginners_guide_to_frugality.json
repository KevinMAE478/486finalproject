If this is the case, you should reevaluate what you buy and the amounts and figure out a system to label expired foods or be more efficient with meal prep.\n\nThe inventory on things you own is helpful for those who keep things in storage boxes and drawers that they forget about and those who shop compulsorily but don't realize that they maybe already own 2-3 of whatever it is they think they need (i.e., headphones, tech gadgets, cables, black tees). It's also super eye-opening just for knowing the sheer hoard of physical stuff that you wasted your money on over the years and never use that's hiding compactly in your back closet. You can then try to sell, donate or upcycle this stuff to help pay off your debts and make the stuff that you do value visible to you to avoid this from happening again.\n\nAfter you've accessed your past and current spending, you could figure out what type of frugal lifestyle would work for you by participating in a month-long challenge of sorts (i.e., buying only necessities, or an all-out no-buy month). It might sound miserable in theory, but by the end of the month, a lot of people realize that they were able to do just fine without indulging in some of their compulsory habits so it helps you remove some dead weight in your life. To curb online shopping, put stuff you might want on a wish list and come back to it at the end of the month to reassess if you still want it. Use some common sense here.

If this is the case, you should reevaluate what you buy and the amounts and figure out a system to label expired foods or be more efficient with meal prep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inventory on things you own is helpful for those who keep things in storage boxes and drawers that they forget about and those who shop compulsorily but don&amp;#39;t realize that they maybe already own 2-3 of whatever it is they think they need (i.e., headphones, tech gadgets, cables, black tees). It&amp;#39;s also super eye-opening just for knowing the sheer hoard of physical stuff that you wasted your money on over the years and never use that&amp;#39;s hiding compactly in your back closet. You can then try to sell, donate or upcycle this stuff to help pay off your debts and make the stuff that you do value visible to you to avoid this from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;#39;ve accessed your past and current spending, you could figure out what type of frugal lifestyle would work for you by participating in a month-long challenge of sorts (i.e., buying only necessities, or an all-out no-buy month). It might sound miserable in theory, but by the end of the month, a lot of people realize that they were able to do just fine without indulging in some of their compulsory habits so it helps you remove some dead weight in your life. To curb online shopping, put stuff you might want on a wish list and come back to it at the end of the month to reassess if you still want it. Use some common sense here.
