Best thing about this is you can build up a nice collection of glass, which can be used on any future camera bodies you buy with a decent mount adaptor. \n\nLastly, yes a full frame DSLR sensor will be better quality than APC-S, and you'll get more pixels, but a good photograph isn't tech specs and pixels, its the subject, lighting, context and quality of lens you have.

It is lens x ~1.5, so a 50mm lens will seem pretty zoomed in.  I would recommend the smaller pancake STM lenses (24mm) for canon if they want to do landscapes or 40mm for portraits. Higher than that can be a bit limiting on a small sensor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: also, not all the D-series are full frame. My 80D is aps-c. Also, I understand that STM lenses are more appropriate for video, but they are great compact primes that are just a touch slower on the AF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Frugal", "name": "t1_dg7zhxz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136831.0, "created_utc": 1492108031.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653zrm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgamaz6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pabloster", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qrfp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Frugal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is some solid advice, I would too recommend getting an entry level Rebel with a decent prime lens ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is some solid advice, I would too recommend getting an entry level Rebel with a decent prime lens &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Frugal", "name": "t1_dgamaz6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492290208.0, "created_utc": 1492261408.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7qrfp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "roundaboot_ca", "parent_id": "t1_dg7aipx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Frugal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Professional photographer here. The secret is in the lenses you buy. I'm a big proponent of \"fixed\" lenses (also called \"prime\" lenses), which are lenses that don't zoom but have a set focal length. Most cameras come with a stock lens that is a zoom (18-55mm, for example). I suggest buying a camera body (the Canon Rebel T5 for example) and buying a fixed 50mm lens. You can buy a basic 50mm EF lens for a Canon for about $120 (or less if you buy used). Bonus to this 50mm fixed is it's very lightweight--great for carrying around with you. Your image quality will be way better with a fixed lens than with a zoom lens which inherently degrades image quality bc you're shooting through many pieces of glass. The major experience difference w fixed vs zoom is you have to move your body to get closer or farther from your subject vs just zooming in or out on your zoom lens. You'll get used to it, plus you'll look like a professional. :)\n\nThe Rebel series is not a professional series camera but still a v good one. The major difference is the cropped sensor on the Rebel vs the full frame sensor on the D series cameras. This means your 50mm fixed lens will technically shoot like a 38mm bc the camera sensor crops the focal length a bit. Not a big deal for someone who wants a camera to travel with or shoot for fun. You could buy an 85mm and it will crop to about 70mm ish but the 85mm fixed is more expensive than the 50mm. \n\nIf you do buy a used lens, do a test to ensure no scratches are on the lens. Sometimes you can tell just by examining the glass lens but you can also take test pictures of a dark piece of paper, a light one, etc. Always test a used camera or lens in natural light. If you buy a used camera (I always have!), do a similar test to check for dust or scratches on the camera sensor or dead pixels (the paper tests work well). Dust will look like gray spots. Dead pixels look like, well, dead pixels.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nBonus tip: you can buy a clear lens filter ($20) to protect your lens from scratches. A good investment.

Each of these requires extra equipment that by itself is often already more than $500.\n\nDoing photography as a pass time / hobby can be about these things, but normally it's not - this is in a way \"extreme\" photography (except perhaps the small depth of field). For most people, photography as a hobby means using your camera in a more technical way, paying more attention to composition, printing some photographs and trying new photography subjects. All of these things can be done on many compact cameras.\n\nI would still recommend looking more in the line of the cameras I mentioned - they produce quality images, you get image stabilization, a large zoom range (so you can experiment a bit with landscapes, portraits, birds etc), and almost all settings that a serious photographer ever uses can be tweaked. Then while using such a camera, you figure out if photography is really something you're interested in, and which specific kind of photography you like (because this matters for equipment choice). Because you bought it second hand, you don't lose too much when you resell it.\n\nOf course it's your own decision, and while (contrary to what you might expect) a DSLR would initially be more limiting, it does make photography feel more \"serious\", and it leaves more room for expansion. If you do choose for a DSLR, I still recommend buying second-hand, and in this case I would recommend considering even older cameras (e.g. from around 2010-2012) because they are all fantastic (the main thing that really got better since then is video ability) and the older you go the less value they lose over time. Also, the moment you move into SLR territory the value comes from the lenses and peripheral equipment, not from the camera itself. Just don't be disappointed when you find out that for $500 you will be carrying around relatively heavy equipment that's actually not very competent or flexible (i.e. 2 lenses that cover a narrower range than you can cover with these compact cameras).", "edited": 1492078539.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a silly reason, but I think you underestimate what you can do with a non-DSLR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some things you can do with an SLR that you won&amp;#39;t be able to do with a compact camera: (extreme) macro, very small depth of field, tilt/shift, fast sports (fast autofocus), technical flash photography, very long exposure. Each of these requires extra equipment that by itself is often already more than $500.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing photography as a pass time / hobby can be about these things, but normally it&amp;#39;s not - this is in a way &amp;quot;extreme&amp;quot; photography (except perhaps the small depth of field). For most people, photography as a hobby means using your camera in a more technical way, paying more attention to composition, printing some photographs and trying new photography subjects. All of these things can be done on many compact cameras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would still recommend looking more in the line of the cameras I mentioned - they produce quality images, you get image stabilization, a large zoom range (so you can experiment a bit with landscapes, portraits, birds etc), and almost all settings that a serious photographer ever uses can be tweaked. Then while using such a camera, you figure out if photography is really something you&amp;#39;re interested in, and which specific kind of photography you like (because this matters for equipment choice). Because you bought it second hand, you don&amp;#39;t lose too much when you resell it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;#39;s your own decision, and while (contrary to what you might expect) a DSLR would initially be more limiting, it does make photography feel more &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, and it leaves more room for expansion.
