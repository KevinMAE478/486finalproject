I've since been putting $25/week as well in there because the three months of the round-ups made me realise that little-and-often saving is one of the easiest things to do because you don't notice huge chunks missing from your account as you do when you save a larger chunk over a longer period. Purely psychological for me, but it's a nice way to get a different way of \"saving\".\n\nI currently have ~$350 in the account, and it's gained 2.5% since the end of Sep last year. A lot better than the best savings accounts out there (though I completely understand there's more risk involved). I have a \"moderate\" portfolio (it gives you the option of five portolios, conservative, mod. conservative, mod, mod aggressive and aggressive).

I'm not actually a student anymore, but my old university provides us with an .edu e-mail after we graduate.
