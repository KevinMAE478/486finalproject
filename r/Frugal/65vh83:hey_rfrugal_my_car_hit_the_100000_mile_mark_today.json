Most cars the fuel pump is in the tank and this also can keep the pump cooler. Running around near empty is foolish.

Oil changes *when the car tells you that they're due*. A few years back I rang Honda and asked if it was advisable for me to change my oil before the maintenance minder says so. I was advised by two separate people (I called twice) that I should change the oil only when the car says it's due.\n\n2. Tires. Keep up with them. Don't let them go bald before swapping them out. Keep them inflated as they should be.\n\n3. Your battery should be checked regularly.\n\n4. Have your alternator checked regularly. Mine started going bad at around 120k. I replaced it at about 125k.\n\n5. Wiring harness. Have it checked regularly. I had mine swapped out at 125k along with the alternator.\n\n6. Your starter. Mine went out at about 140k. Have it checked regularly. Ideally just have alternator, harness, and starter checked regularly.\n\n7. Swap out your fluids when your car tells you to.\n\n8. Have your brakes checked regularly. Particularly if you feel/hear them straining. I had my rotors tooled every 30k miles or so, and got new rotors after about 100k.\n\n9. Have your ac checked regularly.
