I probably won&amp;#39;t get any responses in time but I am going to try anyways! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me &amp;amp; my boyfriend have been living in our apartment for about 10 months now. During such time we have been sleeping on a futon, and our only furniture is a desk. We held off on making this place &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; because he wanted to move out of this apartment to find some place cheaper (We live in Lincoln Park of Chicago since its across the street from my university). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our lease had to be renewed this month and after debating we realized that we weren&amp;#39;t going to find an apartment in time so we are staying here! Though our apartment is only a 1 bedroom I really want to make this apartment more of a home since right now it looks like anyone could live here. Due to our expenses we both promised to save up. We have ordered a bed frame, mattress, bookshelf, and dresser all totaling to about $600. I have about $2,300 in my savings account and wish to ONLY spend about $300. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found some stuff at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and have 5 $15 off $50 coupons.

I was thinking of using my Kohl&amp;#39;s credit card.
