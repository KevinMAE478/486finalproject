It&amp;#39;s about what you&amp;#39;re interested in doing and whether a cruise is something you would enjoy enough to justify the amount you&amp;#39;d spend. I know people who love them and people who would never go again. Personally, I agree with you and think there are many better ways to spend that money that would be much more fun than being stuck on a boat. Especially after hearing about the flu outbreaks they have had on occasion. Don&amp;#39;t let yourself be pressured into something you don&amp;#39;t want to do.
