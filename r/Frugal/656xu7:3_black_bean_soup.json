By now, I&amp;#39;m realizing that WOW those beans swell up, so the cooker is going to be completely full if I don&amp;#39;t empty out a few beans.

I took a bite of it, tasted like Ok bacon to me. After cooking, I crumbled it up and added it to the beans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I added random amounts of salt, pepper, red pepper, red pepper flakes, dehydrated onion bits (because I didn&amp;#39;t have a real onion handy), garlic bits, and maybe another spice or two that I&amp;#39;m forgetting now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I added water to the slow cooker, just enough to cover the beans, maybe a hair over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eight hours later -- bam, we&amp;#39;ve got good soup. It was actually pretty thick, not very watery at all. My wife used the masher to squish a little bit of it up to make it more liquid without making it more watery.
