Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be super nice to be able to play matchmaker for the eligible NPCs? Specifically: What if you had the option to, at 8 hearts, either give an eligible NPC a bouquet OR a token of friendship (and thereby effectively &amp;quot;friendzoning&amp;quot; them)? \nI always feel a bit bad about being the only one romancing and getting married, and I thought back to the whole &amp;quot;rivals&amp;quot; thing in Harvest Moon DS, where there&amp;#39;s these &amp;quot;rival heart events&amp;quot;, and after the fourth one, they get married. Since I never really liked the &amp;quot;rival&amp;quot; idea so much, I thought maybe you could friendzone someone with a token, thereby unlocking the last two hearts, but with a friendship based matchmaking route. Like, you have to give both eligible NPCs this token and have enough hearts with both of them to trigger events and eventually marriage between the two.
