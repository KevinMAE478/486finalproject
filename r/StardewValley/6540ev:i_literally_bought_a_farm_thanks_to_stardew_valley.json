I got a great job working for some amazing people after 5 months of working on nothing but the farm. The only thing that sucked was that I had no friends where I was. There were no kids my age, no one that I knew that I could hang out with on the weekends, just no one. It&amp;#39;s really hard on a 19 y/o to have fun by himself after 7 months of being in the middle of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved back to where I was and I&amp;#39;m now living with my brother. Essentially I&amp;#39;ve had a year of my life with no contact to my friends, no hanging out with the guys when the work week is over  (work is never over on a farm tho) and no talking to people my age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I helped get a lot done in the year I was there. We have about 20 sheep, 4 dozen or so chickens, 5 peacocks, 2 cattle, a donkey and a pony. About 50 acres of clear land and the other 80 will be kept natural. A lot more to it but I don&amp;#39;t want to keep rambling on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t trade it for the world, I honestly miss it and would move back without a heartbeat but I know if get lonely again. If you don&amp;#39;t already have a dog, get one. The dog we got up there was such an amazing companion to have and made it a little less lonely for me, plus they&amp;#39;re naturally man&amp;#39;s best friend so that&amp;#39;s a plus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post but I wish you well and hope you&amp;#39;re successful in what you strive towards OP!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "StardewValley", "name": "t1_dg7m94l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492122573.0, "created_utc": 1492093773.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wb7y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6540ev", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wb7y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6540ev", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wb7y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6540ev", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7o9pm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kittamaru", "parent_id": "t1_dg7hmlx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StardewValley", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah...
