And wheat, when it is used, is rarely more than 50% of the grain bill. The games needs barley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game already has the mechanic of 5 ore + 1 coal = 1 bar so there&amp;#39;s no reason the same couldn&amp;#39;t be applied to kegs. Brewing could be so much better than it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 barley + 1 hops = 1 beer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 hops + 1 barley = 1 pale ale&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 wheat + 1 barley + 1 hops = 1 hefeweizen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 barley + 1 dandelion = 1 gruit&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to get crazy, we could even throw the barley into a kiln and get brown malt back out, giving us&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 brown malt + 1 barley + 1 hops = porter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless! I should probably stop complaining about this and just write a mod which should be doable with some effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing: hop and grape trellises should be permanent like trees. Hops should be planted in the Spring with a two month incubation and then flower every three days in the Fall. The current system makes no sense. Same goes for grapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "StardewValley", "name": "t1_dg5509h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491983430.0, "created_utc": 1491954630.0,
