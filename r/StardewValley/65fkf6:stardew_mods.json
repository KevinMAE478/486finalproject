[Animal Mood Fix](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/761/?) - fixes the bug where animals at a high mood/happiness rating will revert back to an extremely low mood when you pet them.\n2. [Better Ranching](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859/?) - removes failed milking/shearing animations (no more dry squeak) and adds bubbles to show when animal products are ready.\n3. [CJB Cheats Menu](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4/?) - only to experiment with! (hardcore cheating will ruin the fun).\n4. [Daily Quest Anywhere](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/513/?) - allows you to access the bulletin board anywhere.\n5. [Fast Geode](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/750/?) - removes the geode breaking animation so you can instantly break them.\n6. [GateOpener](https://github.com/mralbobo/stardew-gate-opener/releases) - automatically open and close gates on proximity (there's another mod called AutoGate that also does this which has a delay, GateOpener is faster).\n7. [Gift Taste Helper](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/229/?) - displays a helpful tooltip that shows a villager's favourite gifts when hovering over their social page or birthday in the calendar.\n8. [Happy Birthday](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/520/?) - you get a birthday, NPCs wish you, and you get birthday gifts.\n9. [Health Bars](https://github.com/Zoryn4163/SMAPI-Mods/releases) - adds health bars to enemies in the mines.\n10. [Horse Whistle](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/calling-horse-with-key-press.111550/#post-3070635) - lets you call (teleport) your horse to you.\n11. [Instant Grow Trees](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/173/?) - grow trees overnight. As with CJB Cheats Menu, careful in how you use it.\n12. [Jiggly Junimo Bundles](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/smapi-0-39-2-jiggly-junimo-bundles.111789/) - shows a tooltip if an item is in a bundle.\n13. [Lookup Anything](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/?) - See live info about whatever's under your cursor when you press F1 (controller supported).\n14. [Loved Labels](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/279/?) - hover your cursor over your pet or farm animal to see if they have been petted.\n15. [Museum Rearranger](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/428/?) - rearrange the display without needing to donate.\n16. [NPC Map Locations](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239/?) - shows villagers' locations on the map in real-time.\n17. [Simple Crops Label](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/314/?) - adds a tooltip identifying crops and fruit trees.\n18. [Skip Intro](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533/?) - bypasses the splash screens.\n19. [SMAPI Chest Label System](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/242/?) - allows you to name your chests.\n20.

There are sites out there that steal modders&amp;#39; work without crediting them and make money off them. Stay away from them. I use the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21/?\"&gt;mod manager&lt;/a&gt; that makes updating SMAPI easy, and allows selectively enabling mods, but it&amp;#39;s not strictly necessary (if you want to know more about it let me know).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mods I use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/761/?\"&gt;Animal Mood Fix&lt;/a&gt; - fixes the bug where animals at a high mood/happiness rating will revert back to an extremely low mood when you pet them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859/?\"&gt;Better Ranching&lt;/a&gt; - removes failed milking/shearing animations (no more dry squeak) and adds bubbles to show when animal products are ready.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4/?\"&gt;CJB Cheats Menu&lt;/a&gt; - only to experiment with! (hardcore cheating will ruin the fun).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/513/?\"&gt;Daily Quest Anywhere&lt;/a&gt; - allows you to access the bulletin board anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/750/?\"&gt;Fast Geode&lt;/a&gt; - removes the geode breaking animation so you can instantly break them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/mralbobo/stardew-gate-opener/releases\"&gt;GateOpener&lt;/a&gt; - automatically open and close gates on proximity (there&amp;#39;s another mod called AutoGate that also does this which has a delay, GateOpener is faster).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/229/?\"&gt;Gift Taste Helper&lt;/a&gt; - displays a helpful tooltip that shows a villager&amp;#39;s favourite gifts when hovering over their social page or birthday in the calendar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/520/?\"&gt;Happy Birthday&lt;/a&gt; - you get a birthday, NPCs wish you, and you get birthday gifts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Zoryn4163/SMAPI-Mods/releases\"&gt;Health Bars&lt;/a&gt; - adds health bars to enemies in the mines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/calling-horse-with-key-press.111550/#post-3070635\"&gt;Horse Whistle&lt;/a&gt; - lets you call (teleport) your horse to you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/173/?\"&gt;Instant Grow Trees&lt;/a&gt; - grow trees overnight. As with CJB Cheats Menu, careful in how you use it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/smapi-0-39-2-jiggly-junimo-bundles.111789/\"&gt;Jiggly Junimo Bundles&lt;/a&gt; - shows a tooltip if an item is in a bundle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/?\"&gt;Lookup Anything&lt;/a&gt; - See live info about whatever&amp;#39;s under your cursor when you press F1 (controller supported).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/279/?\"&gt;Loved Labels&lt;/a&gt; - hover your cursor over your pet or farm animal to see if they have been petted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/428/?\"&gt;Museum Rearranger&lt;/a&gt; - rearrange the display without needing to donate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239/?\"&gt;NPC Map Locations&lt;/a&gt; - shows villagers&amp;#39; locations on the map in real-time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/314/?\"&gt;Simple Crops Label&lt;/a&gt; - adds a tooltip identifying crops and fruit trees.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533/?\"&gt;Skip Intro&lt;/a&gt; - bypasses the splash screens.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/242/?\"&gt;SMAPI Chest Label System&lt;/a&gt; - allows you to name your chests.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/798/?\"&gt;StackSplitX&lt;/a&gt; - enter specific numbers of items to buy/move/sell.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "StardewValley", "name": "t1_dg9xqh5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241445.0, "created_utc": 1492212645.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wb7y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fkf6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeo8ja", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "relativity_speaking", "parent_id": "t3_65fkf6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StardewValley", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I downloaded ModDrop and it is THE BEST.
