I&amp;#39;d consider having more than a single barn and coop if animals only had been less of a chore to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish it was easier to push past animals. Especially stubborn chickens keeping me from collecting eggs in corners is annoying. I just exit and re-enter the coop to have their positions randomise to fix that. They do need to stay away from doors, but it isn&amp;#39;t a big deal if you have fewer animals in the coop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t paid particular attention to breeding rates; I&amp;#39;ve usually just bought animals for my immediate need. I counted breeding as an eventual bonus if I had spare capacity more than anything really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From my list &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/5p7obq\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (animals &amp;amp; ranch #5):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the hitbox for cows is centered on the bottom of their sprite (which makes sense: udders). It&amp;#39;s fairly large, but it does not cover the top of their sprite. To milk them, aim low, below their hooves if necessary. There&amp;#39;s no particular order between animals, so if there&amp;#39;s one you want to hit, aim away from any that may overlap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal happiness bug is fixed in the beta. For the current release, you can use the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/761/?\"&gt;animal mood fix&lt;/a&gt; mod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely get the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859/?\"&gt;better ranching&lt;/a&gt; mod.
