I would say go for OpenRCT because it&amp;#39;s still a simple isometric game. Everything is on a grid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planet Coaster is ~3d graphics dude~ and you can ride the rides, and add special effects and stuff. The terrain tools also have more to them.... Oh you can also put scenery on custom angles, like I don&amp;#39;t think anything is locked to a grid. Not even the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I would say skip the classic games. OpenRCT uses all the content from RCT 1 and 2 and the expansion packs. Like it&amp;#39;s a clone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And RCT3 was a failure tbh.. It left a lot of fans disappointed. So Planet Coaster is the way to go if you want something a little more complex? Either of the two is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "StardewValley", "name": "t1_dg5wo6y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035040.0, "created_utc": 1492006240.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wb7y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfbl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6c26w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wobbles8steve", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ubhr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StardewValley", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just not RCT world.

They WILL attack until you tame them, but once you do, you can take them with on to fight, you can ride those that aren&amp;#39;t too small, and several of them will give items (cows and sheep give the obvious stuff; dragons can drop teeth and stuff like that)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crafting system is amazing! The better you are at a certain recipe, for example, the better it will sell. Unlike SV all items gain value the more you process them (i.e. a rice pudding will be worth much more than rice and eggs combined; if you&amp;#39;re not good, though, you can burn it). Same applies to blacksmithing, etc  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The characters are super alive, it&amp;#39;s hard to explain. You get really attached to them. Only criticism here is a couple of them look like children...and are bachelors D: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storyline is charming - mostly due to the characters - and the battle system is good. Nothing too fancy, similar to SV but you can learn magic, but the mechanics are good and the bosses cool (I found)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just so much content! After a while you can open up shop instead of just shipping stuff you made. The profits are much better and you get some more character interactions - and you have to level up your vendor skills, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "StardewValley", "name": "t1_dg7vb5m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492132380.0, "created_utc": 1492103580.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wb7y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfbl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9iql6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KettiePi", "parent_id": "t1_dg7u2cm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StardewValley", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Rune Factory 3 was also very good.
