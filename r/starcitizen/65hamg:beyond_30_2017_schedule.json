None of the PU work is going to make the mocap animation challenge any less time consuming and CR isn&amp;#39;t likely to try to cut corners on that aspect of SQ42 development. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also worth remembering that PU updates can afford to be buggy and unoptimized - yet Squadron will require a half year of QA/debug/optimization work after the beta gets locked before it can figuratively (or literally) &amp;quot;go gold.&amp;quot; CIG can&amp;#39;t afford for a buggy unoptimized single player title to be their first official release- they&amp;#39;d doom their studio reputation if they did that. So they have to treat Squadron with greater care any PU updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t expect Squadron is commanding nearly the kind of man hours from the CIG team as the PU is and the recent 3.0 schedule has only further reinforced this belief. I&amp;#39;d love to be wrong and see a surprise release but after 3 years of expecting one is right around the corner and being dead wrong, I&amp;#39;m finding it easier to assume that objects through the front windshield are further away than they appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "name": "t1_dgap7jp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492295450.0, "created_utc": 1492266650.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dganw36", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thornfoot2", "parent_id": "t1_dgaelmd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcitizen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think you are happily mistaken.
