In my opinion, it isn't even the big one.  It was over hyped on reddit from the beginning because it was the only network feature mentioned in previous patch notes.  The \"Jesus feature\" that will seriously improve performance is actually the Object Container system - because without that Network bind/unbind is useless.  They have even pointed this out in ATV by noting that it alone can result in a reduction of 10x the number of entity requests.  Network bind/unbind is a single small portion of the netcode rework.\n\nFinally, the core experience behind planetary landings will still be in 3.0.  Sure, they are using \"moons\" instead of \"planets\" to test the procedural generated massive open worlds - but the whole process of \"Leave a space station, fly to your destination, enter the atmosphere, land on the surface, and get out to explore\" will still be there.  Seriously - at least one of the moons will even have an atmosphere to enter.\n\nThis is a perfect example of over-hyping a couple of features to pretend that less has been delivered.  The reason people wanted \"planetary landings\" was so they could fly down to the surface, get out, and explore.  That will still be there.

They aren&amp;#39;t adding the cloud city, but they didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; claim it was going to be there either.  That is 1 out of 6.  New Space Stations, moons, and asteroids is also still there.  That is 2 out of 6.  Delamar is still there.  &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s count it as not there because it is a stretch goal&amp;quot; is misleading and highly dubious at best. That is 3 out of 6.  Ignoring moons, dumping Crusader, and trying to pretend Delamar isn&amp;#39;t going to make it is not a sound argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Network bind/unbind is NOT the &amp;quot;Jesus feature&amp;quot;.  In my opinion, it isn&amp;#39;t even the big one.  It was over hyped on reddit from the beginning because it was the only network feature mentioned in previous patch notes.  The &amp;quot;Jesus feature&amp;quot; that will seriously improve performance is actually the Object Container system - because without that Network bind/unbind is useless.  They have even pointed this out in ATV by noting that it alone can result in a reduction of 10x the number of entity requests.  Network bind/unbind is a single small portion of the netcode rework.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the core experience behind planetary landings will still be in 3.0.  Sure, they are using &amp;quot;moons&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;planets&amp;quot; to test the procedural generated massive open worlds - but the whole process of &amp;quot;Leave a space station, fly to your destination, enter the atmosphere, land on the surface, and get out to explore&amp;quot; will still be there.
