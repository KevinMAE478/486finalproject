If people have the impression the game is still mostly fair and rewarding, they will play it, even if it not entirely fun. \n\nIf the game mostly works, but the commuity is toxic, some people still can play it and enjoy it. Either because they do not mind, because they adapt that playstyle or because they find their own niche with their clan. But in general we can agree this is bad, and many new players or players who want to enjoy a game more are going to leave or not going to start at all. But still, you can make such game work, at least \"enough\". People can achieve something by playing and that is good enough for many. \n\nIf you have cheaters and abusers, everyone will be annoyed. Not because the game isn't \"fun\" or \"enjoyable\" but because they think it is not fair, the hard work, grind, all the hours they put in are taken away or other people gain the same without achieving something.
