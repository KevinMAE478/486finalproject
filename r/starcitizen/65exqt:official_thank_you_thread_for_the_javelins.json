They didn&amp;#39;t do it for helmets even when the helmet shows two eye holes instead of a visor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can figure is that these features were applied to when the ships were designed from the outside, and every reason under the sun has been offered for the resulting view from inside. The Connie struts could be thinned substantially, but then they would &amp;#39;look weak,&amp;#39; as if that&amp;#39;s a thing in a world with diamond glass and ships like the Reliant. The Khartu could have the central pillars thinned (see Radiant Flux video) without having any real impact on the view from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case it&amp;#39;s an irritation, and I would hope that the years of feedback on this would be met with earnest discussion from CIG, rather than with apologist defense from the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "name": "t1_dgb6g4c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319333.0, "created_utc": 1492290533.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9r4jm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "timedout09", "parent_id": "t3_65exqt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcitizen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Its a win for gameplay and enjoyment to be sure, now if only all the OTHER ships that are owned by magnitudes more backers that ALSO have this issue would have it solved.
