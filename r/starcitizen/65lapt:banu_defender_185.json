Are ship prices really confirmed to be directly correlated to their in-game value? \n\n\nWhat if all CIG is thinking when they are releasing a new concept is how many man hours it will take to finish it (and thus work out its total cost to implement) and doing some math to come up with a sale price that leaves them with some decent profit afterwards. \n\n\nRight now ship components seem to be pretty affordable to replace judging by aUEC prices, and replacing components will be incredibly common gameplay anyway, similar to gear upgrades in MMOs. \n\n\nFrom [reading around](http://starcitizen.wikia.com/wiki/Lifetime_Insurance), insurance, whether LTI or not, will replace hull and standard equipment in the event of destruction or theft. However much like real life they will put systems in place to make sure you can't game the system (fraud or otherwise). So your 300 dollar ship WILL be replaced for sure as long as it's insured, (which is indefinite for LTI) but any cool upgrades / non-standard issue gear will definitely be lost. (unless salvaged perhaps) \n\n\nRearming/ refueling, repairing damages and docking fees are not covered by it. So really LTI isn't all that huge of a bonus that you think it is, when everyone will have access to the same exact insurance, just that they will have to pay credits to renew it when it expires.
