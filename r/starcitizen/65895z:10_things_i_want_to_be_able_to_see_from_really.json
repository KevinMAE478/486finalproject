An Idris should not be able to hide, but I think the smaller ships should have the ability to have more expensive and harder to maintain drives/coolers/power supplies that allow them to be more stealthy. \n\n\n4.

An Idris should not be able to hide, but I think the smaller ships should have the ability to have more expensive and harder to maintain drives/coolers/power supplies that allow them to be more stealthy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but the owner of the ship should be able to turn them off.

Smaller, more streamlined ships should leave smaller streaks in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;#39;t know about this.
