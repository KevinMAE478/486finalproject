When someone is shooting at your teammate that is the absolute *safest* time to shoot that enemy. Their entire focus is on your teammate, so you need to use that and kill them. People who wait until their teammate is dead before doing anything are called baiters in Counter-Strike and they're hated by basically everyone.\n* For controls, low DPI is best but ultimately play with what you're comfortable with. I play at 450 DPI and would turn my sensitivity down in SC if I could.\n* If you changed your \"sensitivity\" in Star Marine, you need to change it back. That's a sensitivity curve which is completely different and very bad.\n* Don't let enemies get near you, during combat the game has clipping issues. The enemy can end up inside of you or the barrel of your gun inside of them, in both cases you can't hurt them.\n* You can still change weapons while sprinting as long as you jump, easiest when jumping down stairs. You can also swap and start sprinting again before the swap has finished.\n* EVA is basically suicide, use it for movement not combat. It's too hard to aim with how the character turns due to the thrusters. EVA sniping is viable if you remain in cover and far away, otherwise don't.\n* Avoid pushing up stairways into enemies, you're slowed down a lot when going up them.\n* Avoid stairways where your back is exposed to a position above you especially.\n* Do whatever /u/_Litauen is doing, he knows far too much.\n\nAlso, crouch spamming is the worst.

Assuming you don't have a tiny mousepad, a good general baseline is around 4-5 inches of mouse movement for 180 degrees in hipfire, and 8-12 inches for 180 degrees in aim down sight (can't currently set this separately in Star Marine).

Practice aiming for the head as much as possible. An easy way to start doing this for beginners is to aim at the upper chest and let recoil kick your weapon up to head height. A more advanced way to practice is to purposefully fire your first shot over the enemy's head, then pull down onto the head.
