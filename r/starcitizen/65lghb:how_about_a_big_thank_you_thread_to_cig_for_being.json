So the idea of it is you server a campaign, you fly missions, it's branching just like Wing Commander was and you have exactly that Wing Commander experience, with the added bonus of some multiplayer and your friends being able to co-op play with you as wing men when you fly your missions. But when you finish your tour of duty, you muster out and you're in the wide universe and then it's open world. You can go where you want, do what you want, choose who you wanna be. And the other thing that's nice about this is, you don't have to do Squadron 42, you can get into the Star Uni... you can basically decide you're never gonna go fight in the military. You can decide that I'm just gonna be a merchant, or I'm just gonna be a pirate.
