Example: A thruster overheats and shuts off during combat and needs a manual reset. The pilot will need to reduce the extremity of his/her maneuvers long enough to allow the engineer to leave their seat, repair the component, and return.

I think it would be intresting to have engineers be able to manage some ship damage from a seat and a computer, but some things could only be fixed by hand. These bigger issues would have to be carefully managed in combat between deciding to slow down to let your engineers temporarily try and fix say a broken thrust-er, and risking their death if you fly too fast while they repair. Engineers would still be very useful for say repairing ship damage once the combat is over in case you were partially or completely disabled during the fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "name": "t1_dg705cb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492079425.0, "created_utc": 1492050625.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2v94d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z4gi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6qlcx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Notoriousdyd", "parent_id": "t1_dg68fhs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcitizen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If by damage I'm sure you mean being turned into a greasy stain on the wall.
