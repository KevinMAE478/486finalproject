Despite contrary belief you actually can sprint over somewhere and fire extremely accurate shots immediately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the entire basis of 3 gun tournaments. You shoot with one, usually running through a field in sprints from firing position to firing position, then do the same with the other two guns. It&amp;#39;s doable because you&amp;#39;re trying to get the fastest times so the whole thing is short. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s hard is doing this over and over because it adds up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we get a good balance of being able to move and still take shots when gaining cover, but not be able to cod sprint around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe have a stamina system that gets worse performance over time. So the more missions you run and things you do the less your &amp;quot;stamina&amp;quot; will recover until you rest in a bed or when you eat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be s good way to make eating a thing too. Not something you have to do all the time but if you&amp;#39;re actively running missions on foot you might need to take a break and get some Benny&amp;#39;s at the nearest station or visit the kitchen on your ship. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "name": "t1_dg9cr87", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215771.0, "created_utc": 1492186971.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2v94d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b4e6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8xkz7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blablablablabla78", "parent_id": "t1_dg8wuuw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcitizen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yeah, let's hope it forces more tactical gameplay :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah, let&amp;#39;s hope it forces more tactical gameplay :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "name": "t1_dg8xkz7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492187778.0, "created_utc": 1492158978.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2v94d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b4e6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg97rbj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hepititusbathtub", "parent_id": "t1_dg8wuuw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcitizen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yeah i just hope its not too over exaggerated.  if it feels like you dont have control of your character people are not gonna like it but it does look really cool. the breathign system and suit punctures had me daydreaming scenarios instantly lol.

back.\n\nI'm sure none of you have caught on to this but they will share the 3.0 production schedule tonight, along with a description of its features by Chris in the newsletter.\n\nMoving on the report, they are showing great things with player interaction. First, they can highlight sub-objects instead of entire meshes which is useful in cockpits where you interact with buttons and switches. The placement system has come online to allow the player to choose [where and with what orientation](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=2m40s) to set down objects with a neat hologram visualization snapped to the surface you are looking at. If the surface is too far away, it automatically switches to a throw state where holding down the mouse button increases the force with a visual indicator. Rest assured, it's not a golf swing and order, justice and all that is good and right in the verse remains. Finally, they spent time making sure the new interaction system works seamlessly with the MFDs. This ties into their work to unify the way players interact with UI screens across the board in order to achieve user experience consistency. In grand CIG tradition, the same underlying system that is used to interact with an MFD will be applied to all terminals, wall-mounted displays and kiosks. This makes the interaction with such displays so much better and [from what they showed](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=4m15s), going into interaction mode and interacting with the cockpit is a much more fluid and integrated experience than before.\n\nSpeaking of UI, tons of work on it this month. Starting off with kiosks, work on the frontend skeleton framework for shopping has started. They are setting up all the UI components to be hooked up to the game's data to be displayed diegetically and it looks pretty good. But wait for the big one, it's really cool. The graphics team had been working on enabling render-to-texture in CryEngine for a while. RTT, or picture-in-picture, consists of [rendering a frame inside a texture and displaying it live in-game](https://youtu.be/4ddJ1OKV63Q?t=5m5s). It's used for things like mirrors and it's generally been a headache in modern engines. It seems that they are now coming through with it with a specific pipeline and restrictions that enable it to be used as a general solution finding a ton of uses, as [envisionned](https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/comment/7239867/#Comment_7239867). Back to UI, this new RTT tech will allow the UI to be rendered properly in the rendering pipeline.\n\nPreparing for that, the UI team has done a round of testing using the current helmet interiors to see how well the UI would render projected on a glass surface by using this tech. And it [looks amazing](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=4m41s). I've always been annoyed with how simple the UI looked for a sci-fi game. It was all rasterized vectors and felt limited by this tech, it failed to sell me the vision of this sci-fi world. I find that the new one is much better, much more stylish while retaining the same utility and being much better integrated into the game world. This goes a long way to make the game feel more polished. They are still checking for issues such as how well textures will read at various sizes and if there are any post-processing knock-on effects. Since the UI is literally projected on the helmet's glass they are also checking what kind of impact the new upcoming dynamic depth of field system might have on it. \n\nYes, you heard right. This last bit will make a lot of people happy, especially when using large displays or if prone to motion sickness. This [new depth of field system](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=5m8s) will allow to change the FoV while making sure that things such as the HUD and 3D helmet interior will remain roughly the same size on screen. This sounds and instantly looks like a smart way to go about it and it must have taken a fair bit of work to do, kudos to them.\n\nNow, they've showed their early work on new gameplay elements like suit punctures, oxygen recharging and depressurization. They've just started but it's [really cool](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=3m25s). They've also introduced the player status system. It introduces different actor states (normal, tired, hyperventilating, etc) incorporating and influenced by fatigue, breathing and stamina that might make actions like vaulting slower or impossible. The mass of the suit and weapons will also influence player stamina. They have created a breathing state component that brings together player status, procedural breathing player animation and sound. Work on breathing and stamina continues to be polished to achieve a solid look and feel.\n\nThe audio team has been involved with the Buccaneer, surface outposts, S42 levels and the actor status system. One very important thing they've mentioned is the continuation of their work on the audio propagation system. It makes audio respect walls, doors and paths. It's a pretty hard thing to do with acceptable performance depending on how many factors you consider and audio propagation is a thing you rarely ever see done at all in games. The system we have now just has audio triggers playing from their point of origin. They are either occluded or unoccluded and are always playing from their source position. This was physically incorrect and the new system works so that any sound playing inside a room will now appear to emit from the door, window or any other opening to anyone listening from the outside. This also extends to other rooms so a sound playing 4 rooms away will navigate the doorway and the area in-between in order to reach the listener. This is insanely cool and at a level of complexity I haven't seen in any game. I'm not sure even the battlefield games go that far. This will go a long way to push immersion and the care given to audio in this game is a rare thing that I admire.\n\nOn the tools front, the first and second pass on the mix management system has been completed. It is a virtual mixing console applied to areas or rooms allowing the creation of mix snapshots for  volume filters or effect settings for individual elements. It also factors in dataforge so they can be tweaked in real time. It makes adjustment of the audio mix much easier. Progress has also been made on the WordUp tool to manage the huge amount of spoken lines in the PU and S42.\n\nNow, Art! The concept team has been working on finishing the Gemini shotgun and a new ship weapon manufacturer, Preacher. On environments, they've continued structure work on the truck stop interiors, satellite interiors, Microtech New Babage and dressing for the modular habitation modules. They have been refining the surface outposts with technical engineering and habitation spaces coming together with their preliminary dressing pass. [They look awesome](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=7m5s) and the exteriors are now mostly complete. They're also looking into lighting variations to add more complex setups for lighting states in the procedural system. Light groups strike again. Greybox for the truck stop space station is continuing and all the building set pieces have been established, now in the detail phase. For satellites, the communication archetype is close to whitebox complete and all the modules and classifications specified by design have been visually explored.\n\nThe ship team continued work on the Hull-C and Reclaimer and included the new light controller (is that what light groups are called now?). I have to say, the light rendering and variations in mood and atmosphere the LGs create [are incredible](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=7m58s). There was also a preview of the Misc Razor and [it's looking sharp](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=8m40s).\n\n^^^^Don't ^^^^judge ^^^^me. ^^^^I ^^^^stayed ^^^^up ^^^^way ^^^^too ^^^^late ^^^^for ^^^^this.\n\nBig update from the VFX team this week. The Buccaneer is now flight ready, and the Connie Aquila is progressing on its flight-ready pass. The prospector has had its first pass and damage R&amp;D blockout. The new GPU-driven engine trails have had their initial implementation pass, [look damn slick](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=9m25s) and I now badly want a Homeworld game made in this engine. For weapon VFXs, they improved their style guide and built a new system helping define the visual style of a weapon based on manufacturer and energy type. They have also rolled out their layered impact library, allowing them to layer up individual elements which gives them more flexibility and incurs less maintenance.\n\nThe animation team has been working on a lot of previz and tech groundwork. They improved the functionality of shouldered weapon states to get the railgun ready for 3.0 as well as polishing the functionality of the prone stance to get it ready for code to clean up any edge case.  The no-weapon jumps are getting a pass to bring the animation in-line with the mocap instead of the technical first-pass implementation. Finally, there's been lots of improvements on weapon loads on the Devastator, Railgun, and new pistol.\n\nMeanwhile the Derby studio has continued with facial animation for S42 cinematics. They attended the facial shoot for 3.0 and met the team in LA for some R&amp;D meetings. This should really help speed up the production of the huge dialogue needs for both S42 and PU.\n\nNow, \\**cough*\\*\n\n[HOLY. FUCK. THE. JAVELIN](https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=12m21s). Watch it. That's all. \n\nTheir work speaks for itself and it is absolutely masterful. This is incredible craftsmanship and I cannot imagine how it will feel to be standing in one of these colossal ships and knowing that it is functional at the same insane level of detail and intricacy as the fighters we know. You can also hear the S42 theme throughout the later parts of the segment and the effect combined with the visuals is just incredible. \n\nThat game is going to be something.\n", "edited": 1492189932.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaand the monster reports are back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure none of you have caught on to this but they will share the 3.0 production schedule tonight, along with a description of its features by Chris in the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving on the report, they are showing great things with player interaction. First, they can highlight sub-objects instead of entire meshes which is useful in cockpits where you interact with buttons and switches. The placement system has come online to allow the player to choose &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=2m40s\"&gt;where and with what orientation&lt;/a&gt; to set down objects with a neat hologram visualization snapped to the surface you are looking at. If the surface is too far away, it automatically switches to a throw state where holding down the mouse button increases the force with a visual indicator. Rest assured, it&amp;#39;s not a golf swing and order, justice and all that is good and right in the verse remains. Finally, they spent time making sure the new interaction system works seamlessly with the MFDs. This ties into their work to unify the way players interact with UI screens across the board in order to achieve user experience consistency. In grand CIG tradition, the same underlying system that is used to interact with an MFD will be applied to all terminals, wall-mounted displays and kiosks. This makes the interaction with such displays so much better and &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=4m15s\"&gt;from what they showed&lt;/a&gt;, going into interaction mode and interacting with the cockpit is a much more fluid and integrated experience than before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of UI, tons of work on it this month. Starting off with kiosks, work on the frontend skeleton framework for shopping has started. They are setting up all the UI components to be hooked up to the game&amp;#39;s data to be displayed diegetically and it looks pretty good. But wait for the big one, it&amp;#39;s really cool. The graphics team had been working on enabling render-to-texture in CryEngine for a while. RTT, or picture-in-picture, consists of &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/4ddJ1OKV63Q?t=5m5s\"&gt;rendering a frame inside a texture and displaying it live in-game&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s used for things like mirrors and it&amp;#39;s generally been a headache in modern engines. It seems that they are now coming through with it with a specific pipeline and restrictions that enable it to be used as a general solution finding a ton of uses, as &lt;a href=\"https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/comment/7239867/#Comment_7239867\"&gt;envisionned&lt;/a&gt;. Back to UI, this new RTT tech will allow the UI to be rendered properly in the rendering pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preparing for that, the UI team has done a round of testing using the current helmet interiors to see how well the UI would render projected on a glass surface by using this tech. And it &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=4m41s\"&gt;looks amazing&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve always been annoyed with how simple the UI looked for a sci-fi game. It was all rasterized vectors and felt limited by this tech, it failed to sell me the vision of this sci-fi world. I find that the new one is much better, much more stylish while retaining the same utility and being much better integrated into the game world. This goes a long way to make the game feel more polished. They are still checking for issues such as how well textures will read at various sizes and if there are any post-processing knock-on effects. Since the UI is literally projected on the helmet&amp;#39;s glass they are also checking what kind of impact the new upcoming dynamic depth of field system might have on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you heard right. This last bit will make a lot of people happy, especially when using large displays or if prone to motion sickness. This &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=5m8s\"&gt;new depth of field system&lt;/a&gt; will allow to change the FoV while making sure that things such as the HUD and 3D helmet interior will remain roughly the same size on screen. This sounds and instantly looks like a smart way to go about it and it must have taken a fair bit of work to do, kudos to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, they&amp;#39;ve showed their early work on new gameplay elements like suit punctures, oxygen recharging and depressurization. They&amp;#39;ve just started but it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=3m25s\"&gt;really cool&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#39;ve also introduced the player status system. It introduces different actor states (normal, tired, hyperventilating, etc) incorporating and influenced by fatigue, breathing and stamina that might make actions like vaulting slower or impossible. The mass of the suit and weapons will also influence player stamina. They have created a breathing state component that brings together player status, procedural breathing player animation and sound. Work on breathing and stamina continues to be polished to achieve a solid look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The audio team has been involved with the Buccaneer, surface outposts, S42 levels and the actor status system. One very important thing they&amp;#39;ve mentioned is the continuation of their work on the audio propagation system. It makes audio respect walls, doors and paths. It&amp;#39;s a pretty hard thing to do with acceptable performance depending on how many factors you consider and audio propagation is a thing you rarely ever see done at all in games. The system we have now just has audio triggers playing from their point of origin. They are either occluded or unoccluded and are always playing from their source position. This was physically incorrect and the new system works so that any sound playing inside a room will now appear to emit from the door, window or any other opening to anyone listening from the outside. This also extends to other rooms so a sound playing 4 rooms away will navigate the doorway and the area in-between in order to reach the listener. This is insanely cool and at a level of complexity I haven&amp;#39;t seen in any game. I&amp;#39;m not sure even the battlefield games go that far. This will go a long way to push immersion and the care given to audio in this game is a rare thing that I admire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the tools front, the first and second pass on the mix management system has been completed. It is a virtual mixing console applied to areas or rooms allowing the creation of mix snapshots for  volume filters or effect settings for individual elements. It also factors in dataforge so they can be tweaked in real time. It makes adjustment of the audio mix much easier. Progress has also been made on the WordUp tool to manage the huge amount of spoken lines in the PU and S42.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, Art! The concept team has been working on finishing the Gemini shotgun and a new ship weapon manufacturer, Preacher. On environments, they&amp;#39;ve continued structure work on the truck stop interiors, satellite interiors, Microtech New Babage and dressing for the modular habitation modules. They have been refining the surface outposts with technical engineering and habitation spaces coming together with their preliminary dressing pass. &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dqv78x5ZEwE?t=7m5s\"&gt;They look awesome&lt;/a&gt; and the exteriors are now mostly complete. They&amp;#39;re also looking into lighting variations to add more complex setups for lighting states in the procedural system. Light groups strike again.
