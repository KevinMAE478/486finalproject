This is crucial, and why turret gunning should remain more focused, snipey, and skill based, even with the OP's suggestion implemented as he describes. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor example, let's say a Polaris despite all its impressive bristling turrets is facing an onslaught by a few fighters and a couple Retaliators: now, the Talis are designed to punch above their weight with torpedoes and are far more nimble than a Polaris, meaning they could potentially swoop in at an odd angle to the Capital target and unload their torps and be off to recharge shields and reload another torp volley before the Polaris can aim its own far bigger and deadlier (size 10 I believe?) torps at the Talis and kill them before they can strike. This mean the Polaris needs to rely on its turrets, which, operated by skilled gunners are still powerful enough to possibly deter them... but not if they have all essentially been \"shotgunized\". Thus in this scenario the Polaris' defense would have to rely on more accurate and deadlier fire point-for-point on a targeting grid, focused on a single incoming target, in order to either disable the Tali, significantly damage it, take down its shields, or otherwise deter it from making a full attack run before its own integrity was depleted forcing a retreat or at least abort of an attack run. For that you simply need concentrated, sniper-style turret mechanics, not diluted spread out damage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Oops I meant to reply to u/B4ckBOne not the OP.", "edited": 1492405409.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the OP is indeed on to something, but right away I detect a couple problems with your addition to it though, respectfully: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, is it doesn&amp;#39;t require as much skill that way- if you make every turret more like a &lt;em&gt;shotgun&lt;/em&gt; by increasing spread and decreasing damage per bullet, even with increased rate, you drastically lower the chance/reward/need for anybody to become an expert &lt;em&gt;sniper&lt;/em&gt; turret gunner, which seems to go against the entire SC ethos of making every game niche a skill-based specialization that becomes all the more valuable to the player possessing the skill the better it gets, as well as to employers hiring said player even though they have to pay more the better the gunner, hypothetically, as opposed to a more arcadey design where &amp;quot;every player can be the hero gunner&amp;quot; because its just a fast, loose, averaged-out shotgun kind of turret style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, and this is less meta-focused and more technical per the actual gunning in action, but the problem with &amp;quot;shotgun-style&amp;quot; turrets is DPS (damage per second) potential: with a wide spread, again even with increased rate of fire, you are more likely to hit &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; target, thus perhaps ensuring a takedown or critical damage against enemy ships/fighters over a longer period of time, but it drastically reduces the ability and potential to &lt;em&gt;take down a single especially dangerous target far faster&lt;/em&gt;. This is crucial, and why turret gunning should remain more focused, snipey, and skill based, even with the OP&amp;#39;s suggestion implemented as he describes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, let&amp;#39;s say a Polaris despite all its impressive bristling turrets is facing an onslaught by a few fighters and a couple Retaliators: now, the Talis are designed to punch above their weight with torpedoes and are far more nimble than a Polaris, meaning they could potentially swoop in at an odd angle to the Capital target and unload their torps and be off to recharge shields and reload another torp volley before the Polaris can aim its own far bigger and deadlier (size 10 I believe?) torps at the Talis and kill them before they can strike. This mean the Polaris needs to rely on its turrets, which, operated by skilled gunners are still powerful enough to possibly deter them... but not if they have all essentially been &amp;quot;shotgunized&amp;quot;. Thus in this scenario the Polaris&amp;#39; defense would have to rely on more accurate and deadlier fire point-for-point on a targeting grid, focused on a single incoming target, in order to either disable the Tali, significantly damage it, take down its shields, or otherwise deter it from making a full attack run before its own integrity was depleted forcing a retreat or at least abort of an attack run.
