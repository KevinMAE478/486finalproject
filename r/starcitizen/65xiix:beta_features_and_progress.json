We are drawing a somewhat arbitrary line around features that would be enough to kick off the SC Persistent Universe. Some features that are not absolutely necessary are also included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now in 2.6.3 and with the 3.0 schedule released, let&amp;#39;s see where we will stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Major Technical Systems&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;10+player per instance netcode&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although the server can hold 24, it&amp;#39;s a major lagfest. To really feel like an MMO, SC will need 50+ people in an instance. I&amp;#39;ve been optimistically hoping for 100+ (so that we can have viable fleet combat), and we&amp;#39;ve even heard CR throw out larger numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new schedule includes two major features for 3.0 and several others later on that would hopefully move us towards this goal:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-22&lt;/strong&gt; New Message Queue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-29&lt;/strong&gt; Entity Owner Manager&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-31&lt;/strong&gt; Entity Update Component Scheduler&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-31&lt;/strong&gt; Network Tokens&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-07-26&lt;/strong&gt; Network Bind/Unbind&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-09-04&lt;/strong&gt; Jobification of Network Writes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-09-13&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous Serialized Variables&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Single universe server w/ dynamic instancing&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the PU is separated into separate servers with a 24-player cap. The ultimate plan is to have one PU server that will dynamically load players into local instances. Although persistence is included, instancing is notably absent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-26&lt;/strong&gt; Persistent Damage, Ammo, and Missiles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-29&lt;/strong&gt; Game Persistence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-07-04&lt;/strong&gt; Repair and Restock system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;hangar-universe interaction&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ie, how to get a ship from your hangar into the universe.

AI will be needed to fill those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-08&lt;/strong&gt; AI Turrets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-09-11&lt;/strong&gt; NPC Generation (Archetype)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1&lt;/strong&gt; AI Locomotion&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;NPC conversation system + wingman orders&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Delta patching&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Downloading 30GB+ every month is prohibitive for many players and very expensive for CIG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Procedurally Generated Planets&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-04-03&lt;/strong&gt; Planetary Tech&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Planetary landing + atmospheric flight&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-04-03&lt;/strong&gt; Planetary Tech&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-05&lt;/strong&gt; Atmospheric Entry Gamecode&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-05&lt;/strong&gt; Atmospheric Entry Graphics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;instanced planetary landing (for cities)&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, this was the only landing... now, it&amp;#39;s almost an add-on to PG moons and landing.

Tony Z has often discussed missions being generated based on the economy and econ nodes, but even a basic system to create a variety of missions separate from that would still be good enough for a first iteration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-12&lt;/strong&gt; Mission Givers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-12&lt;/strong&gt; Solar System Mission Service&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-16&lt;/strong&gt; Mission Manager App&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-05-31&lt;/strong&gt; Mission System&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-06-01&lt;/strong&gt; Mission Board App&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-08-11&lt;/strong&gt; Recovery Missions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-08-21&lt;/strong&gt; Piracy Missions v1&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-08-22&lt;/strong&gt; Service Beacons v1&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-09-25&lt;/strong&gt; Patrol Mission v1&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-10-02&lt;/strong&gt; Assassination Missions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-10-16&lt;/strong&gt; Piracy Missions v2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-10-25&lt;/strong&gt; Transport Mission&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-11-10&lt;/strong&gt; Service Beacon v2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-11-13&lt;/strong&gt; Smuggling Missions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-11-20&lt;/strong&gt; Defense Missions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-12-22&lt;/strong&gt; Patrol Mission v2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Public Transportation System&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to get around the universe without a ship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Ship rentals (for people that lose their ship)&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;Remote Storage&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tony Z has talked about this... buying something at a console and having it show up in your hangar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h5&gt;multi-faction reputation system&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would enable you to track your standing with the factions in the SC universe. Right now, we only have &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;.

I do maintain, however, that we should see at least 1 playable demo this year (probably the SF search mission)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-11-30&lt;/strong&gt; Save Game (I suspect for single player??)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017-12-19&lt;/strong&gt; Landing Gear Compression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind how little of this was even on the radar in 2.4, it&amp;#39;s amazing how close it ended up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WIP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "About a year ago, pre-schedule reports, I compiled and organized [all major features](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/4jxpgx/cleanedup_list_of_features_needed_between_24_and/) that were needed between 2.4 and whatever the initial SC beta would look like -- at the time, assuming the SC beta would look kind of like the initial pitch and did not include things like procedural planets. \n\nKeep in mind that the traditional definition of \"beta\" -- a feature complete game with bugs and tuning to be worked out -- doesn't really apply to the modern day MMO, since they will continuously add features. We are drawing a somewhat arbitrary line around features that would be enough to kick off the SC Persistent Universe. Some features that are not absolutely necessary are also included.\n\nNow in 2.6.3 and with the 3.0 schedule released, let's see where we will stand.\n\n### Major Technical Systems\n\n##### 10+player per instance netcode\n\nAlthough the server can hold 24, it's a major lagfest. To really feel like an MMO, SC will need 50+ people in an instance. I've been optimistically hoping for 100+ (so that we can have viable fleet combat), and we've even heard CR throw out larger numbers.\n\nThe new schedule includes two major features for 3.0 and several others later on that would hopefully move us towards this goal:\n\n- **2017-05-22** New Message Queue\n- **2017-05-29** Entity Owner Manager\n- **2017-05-31** Entity Update Component Scheduler\n- **2017-05-31** Network Tokens\n- **2017-07-26** Network Bind/Unbind\n- **2017-09-04** Jobification of Network Writes\n- **2017-09-13** Continuous Serialized Variables\n\n##### Single universe server w/ dynamic instancing\n\nAt the moment, the PU is separated into separate servers with a 24-player cap. The ultimate plan is to have one PU server that will dynamically load players into local instances. Although persistence is included, instancing is notably absent.\n\n- **2017-05-26** Persistent Damage, Ammo, and Missiles\n- **2017-05-29** Game Persistence\n- **2017-07-04** Repair and Restock system\n\n##### hangar-universe interaction\n\nie, how to get a ship from your hangar into the universe. This may be hidden between-the-lines in the report, but I don't see it clearly.\n\n##### push/pull/Grabby Hands\n\nNeeded for things like stealing cargo and nice to have for cargo in general.\n\n- **2017-05-24** Pick Up &amp; Carry\n\n##### NPC AI, including FPS, crew, traders, miners, etc\n\nThe universe needs NPC guards, targets, traders, bad guys etc. And let's face it: the vast majority of crew slots will be filled by NPCs. AI will be needed to fill those jobs.\n\n- **2017-05-08** AI Turrets\n- **2017-09-11** NPC Generation (Archetype)\n- **3.1** AI Locomotion\n\n\n\n##### NPC conversation system + wingman orders\n\n##### Delta patching\n\nDownloading 30GB+ every month is prohibitive for many players and very expensive for CIG.\n\n##### Procedurally Generated Planets\n\n- **2017-04-03** Planetary Tech\n\n##### Planetary landing + atmospheric flight\n\n- **2017-04-03** Planetary Tech\n- **2017-05-05** Atmospheric Entry Gamecode\n- **2017-05-05** Atmospheric Entry Graphics\n\n##### instanced planetary landing (for cities)\n\nInitially, this was the only landing... now, it's almost an add-on to PG moons and landing. But there will need to be a modified or different system for landing in cities and landing zones.\n\n- landing and atmo stuff included in Planetary Landing section above\n- **2017-06-01** Delmar / Levski\n- **2017-06-20** Arc Corp / Area 18\n- **2017-09-19** Crusader\n- **2017-11-24** Hurston\n- **2018-02-14** Mircotech\n\n### General Universe Systems\n\n##### Galactic Economic Simulation + Economic nodes\n\n- Truckstop (undated, 3.1)\n- **2017-04-21** Solar System Shop Service\n- **2017-05-12** Solar System Mission Service\n\n##### Mission/Job Generation\n\nAlthough the PU since 2.0 has had a handful of simplistic missions, they are not nearly enough to sustain a real game, which is what the beta should be approaching. Tony Z has often discussed missions being generated based on the economy and econ nodes, but even a basic system to create a variety of missions separate from that would still be good enough for a first iteration.\n\n- **2017-05-12** Mission Givers\n- **2017-05-12** Solar System Mission Service\n- **2017-05-16** Mission Manager App\n- **2017-05-31** Mission System\n- **2017-06-01** Mission Board App\n- **2017-08-11** Recovery Missions\n- **2017-08-21** Piracy Missions v1\n- **2017-08-22** Service Beacons v1\n- **2017-09-25** Patrol Mission v1\n- **2017-10-02** Assassination Missions\n- **2017-10-16** Piracy Missions v2\n- **2017-10-25** Transport Mission\n- **2017-11-10** Service Beacon v2\n- **2017-11-13** Smuggling Missions\n- **2017-11-20** Defense Missions\n- **2017-12-22** Patrol Mission v2\n\n\n##### Public Transportation System\n\nHow to get around the universe without a ship.\n\n##### Ship rentals (for people that lose their ship)\n\n##### Remote Storage\n\nTony Z has talked about this... buying something at a console and having it show up in your hangar.\n\n##### multi-faction reputation system\n\nThis would enable you to track your standing with the factions in the SC universe. Right now, we only have \"good\" and \"bad\". So far, nothing more has made into the schedule.\n\n- **2017-08-19** Criminality System\n\n##### Traditional MMO grouping/party system\n\nMMOs enable players to play together via grouping or parties -- players can easily see each other and complete group tasks. This also enabled them to share rewards and targets.\n\n- **2017-09-12** Parties &amp; Groups\n\n##### Org-Web site integration\n\nLong the promise of Org 2.0, this feature would allow things done via the website to translate into the game.\n\n- **2017-07-28** In Game Chat to use Spectrum\n- **2017-08-30** Spectrum Integration In Game\n\n##### Org management/visibility\n\nWho is online, ranks, etc. Kind of like an updated Friends List but with Org features. Not mentioned, but probably related to Spectrum Integration.\n\n- **2017-08-30** Spectrum Integration In Game\n\n##### Org hangars\n\nNot really *needed* for the beta, but no mention in any case.\n\n##### Player to player trading\n\nIt's going to be odd if we can only trade with NPCs.\n\n- **2017-06-01** Inventory System Gamecode Engineering\n- **2017-06-02** Inventory System UI\n\n##### Black Market system\n\nIs this item stolen or illegal?\n\n- **2017-11-13** Smuggling Missions\n\n##### Navigation\n\nCharting courses and not just a single QD.\n\n- **2017-05-12** StarMap App\n\n##### Jump Point Navigation\n\nNo mention.\n\n##### Interdiction\n\nNo explicit mention, but I can't see how piracy works at all without it.\n\n- **2017-08-21** Piracy Missions v1\n- **2017-10-16** Piracy Missions v2\n\n##### Contracting System (Give money to other players for jobs like escorting)\n\n- **2017-08-22** Service Beacon v1\n- **2017-11-10** Service Beacon v2\n\n\n### Player Roles and Role Mechanics\n\n##### cargo hauling\n\nThis is probably the main economic job and is a crucial aspect of the game. It enables the economy to function, pirates to have something to do, and something for good-guy fighters to protect.\n\n- **2017-06-01** Cargo Manifest App\n- **2017-06-01** Cargo UI\n- **2017-06-02** Cargo Gamecode Engineering\n- **2016-06-12** UI Owner Component\n- **2017-10-19** Cargo v2\n\n\n##### Passenger Transport\n\nFerrying around NPCs as a job (different than just cargo).\n\n##### Rescue/Recovery System\n\nThere may be \n\n##### Salvage\n\nThere are two conceivable types of salvage: \n\n1. taking out individual parts from a ship\n2. crunching up a ship or parts of a ship into scrap. \n\nBoth likely involve scanning. We have parts of the former mostly planned for in the schedule. For the latter, we need dedicated salvage ships and new mechanics.\n\n- **2017-05-26** Derelict Ships\n- **2017-07-28** Scanner Improvements v2\n\n##### Mining\n\nAlthough not listed, this is apparently on the schedule; just not public.\n\n##### Fuel collection\n\nIdeally we would expect to see this around ship-to-ship refueling, but not listed.\n\n##### Bounty Hunting + Prisoner system\n\nAlthough not listed, the bounty aspect (probably just killing) was supposed to be in 3.0 or 3.1, but is no longer listed.\n\n##### Cartography/Jump Point Mapping\n\nBasic Exploration output.\n\n##### Medical  \n##### Science/Research  \n##### Information running\n\n##### Smuggling/Cargo scanning\n\nIn order to smuggle, you need:\n\n1. sell-able goods in the game\n2. the ability to label goods as illicit\n3. somewhere to acquire illicit goods\n4. somewhere to sell illicit goods\n5. a way for the authorities to find your illicit goods.\n\n- **2017-05-04** Kiosk UI\n- **2017-06-15** Shopping v2\n- **2017-07-28** Scanner Improvements v2\n\n##### player-controlled external repair  \n##### Space Station Control (MVP++)  \n##### Racing Circuits/League (MVP++)  \n\n### Ships and Ship Systems\n##### Purchasing ships/ship components with ingame currency\n\nMay be part of shopping.\n\n##### Ship/component/cargo insurance\n\n- **2017-05-05** Insurance\n\n##### Ship docking + carrier mechanics  \n##### multicrew station control / role assignments\n\nMay be part of item 2.0, but this is the ability to give roles to seats.\n\n##### Several multicrew station roles, like sensors, CNC, engineering\n\nSeveral concepts, like radar + turret control, are in SC right now, but only in their most basic form.\n\n- **2017-05-05** Item 2.0 Power Supply/Pipes\n- **2017-05-05** Item 2.0 Radar System\n- **2017-05-11** Item 2.0 Operator Seats\n- **2017-06-08** Player Manned Turrets\n- **2017-08-04** Shield Rework\n- **2017-09-13** Radar\n- **3.2** Item Inspection\n\n##### Panel Access to Components/Internal Repair\n\n- **2017-07-03** Interaction System\n- **2017-07-17** Interaction -- Attach\n- **2017-06-20** Ship Damage\n- **2017-09-08** Ship Breaking\n\n##### Component Tweaking/Tuning/Overclocking/Testing (MVP++)  \n\n##### ship locking / access control\n\nThis is often a major complaint of more casual players: \"someone stole my ship off the landing pad\"! For early access, this is certainly annoying. For a beta, it would be ridiculous.\n\n- **2017-10-24** Security/Access Control\n\n##### Ship hacking / forced boarding / component disabling\n\nPirates will need to gain access to a ship to steal it or its cargo. Otherwise, it's not really piracy.\n\n- **2017-05-31** Doors &amp; Airlocks\n- **2017-07-05** Item 2.0 Airlocks v2\n- **2017-09-18** Breaching\n- **2017-10-24** Security/Access Control\n\n##### CPU Resource System\n\nCPU is a pipe just like cooling and power. It does appear to be in-game in a limited form.\n\n##### Electronic Warfare  \n\nSpoofing, jamming, debuff stuff (there was a design post on it)\n\n##### Ship to ship refueling\n\nFuel is a base collectible resource that also is necessary for ship operation.\n\n- **2017-04-12** Item 2.0 Fuel\n- **2017-12-01** Ship to Ship Refuel System\n\n##### Escape Pods/Attached Vehicles\n\nMostly for larger ships. Includes things like the Merlin.\n\n\n\n### Characters and NPCs\n\n##### Injury system with mobility effects\n\n- **2017-05-31** Stamina\n- **2017-08-07** Take down\n- **2017-09-07** Bumps\n- **2017-08-10** Knockdown and Knockbacks\n\n##### FPS cover/recovery  \n##### Death system (I actually think character death can be MVP++)\n\n##### Character Creation/Customization\n\n- **2017-05-31** Character Customization\n\n##### Female character model\n\n- **2017-07-03** Female Player Locomotion\n\n##### Lots of NPCs\n\n- **2017-09-11** NPC Generation (Archetype)\n\n### Assets\n\n##### Landing Zones + Shops\n\n- **2017-06-01** Delmar / Levski\n- **2017-06-20** Arc Corp / Area 18\n- **2017-09-19** Crusader\n- **2017-11-24** Hurston\n- **2018-02-14** Mircotech\n\n##### Planets / moons / planetoids / asteroids\n\nThis will never end, but we apparently have 3 new moons in 3.0.\n\n- **2017-04-07** Moons\n\n##### Star Systems\n\nSC will have over 100 star systems. We currently have about .25.\n\n- **2017-05-31** Solar System Tool\n\n##### Missions\n\nThis is more about custom missions and not procedurally-generated ones from the econ simulator. For example, the Covalex PI mission.\n\n##### Clothes/Accessories\n\nHeavy Marine Armor and Explorer Suit Armor are in 3.0. Presumably, this will never end, but we are basically good enough for a Beta (it's not super important).\n\n##### Ships for ship-limited roles (mining, recovery, etc)\n\n- **2017-05-05** MISC Prospector (mining)\n- **2017-08-10** MISC Hull C (external cargo)\n- **2017-09-06** Reclaimer (salvage)\n\n##### Capital ships\n\nThe Idris and Javelin are both nearly completed, if not done. We heard from CR that the Iris would be in-game as soon as the instance could handle at least two without problems.\n\n##### Vanduul + Xi'an\n\nI expect to get these with SQ42. We have seen progress on the Vanduul, and Xi'an will probably come soon enough.\n\n\n### Extras/fluff/flavor\n\n##### Planetary Exploration/Surface Combat\n\nOk, this became much more important to CIG over the last year.
