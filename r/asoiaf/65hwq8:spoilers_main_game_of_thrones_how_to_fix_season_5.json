I think it's fair to say we're all on the same team, we all love the story, we just want the best adaption possible. Shouldn't we all? Criticizing it shows love in my opinion.\n\nTo point 1:\n\nI'm not sure anyone has made the claim they're the same people, and in regards to the audiences, I'm not sure I agree. Everyone is here to see the story GRRM wrote, some just prefer it in a visual medium. There are a lot of bandwagon fans now that the show is so popular simply because people don't want to be left out, but the people who truly care about the story are here to see the adaption of GRRM's book, not D&amp;D's take on it. The first few seasons where the show was a much closer 1:1 adaptation were better as a whole than later. If they had the budget that the later seasons did I think this would probably solidify the case even more. With the small budget that they had they did a tremendous job on the show those first few seasons.\n\nTo point 2:\n\nI don't think anyone believes this not to be the case, the problem is people should be able to voice their opinions in both cases. This let's not talk badly about the show/book is far more obnoxious to me than any criticism given to either.\n\nTo point 3:\n\nNobody is expecting perfection, but why you wouldn't want it to strive to be as close to as possible is beyond me. It's a cop-out excuse that would leave shows and books unreadable if people weren't striving for it. Again though, I haven't seen anyone say they wanted perfection, you and others seem to interpret having high expectations for something they care a lot about as expecting perfection and anything less will not do, and that is simply not the case.\n\nI think what bothers me the most is the book vs show apologists arguing about criticisms themselves. Yes they're both different, but I don't think it's an issue discussing how to make both better. It's possible to love both, and think both can be improved. People need to stop trying to shut everyone up that doesn't agree with their view(s) of either. Criticizing the show isn't going to get it canceled, and it shouldn't ruin your enjoyment if you disagree, to expect others --who are probably more invested in the world and story-- to keep their traps shut is pretty childish IMO.", "edited": 1492403696.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly I want to say I feel like this has something to do with people criticizing something they enjoy.

Criticizing it shows love in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To point 1:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure anyone has made the claim they&amp;#39;re the same people, and in regards to the audiences, I&amp;#39;m not sure I agree. Everyone is here to see the story GRRM wrote, some just prefer it in a visual medium. There are a lot of bandwagon fans now that the show is so popular simply because people don&amp;#39;t want to be left out, but the people who truly care about the story are here to see the adaption of GRRM&amp;#39;s book, not D&amp;amp;D&amp;#39;s take on it. The first few seasons where the show was a much closer 1:1 adaptation were better as a whole than later. If they had the budget that the later seasons did I think this would probably solidify the case even more. With the small budget that they had they did a tremendous job on the show those first few seasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To point 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone believes this not to be the case, the problem is people should be able to voice their opinions in both cases. This let&amp;#39;s not talk badly about the show/book is far more obnoxious to me than any criticism given to either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To point 3:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody is expecting perfection, but why you wouldn&amp;#39;t want it to strive to be as close to as possible is beyond me. It&amp;#39;s a cop-out excuse that would leave shows and books unreadable if people weren&amp;#39;t striving for it. Again though, I haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone say they wanted perfection, you and others seem to interpret having high expectations for something they care a lot about as expecting perfection and anything less will not do, and that is simply not the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think what bothers me the most is the book vs show apologists arguing about criticisms themselves. Yes they&amp;#39;re both different, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s an issue discussing how to make both better. It&amp;#39;s possible to love both, and think both can be improved. People need to stop trying to shut everyone up that doesn&amp;#39;t agree with their view(s) of either. Criticizing the show isn&amp;#39;t going to get it canceled, and it shouldn&amp;#39;t ruin your enjoyment if you disagree, to expect others --who are probably more invested in the world and story-- to keep their traps shut is pretty childish IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dgb3zly", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315969.0, "created_utc": 1492287169.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hwq8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaxu15", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bojangles1987", "parent_id": "t1_dgaud7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's wrong with season 5 isn't about the books.

She's written to be a sympathetic character in opposition to Cersei (who is ironically also written as more sympathetic than her book version) - I think S6 demonstrates this intention well enough on its own. Yet she stat-rapes a teenager (Tommen is so hopefully naive and inexperienced he can't possibly be considered an adult) and *brags about it to his mother*.

Ramsay\u2019s cruelty isn\u2019t exactly a secret. He hasn\u2019t exactly kept it quiet. Keep in mind that Littlefinger should be well aware of the problems a cruel husband can pose in a marriage alliance, since not all that long ago he was spreading rumours about Joffrey\u2019s cruelty in order to kick off his plot with the Tyrells. It\u2019s not that Littlefinger would never hurt Sansa, it\u2019s that Sansa is far too valuable for him to throw away on Ramsay.\n\n&gt; Then there\u2019s the fact that a match between Sansa and Ramsay does nothing for Littlefinger. It does not solidify his position in the Vale. It does not advance his agenda in the North (assuming that agenda is ultimately Queen Sansa). At best it helps him splinter the Lannister coalition, but he sacrifices Sansa to do so, and he doesn\u2019t need to throw away Sansa to encourage Lannister self-destruction.

This is ridiculous on its face. There is no good plot reason for Sansa to be here, and many, many good plot reasons for her not to be here. There is just the one reason: the showrunners wanted to write Ramsay raping and tormenting a major female character, and they believed Sansa\u2019s plot was otherwise unoccupied with activities of substance and could improve with a bit of rape-and-revenge.\n\n&gt; If Littlefinger is right, and Stannis wins, he rescues Sansa from the most hated family in the North\u2026and the man who sold her to them. A Stannis-backed Sansa regime is a bad outcome for Littlefinger, and not an outcome worth sacrificing all the paths to a Littlefinger-backed Sansa regime.\n\n&gt; And the problem with the theory that Sansa could take Ramsay and make him hers, aside from the fact that Littlefinger still hasn\u2019t done his research, is that Sansa\u2019s issue with the Boltons is that they killed her family and usurped their place! No matter how \u201chers\u201d Ramsay is in private, it\u2019s still his name with her family\u2019s titles attached, and her name being used to legitimise his family\u2019s murder and usurpation of her family!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If Margaery &amp;#39;rapes&amp;#39; a teenager(which she doesn&amp;#39;t because it was consensual) then she&amp;#39;s not supposed to be a sympathetic character.
