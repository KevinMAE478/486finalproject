Take and read.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting in &lt;em&gt;A Feast for Crows&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em&gt;, GRRM has started to bring the disparate threads of his storyline together. Where Martin has talked about how he intended for the first book to resemble &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; in having most of his characters begin at Winterfell and then spread out across the world, the 4th and 5th books of the series have begun the process of bringing the threads back together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt;, Martin further intends to start bringing the threads back together. In a 2012 interview, GRRM stated:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of the POVs will be returning: \u201cAll the characters [are in the book],\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019m going to start pulling the threads back together in this one, I hope.\u201d \u2013 &lt;a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694594/game-of-thrones-season-three-george-rr-martin-richard-madden.jhtml\"&gt;MTV interview, 10/2/2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this means precisely has yet to be seen, however, we can make estimated guesses on how Martin will bring the threads back together and how he\u2019ll weave the characters, their plots and their struggles into a narrative that will likely center everything in several geographical plot gravity wells in 4 major locations:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meereen&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Winterfell&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;King\u2019s Landing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Volantis&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this analysis, I\u2019d like to explore the intersections at these geographic areas, how they likely impact the writing speed and processes that GRRM experiences in writing TWOW and the myriad plots that are, will or might occur in these places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Meereense Knot, Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;George RR Martin stated numerous times that the biggest hurdle in writing &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em&gt; was something he termed the &amp;quot;Meereenese Knot.&amp;quot; Essentially, this was a writing problem derived from numerous characters and events revolving around Daenerys Targaryen and Meereen. For the longest time, GRRM was vague about what exactly the Meereenese Knot was, but in 2012, he opened up about it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how the &amp;quot;Meereenese knot&amp;quot; played out, what was the problem with this? For example, was it the order in which Dany met various characters, or who, when, and how someone would try to take the dragons?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; Now I can explain things. It was a confluence of many, many factors: lets start with the offer from Xaro to give Dany ships, the refusal of which then leads to Qarth&amp;#39;s declaration of war. Then there&amp;#39;s the marriage of Daenerys to pacify the city. Then there&amp;#39;s the arrival of the Yunkish army at the gates of Meereen, there&amp;#39;s the order of arrival of various people going her way (Tyrion, Quentyn, Victarion, Aegon, Marwyn, etc.), and then there&amp;#39;s Daario, this dangerous sellsword and the question of whether Dany really wants him or not, there&amp;#39;s hte plague, there&amp;#39;s Drogon&amp;#39;s return to Meereen...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these things were balls I had thrown up into the air, and they&amp;#39;re all linked and chronologically entwined. The return of Drogon to the city was something I explored as happening at different times. For example, I wrote three different versions of Quentyn&amp;#39;s arrival at Meereen: one where he arrived long before Dany&amp;#39;s marriage, one where he arrived much later, and one where he arrived just the day before the marriage (which is how it ended up being in the novel). And I had to write all three versions to be able to compare and see how these different arrival points affected the stories of the other characters. Including the story of a character who actually hasn&amp;#39;t arrived yet. - &lt;a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/\"&gt;So Spake Martin, 7/22/2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GRRM &amp;quot;solved&amp;quot; the Meereenese Knot by &lt;a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2622896/george-rr-martin-on-pov-and-the-meereenese-knot/\"&gt;adding Barristan Selmy as a POV character late in ADWD&lt;/a&gt;, but the reality is that the knot was not entirely cut by the end of ADWD. There are several characters who have not arrived in Meereen by the end of ADWD. Namely, Victarion Greyjoy and Marwyn the Mage haven\u2019t quite made it to Meereen. Victarion &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; arrive in Meereen at the start of TWOW, but Marwyn is still absent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above all that, Daenerys Targaryen, the woman that everyone was seeking, is now gone from Meereen and is up in the Dothraki Sea somewhere. If TWOW parallels the plot from GoT, S06, it&amp;#39;s likely that her journey will take her to Vaes Dothrak before she returns to Meereen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my vantage point, the major plot points GRRM will or might address in the Meereenese Knot Part 2 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major plot-points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle of Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: Meereen and Yunkai &amp;amp; her allies at war, the Volantene Fleet on its way with Tyrion, Barristan and Victarion on 3 sides of the conflict and their lives at stake.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fallout from the Battle of Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: the situation inside Meereen, Sons of the Harpy, the internal politics of Meereen, the post-battle relationship between Yunkai and Meereen&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Return of Daenerys to Meereen&lt;/strong&gt;: Will the Dragon Queen make it back to Meereen? What will be her reaction to Yunkai (and Barristan/Shavepate) breaking the peace? Who will Daenerys be when she returns?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middling to Minor Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arrival of Marwyn in Meereen&lt;/strong&gt;: What will the Archmaester&amp;#39;s relationship be to the characters in Meereen? Will he come into conflict with someone like Moqorro?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fates of the Sellswords&lt;/strong&gt;: Daario, the Tattered Prince and Brown Ben Plumm look to have some role in post-battle Meereen. What will it be?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penny and Jorah&lt;/strong&gt;: Will both survive the battle? Will Dany take Jorah back into her service?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dornish Knights&lt;/strong&gt;: Will they survive the Battle of Fire? If they do, will they return to Dorne? What type of message will they bring back to Doran regarding the death of Quentyn? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, the convergence of characters and storylines looks like another Meereenese Knot. But here, the ramifications of events in Meereen will blossom out from Slaver&amp;#39;s Bay to impact many other areas besides Meereen. Dorne, Pentos, Yunkai and Volantis will be impacted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you see the plot unfolding for these plot-lines? How will he resolve them? Will he resolve them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Winterfell Knot&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the North, multiple POV characters are converging or possibly converge on Winterfell. The largest event set to occur in the North is a battle between Stannis Baratheon and Roose Bolton that looks to kick off at the Crofter&amp;#39;s Village and possibly spill over to Winterfell. At the Crofter&amp;#39;s Village, Asha and Theon Greyjoy look to be our primary POVs for the battles themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s more occurring than the simple battle at Winterfell. Multiple characters and storylines are or are pointing to Winterfell:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle of Ice/Winterfell:&lt;/strong&gt; The clash between Stannis and Roose with Theon, Asha and possibly Bran as our POVs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath of the Battle of Winterfell:&lt;/strong&gt; Does Stannis or Roose come out triumphant? What will their relationship be with the other northmen in and around Winterfell?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Davos&amp;#39; search for Rickon:&lt;/strong&gt; Davos is searching for Rickon in Skagos and intending to bring him back to the mainland. Will he find him? What will Rickon be like? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Snow&amp;#39;s Death, Resurrection and March to Winterfell:&lt;/strong&gt; Jon&amp;#39;s last moments are filled with a desire to march on Winterfell to kill Ramsay and rescue his &amp;quot;sister.&amp;quot; His death and coming resurrection will likely solidify this desire on Jon&amp;#39;s part. And what will become of Robb&amp;#39;s will naming Jon as heir? Will the North abandon Stannis or Roose if this becomes widely-known?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sansa and Littlefinger:&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of AFFC, Littlefinger dramatically reveals his plan to wed Sansa Stark to Harry the Heir and invade the North with the swords of the Vale. They will likely come to Winterfell barring a GRRM curveball.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Others are coming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middling to Minor Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fate of Jeyne Poole:&lt;/strong&gt; Stannis dispatches Alysanne Mormont and Jeyne Poole to Castle Black just prior to the Battle of Ice. What becomes of Jeyne?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ironborn at Torrhen&amp;#39;s Square:&lt;/strong&gt; Dagmer Cleftjaw retook Torrhen&amp;#39;s Square. It&amp;#39;s the last Ironborn hold-out in the North. Will it play any role in any of the storylines in and around Winterfell?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Massey sent to Braavos:&lt;/strong&gt; Stannis dispatches Massey to Braavos to hire sellswords. Will he be successful? Will he encounter Arya in Braavos?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, numerous POVs and storylines converging or departing from Winterfell. How do you see the action unfolding?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The King&amp;#39;s Landing Conflagration&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our third knot centers on King&amp;#39;s Landing. There, the storylines of Cersei, Aegon, Jon Connington and Arianne seem to be moving there. Though a lot of action is set to occur in the Stormlands early in TWOW, King&amp;#39;s Landing will likely be the final setpiece for these POVs/storylines. The importance, then, in King&amp;#39;s Landing relies on it being the seat of power, the center of gravity for the politics of the realm. Controlling King&amp;#39;s Landing and sitting the Iron Throne means we&amp;#39;ll go beyond just two POVs (Counting Kevan&amp;#39;s ADWD Epilogue) in the city to several more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aegon&amp;#39;s crusade for the Iron Throne:&lt;/strong&gt; Young Griff and the Golden Company have landed in Westeros and taken several castles along the coast. They&amp;#39;ve even taken Storm&amp;#39;s End. The ultimate goal is King&amp;#39;s Landing and the Iron Throne. Will they succeed? Fail?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cersei&amp;#39;s Shenanigans:&lt;/strong&gt; Cersei&amp;#39;s Trial by Battle, her conflict with the Tyrells, Faith Militant, everyone. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fallout from Kevan and Pycelle&amp;#39;s deaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Faith Militant:&lt;/strong&gt; The High Sparrow is growing powerful, Tyene Sand is sent to infiltrate the Faith Militant, do they back Aegon?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Connington and the Greyscale:&lt;/strong&gt; Does JonCon cause a greyscale outbreak? What impact will greyscale have on JonCon?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arianne and Aegon:&lt;/strong&gt; Does the Dornish Princess seduce and win over Aegon? Do they marry? Does Arianne bring Dorne into war with the Iron Throne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middling to Minor Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nymeria Sand on the Small Council:&lt;/strong&gt; Lady Nym is coming to take the Dornish Seat on the small council. What will her role be in the small council?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to Loras?&lt;/strong&gt; Loras is reportedly badly wounded on Dragonstone. Will he survive? Will he return to TWOW?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rosby Inheritance:&lt;/strong&gt; Who&amp;#39;s putting forward claims to Rosby?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give me your best &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s how this event will go down&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s how GRRM will resolve this plot!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Volantene Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In ADWD, Volantis becomes a major setpiece in the narrative. POV Characters as far afield as Tyrion, Quentyn, Jon Connington and Victarion visit the city and bring their unique perspectives into the city. What comes out of this is a fascinating picture of a city about to embark on a foreign war while an internal revolution by slaves and freedmen looms large. Eventually, I might have a more substantive piece on Volants in TWOW, but for now, let&amp;#39;s talk bullet points, because the people love bullet-points:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volantis sent a fleet of ships crewed by slaves to Meereen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&amp;#39;s going to be interesting. Will the slaves rebel? Fight for Daenerys? Throw off their chains and give Dany the ships she needs to invade Westeros? (Yes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Volantene Revolution:&lt;/strong&gt; 4 of 5 people in Volantis are slaves. Meanwhile, the high priest of R&amp;#39;hllor in Volantis (Benerro) believes that Dany is Azor Ahai Reborn. Shit&amp;#39;s going down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dany will likely come to Volantis&lt;/strong&gt;: Given the Widow on the Waterfront&amp;#39;s conversation with Tyrion and Moqorro&amp;#39;s entry into Dany&amp;#39;s storyline, Dany will come to Volantis? Will she burnidate the city? Part of the city?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dany/Tyrion intersection:&lt;/strong&gt; Martin said that Dany and Tyrion would be apart for much of TWOW, but they would &amp;quot;intersect&amp;quot; later in TWOW. I think this will go down in Volantis. How will it unfold? Will Aegon come up?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Arya come to Volantis?&lt;/strong&gt; One theory I&amp;#39;ve seen batted around is that Arya will make her way to Volantis and join up with Dany&amp;#39;s crew.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middling to Minor Plot-Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who won the election in Volantis?&lt;/strong&gt; Did the Tigers take two of the three triarch positions?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, much of the above is speculative given that we&amp;#39;ve seen no sample chapters set in Volantis, but given the emphasis Martin placed in the city, it&amp;#39;s likely this will be a major setpiece in TWOW. How will events go down? What happens in Volantis?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unsettling as it is, Martin has written himself into about 4 major knots that potentially rival the difficulty and complexity of the Meereenese Knot from ADWD. Additionally, though not included in this piece, Samwell and Aeron might be converging in and around Oldtown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, how does Martin writes his way out of these knots? How will these major geographic centers of gravity impact the plot? Which storylines are you looking forward to? Let me know in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "*\"Plot Gravity Wells\" comes from /u/bookshelfstud's excellent piece [\"The Return of the White Wolf.\"](https://offmichaelsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/return-of-the-white-wolf-jon-is-coming-back/) That essay is #RealGood. Take and read.*\n\n##Intro\n\nStarting in *A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons*, GRRM has started to bring the disparate threads of his storyline together. Where Martin has talked about how he intended for the first book to resemble *The Lord of the Rings* in having most of his characters begin at Winterfell and then spread out across the world, the 4th and 5th books of the series have begun the process of bringing the threads back together.\n\nIn *The Winds of Winter*, Martin further intends to start bringing the threads back together. In a 2012 interview, GRRM stated:\n\n&gt; All of the POVs will be returning: \u201cAll the characters [are in the book],\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019m going to start pulling the threads back together in this one, I hope.\u201d \u2013 [MTV interview, 10/2/2012]( http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694594/game-of-thrones-season-three-george-rr-martin-richard-madden.jhtml)\n\nWhat this means precisely has yet to be seen, however, we can make estimated guesses on how Martin will bring the threads back together and how he\u2019ll weave the characters, their plots and their struggles into a narrative that will likely center everything in several geographical plot gravity wells in 4 major locations:\n\n- Meereen\n- Winterfell\n- King\u2019s Landing\n- Volantis\n\nIn this analysis, I\u2019d like to explore the intersections at these geographic areas, how they likely impact the writing speed and processes that GRRM experiences in writing TWOW and the myriad plots that are, will or might occur in these places.\n***\n##The Meereense Knot, Part 2\n\nGeorge RR Martin stated numerous times that the biggest hurdle in writing *A Dance with Dragons* was something he termed the \"Meereenese Knot.\" Essentially, this was a writing problem derived from numerous characters and events revolving around Daenerys Targaryen and Meereen. For the longest time, GRRM was vague about what exactly the Meereenese Knot was, but in 2012, he opened up about it:\n\n&gt; Now that we know how the \"Meereenese knot\" played out, what was the problem with this? For example, was it the order in which Dany met various characters, or who, when, and how someone would try to take the dragons?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** Now I can explain things. It was a confluence of many, many factors: lets start with the offer from Xaro to give Dany ships, the refusal of which then leads to Qarth's declaration of war. Then there's the marriage of Daenerys to pacify the city. Then there's the arrival of the Yunkish army at the gates of Meereen, there's the order of arrival of various people going her way (Tyrion, Quentyn, Victarion, Aegon, Marwyn, etc.), and then there's Daario, this dangerous sellsword and the question of whether Dany really wants him or not, there's hte plague, there's Drogon's return to Meereen...\n\n&gt; All of these things were balls I had thrown up into the air, and they're all linked and chronologically entwined. The return of Drogon to the city was something I explored as happening at different times. For example, I wrote three different versions of Quentyn's arrival at Meereen: one where he arrived long before Dany's marriage, one where he arrived much later, and one where he arrived just the day before the marriage (which is how it ended up being in the novel). And I had to write all three versions to be able to compare and see how these different arrival points affected the stories of the other characters. Including the story of a character who actually hasn't arrived yet. - [So Spake Martin, 7/22/2012](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/)\n\nGRRM \"solved\" the Meereenese Knot by [adding Barristan Selmy as a POV character late in ADWD](http://www.mtv.com/news/2622896/george-rr-martin-on-pov-and-the-meereenese-knot/), but the reality is that the knot was not entirely cut by the end of ADWD. There are several characters who have not arrived in Meereen by the end of ADWD. Namely, Victarion Greyjoy and Marwyn the Mage haven\u2019t quite made it to Meereen. Victarion *does* arrive in Meereen at the start of TWOW, but Marwyn is still absent.\n\nAbove all that, Daenerys Targaryen, the woman that everyone was seeking, is now gone from Meereen and is up in the Dothraki Sea somewhere. If TWOW parallels the plot from GoT, S06, it's likely that her journey will take her to Vaes Dothrak before she returns to Meereen.\n\nFrom my vantage point, the major plot points GRRM will or might address in the Meereenese Knot Part 2 are as follows:\n\n**Major plot-points**\n\n- **The Battle of Fire**: Meereen and Yunkai &amp; her allies at war, the Volantene Fleet on its way with Tyrion, Barristan and Victarion on 3 sides of the conflict and their lives at stake.\n- **Fallout from the Battle of Fire**: the situation inside Meereen, Sons of the Harpy, the internal politics of Meereen, the post-battle relationship between Yunkai and Meereen\n- **The Return of Daenerys to Meereen**: Will the Dragon Queen make it back to Meereen? What will be her reaction to Yunkai (and Barristan/Shavepate) breaking the peace? Who will Daenerys be when she returns?\n\n**Middling to Minor Plot-Points**\n\n- **The Arrival of Marwyn in Meereen**: What will the Archmaester's relationship be to the characters in Meereen? Will he come into conflict with someone like Moqorro?\n- **The Fates of the Sellswords**: Daario, the Tattered Prince and Brown Ben Plumm look to have some role in post-battle Meereen. What will it be?\n- **Penny and Jorah**: Will both survive the battle? Will Dany take Jorah back into her service?\n- **The Dornish Knights**: Will they survive the Battle of Fire? If they do, will they return to Dorne? What type of message will they bring back to Doran regarding the death of Quentyn? \n\nAs you can see above, the convergence of characters and storylines looks like another Meereenese Knot. But here, the ramifications of events in Meereen will blossom out from Slaver's Bay to impact many other areas besides Meereen. Dorne, Pentos, Yunkai and Volantis will be impacted. \n\nHow do you see the plot unfolding for these plot-lines? How will he resolve them? Will he resolve them?\n***\n##The Winterfell Knot\n\nIn the North, multiple POV characters are converging or possibly converge on Winterfell. The largest event set to occur in the North is a battle between Stannis Baratheon and Roose Bolton that looks to kick off at the Crofter's Village and possibly spill over to Winterfell. At the Crofter's Village, Asha and Theon Greyjoy look to be our primary POVs for the battles themselves.\n\nHowever, there's more occurring than the simple battle at Winterfell. Multiple characters and storylines are or are pointing to Winterfell:\n\n**Major Plot-Points**\n\n- **The Battle of Ice/Winterfell:** The clash between Stannis and Roose with Theon, Asha and possibly Bran as our POVs\n- **Aftermath of the Battle of Winterfell:** Does Stannis or Roose come out triumphant? What will their relationship be with the other northmen in and around Winterfell?\n- **Davos' search for Rickon:** Davos is searching for Rickon in Skagos and intending to bring him back to the mainland. Will he find him? What will Rickon be like? \n- **Jon Snow's Death, Resurrection and March to Winterfell:** Jon's last moments are filled with a desire to march on Winterfell to kill Ramsay and rescue his \"sister.\" His death and coming resurrection will likely solidify this desire on Jon's part. And what will become of Robb's will naming Jon as heir? Will the North abandon Stannis or Roose if this becomes widely-known?\n- **Sansa and Littlefinger:** At the end of AFFC, Littlefinger dramatically reveals his plan to wed Sansa Stark to Harry the Heir and invade the North with the swords of the Vale. They will likely come to Winterfell barring a GRRM curveball.\n- **The Others are coming**\n\n**Middling to Minor Plot-Points**\n\n- **The Fate of Jeyne Poole:** Stannis dispatches Alysanne Mormont and Jeyne Poole to Castle Black just prior to the Battle of Ice. What becomes of Jeyne?\n- **Ironborn at Torrhen's Square:** Dagmer Cleftjaw retook Torrhen's Square. It's the last Ironborn hold-out in the North. Will it play any role in any of the storylines in and around Winterfell?\n- **Justin Massey sent to Braavos:** Stannis dispatches Massey to Braavos to hire sellswords. Will he be successful? Will he encounter Arya in Braavos?\n\nAgain, numerous POVs and storylines converging or departing from Winterfell. How do you see the action unfolding?\n***\n##The King's Landing Conflagration\n\nOur third knot centers on King's Landing. There, the storylines of Cersei, Aegon, Jon Connington and Arianne seem to be moving there. Though a lot of action is set to occur in the Stormlands early in TWOW, King's Landing will likely be the final setpiece for these POVs/storylines. The importance, then, in King's Landing relies on it being the seat of power, the center of gravity for the politics of the realm. Controlling King's Landing and sitting the Iron Throne means we'll go beyond just two POVs (Counting Kevan's ADWD Epilogue) in the city to several more.\n\n**Major Plot-Points**\n\n- **Aegon's crusade for the Iron Throne:** Young Griff and the Golden Company have landed in Westeros and taken several castles along the coast. They've even taken Storm's End. The ultimate goal is King's Landing and the Iron Throne. Will they succeed? Fail?\n- **Cersei's Shenanigans:** Cersei's Trial by Battle, her conflict with the Tyrells, Faith Militant, everyone. \n- **Fallout from Kevan and Pycelle's deaths**\n- **The Faith Militant:** The High Sparrow is growing powerful, Tyene Sand is sent to infiltrate the Faith Militant, do they back Aegon?\n- **Jon Connington and the Greyscale:** Does JonCon cause a greyscale outbreak? What impact will greyscale have on JonCon?\n- **Arianne and Aegon:** Does the Dornish Princess seduce and win over Aegon? Do they marry? Does Arianne bring Dorne into war with the Iron Throne\n\n**Middling to Minor Plot-Points**\n\n- **Nymeria Sand on the Small Council:** Lady Nym is coming to take the Dornish Seat on the small council. What will her role be in the small council?\n- **What happened to Loras?** Loras is reportedly badly wounded on Dragonstone. Will he survive? Will he return to TWOW?\n- **The Rosby Inheritance:** Who's putting forward claims to Rosby?\n\nGive me your best \"Here's how this event will go down\" or \"Here's how GRRM will resolve this plot!\"\n***\n##The Volantene Revolution\n\nIn ADWD, Volantis becomes a major setpiece in the narrative. POV Characters as far afield as Tyrion, Quentyn, Jon Connington and Victarion visit the city and bring their unique perspectives into the city. What comes out of this is a fascinating picture of a city about to embark on a foreign war while an internal revolution by slaves and freedmen looms large. Eventually, I might have a more substantive piece on Volants in TWOW, but for now, let's talk bullet points, because the people love bullet-points:\n\n**Major Plot-Points**\n\n- **Volantis sent a fleet of ships crewed by slaves to Meereen:** Yeah, that's going to be interesting. Will the slaves rebel? Fight for Daenerys? Throw off their chains and give Dany the ships she needs to invade Westeros? (Yes)\n- **The Volantene Revolution:** 4 of 5 people in Volantis are slaves. Meanwhile, the high priest of R'hllor in Volantis (Benerro) believes that Dany is Azor Ahai Reborn. Shit's going down.\n- **Dany will likely come to Volantis**: Given the Widow on the Waterfront's conversation with Tyrion and Moqorro's entry into Dany's storyline, Dany will come to Volantis? Will she burnidate the city? Part of the city?\n- **The Dany/Tyrion intersection:** Martin said that Dany and Tyrion would be apart for much of TWOW, but they would \"intersect\" later in TWOW. I think this will go down in Volantis. How will it unfold? Will Aegon come up?\n- **Will Arya come to Volantis?** One theory I've seen batted around is that Arya will make her way to Volantis and join up with Dany's crew.\n\n**Middling to Minor Plot-Points**\n\n- **Who won the election in Volantis?** Did the Tigers take two of the three triarch positions?\n\nObviously, much of the above is speculative given that we've seen no sample chapters set in Volantis, but given the emphasis Martin placed in the city, it's likely this will be a major setpiece in TWOW. How will events go down? What happens in Volantis?\n***\n##Conclusion\n\nUnsettling as it is, Martin has written himself into about 4 major knots that potentially rival the difficulty and complexity of the Meereenese Knot from ADWD. Additionally, though not included in this piece, Samwell and Aeron might be converging in and around Oldtown. \n\nSo, how does Martin writes his way out of these knots? How will these major geographic centers of gravity impact the plot? Which storylines are you looking forward to?

He believes she has been sent by R'hllor to deliver them from evil. (Note also in the first paragraph, Tyrion cuts Haldon off before he can translate any more.) Benerro also leaves an omen for Volantis if it strikes against Daenerys. We hear this through Qavo Nogarys, a Selhorys customs officer who plays cyvasse against Tyrion:\n\n&gt;\u201cThe red priests would be wise to hold their tongues,\u201d said Qavo Nogarys. \u201cAlready there has been fighting between their followers and those who worship other gods. Benerro\u2019s rantings will only serve to bring a savage wrath down upon his head.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cWhat rantings?\u201d the dwarf asked, toying with his rabble\n\n&gt;The Volantene waved a hand. \u201cIn Volantis, thousands of slaves and freedmen crowd the temple plaza every night to hear Benerro shriek of bleeding stars and a sword of fire that will cleanse the world. **He has been preaching that Volantis will surely burn if the triarchs take up arms against the silver queen**.\u201d\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VI, ADWD*\n\nAnd later, word arrives in Meereen that Volantis \"has\" launched it's fleet. \n\n&gt;\"And there is more. Worse. Volantis has launched its fleet against us.\u201d [Skahaz]\n\n&gt;\u201cVolantis.\u201d Selmy\u2019s sword hand tingled. We made a peace with Yunkai. Not with Volantis. \u201cYou are certain?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cCertain. The Wise Masters know. So do their friends. The Harpy, Reznak, Hizdahr. This king will open the city gates to the Volantenes when they arrive. All those Daenerys freed will be enslaved again. Even some who were never slaves will be fitted for chains. You may end your days in a fighting pit, old man. Khrazz will eat your heart.\"\n\nHow this news arrives ahead of the fleet, given there are no ravens, is a micro mystery in ADWD. Perhaps riders from the Demon Road by Mantarys reached Tolos and the news was carried via ship to Yunkai. Perhaps a faster ship not coupled to a fleet arrived first. With the Volantene fleet delayed, either reason could explain why a physically shorter half-land, half-sea route arrived first. Or perhaps this claim is an anticipated rumor rather than something exact. Regardless, Victarion witnessed the Volantenes before their departure, and clearly expects the fleet to be tailing him to Meereen:\n\n&gt;He took care not to mention the green galleys of Old Volantis that surely must be sailing up through the Gulf of Grief even as he spoke.\n\n&gt;*Victarion, ADWD*\n\n...and Moqorro also backs this claim up:\n\n&gt;\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d the captain asked his black priest that night, as Moqorro stood before his nightfire. \u201cWhat awaits us on the morrow? More rain?\u201d It smelled like rain to him.\n\n&gt;\u201cGrey skies and strong winds,\u201d Moqorro said. \u201cNo rain. Behind come the tigers. Ahead awaits your dragon.\u201d\n\n&gt;*Victarion, ADWD*\n\nAlthough we're not sure to what degree Moqorro is messing with Victarion:\n\n&gt;The black priest bowed his head. \u201cThere is no need. The Lord of Light has shown me your worth, lord Captain. Every night in my fires I glimpse the glory that awaits you.\u201d\n\n&gt;*Victarion, ADWD*\n\nI recently reread [Brynden's essay on the Battle of Fire](https://bryndenbfish.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/a-dragon-dawn-a-complete-analysis-of-the-upcoming-battle-of-fire-conclusion-fire-and-blood/), which lays out a theory that the Volantene slaves will rebel when they reach Slaver's Bay and go over to Daenerys. This is certainly a probable outcome, but I feel like there is more going on in Volantis than a simple voyage to Meereen and rebellion. We have reason already to doubt this will occur, given Tyrion's musings on the Tiger Cloaks - *slave soldiers.*\n\n&gt;A squad of Volantene spearmen stood guard at the river gate. Torchlight gleamed off the steel claws that jutted from their gauntlets. Their helms were tiger\u2019s masks, the faces beneath marked by green stripes tattooed across both cheeks. **The slave soldiers of Volantis were fiercely proud of their tiger stripes, Tyrion knew.** *Do they yearn for freedom?* he wondered. *What would they do if this child queen bestowed it on them? What are they, if not tigers? What am I, if not a lion?*\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VI, ADWD*\n\nIt could be Tyrion's understanding is flawed - we don't know how he acquired this knowledge, hell, perhaps it was a copy of \"Lonely Planetos: Volantis\" written by the Volantene nobles. Then again, if you're going to have a massive slave population, you'd probably want adequate protection against any revolts. You definitely wouldn't want to be arming slaves whose loyalty might be in doubt. And we do know roughly half off the Tiger Cloaks aren't worshipers of R'hllor - which would possibly mean substantial resistance to a religious uprising:\n\n&gt;\u201cBenerro can see the morrow in his flames,\u201d the widow said. \u201cTriarch Malaquo tried to hire the Golden Company, did you know? He meant to clean out the red temple and put Benerro to the sword. **He dare not use tiger cloaks. Half of them worship the Lord of Light as well.**\"\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VII, ADWD*\n\nAnd to requote Qavo Nogarys earlier:\n\n&gt;\u201cThe red priests would be wise to hold their tongues,\u201d said Qavo Nogarys. \u201c**Already there has been fighting between their followers and those who worship other gods.** Benerro\u2019s rantings will only serve to bring a savage wrath down upon his head.\u201d\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VI, ADWD*\n\nAnd we also have reason to believe it's not just the Tiger faction willing to go to war from the barge sailing up the Rhoyne that Tyrion and the Griffs pass:\n\n&gt;\u201c**Nyessos and Malaquo go hand in hand, and the elephants show stripes.**\u201d The voice faded as the other boat moved away from them. They watched its light dwindle and disappear.\n\n&gt;*Tyrion V, ADWD*\n\nSo it looks like things aren't perfectly clean for Benerro and the slaves to start an uprising. The old families appear to be unified. The followers of other gods are fighting with Benerro, and we have reason to believe the armed slaves might be more loyal than not. Plus we have Grezdan mo Eraz from Yunkai and other envoys over in Volantis spreading terrible rumors about Daenerys. The slaves have a huge population advantage, but they don't appear to be unified, and Benerro seems to be their center of support. If he should fall, the fire would be squelched rather quickly.\n\nSo who is going to come out on top, the slaves? the Red Priests? the Triarchs? \n\nBy the time the Volantene fleet is ready to launch, I think the situation has resolved itself. How? Well, there is another faction present in the vicinity, whose purpose remains cloudy to all of our characters, but we receive several pieces of information from different sources that can illuminate a gap in our story:\n\n&gt;\u201cYou have Dothraki outside your own gates,\u201d Haldon said.\n\n&gt;\u201cKhal Pono.\u201d Qavo waved a pale hand in dismissal. \u201cThe horselords come, we give them gifts, the horselords go.\u201d He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around Tyrion\u2019s alabaster dragon, removed it from the board.\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VI, ADWD*\n\nNobody seems very concerned with Khal Pono, yet he has brought the largest khalasar of the Dothraki all the way to Old Volantis:\n\n&gt;The last reports had Pono near the headwaters of the Selhoru with a *khalasar* of thirty thousand.\n\n&gt;*Tyrion III, ADWD*\n\nWhy are they there? I think we receive the reason from the Widow of the Waterfront:\n\n&gt;\u201cBenerro can see the morrow in his flames,\u201d the widow said. \u201c**Triarch Malaquo tried to hire the Golden Company, did you know? He meant to clean out the red temple and put Benerro to the sword.** He dare not use tiger cloaks. Half of them worship the Lord of Light as well.\"\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VI, ADWD*\n\nThe Golden Company is unavailable *but Khal Pono is.* I don't think the Khal is there to collect tribute, I think he's been called in to sack the Red Temple. The Golden Company also works to Triarch Malaquo's advantage. When the Golden Company approaches the city, he sends out 5,000 foot and 1,000 horse out of the city on a very reasonable mission:\n\n&gt;A ferocious southern sun beat down upon the crowded riverfront of Volon Therys, but heat was the last and least of Griff\u2019s concerns. The Golden Company was encamped three miles south of town, well north of where he had expected them, and Triarch Malaquo had come north with five thousand foot and a thousand horse to cut them off from the delta road.\n\n&gt;*The Lost Lord, ADWD*\n\nA lot of the armed tigers cloaks that might side with Benerro are out of the city. It also sounds like there is a bit of creative wording from GRRM here in our Qavo quote:\n\n&gt;\u201cThe red priests would be wise to hold their tongues,\u201d said Qavo Nogarys. \u201cAlready there has been fighting between their followers and those who worship other gods. **Benerro\u2019s rantings will only serve to bring a savage wrath down upon his head.**\u201d\n\n&gt;*Tyrion VI, ADWD*\n\nNote the use of the word \"savage,\" a word which has been primarily used throughout the series to describe the Dothraki. But what is stopping Pono from going after all of Volantis? Well, Pono would probably want to make sure the Volantenes launch against her:\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Political and Religious Situation in Volantis&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe priest is calling on the Volantenes to go to war,\u201d the Halfmaester told him, \u201cbut on the side of right, as soldiers of the Lord of Light, R\u2019hllor who made the sun and stars and fights eternally against the darkness.

They watched its light dwindle and disappear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyrion V, ADWD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it looks like things aren&amp;#39;t perfectly clean for Benerro and the slaves to start an uprising. The old families appear to be unified. The followers of other gods are fighting with Benerro, and we have reason to believe the armed slaves might be more loyal than not. Plus we have Grezdan mo Eraz from Yunkai and other envoys over in Volantis spreading terrible rumors about Daenerys. The slaves have a huge population advantage, but they don&amp;#39;t appear to be unified, and Benerro seems to be their center of support. If he should fall, the fire would be squelched rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So who is going to come out on top, the slaves? the Red Priests? the Triarchs? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time the Volantene fleet is ready to launch, I think the situation has resolved itself. How? Well, there is another faction present in the vicinity, whose purpose remains cloudy to all of our characters, but we receive several pieces of information from different sources that can illuminate a gap in our story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have Dothraki outside your own gates,\u201d Haldon said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cKhal Pono.\u201d Qavo waved a pale hand in dismissal. \u201cThe horselords come, we give them gifts, the horselords go.\u201d He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around Tyrion\u2019s alabaster dragon, removed it from the board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyrion VI, ADWD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody seems very concerned with Khal Pono, yet he has brought the largest khalasar of the Dothraki all the way to Old Volantis:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The last reports had Pono near the headwaters of the Selhoru with a &lt;em&gt;khalasar&lt;/em&gt; of thirty thousand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyrion III, ADWD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are they there? I think we receive the reason from the Widow of the Waterfront:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBenerro can see the morrow in his flames,\u201d the widow said. \u201c&lt;strong&gt;Triarch Malaquo tried to hire the Golden Company, did you know? He meant to clean out the red temple and put Benerro to the sword.&lt;/strong&gt; He dare not use tiger cloaks. Half of them worship the Lord of Light as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyrion VI, ADWD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Golden Company is unavailable &lt;em&gt;but Khal Pono is.&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think the Khal is there to collect tribute, I think he&amp;#39;s been called in to sack the Red Temple. The Golden Company also works to Triarch Malaquo&amp;#39;s advantage. When the Golden Company approaches the city, he sends out 5,000 foot and 1,000 horse out of the city on a very reasonable mission:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A ferocious southern sun beat down upon the crowded riverfront of Volon Therys, but heat was the last and least of Griff\u2019s concerns. The Golden Company was encamped three miles south of town, well north of where he had expected them, and Triarch Malaquo had come north with five thousand foot and a thousand horse to cut them off from the delta road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lost Lord, ADWD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the armed tigers cloaks that might side with Benerro are out of the city. It also sounds like there is a bit of creative wording from GRRM here in our Qavo quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe red priests would be wise to hold their tongues,\u201d said Qavo Nogarys. \u201cAlready there has been fighting between their followers and those who worship other gods. &lt;strong&gt;Benerro\u2019s rantings will only serve to bring a savage wrath down upon his head.&lt;/strong&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyrion VI, ADWD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note the use of the word &amp;quot;savage,&amp;quot; a word which has been primarily used throughout the series to describe the Dothraki. But what is stopping Pono from going after all of Volantis? Well, Pono would probably want to make sure the Volantenes launch against her:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg7pefe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126097.0, "created_utc": 1492097297.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655xmy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655xmy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655xmy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg80hz8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guileandsubterfuge", "parent_id": "t1_dg7q1ty", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think the Riverlands are, at the*very*  least, the 5th big location in Winds.

I don't know why they aren't discussed more as their plotline and eventual meeting will be very impactful.\n\n\n&gt;Considering Jon wanted to send 'Arya' to Braavos, but he's dead now. So if he's not there alive then why would anyone send her to Braavos. \n\nThe fact that Jon is dead and the manner of his death will be the reason getting \"Arya\" somewhere safe and away from the Wall is important. George added that random thought in Jon's chapter pointing out how unsafe it would be for her at the Wall and hiding her away in Braavos was an option. Then Jeyne is suddenly in the hands of a Braavosi Iron Banker? Very convenient. You see where George is going with this. Sending Massey to Braavos is another link to Arya as well as the Iron Bank's involvement with both Stannis/Jon.\n\n&gt;Stannis must possibly know her value and he wanted to send her to Jon 'cos as far as he knows Jon's her only living family left. \n\nStannis let fArya travel to the Wall in a very dangerous time with not much protection. How much does he really value her? He never addresses fArya by her name and seems rather dismissive. What are the chances he knows Jeyne is a fake? Pretty high. \n\n&gt;looking for Arya.\n\nThat is key. Why is she looking for Arya? She makes zero effort to go to the Vale after news of her sister's death. What ever happened to Sansa, does LS not care? Brienne is trying to find Sansa and the whole time she is actually on Arya's trail. LS was at Robb's sealing of his Will and George does something very odd. Robb makes Jon his heir, and lists his dead siblings: Bran, Rickon... and makes no mention of Arya.

So if he&amp;#39;s not there alive then why would anyone send her to Braavos. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that Jon is dead and the manner of his death will be the reason getting &amp;quot;Arya&amp;quot; somewhere safe and away from the Wall is important. George added that random thought in Jon&amp;#39;s chapter pointing out how unsafe it would be for her at the Wall and hiding her away in Braavos was an option. Then Jeyne is suddenly in the hands of a Braavosi Iron Banker? Very convenient. You see where George is going with this. Sending Massey to Braavos is another link to Arya as well as the Iron Bank&amp;#39;s involvement with both Stannis/Jon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stannis must possibly know her value and he wanted to send her to Jon &amp;#39;cos as far as he knows Jon&amp;#39;s her only living family left. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stannis let fArya travel to the Wall in a very dangerous time with not much protection. How much does he really value her? He never addresses fArya by her name and seems rather dismissive. What are the chances he knows Jeyne is a fake? Pretty high. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;looking for Arya.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is key. Why is she looking for Arya? She makes zero effort to go to the Vale after news of her sister&amp;#39;s death. What ever happened to Sansa, does LS not care? Brienne is trying to find Sansa and the whole time she is actually on Arya&amp;#39;s trail. LS was at Robb&amp;#39;s sealing of his Will and George does something very odd. Robb makes Jon his heir, and lists his dead siblings: Bran, Rickon... and makes no mention of Arya. Sansa is disinherited and Catalyn agrees with him. LS is weeping over Robb&amp;#39;s KiTN bronze crown and George makes a point of mentioning that...

I really don't see any of our POVs or mains going down, considering the Yunkai'i are really about to get slaughtered. Yes, I've seen the theories that the Shavepate will close the doors on Barristan at some point, but who would he be running from? The Yunkai'i are about to lose their sellswords, their slave soldiers aren't the best (chaining them together doesn't help), Victarion is about to pound their rear (*heh*), and I think the Volantis slaves will revolt.\n\nThe Victarion/Dragonbinder debacle is really what's got me in a loop, but I think Victarion is Dany's second \"bride of fire\" husband, the \"corpse on the prow of a ship, grey lips smiling sadly\". I don't think Victarion is already dead and Moqorro resurrected him, he just did some magic fire arm shit, but this doesn't mean Moqorro won't resurrect Victarion in the near future, especially if Vic decides to blow dragonbinder (but I don't think he will, he knows what happens to those who do).\n\nI feel that Tyrion, Barristan, and Victarion will join up and have to deal with the Shavepate's killing of the hostages, and probably Hizdahr, and try to keep the city in order. I don't like to use the show as reference, but I think they swapped Varys for Barristan as the Tyrion councillor in this time. None of the three will trust the other fully, so it should be interesting.\n\nRegarding the Dornish, I think Drink and Arch both make it out alive, and decide to stick on with Dany. Eventually word will reach Doran that Quentyn was roasted, and I think he'll also find out that Drink and Arch are with Dany (Doran himself already claiming for Aegon), and start to get suspicious that the Yronwoods secretly murdered Quentyn, and this will cause further problems in Dorne. GRRM is definitely setting up a Martell/Yronwood conflict. Quentyn was the only hope for that relationship to ever be a good one, and well, *Oh.*\n\nMy question here is, where exactly is Marwyn at this point in time? Is there any good guesses to that? I've seen it tossed around before that he meets Dany in Volantis, but the Swan Ships are famously very fast, so he could make it to Meereen in good time, especially if they got some of that good Euron wind that Vic got.\n\n&gt;Winterfell\n\nTotally buy into the night lamp, Stannis faked his death, etc, will take Winterfell through trickery, maybe sorcery/glamors.\n\nTheon's role is a huge wild card for me, I'm starting to lean towards Bran skinchanging Theon when at the Heart tree, but that's kind of a stretch. What's more likely is that once they bring Theon out to the tree, a murder of ravens is going to descend shouting his name, and gods know what else, live? Bran? And this will totally spook the northerners and probably prevent Stannis from killing him as well. Either that or Arnolf Karstark gets murdered in Theon's place, maybe glamored as the latter.\n\nOnce Jon is resurrected, I think he heads to Hardhome. I also think Mel takes him north of the wall to do the resurrection, and no one really witnesses it, maybe Val or Tormund, some other NW members tag along. But this line in Mel's POV really sticks out to me:\n\n&gt;\"Lord Snow has need of me, beyond the Wall.\" ***He does not know it yet, but soon...***\n\nSelyse and co most likely flee Castle Black in the confusion, maybe heading to the Nightfort, could also go to Deepwood Motte knowing Stannis had taken it, and it's not far. Eventually they make it to Winterfell upon learning Stannis still lives.\n\nJon makes it to Hardhome only to find it pretty desolate, grabs the remaining Wildlings, and when they make it back to the wall, they gather the rest to march on Winterfell, only to find Stannis had taken it.\n\nThe inside Winterfell post-Stannis capture must be an insane knot. When does he burn Shireen, and who is there? You'd have to assume it's post wall falling, and I can't imagine Jon or Davos being there, so where are they? If Rickon is back, does Stannis marry him to Shireen? How will our new Wild Wolf take it when his betrothed gets crisped?\n\nJustin Massey will take Jeyne to Braavos. I think he marries her, thinking she's Arya, only to find out from the real Arya that she's not, when they inevitably run into one another. Justin gets the bride he's looking for, but it's not a Lord Paramount's daughter like he was hoping. No idea where he and Jeyne go from there.\n\n&gt;Arya\n\nI don't think the FM punish/kick out Arya yet for killing Raff, she probably still has to go learn from the Black Pearl, but she'll want to leave on her own. Who knows how they'll take this? Are they cool with a rogue protege just leaving, or do they actually send someone after her? The waif/Arya confrontation could turn out to be real, just not as cheesy as the show made it out to be, and it won't be personal for the Waif. There will definitely be no \"now you are truly no one\" moment, because Arya never will be in the eyes of the FM.\n\n&gt;The Rest\n\nThere's so much going on elsewhere, it would take days to write all about or speculate, but I think we can get a pretty good idea. Sam finds out some good info in Oldtown before Euron invades and blows the Horn of Winter. Cersei wins her trial, starts building up some power, and unleashes some sort of wrath before Aegon invades. Myrcella and Tommen will probably be dead before Aegon gets there, or will die in the confusion. It's possible Tommen dies first, and Cersei crowns Myrcella, which would be fitting considering it's been stated by so many in the story that crowning Myrcella will kill Myrcella. This also can set a precedent for any future Queens: Dany, Sansa, etc. There's got to be some sort of grey scale outbreak, but it won't be significant enough to have a major impact on the rest of the story. I think it's mainly a plot device for Jon Con to make rash decisions. Sansa will rally the Vale, unmask LF for who he really is, and I thinks he invades the Riverlands first, which will probably already be in open rebellion after RW2.0, and unites them, coming with the full force of the Riverlands and Vale to the North.

How many chapters can we expect in TWoW and how will they correlate? I think there will be around 74 chapters and the volume will be greater than ADwD. I divide TWoW into three major parts: Team Dany (22 chapters), The North (22 chapters) and the rest (30 chapters). So far, I am pretty much convinced about the outline of the 30 chapters. The rest is I am still struggling with. Below is my outline for TWoW excluding Dany and the North.\n\n**Stark Sisters (8 chapters)**\n\n* **Sansa I:** Preps for the tourney (We already have this).\n\n* **Sansa II:** The tourney. Death of Harry. Chaos.\n\n* **Sansa III:** LF tries to persuade Sansa to get pregnant ASAP and claim that the baby is from late Harry so that when Sweetrobin dies, this baby will be legitimized as the Lord of the Vale by any of the contenders for the IT who wishes the Vale and the North at their side. Long story short, LF tries to have his way with Sansa. Sansa is not moved by the idea. LF tries to rape her and she slays the savage giant.\n\n* **Sansa IV:** Shadrich approaches Sansa who has just slain LF and convinces her that he can take her to the North. Sansa does not have any other option. They secretly run away and eventually find a ship. But Shadrich betrays her and the ship comes to the KL where he will turn her over to Cersei.\n\n* **Arya I:** Mercy (We already have this).\n\n* **Arya II \u2013 III:** Raff\u2019s death and Mercy\u2019s disappearance cause a great scandal. Harys Swyft is forced to return to KL empty handed. Arya is sent to a courtesan to study advanced spying. Deeper and darker history of the Faceless Men is revealed to her. Bran tries to contact Arya in her wolf dreams. Eventually, Theon comes to Braavos under Bran\u2019s guidance and briefs Arya about many things happened to the Stark family in Westeros.\n\n* **Arya IV:** Arya makes up her mind. She and Theon find a ship sailing back to Westeros. Arya\u2019s purpose is to reunite with Nymeria and then bring the gift to Lady Stoneheart.\n\n**Riverlands (5 chapters)**\n\t\n* **Jaime &amp; Brienne:** Brienne brings Jaime to LSH who throws accusations to him. Brienne persuades Jaime to demand trial by combat. Brienne becomes Jaime\u2019s champion and saves him. Possible confirmation of Lem Lemoncloak = Richard Lonmouth theory. If that is the case, some missing details about Robert\u2019s Rebellion can be revealed by him. Jaime is set free but Brienne\u2019s oath to LSH still holds. Jaime and Brienne have sex before Jaime leaves. The Second Red Wedding through Brienne\u2019s eyes. In the end, Brienne demands to be set free in order to avenge Renly from Stannis in the North. LSH has to let her go because this term was included in Brienne\u2019s oath back in ACoK. In the end, we have Brienne heading North with Podrick and Jaime heading to KL.\n\n**King\u2019s Landing (4 chapters)**\n\n* **Cersei I \u2013 IV:** Cersei wins her trial and becomes Tommen\u2019s regent. Tommen is poisoned by Tyene who is disguising as a novice attending to Cersei. Myrcella is to be crowned the queen. Lannister-Tyrell alliance is at the brink of total collapse. Tyrells lose their hold on to power by the death of Tommen. Cersei now has the upper hand. Marg\u2019s trial is postponed. The Tyrell army leaves for Storm\u2019s End. All of this takes place in short time with great momentum. The Tyrell army is defeated, Mace is killed and Tarly bends the knee to fAegon. Olenna comes to the KL with refugees from Highgarden. Euron proves to be a real menace in the Reach, sacking Highgarden and killing Garlan in battle. The trial of Marg takes place. She is found guilty and executed. Tyrells seem almost \u201cdone\u201d. fAegon is ever expanding by marrying Arianne and engulfing large swaths of Stormlands, Dorne and the Reach. Cersei is the de facto queen in the KL but Myrcella, being a strong character, keeps contesting her decisions. They have serious quarrels. Myrcella will eventually jump to her death from Maegor\u2019s Holdfast but not in this book.\n\n**Team fAegon (8 chapters)**\n\n* **Arianne I \u2013 II:** On the way to the dragon\u2019s gullet. (We already have them). \n\n* **Arianne III:** Arianne and fAegon fall in love at first sight and decide to marry. Dorne goes black and now they can never go back.\n\n* **JonCon I \u2013 IV:** The Battle of Storm\u2019s End. By \u201cguile\u201d, JonCon conquers Storm\u2019s End for the first time in history.  Then, JonCon makes his plans to confront the incoming Tyrell army. With a good combination of leadership and the choice of battleground, JonCon manages to defeat the Tyrells. Elephants are game changer in this battle. Mace is killed in battle but Tarly is taken prisoner. He and some other surviving Reach Lords swear fealty to fAegon. The news of Euron\u2019s exploits in the Reach comes to them. They decide to go to the Reach and put an end to the threat of the ironborn, which will win other important Reach Lords to their cause, while the Tyrell rose keeps fading. \n\n* **Hotah I:** They learn that Darkstar has stolen the Dawn. Tracking Darkstar. They catch his scent. A fight breaks out. Balon Swann learns the truth about who really killed Oakheart and change sides. He and Darkstar easily slay Obara and Hotah. Darkstar is to become an outlaw at the Red Mountains, like the Vulture Kings of old.\n\n**The Reach (5 chapters)**\n\n* **Sam I:** Sam forging his chains, learning ancient history and arcane stuff.\n\n* **Aeron I:** Forsaken (We already have this).\n\n* **Aeron II:** Euron evades the Redwyne Fleet and starts raiding up the Mander in greater strength. He eventually finds a way to sack Highgarden and kills Garlan in battle. The combined Redwyne-Hightower Fleet retakes the Shields, blockades the mouth of Mander and sends a massive host up the river, both from the land and the waters. Euron and all of his forces are seemingly trapped upstream. Euron commands his men to get rid of unnecessary loads. The ironborn are to carry their longboats over the land to the Honeywine.  From there, they come down the river directly to Oldtown with speed. The city\u2019s defenses are elsewhere and they do not expect an attack from the rear.\n \n* **Sam II \u2013 III:** Sam is our POV in Euron\u2019s raid to Oldtown. The ironborn attack comes as a shock. The city is in chaos. When the ironborn tide reaches its greatest extent, Sam succeeds in killing Euron thanks to his archery practices. This changes the tide of the battle. The ironborn attack gets bogged down. As Euron is dying, the van of fAegon\u2019s army (led by Sam\u2019s father) arrives and the ironborn are soundly defeated between the hammer and the anvil. Aeron is still alive and taken as a prisoner along with many ironborn. The Hightowers and Redwynes bend knee to fAegon along with their bannermen. Aeron is interrogated. He reveals Euron\u2019s pets (like the Codds) and makes sure to have them executed. The other ironborn Lords (like Goodbrothers) are spared with their men after they all swear fealty to fAegon. In the end, Aeron and the remaining ironborn are sent to the Iron Islands to restore order and obey the king\u2019s peace. JonCon\u2019s greyscale is finally revealed and fAegon, now having so many Lords at his side, sends him away. Sam claims Euron\u2019s Valyrian Steel Armor for the NW by right of personally slaying him. He plans to repurpose it to create new VS swords to fight the Others. In the end, Sam gets on the way back to the Wall. JonCon, feeling abandoned and depressed, goes with him. They will eventually team up with Gendry and take him to the Wall as well, possibly with more members of the BwB. JonCon will see the young Robert, the man he hates most, in Gendry but will grow to like the boy and be a father figure to him. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very interesting because I have been thinking about the exact same thing in the last weeks.
