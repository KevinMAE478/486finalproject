Then he is at the battle on the Trident when Robert kills Rhaegar.  He had to watch one of his best friends kill 2 of his other best friends.  After this he breaks, leaves his life and identity behind.

If we later find out he is Lonmouth and Lonmouth was supposed to be a King's Guard, that would be a pretty funny nod to the reader on a reread.  Arya also specifically describes his cloak at one point.  It's worn, but the description makes it clear that it isn't some peasant rag.  Lem is at the very least highborn/wealthy.\n\nThere are also frequent references to Lem Lemoncloak and kissing.  And after those references, one of the other King's Brotherhood guys (don't remember which one) always gives a knowing smile like he's in on some joke.  Arya notices this more than once.

The full one is very well hashed out.  It's covered extensively in a Radio Westeros podcast, but I don't recall which one.  I'll do my best to answer some of your questions.\n\nWhy does Rhaegar know that Lyanna is the Mystery Knight?\n\nAfter the first day of tourney, Aerys demands someone unmask the mystery knight, and personally orders Rhaegar and his squire to find out who it is.  The next day the mystery knight's shield is found hanging in a tree.  The theory goes that Rhaegar found and unmasked Lyanna with his squire.  Bonus side theory: his squire is Lem Lemoncloak from the King's Brotherhood.  There is actually a lot of textual evidence for that and would give us a character who can relay that narrative in a later book.\n\nWhy does Rhaegar help the Starks?\n\nThere is a lot of textual evidence to support a power struggle between Rhaegar and Aerys in King's Landing.  Particularly when Aerys was held hostage by a rebelling house.  I forget which one.  Tywin attacked the castle anyway, and said that if Aerys was killed, Rhaegar would be a better king anyway.  If not for Barristan, Aerys would have been killed.  After that, Aerys never left the Red Keep until Harrenhal.  So why did Aerys go to Harrenhal if he hadn't left the Red Keep in years?  He believed Harrenhal was a pretext to get the major houses together to plan to overthrow Aerys and put Rhaegar on the throne.  Once Rhaegar openly defied Aerys by taking Lyanna, they both had to hide from Aerys.\n\nWhy does Rhaegar go to war?\n\nThe narrative gets out of his control.  He may have notified Rickard that he took Lyanna, but Brandon had left the tournament a day early (I forget why).  Brandon hears about his sister's abduction and immediately turns to King's Landing without consulting with his family.  He gets himself arrested and Rickard goes to King's Landing to try to defuse the situation.  They both get killed and Rhaegar no longer has a Stark who knows what's going on.\n\nRobert's recollection of how things went down is extremely biased and unreliable.  From Ned's memories of his sister, it sounds like she didn't want to marry Robert, but Robert remembers her as the love of his life.  His reaction at the time was probably just as warped.  Rhaegar ran off with his fiancee and he was jealous and pissed.  He also managed to raise half the kingdom to his side with the kidnap and rape narrative.  There was no way to avoid fighting a war with Robert.\n\nWe know that Rhaegar planned to have a council after the war to depose Aerys and implement some sort of protection against crazy kings.  From his perspective, he was probably trying to put down a rebellion and try to rebuild the realm that Aerys messed up.  Or maybe he just made some really big mistakes; George Martin loves flawed characters.  Or he could have misread a prophecy and thought everything would work out.  We know Rhaegar was upset with prophecies and George Martin loves to place misread prophecies all over the story.\n\nCheck out Radio Westeros for a better version of this.

It&amp;#39;s covered extensively in a Radio Westeros podcast, but I don&amp;#39;t recall which one.  I&amp;#39;ll do my best to answer some of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why does Rhaegar know that Lyanna is the Mystery Knight?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the first day of tourney, Aerys demands someone unmask the mystery knight, and personally orders Rhaegar and his squire to find out who it is.  The next day the mystery knight&amp;#39;s shield is found hanging in a tree.  The theory goes that Rhaegar found and unmasked Lyanna with his squire.  Bonus side theory: his squire is Lem Lemoncloak from the King&amp;#39;s Brotherhood.  There is actually a lot of textual evidence for that and would give us a character who can relay that narrative in a later book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why does Rhaegar help the Starks?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of textual evidence to support a power struggle between Rhaegar and Aerys in King&amp;#39;s Landing.  Particularly when Aerys was held hostage by a rebelling house.  I forget which one.  Tywin attacked the castle anyway, and said that if Aerys was killed, Rhaegar would be a better king anyway.  If not for Barristan, Aerys would have been killed.  After that, Aerys never left the Red Keep until Harrenhal.  So why did Aerys go to Harrenhal if he hadn&amp;#39;t left the Red Keep in years?

He's one of the most hypocrit characters of the whole damn saga. \n\nI don't solely  put blame on Rhaegar, but to me he's with Aerys the main responsible for the shitstorm. Sure he couldn't expect a civil war, but what did he expect  when he eloped with Lyanna Stark, hid for months and let crazy Aerys deal with the nobles Rhaegar angered. A century before Lyonel Baratheon named himself Storm King after Jahaerys broke the betrothal with his daughter. The king was not mad so the conflict was settled  but still a bloody civil occured. In this situation the king is mad, Rhaegar knows it, he creates a political mess in Westeros, but somehow lets his father unchecked for months. Did he truly believe that no one would ask after Lyanna at some point?! And he wouldn't  have left the ToJ if Hightower hadnt' come.

Sure he couldn&amp;#39;t expect a civil war, but what did he expect  when he eloped with Lyanna Stark, hid for months and let crazy Aerys deal with the nobles Rhaegar angered. A century before Lyonel Baratheon named himself Storm King after Jahaerys broke the betrothal with his daughter. The king was not mad so the conflict was settled  but still a bloody civil occured. In this situation the king is mad, Rhaegar knows it, he creates a political mess in Westeros, but somehow lets his father unchecked for months.

As the Elder Brother said, all they knew is that they served a lord who &amp;quot;served a lord who served a lord who had decided to support the dragon rather than the stag.&amp;quot; Why it started was of little importance to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the cause of the rebellion is well known at this point in the story throughout Westeros, but that&amp;#39;s because history is written by the victors. The evil dragon prince kidnapped the beloved northern lady who was promised to the heroic Robert Baratheon. Had the Targs won, you could bet there&amp;#39;d be stories about the heroic dragon prince who rescued the northern maiden from the savage stag lord that started a war out of revenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg7tzox", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130990.0, "created_utc": 1492102190.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655yzo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg843mr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Toastasaurus", "parent_id": "t3_655yzo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think that, in that case, the Royalist side isn't looking at it as \"The War to let Rhaegar do whatever he wants\", they're looking at it as \"The War to preserve the Dynasty.\"\n\nReally, one of the larger elements of Robert's Rebellion is that it wasn't *really* about Lyanna and Rhaegar- it was about Aerys' going *way* off the deep end, executing Brandon and Rickeon Stark and ordering their heirs sent to him in chains.
