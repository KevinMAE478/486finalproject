I've brought this up before with Preston, but I really think the Daynes need to be explored some more.  They are by far the most interesting family in Westeros that GRRM hasn't directly talked about.\n\n* Ashara Dayne likely had a sexual relationship with Brandon Stark.  Her child (timing wise could have been Brandon's) was still born.  \n* Ned Stark killed Ser Arthur Dayne, Ashara's Brother.  Upon hearing the news, which also came shortly after her child died, she purportedly killed herself.  \n* Ned Stark returned the Dayne family sword, Dawn, to Starfall rather than keep it as a prize of victory.  \n* Edric Dayne, the current Lord of House Dayne, was the Squire to Ser Berric Dondarrian, the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners who was killed and revived a dozen times.  \n* Edric Dayne who is only 2 years older than Arya Stark, meets and befriends her on the road.  He reveals that he goes by \"Ned Dayne\" and does so because of the high opinion the Dayne family has for her father, Eddard \"Ned\" Stark.  \n\nSo stopping here, the Stark family has an interesting history with the Dayne family.  Brandon's brief fling with Ashara possibly leading to a pregnancy and her stillborn child, a factor in her eventual suicide.  Ned killing Arthur and returning his sword to the family.... yet those aren't good things.  Those aren't things that bind two families in friendship.  Yet Ned Dayne, when he meets Arya, is excited about Starks.  He reveals that Jon Snow's nursemaid was also his nursemaid, making them milkbrothers, and that he goes by Ned to honor Ned Stark.  Weird that he seems so fond of House Stark despite a pretty negative history between the two houses.\n\nAdditionally all members of House Dayne we've had physical descriptions of in the books have decidedly Valyrian features.  Silver-Blonde hair and/or purple eyes.  They are the *ONLY* family described in Westeros to have such features that didn't directly descend from Valyria.  Lord Edric Dayne himself is described as having \"pale blonde hair and eyes that appear a pale purple\".  He's not quite the \"Silver Hair and Violet\" that a Targaryen is, but it's probable they have a Valyrian History.\n\nAs for House Dayne's history?  They live in one of the oldest cities in Westeros (only Oldtown is said to be older), and they used to be the Kings of the mountain range and river where they live before the Martells united Dorne by conquest eons ago.  \n\nLord Edric \"Ned\" Dayne is currently in the books leading a portion of the former Brotherhood Without Banners south (probably back to Starfall, but... \"South\" is pretty general).  He's about 14 years old depending on the estimate, but not that old.  It could be safely assumed that he's returning to Starfall with his Brotherhood Without Banners' companions in order to take his seat as the Lord of Starfall with the loyal Brotherhood members being given a Banner: Starfall's White and Lilac. \n\n-----\n\nSo how does Darkstar fit in?  He is Ser Gerold Dayne of House Dayne of High Hermitage.  The cadet branch of House Dayne that rules over one of the 2 largest cities (the other being Blackmont) directly loyal to House Dayne and former major seats in the Kingdom of the Torentine that House Dayne used to be the Kings and Queens of.  Framing Gerold Dayne of High Hermitage and not expecting the Daynes of Starfall to take offense would be akin to framing a Lannister of Lannisport and not expecting the Lannisters of Casterly Rock to take offense.  \n\nSo I circle back to my original question:\n\n**Why the hell would Doran Martell** *want* **to declare war on the Daynes of Starfall?**  Preston suggests that Doran is framing Darkstar for the attack on Myrcella... but what?  What does he stand to gain from essentially declaring war on the Daynes?  \n\nAre the Daynes not loyal to the Martells?  When/if Edric Dayne returns to Starfall does Doran think he'll be cool with Doran framing up his Cousin?  \n\nI'm at a loss here.  Is he trying to usurp Starfall and High Hermitage for his own gain?", "edited": 1492150907.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering the motivation for Doran to set up Darkstar and essentially declare war on the Daynes of Starfall.
