George by contrast, an atheist who has a negative opinion of religion does include religion in his universe, why? I think the answer is fairly obvious, he is making a point about religion. As in the real world, religion (especially the Abrahamic kind) is incredibly dogmatic and prioritises credulity over critical reasoning. These ideologies have contributed or had a direct hand in almost every single atrocity that has occurred in recorded history. In the words of Steven Weinberg, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil\u2014that takes religion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think George is making Weinberg&amp;#39;s point. So there is no true religion, there are no gods, at least in the conventional sense. That all mysterious and magical occurrences in the story can be linked to coincidence, deception or in the case of resurrected people, hive minds such as the Children of the Forest, a potential Other hive mind, and the Undying. George in contrast to Tolkien who had gods but no religion, George has religion but no gods. I think it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious really, though subtle. It took me a while to take this view of the series. I understand it takes people a while to come over to this view, it is a controversial one, but based on everything we know, about the series, about George, about his previous work, this is the correct conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Gee people really don&amp;#39;t like being told this no matter how polite it&amp;#39;s put.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dgbw3sg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492365026.0, "created_utc": 1492336226.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o4x3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc36xy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wyman-Manderly", "parent_id": "t3_65o4x3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are no \"true\" religions in ASOIAF, because that's not the way George's mind works.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; religions in ASOIAF, because that&amp;#39;s not the way George&amp;#39;s mind works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dgc36xy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492382062.0, "created_utc": 1492353262.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o4x3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9e94", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "illuminatus235", "parent_id": "t3_65o4x3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Obviously none because GRRM", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously none because GRRM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dgc9e94", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390653.0, "created_utc": 1492361853.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o4x3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc3yml", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TyrionTarg", "parent_id": "t3_65o4x3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There is no true religion.
