Avoidable\u200b if Moore keeps his helm on with a neutered voice, and if the &amp;quot;peasants&amp;quot; attack regular customers as much as Valemen, giving the illusion that it was prices they were protesting, not the Clansmen. No evidence. Later on, Tyrion gives Tywin a bit of exposition as to Baelish and his nefarious intent, and as to his treacheries in King&amp;#39;s Landing. Cersei may think it unforgivable, but Tywin would probably commend him, which is more important, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg9livw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492225996.0, "created_utc": 1492197196.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8gvch", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fadlpadl", "parent_id": "t1_dg89c3r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If he asks just any random man there's a good chance Petyr can muster up a force of bribed men of his own before anything happens, and at that point there is a significant risk of Tyrion ending up just as dead.\nOr at the very least he'll probably end up dead in the next dangerous situation that arises, completely accidentally of course.\n\nHe needs someone who cannot be bought off by Petyr, and can do the job swiftly and without giving Petyr the ability to react.\n\nThe first leaves out Bronn, so he doesn't really have anyone he can just straight up order to do the deed risk-free.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he asks just any random man there&amp;#39;s a good chance Petyr can muster up a force of bribed men of his own before anything happens, and at that point there is a significant risk of Tyrion ending up just as dead.\nOr at the very least he&amp;#39;ll probably end up dead in the next dangerous situation that arises, completely accidentally of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He needs someone who cannot be bought off by Petyr, and can do the job swiftly and without giving Petyr the ability to react.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first leaves out Bronn, so he doesn&amp;#39;t really have anyone he can just straight up order to do the deed risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg8gvch", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492157691.0, "created_utc": 1492128891.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657njo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657njo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8erbu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MaegorDaCruel", "parent_id": "t1_dg8elob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; but you need LF people.\n\nYeah I see what you mean by this.
