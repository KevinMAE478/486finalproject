If you think about it hard enough I&amp;#39;m sure something will come to you. We&amp;#39;ve all had someone steal money from us, have a family member screw us over, and someone who hurt us because of their love for you, someone else, or your love for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that I believe is the point of Quaithe&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;warning.&amp;quot; It isn&amp;#39;t a warning at all, its just something to get Dany paranoid and act more crazy. Quaithe seems to want her to act like a crazy Targaryen, she keeps on telling her to &amp;quot;remember who you are.&amp;quot; Dany doesn&amp;#39;t need to be betrayed at all, I would argue that the point of this whole thing is to just get her to be a crazy Targaryen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg6c0s8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051408.0, "created_utc": 1492022608.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zwhf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ddcv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZoSoVII", "parent_id": "t3_64zwhf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't find this tinfoil at all, it is an excellent theory and it fits Dany perfectly.
