It is not as if his ancestry plays a role in relation to Bran, or is even alluded to.

He is there to make the statement, that &lt;strong&gt;the gulf between the magic of Starks and Targaryens is not as insurmountable as we have been led to believe, and a man skilled in the sorcery of one realm can easily cross into the other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this important ?

In the long time that the Targaryens have been in Westeros, some adventurous Stark must have surely faced against a wild dragon, or obtained a dragon egg, or even fought against a dragon, leading to the demonstration of their affinity to the monsters ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I found out. No. &lt;strong&gt;Suspiciously, Starks have never intermarried with the Targaryens (whereupon their children might have hatched their eggs) or ever faced of against a dragon, wild or otherwise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in the Dance of the Dragons, when almost all Westeros faced dragonfire, the Starks were conspicuous by there absence, with Cregan Stark arriving in Kings Landing &lt;strong&gt;after all the dragons were dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is evident that GRRM is going to some length to avoid having the Starks confront a dragon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the most Bloodraven of all ?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now I was sold on the idea that the Starks can be dragonriders, but which Stark ? Sansa, the quintessential lady who dreams of a knight to rescue her ? Or Bran, the chosen protege of Bloodraven, who has been promised that he would fly ? Or perhaps Rickon, the youngest, and probably the most savage of the Starks ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, it is someone else. Who, like Bloodraven, is known to travel under various aliases. Who, like the feared King&amp;#39;s hand, is known to hand out death sentences on her own. And who, like the badass wielder of the Dark Sister, is a fine swordswoman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guessed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Wolf who dreams of flying&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She chewed on her lip, hoping. &lt;strong&gt;If I had wings I could fly back to Winterfell&lt;/strong&gt; and see for myself. And if it was true, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;d just fly away, fly up past the moon&lt;/strong&gt; and the shining stars, and see all the things in Old Nan&amp;#39;s stories, dragons and sea monsters and the Titan of Braavos, and maybe I wouldn&amp;#39;t ever fly back unless I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could change into a wolf &lt;strong&gt;and grow wings and fly away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet &lt;strong&gt;instead of wings&lt;/strong&gt; the way was longer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read with this knowledge in mind, many of these lines seem to foreshadow Arya the Dragon rider. Let us also look at a description of Eleana Targaryen, a sister of Aegon the Unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Elaena was &lt;strong&gt;initially not a great beauty&lt;/strong&gt; like her sisters, and &lt;strong&gt;at age eleven was even described as a &amp;quot;skinny little thing&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, awkward and angular, shy and charming by turns. However, &lt;strong&gt;her beauty matured as she got older&lt;/strong&gt;, and men said that she was more beautiful at age seventy than at age seventeen. Her eyes were a soft lilac, &lt;strong&gt;her mouth thin-lipped and often angry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In character, she had more than a little of Daena&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;willfulness&lt;/strong&gt;, as she would prove when she grew older. Elaena was also &lt;strong&gt;shrewd and intelligent,&lt;/strong&gt; especially with money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Change the name to Arya, and it reads like her description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why Viserion specifically ? Well, for starters, lets look at Bloodraven&amp;#39;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brynden&amp;#39;s personal arms were &lt;strong&gt;a white dragon&lt;/strong&gt; with red eyes breathing red flame on a black field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Eleana was known to possess a white and gold colored dragon egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Elaena&amp;#39;s most cherished possession was a dragon&amp;#39;s egg whose stony shell &lt;strong&gt;showed the same colors as her hair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her hair was a &lt;strong&gt;platinum white with a bright golden streak&lt;/strong&gt; down the middle...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The curse of the Three deaths&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dany&amp;#39;s eldest brother, and the heir to the throne, dies to treachery. He is followed many years after by Viserys, who is murdered by his host. And that fateful night in the Dothraki sea, the maegi betrays her, and &lt;strong&gt;a life is snuffed out within her body, which is as much her death as that of her unborn child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at Jon, we see that &lt;strong&gt;the same macabre pattern continues,&lt;/strong&gt; whereby his eldest sister and Rheagar&amp;#39;s heir, Rhaenys, is slain by a treacherous Lannister, and his brother Aegon smashed by another. He too follows years after, stabbed by mutineers of the Nights Watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Arya&amp;#39;s eldest brother, Robb, &lt;strong&gt;is betrayed and killed after he becomes a king.&lt;/strong&gt; If this indeed is a requirement to ride a dragon, will Sansa to find herself murdered ? And what form will Arya&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;death&amp;#39; take ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;But what about Tyrion ?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you reading about?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dragons,&amp;quot; Tyrion told him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What good is that? There are no more dragons,&amp;quot; the boy said with the easy certainty of youth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So they say,&amp;quot; Tyrion replied. &amp;quot;Sad, isn&amp;#39;t it? When I was your age, &lt;strong&gt;I used to dream of having a dragon of my own.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would all love for Tyrion to ultimately get to ride a dragon, and he does seem to be foreshadowed to be Viserion&amp;#39;s rider, as his cyvasse dragon is always white, and gold is the Lannister color. But how does this stack up with our theory.

He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, &lt;strong&gt;when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke.&lt;/strong&gt;....To temper it this time, &lt;strong&gt;he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.&lt;/strong&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dragons as the Lightbringer has been already speculated, but how it fits with the story of its forging had not been that clear.
