That will be Renly&amp;#39;s first thought when he sees LF after the victory parade. LF may have provide him with a some important early intel but ultimately Renly never even uses it; Stannis announces it to the realm and it&amp;#39;s not as if LF has any definitive proof (unless the tapestry theory is true). Also, once Renly has won, everyone will believe they&amp;#39;re at war with Eurasia anyway...unless LF has something more to offer then he&amp;#39;s surplus to requirements (i.e. use Harrenhal etc etc as a reward/bribe for e.g. Tarly)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg6oaus", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492064847.0, "created_utc": 1492036047.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wzlr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 57, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BryndenBFish", "parent_id": "t3_64y5hm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Great questions.

She's come all the way down from Riverrun, a long way ahorse. I fear she never saw your little letter.\"\n\n&gt; \"Joffrey is not my brother's seed,\" Stannis said bluntly. \"Nor is Tommen. They are bastards. The girl as well. All three of them abominations born of incest.\"\n\n&gt; *Would even Cersei be so mad?* Catelyn was speechless.\n\n&gt; \"Isn't that a sweet story, my lady?\" Renly asked. \"I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received his letter, and I must say, it took my breath away.\" He smiled at his brother. \"I had never suspected you were so clever, Stannis. Were it only true, you would indeed be Robert's heir.\" (ACOK, Catelyn III)\n\nHowever, what legal rationale would Renly have to unseat Cersei... if he didn't know about the incest?

It's not a stretch to me that Littlefinger was the reason why Renly wanted to plant Margaery in Robert's bed and eventually make her queen.\n\nDeposing Cersei Lannister would certainly introduce a degree of chaos into Westeros as Tywin wouldn't take this lightly, and this works to boost Littlefinger's prestige as well to Renly and perhaps Robert.\n\nBy ACOK though, Robert is dead, Renly has the loyalty of Highgarden. So, what's Littlefinger's play? To me, it seems like he wins either way. If Renly wins, he's already buds with Renly. So, he's likely to remain at least in his position. If Joffrey wins, nothing really happens. However, he gets the chance to reward himself by volunteering to go to the Tyrells after the death of Renly.\n\nSo, I think Littlefinger is playing both sides between Renly and Joff in ACOK and looks to win out either way.
