The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change it.\"\n\nThis in turn echoes Maester Aemon's speech about the pain of choosing:\n\n&gt;Maester Aemon sighed. \"Have you heard nothing I've told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?\" He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. \"Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old. By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation. What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother's poor grandson, and his son, and even the little children...\"\n\nBloodraven's tragedy is that, for all sorcerous might, he was just as helpless as Aemon was during Robert's Rebellion. It's very easy to see him seeking vengeance for his family to make up for his failure to protect them.\n\nSome additional notes on the cat:\n\n&gt;One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel ... all but this one, this **one-eared black devil** of a tomcat.\n\n* Both the quail incident and Arya's difficulty in catching him imply that Balerion is no ordinary cat, and the latter echoes Jon's observation about one of Bloodraven's other animals:\n\n\t&gt;*That bird is too clever by half.*\n\n* The missing ear echoes Bloodraven's missing eye.\n* This is one of only three times word \"devil\" is used outside of the phrase \"bog devils\". The second \"devil\" is the aforementioned boar:\n\n\t&gt;\"A boar.\" Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with blood.\n\n\t&gt;\"**A devil**,\" the king husked. \n\n\tAnd the third is a man of the Night's Watch:\n\n\t&gt;He'd sent one of his bastards, that Walder Rivers, and the next thing Chett had known he was walking to the Wall with that foul-smelling **black devil** Yoren.\n\n* Bloodraven's great-great-...-great-niece's pet is a logical choice for one of his familiars.\n* [Enemy Eats Your Lunch](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyEatsYourLunch) is an established psychological warfare tactic in both fiction and real life.\n* Bloodraven is absolutely that petty:\n\n\t&gt;\"One-and-twenty sorts of birds,\" said Ser Kyle.\n\n\t&gt;\"One-and-twenty sorts of bird droppings,\" said Ser Maynard.\n\n\t&gt;\"You have no poetry in your heart, ser.\"\n\n\t&gt;\"You have shit upon your shoulder.\"\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;\"Very good. See that my horse is saddled and ready. I mean for us to ride within the hour. Have you eaten? Craster serves plain fare, but filling.\"\n\n\t&gt;*I will not eat Craster's food*, he decided suddenly. \"I broke my fast with the men, my lord.\" Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw. **The bird hopped back to Mormont's shoulder, where it promptly shat. \"You might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me,\"** the Old Bear grumbled. The raven *quorked*.\n\nPlugging \"boar\" into asearchoficeandfire reveals a TON of foreshadowing for Bloodraven skinchanging the one that killed Robert. (I'm considering making new thread entirely since none of the existing ones go into much detail, but I'm not sure when to do that instead of posting here. Could anyone clarify?)\n\n*  The boar is called a \"bastard\" not once but three times:\n\n\t&gt;\"Stinks,\" Robert said. \"The stink of death, don't think I can't smell it. **Bastard** did me good, eh? But I \u2026 I paid him back in kind, Ned.\"\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;\"Serve the boar at my funeral feast,\" Robert rasped. \"Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp. Eat the **bastard**. Don't care if you choke on him. Promise me, Ned.\"\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;\"Ah, fuck you, Ned,\" the king said hoarsely. \"I killed the **bastard**, didn't I?\"\n\n* It is thrice suggested that the boar was some sort of divine punishment:\n\n\t&gt;\"The girl. Daenerys. Only a child, you were right \u2026 that's why, the girl \u2026 **the gods sent the boar \u2026 sent to punish me** \u2026\"\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;\"A hunter lives a perilous life. If the boar had not done for Robert, it would have been a fall from a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astray \u2026 **the forest is the abbatoir of the gods.**\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;\"Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and gold is all . . . but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and **the Whoremonger King is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven** and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!\" He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle. \"There comes the Harbinger! **Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!**\"\n\n* There are two separate allusions to the idea of someone having skinchanged it:\n\n\t&gt;Stannis ground his teeth. \"If someone said I had **magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert**, likely they would believe that as well.\"\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;\"In time,\" said the High Septon. \"You also stand accused of conspiring at the murder of your own lord husband, our late beloved King Robert, First of His Name.\"\n\n\t&gt;*Lancel*, Cersei thought. **\"Robert was killed by a boar. Do they say I am a skinchanger now? A warg?\"**\n\n* And there are some miscellaneous hints like the time loop where the pit fighter Barsena **Blackhair** faces (and is killed by) a boar:\n\n\t&gt;The boar was a huge beast, with tusks as long as a man's forearm and small **eyes that swam with rage**. She wondered whether **the boar that had killed Robert Baratheon had looked as fierce**.\n\n\t--\n\t&gt;The boar raised his head, snorting \u2026 and flame engulfed him, **black fire shot with red.** Dany felt the wash of heat thirty feet away. **The beast's dying scream sounded almost human.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/53gnc2/spoilers_main_bloodravens_revenge/\"&gt;Bloodraven&amp;#39;s revenge&lt;/a&gt; posits that Bloodraven was skinchanging into both a black tomcat (generally agreed to be Rhaenys&amp;#39;s kitten Balerion) that once stole a roast quail from Tywin and the boar that killed Robert Baratheon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a general note:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Men came to the Wall from all of the Seven Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, no matter how many oaths a man swore ... as Jon himself had good reason to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jon parallels Bloodraven very heavily and his statement here is echoed by Bloodraven&amp;#39;s later words to Bran:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You cannot speak to him, try as you might.

The second &amp;quot;devil&amp;quot; is the aforementioned boar:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A boar.&amp;quot; Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;A devil&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; the king husked. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the third is a man of the Night&amp;#39;s Watch:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d sent one of his bastards, that Walder Rivers, and the next thing Chett had known he was walking to the Wall with that foul-smelling &lt;strong&gt;black devil&lt;/strong&gt; Yoren.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodraven&amp;#39;s great-great-...-great-niece&amp;#39;s pet is a logical choice for one of his familiars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyEatsYourLunch\"&gt;Enemy Eats Your Lunch&lt;/a&gt; is an established psychological warfare tactic in both fiction and real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodraven is absolutely that petty:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One-and-twenty sorts of birds,&amp;quot; said Ser Kyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One-and-twenty sorts of bird droppings,&amp;quot; said Ser Maynard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have no poetry in your heart, ser.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have shit upon your shoulder.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very good.

(I&amp;#39;m considering making new thread entirely since none of the existing ones go into much detail, but I&amp;#39;m not sure when to do that instead of posting here. Could anyone clarify?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boar is called a &amp;quot;bastard&amp;quot; not once but three times:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stinks,&amp;quot; Robert said. &amp;quot;The stink of death, don&amp;#39;t think I can&amp;#39;t smell it. &lt;strong&gt;Bastard&lt;/strong&gt; did me good, eh? But I \u2026 I paid him back in kind, Ned.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Serve the boar at my funeral feast,&amp;quot; Robert rasped. &amp;quot;Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp.

Daenerys. Only a child, you were right \u2026 that&amp;#39;s why, the girl \u2026 &lt;strong&gt;the gods sent the boar \u2026 sent to punish me&lt;/strong&gt; \u2026&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A hunter lives a perilous life. If the boar had not done for Robert, it would have been a fall from a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astray \u2026 &lt;strong&gt;the forest is the abbatoir of the gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and gold is all . . . but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and &lt;strong&gt;the Whoremonger King is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven&lt;/strong&gt; and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!&amp;quot; He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle. &amp;quot;There comes the Harbinger! &lt;strong&gt;Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two separate allusions to the idea of someone having skinchanged it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stannis ground his teeth. &amp;quot;If someone said I had &lt;strong&gt;magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert&lt;/strong&gt;, likely they would believe that as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In time,&amp;quot; said the High Septon. &amp;quot;You also stand accused of conspiring at the murder of your own lord husband, our late beloved King Robert, First of His Name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancel&lt;/em&gt;, Cersei thought. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Robert was killed by a boar. Do they say I am a skinchanger now? A warg?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are some miscellaneous hints like the time loop where the pit fighter Barsena &lt;strong&gt;Blackhair&lt;/strong&gt; faces (and is killed by) a boar:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The boar was a huge beast, with tusks as long as a man&amp;#39;s forearm and small &lt;strong&gt;eyes that swam with rage&lt;/strong&gt;.

He hated archers.** (ASOS Jaime I)\n\nIn his first chapter, Jaime thinks to himself that he hates archers. This could foreshadow him getting killed by one.\n\n&gt; Jaime told him, for all the good it did. \u201cCatelyn Stark does not rule in Riverrun,\u201d Ser Robin\nshouted back. **Four archers crowded into position on either side of him, two standing and two kneeling.** \u201cCast your swords into the water.\u201d \n\n&gt; \u201cI have no sword,\u201d he returned, \u201cbut if I did, I\u2019d stick it through your belly and **hack the balls off those four cravens.\u201d** (ASOS Jaime I)\n\nJaime later expresses his intention to castrate the archers. This could be a hint that the archer who'll end up killing him will be a eunuch. So Theon, of course.\n\n&gt; **I was that close to crossing swords with the Kingslayer himself.\u201d** Theon held his hands two feet apart. \u201cDaryn Hornwood came between us, and died for it.\u201d (ACOK  Theon III)\n\nTheon may yet get the chance to face (and kill) the Kingslayer.\n\n&gt; Husband made a face. \u201cA big woman, dressed like a man. **And the one in chains... I didn\u2019t fancy the look of his eyes.\u201d**\n\n&gt; Anguy smiled over his ale. **\u201cWhen I don\u2019t fancy a man\u2019s eyes, I put an arrow through one.\u201d** (ASOS Arya II)\n\nHusband says that he didn't fancy the look of Jaime's eyes, and Anguy says that when he doesn't fancy a man's eyes, he puts an arrow through one. This could foreshadow Jaime being killed with an arrow.\n\n&gt; \u201cI will permit you to take the black. Ned Stark\u2019s bastard is the Lord Commander on the Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; The Blackfish narrowed his eyes. \u201cDid your father arrange for that as well? Catelyn never trusted the boy, as I recall, no more than she ever trusted **Theon Greyjoy.**\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; It was a good thing that Jaime wore no sword; elsewise he would have ripped his blade out, and **if Ser Brynden did not slay him, the archers on the walls most surely would.** \u201cAre there any terms you will accept?\u201d he demanded of the Blackfish. (AFFC Jaime VI)\n\nShortly after a mention of Theon, Jaime thinks that the archers would slay him if he took out his sword. This could foreshadow Theon killing Jaime with an arrow while he has a sword in hand.\n\n&gt; \u201cYour brother\u2019s son, Ser Cleos,\u201d said Jaime. **\u201cHe was with us until outlaws filled him full of arrows.** Urswyck and this lot took his goods and **left him for the wolves.\u201d** (ASOS Jaime IV)\n\nJaime's cousin was shot full of arrows and left for the wolves, which could foreshadow Jaime being shot full of arrows and left for the wolf, Bran.\n\n&gt;  \u201cAs you learned from Ser Boros and Ser Meryn?\u201d\n\n&gt; **That arrow hit too close to the mark.** (ASOS Jaime)\n\nThis could foreshadow Jaime being killed with an arrow.\n\nBrienne dreams of how Renly died in AFFC, only to find that in his place is Jaime:\n\n&gt; That night she dreamed herself in Renly's tent again. All the candles were guttering out, and the cold was thick around her. Something was moving through green darkness, something foul and horrible was hurtling toward her king. She wanted to protect him, but her limbs felt stiff and frozen, and it took more strength than she had just to lift her hand. **And when the shadow sword sliced through the green steel gorget and the blood began to flow, she saw that the dying king was not Renly after all but Jaime Lannister, and she had failed him.**\n\nThis could foreshadow that Jaime, like Renly, will die in Brienne's arms, becoming the second man she loves to do so. Also, Jaime tells Bronn in the show that he would like to die in the arms of the woman he loves. He was referring to Cersei, but we all know it's really Brienne.\n\n&gt; \u201cSer Ryman did. Rode up to the castle gates half-drunk and blustering, making threats. The Blackfish appeared on the ramparts long enough to say that he would not waste fair words on foul men. Then he put an arrow in the rump of Ryman\u2019s palfrey. The horse reared, Frey fell into the mud, and I laughed so hard I almost pissed myself. **If it had been me inside the castle, I would have put that arrow through Ryman\u2019s lying throat.\u201d**\n\n&gt; **\u201cI\u2019ll wear a gorget when I treat with them,\u201d said Jaime, with a half smile.** (AFFC Jaime V)\n\nThis could foreshadow the arrow going through Jaime's throat. Note that Renly was also stabbed through the throat before dying in Brienne's arms.\n\nJacelyn Bywater was the commander of the gold cloaks, like Jaime is the commander of the white cloaks, and he wore an iron hand in place of his right hand. This inspired Jaime to start wearing his gold hand:\n\n&gt; He looked at his stump and grimaced. I must do something about that. **If the late Ser Jacelyn Bywater could wear an iron hand, he should have a gold one.** Cersei might like that. A golden hand to stroke her golden hair, and hold her hard against me.\n\nHe was shot with an arrow through the throat:\n\n&gt; \"During the battle. Your sister sent the Kettleblacks to fetch the king back to the Red Keep, the way I hear it. When the gold cloaks saw him leaving, half of them decided they'd leave with him. Ironhand put himself in their path and tried to order them back to the walls. They say Bywater was blistering them good and almost had 'em ready to turn **when someone put an arrow through his neck.** He didn't seem so fearsome then, so they dragged him off his horse and killed him.\n\nSo this could foreshadow Jaime meeting a similar fate.", "edited": 1492095210.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5owx1i/spoilers_extended_brans_revenge/\"&gt;Bran will kill Jaime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve figured out how Bran will kill Jaime: he will &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/627d4r/bran_will_skinchange_theon/\"&gt;skinchange Theon&lt;/a&gt; and shoot him full of arrows.

This could foreshadow him getting killed by one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jaime told him, for all the good it did. \u201cCatelyn Stark does not rule in Riverrun,\u201d Ser Robin\nshouted back. &lt;strong&gt;Four archers crowded into position on either side of him, two standing and two kneeling.&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cCast your swords into the water.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have no sword,\u201d he returned, \u201cbut if I did, I\u2019d stick it through your belly and &lt;strong&gt;hack the balls off those four cravens.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; (ASOS Jaime I)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jaime later expresses his intention to castrate the archers. This could be a hint that the archer who&amp;#39;ll end up killing him will be a eunuch. So Theon, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was that close to crossing swords with the Kingslayer himself.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; Theon held his hands two feet apart. \u201cDaryn Hornwood came between us, and died for it.\u201d (ACOK  Theon III)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theon may yet get the chance to face (and kill) the Kingslayer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Husband made a face. \u201cA big woman, dressed like a man. &lt;strong&gt;And the one in chains... I didn\u2019t fancy the look of his eyes.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anguy smiled over his ale. &lt;strong&gt;\u201cWhen I don\u2019t fancy a man\u2019s eyes, I put an arrow through one.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; (ASOS Arya II)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband says that he didn&amp;#39;t fancy the look of Jaime&amp;#39;s eyes, and Anguy says that when he doesn&amp;#39;t fancy a man&amp;#39;s eyes, he puts an arrow through one. This could foreshadow Jaime being killed with an arrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI will permit you to take the black. Ned Stark\u2019s bastard is the Lord Commander on the Wall.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Blackfish narrowed his eyes. \u201cDid your father arrange for that as well? Catelyn never trusted the boy, as I recall, no more than she ever trusted &lt;strong&gt;Theon Greyjoy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a good thing that Jaime wore no sword; elsewise he would have ripped his blade out, and &lt;strong&gt;if Ser Brynden did not slay him, the archers on the walls most surely would.&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cAre there any terms you will accept?\u201d he demanded of the Blackfish. (AFFC Jaime VI)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after a mention of Theon, Jaime thinks that the archers would slay him if he took out his sword. This could foreshadow Theon killing Jaime with an arrow while he has a sword in hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYour brother\u2019s son, Ser Cleos,\u201d said Jaime. &lt;strong&gt;\u201cHe was with us until outlaws filled him full of arrows.&lt;/strong&gt; Urswyck and this lot took his goods and &lt;strong&gt;left him for the wolves.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; (ASOS Jaime IV)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jaime&amp;#39;s cousin was shot full of arrows and left for the wolves, which could foreshadow Jaime being shot full of arrows and left for the wolf, Bran.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAs you learned from Ser Boros and Ser Meryn?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That arrow hit too close to the mark.&lt;/strong&gt; (ASOS Jaime)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could foreshadow Jaime being killed with an arrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brienne dreams of how Renly died in AFFC, only to find that in his place is Jaime:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That night she dreamed herself in Renly&amp;#39;s tent again. All the candles were guttering out, and the cold was thick around her. Something was moving through green darkness, something foul and horrible was hurtling toward her king. She wanted to protect him, but her limbs felt stiff and frozen, and it took more strength than she had just to lift her hand. &lt;strong&gt;And when the shadow sword sliced through the green steel gorget and the blood began to flow, she saw that the dying king was not Renly after all but Jaime Lannister, and she had failed him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could foreshadow that Jaime, like Renly, will die in Brienne&amp;#39;s arms, becoming the second man she loves to do so. Also, Jaime tells Bronn in the show that he would like to die in the arms of the woman he loves. He was referring to Cersei, but we all know it&amp;#39;s really Brienne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSer Ryman did. Rode up to the castle gates half-drunk and blustering, making threats. The Blackfish appeared on the ramparts long enough to say that he would not waste fair words on foul men. Then he put an arrow in the rump of Ryman\u2019s palfrey. The horse reared, Frey fell into the mud, and I laughed so hard I almost pissed myself. &lt;strong&gt;If it had been me inside the castle, I would have put that arrow through Ryman\u2019s lying throat.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll wear a gorget when I treat with them,\u201d said Jaime, with a half smile.&lt;/strong&gt; (AFFC Jaime V)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could foreshadow the arrow going through Jaime&amp;#39;s throat. Note that Renly was also stabbed through the throat before dying in Brienne&amp;#39;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jacelyn Bywater was the commander of the gold cloaks, like Jaime is the commander of the white cloaks, and he wore an iron hand in place of his right hand. This inspired Jaime to start wearing his gold hand:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He looked at his stump and grimaced. I must do something about that. &lt;strong&gt;If the late Ser Jacelyn Bywater could wear an iron hand, he should have a gold one.&lt;/strong&gt; Cersei might like that. A golden hand to stroke her golden hair, and hold her hard against me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was shot with an arrow through the throat:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During the battle. Your sister sent the Kettleblacks to fetch the king back to the Red Keep, the way I hear it. When the gold cloaks saw him leaving, half of them decided they&amp;#39;d leave with him. Ironhand put himself in their path and tried to order them back to the walls. They say Bywater was blistering them good and almost had &amp;#39;em ready to turn &lt;strong&gt;when someone put an arrow through his neck.&lt;/strong&gt; He didn&amp;#39;t seem so fearsome then, so they dragged him off his horse and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this could foreshadow Jaime meeting a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg7mtxo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123251.0, "created_utc": 1492094451.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
