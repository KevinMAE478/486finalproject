Some of the most expensive bottles in the world are from Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem and are over 100 years old. \n\nIn general, two main things help preserve wine as it ages, Tannins and Sugar. The tannins are what make you pucker and the sugar is obvious. When they break down over time, the fruit comes forward until the wine starts to go bad and become vinegar. \n\nThe high sugar content is also why some Riesling's from the French Alsace and German Mosel and Rhine regions are so highly prized. \n\nBut, if I was betting, I would say Arbor Gold is probably based on the Muscat grape family; which is one of the sweeter types in general and is one of the most ancient grapes used for wine in the Mediterranean and grows well on Mediterranean islands. \n\nThe reds could be something like this: the big prized Burgundies are the most purple and made from the delicate and difficult to grow Pinot Noir. They also need colder weather than the Bordeauxs. So they are probably from the higher elevations of The Reach. I am however flummoxed that Lord Redwyne makes a deep purple Burgundy style wine on The Arbor. \n\nThe Deep reds are probably Bordeaux types which are Cabernet Sauvingnon with some of the more mellow reds being like Bordeaux's Merlot, Cab Franc and the blends. \nThe sweeter reds are probably like Beaujolais Nouveau, which is just an un-aged wine made from Gamay; which can be very good and sometimes more fruity that sugary. \"pure wine\" tasting in some people's opinion (mine too).\n\nThe red that Oberyn makes fun of HAS to be Lambrusco. It is a sweet, sometimes fizzy, light bodied Italian wine. Knowing George growing up in the NYC area, this was a cheap standard that was on every italian restaurant's table back in the day; along with the poorer versions of Chianti. \nBut, he could be making fun of a white Zinfandel or a sweet Rose as opposed to a nice dry Rose, which I would expect to be made in Dorne. \n\nThe more common whites are probably very much like all the different Chardonnay styles and Pinot Gris/Grigio. \n\nSpicy reds and Sour reds are interesting. Spicy: Syrah is known to have spice and grows well in the French Rhone and to the Riviera coast. Hermitage is the best example.  Chateuneuf du Pape being a good example of a similar style with Syrah, Grenache or Cinsault. Abig grape that produces fruity and a lot of spice is Grenache, Garnacha in Spain and Mouverdre, Mataro in Spain, and these are used in Rhine and Southern French wines and also good for blending. I wouldn't be surprised if this type of grape grew in The Reach and Dorne. \n\nSour... this screams northern Italy, Nebbiolo grapes and the Piedmont... **OR** the sour wines are wines that just don't age well and start to turn. \n\nDornish wines make me think of a mixture of Italian and Spanish wines. Deep colored Rioja from Tempranillo, which many Riojas are also blended with Garnacha to give it spice. But the Grand daddies of Italy, Brunello di Montalcino (my favorite and I have been there, yay!) and Amarone della Valpolicella. Brunello is the pure Sangiovese Grosso, the larger cousin to Chianti which is made from Sangiovese; and is grown in Montalcino in Tuscany (think The Medici's). Amarone is a big deep wine grown inland from Venice. A bold wine. \nDorne is always associated with Spain, but I have also always received a Southern Italian and Sicilian vibe mixed in with the Spanish. Sometimes I lean all the way Sicilian ;)\n\nAny way, those are some wines one could try when thinking about some of the Westerosi wines. ", "edited": 1492306242.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my thoughts: &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR I have been a wine lover and &amp;quot;pretend buff&amp;quot; for a few decades and have drank my way across Europe and the USA drinkin wine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One reason Sauternes is so well liked is it is one of thw few white wines that age really well. Some of the most expensive bottles in the world are from Ch\u00e2teau d&amp;#39;Yquem and are over 100 years old. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, two main things help preserve wine as it ages, Tannins and Sugar. The tannins are what make you pucker and the sugar is obvious. When they break down over time, the fruit comes forward until the wine starts to go bad and become vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The high sugar content is also why some Riesling&amp;#39;s from the French Alsace and German Mosel and Rhine regions are so highly prized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if I was betting, I would say Arbor Gold is probably based on the Muscat grape family; which is one of the sweeter types in general and is one of the most ancient grapes used for wine in the Mediterranean and grows well on Mediterranean islands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reds could be something like this: the big prized Burgundies are the most purple and made from the delicate and difficult to grow Pinot Noir. They also need colder weather than the Bordeauxs. So they are probably from the higher elevations of The Reach. I am however flummoxed that Lord Redwyne makes a deep purple Burgundy style wine on The Arbor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Deep reds are probably Bordeaux types which are Cabernet Sauvingnon with some of the more mellow reds being like Bordeaux&amp;#39;s Merlot, Cab Franc and the blends. \nThe sweeter reds are probably like Beaujolais Nouveau, which is just an un-aged wine made from Gamay; which can be very good and sometimes more fruity that sugary. &amp;quot;pure wine&amp;quot; tasting in some people&amp;#39;s opinion (mine too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The red that Oberyn makes fun of HAS to be Lambrusco. It is a sweet, sometimes fizzy, light bodied Italian wine. Knowing George growing up in the NYC area, this was a cheap standard that was on every italian restaurant&amp;#39;s table back in the day; along with the poorer versions of Chianti. \nBut, he could be making fun of a white Zinfandel or a sweet Rose as opposed to a nice dry Rose, which I would expect to be made in Dorne. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more common whites are probably very much like all the different Chardonnay styles and Pinot Gris/Grigio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spicy reds and Sour reds are interesting. Spicy: Syrah is known to have spice and grows well in the French Rhone and to the Riviera coast. Hermitage is the best example.  Chateuneuf du Pape being a good example of a similar style with Syrah, Grenache or Cinsault. Abig grape that produces fruity and a lot of spice is Grenache, Garnacha in Spain and Mouverdre, Mataro in Spain, and these are used in Rhine and Southern French wines and also good for blending. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if this type of grape grew in The Reach and Dorne. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sour... this screams northern Italy, Nebbiolo grapes and the Piedmont... &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; the sour wines are wines that just don&amp;#39;t age well and start to turn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dornish wines make me think of a mixture of Italian and Spanish wines. Deep colored Rioja from Tempranillo, which many Riojas are also blended with Garnacha to give it spice. But the Grand daddies of Italy, Brunello di Montalcino (my favorite and I have been there, yay!) and Amarone della Valpolicella. Brunello is the pure Sangiovese Grosso, the larger cousin to Chianti which is made from Sangiovese; and is grown in Montalcino in Tuscany (think The Medici&amp;#39;s). Amarone is a big deep wine grown inland from Venice. A bold wine. \nDorne is always associated with Spain, but I have also always received a Southern Italian and Sicilian vibe mixed in with the Spanish.
