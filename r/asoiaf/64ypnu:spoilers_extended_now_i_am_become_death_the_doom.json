But before we jump into that, there&amp;#39;s an overwhelming, obvious allusion being made here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;...hell had swallowed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, a landscape of charred trees and burned bones...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A second sun rising in the north - the blast was so large it seemed as bright as the sun. Ashes raining down for half a year. Nightmarish devastation. Wildlife that takes decades to recover, and even now is strange. &lt;strong&gt;GRRM has written the legends of Hardhome to evoke a nuclear detonation, complete with the nuclear fallout (raining ashes) and catastrophic enviornmental devestation (nightmarish landscape).&lt;/strong&gt; The stories of demon hauntings and ghouls and burning ghosts could easily be garbled accounts of radiation poisoning or deformed people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that I&amp;#39;m not saying it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a nuclear bomb - it almost certainly was not - but GRRM is &lt;em&gt;intentionally evoking&lt;/em&gt; the image of one. Particularly the image of a second sun rising in the north, which is often how witnesses of a nuclear blast describe them. Here is a description of the Trinity test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After about a millisecond, the fireball from a 1 megaton nuclear weapon would appear to an observer 50 miles away to be many times more brilliant than the sun at noon... bursts in the megaton range have been seen directly as far a 700 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why? What reason would GRRM have to imply that Hardhome was the site of some sort of spontaneous nuclear explosion? I think the answer is that it wasn&amp;#39;t spontaneous. It was very, very controlled, in point of fact. I think it was a sort of... weapons test, if you will. A dry run for the big kaboom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Destroyer of Worlds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Trinity test site in New Mexico was the site of the first nuclear detonation in history. Hundreds of top Allied scientists, under the direction of Robert Oppenheimer, worked in secret for years, building on Einstein&amp;#39;s work and eventually succeeding in splitting the atom. The nuclear bomb would become America&amp;#39;s coup in World War II, providing a means to quickly and categorically put an end the ambitions of the brutal, conquest-hungry Japanese Empire with the least amount of human death possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon seeing the nuclear bomb detonate for the first time, Oppenheimer famously quoted the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;, saying &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Hardhome was the Trinity test of ASOIAF. And I believe the evocation of the Trinity test is done intentionally - this time, the responsible party &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; death - the destroyer of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the releveant timeline:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;800 Years Ago:&lt;/strong&gt; The Faceless Men come forth, inciting a slave rebellion on a fleet of Valyrian ships. The ships flee the wrath of the dragonlords and found the Free City of Braavos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;700 Years Ago:&lt;/strong&gt; Braavos reveals itself to the world. The Faceless Men begin to work for hire outside of Braavos, giving the gift, becoming infamous, and collecting their first century of &amp;quot;payments&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;600 Years Ago:&lt;/strong&gt; Hardhome destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;400 Years Ago:&lt;/strong&gt; The Doom of Valyria - as in, Hardhome, but an entire continent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that from the first moment of the Faceless Men, a very long, very intricate &lt;em&gt;cyvasse&lt;/em&gt; game began between the Faceless Men and the Valyrian Freehold - though the Valyrians never got a chance to figure this out. And we know that although the Faceless Men don&amp;#39;t mind extreme collateral damage, they brought &amp;quot;the gift&amp;quot; to the Valyrians as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arya drew back from him. \u201cHe killed the slave?\u201d That did not sound right. &lt;strong&gt;\u201cHe should have killed the masters!\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cHe would bring the gift to them as well... but that is a tale for another day, one best shared with no one.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the Kindly Man is claiming responsibility for the Doom of Valyria. Whether it was done directly or indirectly remains to be made explicit - hopefully we&amp;#39;ll hear more details by the time Arya is done with her training - but one thing that is certain is that the Faceless Men spent the three-hundred-eighty-odd years between the founding of Braavos and the Doom of Valyria &lt;em&gt;engineering the downfall of the Valyrians.&lt;/em&gt; And Hardhome is smack dab in the middle of that time period, behaving just like a little Doom of Valyria. And even though we already had the story from Jon, guess which two characters go out of their way to exposit it for us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, when the kindly man asked her what three things she knew that she had not known before, she was ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know why the Sealord seized the Goodheart. She was carrying slaves. Hundreds of slaves, women and children, roped together in her hold.\u201d Braavos had been founded by escaped slaves, and the slave trade was forbidden here. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I know where the slaves came from. They were wildlings from Westeros, from a place called Hardhome. An old ruined place, accursed.\u201d Old Nan had told her tales of Hardhome, back at Winterfell when she had still been Arya Stark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right, the Free Folk from Hardhome end up in Braavos of all places - and Tycho Nestoris&amp;#39;s fleet was weirdly given to the Night&amp;#39;s Watch to rescue many more. Arya even specifically mentions the Doom of Hardhome to the Kindly Man - who, probably, is trying really hard not to give away spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire, made Flesh, made Fire Again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what could be the source of the blast? One thing is certain: it was much less intense than the Doom of Valyria, where hell swallowed an entire fucking continent. Here are the prevailing theories on the Doom, with the answers we can safely eliminate crossed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;To this day, no one knows what caused the Doom. &lt;del&gt;Most say that it was a natural cataclysm&lt;/del&gt;\u2014a catastrophic explosion caused by the eruption of all Fourteen Flames together. &lt;del&gt;Some septons, less wise, claim that the Valyrians brought the disaster on themselves for their promiscuous belief in a hundred gods and more, and in their godlessness they delved too deep and unleashed the fires of the Seven hells on the Freehold.&lt;/del&gt; A handful of maesters, influenced by fragments of the work of Septon Barth, hold that Valyria had used spells to tame the Fourteen Flames for thousands of years, that their ceaseless hunger for slaves and wealth was as much to sustain these spells as to expand their power, and that when at last those spells faltered, the cataclysm became inevitable.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we see that the Fourteen Flames exploded. And we know those volcanos are not &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; - the fires beneath the earth are not just natural occurences, as in our world, but the domain of fire wyrms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cFire wyrms. Some say they are akin to dragons, for wyrms breathe fire too. Instead of soaring through the sky, they bore through stone and soil. If the old tales can be believed, there were wyrms amongst the Fourteen Flames even before the dragons came.&lt;/strong&gt; The young ones are no larger than that skinny arm of yours, but they can grow to monstrous size and have no love for men.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And dragons heating the &amp;quot;furnaces of the world&amp;quot; would make sense - a common saying among the more magically knowledgable in ASOIAF is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Dragons are fire made flesh, and fire is power.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course there were dragons in Westeros too, long ago. Dragonglass is plentiful north of the Wall, and the story of Florian the Fool contains a dragon. But a dragon makes no sense. &lt;em&gt;Valyria&lt;/em&gt; had thousands of dragons - and like Hardhome, the Doom occured in the space of a single day, consuming them all in an inferno so hot that &amp;quot;even dragons burned.&amp;quot; So now let&amp;#39;s return to the idea of nuclear weapons. Dragons are, of course, a very heavy-handed metaphor for nuclear weapons - GRRM has said this over and over again in interviews, and the many different allusions to nuclear war in the account of the Dance of the Dragons do a fine job of illustrating the concept of mutually assured destruction. But what if the metaphor were more literal? What if dragons, fire made flesh, &lt;em&gt;could be made into fire again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though we have only fragments (thanks, GRRM) TWOIAF gives us a hint that something like this may have happened at Summerhall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...the blood of the dragon gathered in one...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;...seven eggs, to honor the seven gods,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;though the king&amp;#39;s own septon had warned... ...pyromancers... ...wild fire... ...flames grew out of control...towering...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;burned so hot that...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;...died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe that given sufficient stimulation, a dragon egg can be detonated instead of hatched, releasing the concentrated &amp;quot;fire power&amp;quot; of the egg in one catastrophic blast, on par with a nuclear bomb.&lt;/strong&gt; Although Aegon wasn&amp;#39;t trying to detonate anything, I believe the involvement of the pyromancers (whose arts are tied to the existence of dragons, and who beg Cersei to be allowed to hatch any newly discovered dragon eggs) destabilized the eggs, causing a partial detonation that, while not on the scale of Hardhome, was more than sufficient to wipe out Summerhall and kill Dunk, Egg, and most of the last Valyrian family tree (And who knows, maybe the Faceless interfered with Summerhall as well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Faceless Men tested their dragon egg &amp;quot;suitcase nuke&amp;quot; at Hardhome (their &amp;quot;Trinity&amp;quot; site) to see how much destruction exactly one egg could cause. Once they knew that, they poured all their efforts into weakening the Valyrians and stockpiling dragon eggs. And one fine day, they detonated dozens of eggs across the Valyrian peninsula, causing a chain reaction with the eggs of the fire wyrms in the Fourteen Flames, and consuming the continent in an apocolypse of sorcery, fire, and blood - the ultimate commupance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Oh, and if you&amp;#39;re wondering how the Faceless could be monstrous, remember that Hardhome was a few thousand people at most - if the Faceless Men caused the Doom, they incinerated millions of innocent slaves along with their masters. And the story of the revolt is begun by the Faceless killing a slave - a precursor to a story with lots of innocent death. But that&amp;#39;s all right. &lt;em&gt;Valar Morghulis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last thought: if a certain godless man paid for a certain assassination with a certain egg, the Faceless Men may have one more nuclear bombshell to drop. And a certain godless man has sailed the Smoking Sea, and seen Valyria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Hardhome was a weapons test, the Faceless Men&amp;#39;s dry run for the Doom of Valyria. Both events are described with the same post-nuclear verbiage (as bright as the sun, raining ash, devastated wastelands, haunted and accursed, demons and ghouls and monsters) and the story of Hardhome and the fall of Valyria are both very prominent in Arya&amp;#39;s storyline and in the House of Black and White.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "What really happened at Hardhome?

Hardhome was the antithesis to Valyria, and very third-world by comparison. If the nuclear weapons testing analogy holds true, it would be like America testing its nuclear weapons in Bikini Atoll, except Valyria didn't bother relocating the native people first.\n\nFaceless Men would have been like the Rosenbergs, who discovered the weapon of mass destruction that Valyria had created and leaked the secrets back to Braavos.

Importantly, the Targaryens got visions to bail on the Valyrian continent 12 years before the Doom - and now, whaddya know, we have &amp;quot;dragons freeing slaves&amp;quot;, when only three short centuries ago dragons were the alpha and the omega of the slave trade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;an organization that I believe he&amp;#39;s setting up to be ultimately &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; (but which he has deliberately tried to represent as suspect and ambiguous, chiefly by holding out the real nature of the gift vis-a-vis slave-ZOMBIES)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree completely with this - I too have seen GRRM as ultimately &amp;quot;approving&amp;quot; of the FM. But most of all I think &amp;quot;the gift&amp;quot; and the HoBaWis a criticism of end-of-life care in the Western world - we focus too much on the horrific consequence of &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; that we forget to allow ourselves and our loved ones to live our lives. See the healer of Aemon in Braavos:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No potion will make him young again. Give him this [dreamwine] and let him die.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, we saw in AFFC that the Faceless are willing to take innocent life to achieve their goals. What&amp;#39;s the qualitative difference between one innocent to to three thousand innocents? It&amp;#39;s not out of the question for several thousand &amp;quot;Pates&amp;quot; to be sacrificed to bring down the Valyrian empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg6lfel", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061333.0, "created_utc": 1492032533.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6buls", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 49, "report_reasons": null, "author": "M_Tootles", "parent_id": "t3_64ypnu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The basic idea that there's a relationship between Hardhome and the Doom and that these events have some kind of dramatic motivation rather than just being \"stuff that happened\" seems noncontroversial.
