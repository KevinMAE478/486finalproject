And yet there\u2019s still more to discover. It\u2019s mind-bogglingly huge, basically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, just as in our own history, the \u201cOrient\u201d was once seen as a mysterious and exotic place, so too do the Westerosi view Essos.

Asshai, Carcosa, the City of the Winged Men, K\u2019Dath: all are known only through third-hand travellers\u2019 tales and maesters\u2019 books. Even Lomas Longstrider, renowned in Westeros for his travels, did not reach Asshai, having seen the Bone Mountains and believed he had reached the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some fans have wondered why it is that the world seems to abruptly end just east of Asshai \u2013 and what, possibly, could lay beyond it. One popular theory that, despite being debunked by GRRM himself, continues to endure, is that Essos and Westeros are actually connected: the far eastern part of Essos wraps around and connects to the far north of Westeros, either via land or an ice sheet. Others speculate that Essos does simply end \u2013 there\u2019s just nothing of interest past Asshai. Or, potentially, there might be either natural or magical factors that inhibit travel further than Asshai. Or (and I do believe this is the most likely option) GRRM just hasn\u2019t created anything further than that, because it\u2019s not important to the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another theory is based on Quaithe\u2019s prophecy to Daenerys in A Clash of Kings:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To go north, you must journey south, to reach the west you must go east. To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While, symbolically, the prophecy seems to allude to Daenerys needing to \u201creturn to her roots\u201d \u2013 something she does, in her final chapter of ADWD \u2013 others interpret it more literally, suggesting that when Dany invades Westeros, she will do so by travelling east: setting sail from the far eastern shore of Essos, circumnavigating the globe and thus arriving in Westeros from the west. Additionally, many speculated that \u201cto touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow\u201d refers to Asshai \u2013 also known as \u201cAsshai-by-the-Shadow\u201d. (I, being Essos-loving trash, sat up straight upon hearing this.) Sadly, this theory was put to rest by GRRM, who has said that Asshai would only ever be seen \u201cin flashback and memory, if at all\u201d. My Essos-loving heart wept upon reading that.
