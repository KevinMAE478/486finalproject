The treasury will be empty and the Iron Bank, along with other creditors, will insist on the repayments of past debts. GRRM wanted to learn more about Aragorn's tax policy or how he dealt with the defeated orcs and men after Sauron was defeated.

Some people will still successfully do it but most of the enthusiasts will give up trying it after they fail over and over again. This will take a lot of time but magic will greatly perish because of global reasons and magic users giving up after failure.\n\n&gt; 6) What is the 'sweet' part of your bittersweet ending?\n\nThe cataclysmic end is averted and seasonal balance is restored.
