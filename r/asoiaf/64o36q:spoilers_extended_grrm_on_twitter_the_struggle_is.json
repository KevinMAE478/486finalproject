This sucks so hard, but especially hard for the fans who began the series before it got so big and popular.  \n\nI caught up on the show after season 3 concluded because at that point there was a lot of \"buzz\" surrounding it. I never thought I would get so excited about a something like this! So  I plowed through the all books in the course of the summer in 2013. I really wanted to see Dany get to Westeros and stuff (I mean, who wouldn't?) After all, the world that Mr. Martin created had completely captured my imagination. The fantasy setting was grounded by these very relatable characters, and the mysteries of their world are so incredibly tantalizing. I love learning about the lore and histories that flesh out the setting of the story--I've even become more appreciative and cognizant of actual medieval history now too.  \n\nBut I remember exactly what happened the night I finished Dance: I Googled GRRM and found his...LiveJournal? This guy who wrote these awesome stories is just an affable, earnest dork from NJ that now lives in the southwest? And he has a...LiveJournal? And he even uses the \"current mood\" avatar things in his entries? I'm not knocking it at all, but it took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting it to be that easy or that accessible. I forgot that this guy had been living the unassuming fantasy writer life for so long. His was a niche market, and I was an outsider. \n\nOf course, it didn't take long for me to find this subreddit. The top post of all time at that time was an energetic question about Varys' \"master plan\" and all that cool speculative stuff that would eventually become the black tar heroine it is for me today. \n\nBut I didn't find what I was REALLY looking for. See, it only took a few clicks to realize the truth about just how long the wait had been for precious Dance, and how unlikely it was that Winds would be out soon. There weren't any posts on here about a publication date or anything of the sort. I was so new to this that I figured it couldn't be THAT long, right? I mean, the guy has written so much, so he MUST have a sense of where to go/how to end it all sooner than later, right? Then I go back to the books and look at the gaps in the publication dates.

You all have known about this incredible world, and have been here for years and years, and have watched as newcomers like myself inhale it all as you had. And yet, now we're all just as \"caught up\" as you. To make matters worse the show is filling in gaps and answering almost sacred questions about character's fates that perhaps would have felt more special to have been revealed in the intimacy of print.   \n\nThe show is wonderful and it treats the source material with reverence, but for the people who have been on board since the beginning, my heart goes out to you all.
