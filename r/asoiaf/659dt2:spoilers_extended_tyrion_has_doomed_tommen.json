It occurred to me that Tyrion has been and will be responsible for the deaths of all of Cersei&amp;#39;s children. He doesn&amp;#39;t know it and he truly didn&amp;#39;t intend for them to die due to his machinations. But unfortunately, he has doomed them all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joffrey:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tyrion is the one that organizes the Lannister/Tyrell alliance: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bribes might sway some of the lesser lords,&amp;quot; Tyrion said, &amp;quot;but never Highgarden.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;True,&amp;quot; Littlefinger admitted. &amp;quot;The Knight of Flowers is the key there. Mace Tyrell has two older sons, but Loras has always been his favorite. Win him, and Highgarden will be yours.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, Tyrion thought. &amp;quot;It seems to me we should take a lesson from the late Lord Renly. We can win the Tyrell alliance as he did. With a marriage. Varys understood the quickest. &amp;quot;You think to wed King Joffrey to Margaery Tyrell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know how this ends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Littlefinger cleverly spreads information about Joffrey&amp;#39;s true nature through the Tyrell camp. Lady Olenna and Margaery confirm the truth from Sansa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sansa felt as though her heart had lodged in her throat. The Queen of Thorns was so close she could smell the old woman&amp;#39;s sour breath. Her gaunt thin fingers were pinching her wrist. To her other side, Margaery was listening as well. A shiver went through her. &amp;quot;A monster,&amp;quot; she whispered, so tremulously she could scarcely hear her own voice. &amp;quot;Joffrey is a monster. He lied about the butcher&amp;#39;s boy and made Father kill my wolf. When I displease him, he has the Kingsguard beat me. He&amp;#39;s evil and cruel, my lady, it&amp;#39;s so. And the queen as well.&amp;quot; Lady Olenna Tyrell and her granddaughter exchanged a look. &amp;quot;Ah,&amp;quot; said the old woman, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s a pity.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long before this conversation, Olenna and Littlefinger conspired to have Joffrey killed with the strangler. Ser Dontos gives Sansa the hairnet with the poison in Clash. It seems this conversation with Sansa was simply Olenna attempting to confirm the rumors she heard before following through with regicide. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Myrcella:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What a disgusting little worm you are. Myrcella is my only daughter. Did you truly imagine that I would allow you to sell her like a bag of oats? &amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Myrcella&lt;/em&gt;, he thought. &lt;em&gt;Well, that egg has hatched. Let&amp;#39;s see what color the chick is.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Hardly a bag of oats. Myrcella is a princess. Some would say this is what she was born for. Or did you plan to marry her to Tommen?&amp;quot; Her hand lashed out, knocking the wine cup from his hand to spill on the floor. &amp;quot;Brother or no, I should have your tongue out for that. I am Joffrey&amp;#39;s regent, not you, and I say that Myrcella will not be shipped off to this Dornishman the way I was shipped to Robert Baratheon.&amp;quot; Tyrion shook wine off his fingers and sighed. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Why not? She&amp;#39;d be a deal safer in Dorne than she is here.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Safer in Dorne.&amp;quot; Surely not and Martin knew that when he wrote that bit of foreshadowing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arianne conspires to crown Myrcella for her own selfish reasons. The plot fails and Myrcella is horribly disfigured at the hands of Ser Gerold Dayne. Now, it&amp;#39;s only fan speculation that Myrcella has died or will die from her wounds. But this quote from ADWD is enough to seal it for me that she won&amp;#39;t survive the attack: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Even a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,&amp;quot; said Tyrion, wounded. &amp;quot;Queen her, I said. Not kill her.&amp;quot;\nThe cheesemonger spooned up cherries. &amp;quot;In Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face and a death&amp;#39;s-head on the other. Yet it is the same coin. &lt;strong&gt;To queen her is to kill her. Dorne might rise for Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.&amp;quot;\nTyrion looked at the fat man with new interest. &lt;em&gt;He is right on both counts. To queen her is to kill her. And I knew that.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Futile gestures are all that remain to me. This one would make my sister weep bitter tears, at least.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To queen her is to kill her&amp;quot; -- and that&amp;#39;s exactly what Arianne did. She crowned her and in doing so, she killed her. An actual coronation was not necessary for Myrcella to be considered queen. By Dornish law, Myrcella was Joffrey&amp;#39;s rightful heir. This technicality (while not observed by all of Westeros) was enough to make Myrcella a queen and to doom her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally we come to Tommen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is quite possibly Tyrion&amp;#39;s worst offense towards his family. He didn&amp;#39;t intend for Joffrey and Myrcella to be harmed when he arranged their marriages. But he deliberately sends a dragon to King&amp;#39;s Landing all because of his hatred of Cersei.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The dwarf shrugged. \u201cDo you want to wager your throne upon a woman\u2019s whim? Go to Westeros, though \u2026 ah, then you are a rebel, not a beggar. Bold, reckless, a true scion of House Targaryen, walking in the footsteps of Aegon the Conqueror. A dragon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tyrion messes with Aegon&amp;#39;s head and implants the idea that he should skip going to Daenerys and head straight for Westeros. Because he was simply being cruel as he loves to be considering he is a powerless, stunted dwarf, he doesn&amp;#39;t expect Aegon to follow through with his plan.

Tarth, the Stepstones, even Estermont. And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm&amp;#39;s End.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now Aegon and his army are marching towards King&amp;#39;s Landing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention that when Tyrion hears Aegon and his army has turned to Westeros, he completely forgets that his last remaining nephew is in danger. It never occurs to him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I theorize that Aegon and his army will be successful and dispose of the last Lannister pretender.
