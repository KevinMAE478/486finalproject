On one side is R&amp;#39;hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror.

The comet was splendid and scary all at once. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The Red Sword,&amp;quot; the Bull named it&lt;/strong&gt;; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn&amp;#39;t a new sword, it was Ice, her father&amp;#39;s greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard&amp;#39;s blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King&amp;#39;s Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a theory that Gendry would reforge Ice and make it lightbringer.
