They have old cultural prohibitions against commerce, they have this whole thing with \"salt wives,\" they have this weird death/rebirth ritual for their priests, they have the \"No Godless Man May Sit on the Seastone Chair\" rule, they have this rule that they have to take things from the mainland by raiding and by stealing rather than by trade, and they have rules of war that effectively say they are not allowed to stay in any one place for very long.\n\nThere are a bunch of different reasons I can see why the Old Way would have these rules. Maybe this is just how the Ironborn survive, and their religion was written up to justify it. Maybe it is about social structure - the raiders are historically in control and want to limit the potential power of merchants. The ironborn seem more interested (like the Wildlings) in kidnapping women and using them for reproduction than in marrying and unifying families - it's not hard to understand why an ethnic group would refuse to intermarry as equals with another ethnic group, but are these reasons really satisfactory?\n\nHere's my theory, which is also my argument for why the Old Way of the Drowned God is the only human religion in Westeros that makes sense given the situation everybody is living in.\n\nThe Pact was not a pact of equals - the Children of the Forest and the weirwoods subjugated and enslaved humanity, and they maintained this control through the weirwoods (which is why those people think they are the \"First Men,\" because their history has been erased, why they don't have any ambition to advance their technology, why they engage in human sacrifice, why they periodically purge each other's populations.\n\nThe Ironborn were among those small groups of people around Westeros who managed to remain independent of the control of the trees. Their main weapon in doing this was by retreating to the Iron Islands, which are separated from the mainland by salt water, which the tree roots can't cross)\n\nSo, the rules of the Old Way are the rules the Ironborn developed to avoid being enslaved by the weirwoods and to continue surviving as individuals and as a civilization. They include:\n\n- Don't go to the mainland and stay. You don't belong there, and if you stay too long there the trees will enslave you with their magical powers.\n- Do not live anywhere where the trees could easily grow before you notice and enslave you. This includes areas of large arable farmland. (\"We do not sow.\")\n- The place where you live is pretty poor in a variety of stuff. It is okay to take stuff from the mainland, because the people who live there have succumbed to this strange servitude - they are the bad guys, they have no free will anyway.\n- The people from the mainland are slaves of the trees. Do not trust them, do not deal with them if you can avoid it. If you must deal with them regularly, take them away from the mainland, don't let them keep living there, and keep them under tight control and watch.\n- Your population is pretty limited, so it's okay to steal women from the mainland to increase your genetic diversity.\n- The key to stopping the trees is salt, especially salt water. The trees can't survive salt water. We have a bunch of ways you can use salt water to keep our people safe - including using it on the women you kidnap for reproductive purposes (your \"salt wives\"). \n- And the one I was referencing - If you need to attack a fortress, do it quickly, take what you need, kill the people in it (they're practically dead anyway) and get out. Don't set up a siege. Especially don't go looking for wood to make siege weapons, this will take you near the forests, where the trees will get you given enough time. The highest priority is that you can't stay on the mainland long, even for war.\n- We figured out one way to make sure the trees aren't controlling someone: kill them with salt water and then revive them. This will break the control the trees have over anyone. Our own leaders all have to go through this ritual before taking office to be sure (these became the priests of the Drowned God), and we absolutely have to do it to anybody who would actually be in charge of us (no Godless man may sit on the Seastone Chair).\n\nThis is all tinfoily and all very likely nonsense, and there are a lot of other explanations for what is happening. But, if you believe that the Old Way is a way of living that is supposed to protect you from the weirwoods, then it makes a whole lot of sense. And it means \n\nTo scale it way back, the Old Way seems like a religion focused on survival, and the main reason it seems so strange and useless and evil is that conditions in the world have been pretty good and it has stopped being necessary.\n\nBut I tend to think that as the various wars and existential threats to humanity come to a head, the actual Old Way is going to make a reappearance, likely through Theon, whose name means priestly and who has been initiated into the priesthood by Aeron, and we're going to see the more practical, useful, even good side of the Old Way.\n\nThat even if this isn't the explanation for what is going on, there will be some other explanation making all the specifics of the Old Way make a bit more sense, and making a strong case for it as a religion even if the actual Drowned God isn't that big of a deal.", "edited": 1492191997.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Part 2)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the Ironborn have really weird customs that seem to get in their way a lot and don&amp;#39;t seem to serve much of a modern purpose. They have old cultural prohibitions against commerce, they have this whole thing with &amp;quot;salt wives,&amp;quot; they have this weird death/rebirth ritual for their priests, they have the &amp;quot;No Godless Man May Sit on the Seastone Chair&amp;quot; rule, they have this rule that they have to take things from the mainland by raiding and by stealing rather than by trade, and they have rules of war that effectively say they are not allowed to stay in any one place for very long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of different reasons I can see why the Old Way would have these rules.
