It is  within his place to offer council, however, and that's what he's trying to do (however good or poor that council is).\n\nThat's what I was responding to. And it's important because the content of what Bowen is saying matters along with the way he's saying it and how often. He's not offering up an equally reasonable idea to Jon when he's asked about it, he's forcing discussion on a proven losing strategy ad nauseam to Jon and everyone else that will listen and openly questioning Jon in front of the men.\n\n&gt;By the time he reached the stable, Dolorous Edd had the lord commander's palfrey saddled and bridled and waiting for him. The wayns were forming up beneath Bowen Marsh's watchful eye. The Lord Steward was trotting down the column, pointing and fussing, his cheeks red from the cold. When he spied Jon, they reddened even more. \"Lord Commander. Are you still intent on this \u2026\"\n\n&gt;\"\u2026 folly?\" finished Jon. \"Please tell me you were not about to say folly, my lord. Yes, I am. We have been over this. Eastwatch wants more men. The Shadow Tower wants more men. Greyguard and Icemark as well, I have no doubt, and we have fourteen other castles still sitting empty, long leagues of Wall that remain unwatched and undefended.\"\n\nNotice the change from when Bowen first brings it up in an earlier chapter.\n\n&gt;\"They complained about Lord Commander Mormont too. Men love to complain about their wives and lords, he told me once. Those without wives complain twice as much about their lords.\" Jon Snow glanced toward the stockade. Two walls were down, a third falling fast. \"I will leave you to finish here, Bowen. Make certain every corpse is burned. Thank you for your counsel. I promise you, I will think on all you've said.\"\n\nMy point is that he's not being a wise councilor being treated poorly, he's being obstinate and at the end a mutineer. At every opportunity after the initial discussion he brings up how he thinks Jon is wrong and slowly builds up to more aggressive language, calling Jon's action treasonous at one point. To blame Jon for being bad at communicating is not a fair characterization, Marsh is incredibly stubborn and ends up killing Jon. And is preaching a strategy that will fail. \n\nHad he given other ideas, like perhaps Jon make peace with Roose/Ramsay Bolton for support of the Watch, suggested acquiring sell swords, giving Stannis more power in exchange for a permanent garrison, etc. and Jon was acting the same I'd agree that he was being a bad leader. But what Bowen wants is a losing strategy and you can't blame Jon for rejecting it and getting frustrated as Bowen continues pushing the same idea over and over. The Watch cannot hold back the Wildlings never mind the Others unless they take decisive action. Sitting on your hands in their situation is suicide.

And it&amp;#39;s important because the content of what Bowen is saying matters along with the way he&amp;#39;s saying it and how often. He&amp;#39;s not offering up an equally reasonable idea to Jon when he&amp;#39;s asked about it, he&amp;#39;s forcing discussion on a proven losing strategy ad nauseam to Jon and everyone else that will listen and openly questioning Jon in front of the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the time he reached the stable, Dolorous Edd had the lord commander&amp;#39;s palfrey saddled and bridled and waiting for him. The wayns were forming up beneath Bowen Marsh&amp;#39;s watchful eye. The Lord Steward was trotting down the column, pointing and fussing, his cheeks red from the cold. When he spied Jon, they reddened even more. &amp;quot;Lord Commander. Are you still intent on this \u2026&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;\u2026 folly?&amp;quot; finished Jon. &amp;quot;Please tell me you were not about to say folly, my lord. Yes, I am. We have been over this. Eastwatch wants more men. The Shadow Tower wants more men. Greyguard and Icemark as well, I have no doubt, and we have fourteen other castles still sitting empty, long leagues of Wall that remain unwatched and undefended.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice the change from when Bowen first brings it up in an earlier chapter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They complained about Lord Commander Mormont too. Men love to complain about their wives and lords, he told me once. Those without wives complain twice as much about their lords.&amp;quot; Jon Snow glanced toward the stockade. Two walls were down, a third falling fast. &amp;quot;I will leave you to finish here, Bowen. Make certain every corpse is burned. Thank you for your counsel. I promise you, I will think on all you&amp;#39;ve said.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that he&amp;#39;s not being a wise councilor being treated poorly, he&amp;#39;s being obstinate and at the end a mutineer. At every opportunity after the initial discussion he brings up how he thinks Jon is wrong and slowly builds up to more aggressive language, calling Jon&amp;#39;s action treasonous at one point. To blame Jon for being bad at communicating is not a fair characterization, Marsh is incredibly stubborn and ends up killing Jon. And is preaching a strategy that will fail. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had he given other ideas, like perhaps Jon make peace with Roose/Ramsay Bolton for support of the Watch, suggested acquiring sell swords, giving Stannis more power in exchange for a permanent garrison, etc. and Jon was acting the same I&amp;#39;d agree that he was being a bad leader. But what Bowen wants is a losing strategy and you can&amp;#39;t blame Jon for rejecting it and getting frustrated as Bowen continues pushing the same idea over and over. The Watch cannot hold back the Wildlings never mind the Others unless they take decisive action. Sitting on your hands in their situation is suicide. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg54987", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982408.0, "created_utc": 1491953608.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4x5iy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Killy_Wonka", "parent_id": "t1_dg4vt5b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's difficult to imagine that you read what I wrote before you responded.

He knows that the Others are coming, and that contours his every action as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. In addition to that, Jon is in the unique position of having been both a Night's Watchmen as well as a Wildling (sort-of). So, he understands both cultures to some degree.\n\nThe major problem for Jon is that he isn't a great communicator with his subordinate leadership. That's not to say that Bowen Marsh and the others are great leaders and always have valuable insight. In many cases, they are neither. However, (and granted, this comes from some of my own 'leadership experiences') Jon's attitude is \"I'm right. History will validate me.\" without the requisite address of their concern.\n\nLast night, I was doing a re-read of ADWD, Jon V for an upcoming podcast appearance, and the conversation at the end of the chapter between Jon and Bowen is demonstrative of Jon's approach to leadership.\n\nThe context of the conversation is that Jon makes an offer to the Wildlings encamped at Molestown that if any boys, girls, men and women of the free folk want to help man the Wall, they'll get better provisions. 63 Wildlings eventually decided to come back to the Wall with Jon &amp; co. On the way back, Bowen and Jon talk:\n\n&gt; \"What will you do with them?\" Bowen Marsh asked Jon on the ride back up the kingsroad.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Train them, arm then, and split them up. Send them where they're needed. Eastwatch, the Shadow Tower, Icemark, Greyguard. I mean to open three more forts as well.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The Lord Steward glanced back. \"Women too? Our brothers are not accustomed to having women amongst them, my lord. Their vows ... there will be fights, rapes ...\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"These women have knives and know how to use them.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"And the first time one of these spearwives slits the throat of one of our brothers, what then?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We will have lost a man,\" said Jon, \"but we have just gained sixty-three. You're good at counting, my lord. Correct me if I'm wrong, but my reckoning leaves us sixty-two ahead.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Marsh was unconvinced. \"You've added sixty-three more mouths, my lord ... but how many are fighters, and whose side will they fight on? If it's the Others at the gates, most like they'll stand with us, I grant you ... but if it's Tormund Giantsbane or the Weeping Man come calling with ten thousand howling killers, what then?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Then we'll know. So let us hope it never comes to that.\" (ADWD, Jon V)\n\nFirst, it should be noted that Jon's proposal to help better man and patrol the Wall is smart, but there's issues too. The issue that Bowen brings up is that if Tormund and the Weeper attack the Wall, the Wildlings could be a potential fifth column and help Tormund and the Weeper cross the Wall by force. That's not a ridiculous assumption. Mance Rayder's attack on the Wall was just a few months before this event, and Jon knows Tormund and the Weeper survived the Battle of the Wall:\n\n&gt; Stannis Baratheon had smashed Mance Rayder's host and made the King-Beyond-the-Wall his captive \u2026 but the wildlings were still out there, the Weeper and Tormund Giantsbane and thousands more. (ADWD, Jon I)\n\nJon never address Bowen's concern at the end of Jon V. He never asks questions of Bowen either or solicits his advice. One of the aspects of leadership that has helped me along the way has been to have subordinates take ownership of projects. One of the ways that I've seen others (and have tried to emulated in my own way) do this is by making them an integral part of the process by asking them for advice on how to implement something.\n\nIf the goal is make the Wildlings help man the Wall, Jon would have been wise to ask Bowen's advice on how to integrate the Wildlings into the defense of the Wall. Jon seems to think that food alone will convince the Wildlings not to turn their knives on the Night's Watch if the Weeper or Tormund come in force, but think about it: if your kin, clan, friends or countrymen were desperately trying to get to safety, would extra food be enough to prevent you from assisting your fellows? Probably not. Asking Bowen for advice would have done Jon a deal of good at making Bowen a part of the process and given him a sense of ownership over it.\n\nThe other problem is that Jon is incurious about *why* Bowen is grousing. Sure, he *understands* why Bowen feels the way he does, but something I learned in marriage far too late for my own good is that simply providing answers when my wife needs to vent just aggravates her. Mrs BFish doesn't want me to provide the solutions. She wants me to care, to listen to empathize. \n\nBowen wants the same. He wants to be heard, respected and cared about. He might be much more short-sighted than Jon and wrong in wanting to keep the Wildlings north of the Wall, but that's not the point. The point is that Jon just tells Bowen what's going to happen and never inquires more after why his Lord Steward might be concerned. That's difficult, and it sucks, but by the gods, Jon, you're a leader. Being a leader is difficult, it sucks, but if you do it right, it pays dividends in the future.\n\n**TL;DR** *Jon needed to listen to Bowen, ask questions of him and integrate him into the process.*", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got lots of #thoughts.

One of the ways that I&amp;#39;ve seen others (and have tried to emulated in my own way) do this is by making them an integral part of the process by asking them for advice on how to implement something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the goal is make the Wildlings help man the Wall, Jon would have been wise to ask Bowen&amp;#39;s advice on how to integrate the Wildlings into the defense of the Wall. Jon seems to think that food alone will convince the Wildlings not to turn their knives on the Night&amp;#39;s Watch if the Weeper or Tormund come in force, but think about it: if your kin, clan, friends or countrymen were desperately trying to get to safety, would extra food be enough to prevent you from assisting your fellows? Probably not. Asking Bowen for advice would have done Jon a deal of good at making Bowen a part of the process and given him a sense of ownership over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that Jon is incurious about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Bowen is grousing. Sure, he &lt;em&gt;understands&lt;/em&gt; why Bowen feels the way he does, but something I learned in marriage far too late for my own good is that simply providing answers when my wife needs to vent just aggravates her. Mrs BFish doesn&amp;#39;t want me to provide the solutions. She wants me to care, to listen to empathize. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bowen wants the same. He wants to be heard, respected and cared about. He might be much more short-sighted than Jon and wrong in wanting to keep the Wildlings north of the Wall, but that&amp;#39;s not the point. The point is that Jon just tells Bowen what&amp;#39;s going to happen and never inquires more after why his Lord Steward might be concerned. That&amp;#39;s difficult, and it sucks, but by the gods, Jon, you&amp;#39;re a leader. Being a leader is difficult, it sucks, but if you do it right, it pays dividends in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jon needed to listen to Bowen, ask questions of him and integrate him into the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg4lhl4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960639.0, "created_utc": 1491931839.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s4lj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s4lj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s4lj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4psih", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JustNedsGirl", "parent_id": "t1_dg4oc9k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jon learned from Ned a lot, and he keep thinking about it, all the time.\n\n&gt; \"My father once told me that some men are not worth having,\" Jon finished. \"A bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself.\"\n\n.\n\n&gt; They had numbers, but the Night's Watch had discipline, and in battle discipline beats numbers nine times of every ten, his father had once told him.\n\n.\n\n&gt; No wall can keep you safe,\" his father had told him once, as they walked the walls of Winterfall. \"A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it.\"\n\n.\n\n&gt; His father had always said that in battle a captain's lungs were as important as his sword arm. \"It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is, if his commands cannot be heard,\" Lord Eddard told his sons, so Robb and he used to climb the towers of Winterfell to shout at each other across the yard.\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; A lord may love the men that he commands, he could hear his lord father saying, but he cannot be a friend to them.
