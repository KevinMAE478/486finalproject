For the first time all day, Selmy felt certain. This is what I was made for, he thought. The dance, the sweet steel song, a sword in my hand and a foe before me.The pit fighter was fast, blazing fast, as quick as any man Ser Barristan had ever fought. In those big hands, the arakh became a whistling blur, a steel storm that seemed to come at the old knight from three directions at once. Most of the cuts were aimed at his head. Khrazz was no fool. Without a helm, Selmy was most vulnerable above the neck. He blocked the blows calmly, his longsword meeting each slash and turning it aside. The blades rang and rang again. Ser Barristan retreated. On the edge of his vision, he saw the cupbearers watching with eyes as big and white as chicken eggs. Khrazz cursed and turned a high cut into a low one, slipping past the old knight's blade for once, only to have his blow scrape uselessly off a white steel greave. Selmy's answering slash found the pit fighter's left shoulder, parting the fine linen to bite the flesh beneath. His yellow tunic began to turn pink, then red.\"Only cowards dress in iron,\" Khrazz declared, circling. No one wore armor in the fighting pits. It was blood the crowds came for: death, dismemberment, and shrieks of agony, the music of the scarlet sands. Ser Barristan turned with him. **\"This coward is about to kill you, ser.\"** The man was no knight, but his courage had earned him that much **courtesy.** Khrazz did not know how to fight a man in armor.

I will eat your heart.&amp;quot; The two men were of a height, but Khrazz was two stone heavier and forty years younger, with pale skin, dead eyes, and a crest of bristly red-black hair that ran from his brow to the base of his neck. &amp;quot;Then come,&amp;quot; said Barristan the Bold. For the first time all day, Selmy felt certain. This is what I was made for, he thought. The dance, the sweet steel song, a sword in my hand and a foe before me.The pit fighter was fast, blazing fast, as quick as any man Ser Barristan had ever fought. In those big hands, the arakh became a whistling blur, a steel storm that seemed to come at the old knight from three directions at once. Most of the cuts were aimed at his head. Khrazz was no fool. Without a helm, Selmy was most vulnerable above the neck. He blocked the blows calmly, his longsword meeting each slash and turning it aside. The blades rang and rang again. Ser Barristan retreated. On the edge of his vision, he saw the cupbearers watching with eyes as big and white as chicken eggs. Khrazz cursed and turned a high cut into a low one, slipping past the old knight&amp;#39;s blade for once, only to have his blow scrape uselessly off a white steel greave. Selmy&amp;#39;s answering slash found the pit fighter&amp;#39;s left shoulder, parting the fine linen to bite the flesh beneath. His yellow tunic began to turn pink, then red.&amp;quot;Only cowards dress in iron,&amp;quot; Khrazz declared, circling. No one wore armor in the fighting pits. It was blood the crowds came for: death, dismemberment, and shrieks of agony, the music of the scarlet sands. Ser Barristan turned with him. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;This coward is about to kill you, ser.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; The man was no knight, but his courage had earned him that much &lt;strong&gt;courtesy.&lt;/strong&gt; Khrazz did not know how to fight a man in armor.

Their fear was so ripe Victarion could taste it. Left and right he laid about, hewing off the first man's arm at the elbow, cleaving through the shoulder of the second. The third buried his own axehead in the soft pine of Victarion's shield. He slammed it into the fool's face, knocked him off his feet, and slew him when he tried to rise again. As he was struggling to free his axe from the dead man's rib cage, a spear jabbed him between the shoulder blades. It felt as though someone had slapped him on the back. Victarion spun and slammed his axe down onto the spearman's head, feeling the impact in his arm as the steel went crunching through helm and hair and skull. The man swayed for half a heartbeat, till the iron captain wrenched the steel free and sent his corpse staggering loose-limbed across the deck, looking more drunk than dead.\n\n\n&gt;By then his ironborn had followed him down onto the deck of the broken longship.

Victarion slew another man, and another. He would have killed a third, but Ragnor cut him down first. \"Well struck,\" Victarion bellowed at him.\nWhen he turned to find the next victim for his axe, he spied the other captain across the deck. His white surcoat was spotted with blood and gore, but Victarion could make out the arms upon his breast, the white rose within its red escutcheon. The man bore the same device upon his shield, on a white field with a red embattled border. \"You!\" the iron captain called across the carnage. \"You of the rose! Be you the lord of Southshield?\"\n\n\n&gt;The other raised his visor to show a beardless face. \"His son and heir. Ser Talbert Serry. And who are you, kraken?\"\n\n\n&gt;\"Your death.\" Victarion bulled toward him.\n\n\n&gt;Serry leapt to meet him. His longsword was good castle-forged steel, and the young knight made it sing. His first cut was low, and Victarion deflected it off his axe. His second caught the iron captain on the helm before he got his shield up. Victarion answered with a sidearm blow of his axe. Serry's shield got in the way. Wooden splinters flew, and the white rose split lengthwise with a sweet sharp crack. The young knight's longsword hammered at his thigh, once, twice, thrice, screaming against the steel. This boy is quick, the iron captain realized. He smashed his shield in Serry's face and sent him staggering back against the gunwale. Victarion raised his axe and put all his weight behind his cut, to open the boy from neck to groin, but Serry spun away. The axehead crashed through the rail, sending splinters flying, and lodged there when he tried to pull it free. The deck moved under his feet, and he stumbled to one knee.\n\n\n\n&gt;Ser Talbert cast away his broken shield and slashed down with his longsword. Victarion's own shield had twisted half around when he stumbled. He caught Serry's blade in an iron fist. Lobstered steel crunched, and a stab of pain made him grunt, yet Victarion held on. \"I am quick as well, boy,\" he said as he ripped the sword from the knight's hand and flung it into the sea.\n\n\n&gt;Ser Talbert's eyes went wide. \"My sword . . .\"\n\n\n&gt;Victarion caught the lad about the throat with a bloody fist. \"Go and get it,\" he said, forcing him backwards over the side into the bloodstained waters.", "edited": 1491896205.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Dance with me then&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it ends with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He vaulted over the gunwale, landing on the deck below with his golden cloak billowing behind him.

Gems?\u201d She stabbed twice more. \u201cIs there food? Where is Lord Beric?\u201d She was on top of him by then, still stabbing. \u201cWhere did he go? How many men were with him? How many knights? How many bowmen? How many, how many, how many, how many, how many, how many? is there gold in the village?\u201d\n\n&gt;Her hands were red and sticky when Sandor dragged her off him. \u201cEnough,\u201d was all he said. He was bleeding like a butchered pig himself, and dragging one leg when he walked.\n\nAnd this\n&gt;Tyrion\u2019s finger clenched. The crossbow whanged just as Lord Tywin started to rise. The bolt slammed into him above the groin and he sat back down with a grunt. The quarrel had sunk deep, right to the fletching. Blood seeped out around the shaft, dripping down into his pubic hair and over his bare thighs. \u201cYou shot me,\u201d he said incredulously, his eyes glassy with shock.\n\n&gt;\u201cYou always were quick to grasp a situation, my lord,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cThat must be why you\u2019re the Hand of the King.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cYou ... you are no ... no son of mine.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cNow that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Father.
