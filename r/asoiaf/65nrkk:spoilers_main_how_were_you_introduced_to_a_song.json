In that time I&amp;#39;ve read through the books multiple times, watched through the show multiple times, became an expert in Westerosi politics, familiarized myself with virtually every fan theory, and got two ASOIAF tattoos (Rains of Castamere inspired tattoo and the Targaryen sigil).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back on all of this got me thinking of how I was introduced to this great series in the first place. I was at a friends house with about 10 other people on a Sunday night, when half of the group split into the next room to watch the newest episode of this show called Game of Thrones. About an hour later they came out of that room with shocked expressions, and all they were talking about were the consequences of an event that they had just watched. At this point I had heard about Game of Thrones from a bunch of different people even outside of this group and figured I&amp;#39;d give the series a shot eventually, but after seeing these friends react and discuss that potential fallout of what they&amp;#39;d just seen convinced me to start watching. I borrowed the first two seasons on DVD from a friend that night and the next day I had begun my journey.\nI remember describing the first episode at the time as &amp;quot;okay, medieval politics, medieval politics, BAM kid gets pushed out a window.&amp;quot; When Lady died in the second(?) episode I had began to worry that I had started a series I wouldn&amp;#39;t end up liking. But that didn&amp;#39;t last long as I was utterly hooked. I remember getting to Viserys death and going &amp;quot;omg this is just brilliant.&amp;quot; I remember watching Ned&amp;#39;s death late at night and texting my friends full of anger bitching about the tragedy of this honorable man going down in history and being remembered for confessing to a crime that he didn&amp;#39;t commit. I know Dany isn&amp;#39;t too popular around here, but I remember what I felt when for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember watching through season 2 fascinated with this alcoholic dwarf who somehow managed to navigate through these murky political waters that had drowned our beloved Ned. I remember an uncrowned king demanding that Jaime Lannister be called out for having sex with his sister, but still being referred to as &amp;quot;Ser Jaime Lannister,&amp;quot; because &amp;quot;No matter what else he is, the man is still a knight.&amp;quot; I remember a certain squire having unspoken, forbidden relations with a king, and as a man who &amp;quot;suffers&amp;quot; from the same affliction as Renly and Loras it was fascinating to see it dealt with in that sort of context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, with just one day to go before the next new episode, I had caught up to my friends. I sat down to watch the episode that had affected my friends in such a way that it inspired me to watch the series, and I saw the man who would eventually become my favorite character lose his hand because he had (successfully) prevented the raping of another great character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that Sunday night I was ready to watch my first ever brand new episode of Game of Thrones in real time, with my friends, live as it was airing.
