Arthur was Dornish\n- Jon also only says that Mance sang the song well enough. At Winterfell Mance also sings, but again nobody thinks he's fantastic or anything and they tolerate him because he's the only singer. Many see the parallels between Mance and Rhaegar in that both were singers, but Rhaegar actually was great at it. Mance by all accounts isn't. Passable enough, but not great. It's not really in favour of Arthur mind you as we have nothing to indicate Arthur ever sang, but something to consider in that he's not Rhaegar if he's secretly somebody.\n- Mance has a red and black cloak. Red and black are the Targaryen colours. Arthur was a Targaryen loyalist\n- Qhorin himself says that Mance was better than him. Arthur was the best swordsman in the country so it makes more sense that Mance, the best swordsman in the north, is Arthur than that Arthur was Qhorin and Mance, a random, was still better than him\n- Mance famously won over the wildlings by killing the stubborn ones yes, but mostly by negotiating, settling old scores, forging peaces, etc. Arthur defeated the Kingswood Brotherhood by winning over the smallfolk by negotiating between them and Aerys until they willingly helped him out instead of the Brotherhood\n- Mance is extremely strong and Jaime listed Arthur Dayne as a man who was stronger than him\n- Mance takes up of all things a greatsword to spar Jon with, and as he gives it its first swing he reminisces about how it makes a sweet sound. Arthur fought with the greatsword Dawn.\n- While sparring Jon Mance expertly uses his armour, almost exactly like Barristan later does against Khrazz.

Qhorin. Qhorin is said to have learned to fight with his other hand\n- Qhorin supposedly lost his hand fighting a wildling. It doesn't make sense that Arthur would've been defeated by some random wildling. Gerold makes more sense considering he'd be less skilled than Arthur. Still unlikely considering he'd still be pretty skilled, but then again it's unlikely that Qhorin could've ever been defeated by a wildling considering how skilled he is anyways.\n- Qhorin is repeatedly referenced as being big, tall, and strong. Gerold's nickname \"The White Bull\" came from his famous strength\n- As previously mentioned, Qhorin says that Mance is better than him. Arthur would've been better than Gerold.\n- Qhorin repeatedly references duty, following orders, etc. Gerold was the KG who told Jaime to obey his king, as well as the KG who references his duty at the TOJ.\n\nAt the very least GRRM seems to be drawing references to the characters.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arthur = Mance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mance is introduced singing &amp;quot;The Dornishman&amp;#39;s Wife&amp;quot;, despite supposedly having lived his entire life at the Wall and beyond.
