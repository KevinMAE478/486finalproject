In case my nickname didn't give it away, I am a huuuuge fan, and I find Davos's visit to White harbor to be some of the best chapters in all of the books.

While Lyanna Mormont was fun in the show, it still feels like a brutal slap on the book-readers when she schools Lord Manderly for forgetting his promise to the north. Like What da fawk. That would be like Tommen showing up and telling Tywinn that he doesn't know how to rule so now Tommen has to teach him.
