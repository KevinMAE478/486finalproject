Sure, he talks as if he has a master plan he has been following for years and maybe he believes it, but there&amp;#39;s no evidence for this. Let&amp;#39;s look at what he did and didn&amp;#39;t do as part of his &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; and see if it really holds up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began when his sister &lt;strong&gt;Elia was murdered&lt;/strong&gt;.

So far, so good, this is all reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Doran doesn&amp;#39;t actually do anything over the next couple of years to get revenge. &lt;strong&gt;He made no attempt to undermine Robert&amp;#39;s regime&lt;/strong&gt;, never tried to turn other lords against him and the Lannisters. He made no alliances and never tried to get friends into influential places (or make friends out of those already there). The Starks have a rivalry with the Lannisters, why not build a friendship? Open rebellion is out of the question, but what about covert assassination (of say, the Mountain) or sabotage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;the Greyjoys rebelled and attacked the Lannisters&lt;/strong&gt;, Doran again did nothing. If he was plotting revenge, this was an opportunity. His foe was being attacked and the loyalty of the other lords was in doubt (that was what sparked the rebellion). The rebellion was probably doomed to failure, but that might not have been clear at the time. At the time Doran didn&amp;#39;t know if he would ever get a better chance at revenge, yet he let he let the opportunity slip through his grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doran never helped Dany and Viserys&lt;/strong&gt; while they were homeless and hunted by assassins. That was when they truly needed major support, yet Doran did nothing. The marriage pact didn&amp;#39;t help them at all, in fact they didn&amp;#39;t even know it existed. Why make the pact and then ignore it for years? It&amp;#39;s sheer luck that Dany is still alive and that&amp;#39;s no thanks to Doran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doran did nothing during the War of Five Kings&lt;/strong&gt;.

You couldn&amp;#39;t dream up a better chance. The kingdom had collapsed, almost every major lord was going their own way such that not rebelling was more unusual than rebellion. The Lannisters were isolated and  he could strike at the them with little risk to himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Doran intervened, &lt;strong&gt;he would have changed the tide of the war&lt;/strong&gt;. He could have directly shifted the balance at the Battle of the Blackwater, or at least prevented the Tyrells from coming to the rescue. He never even tried to make contact with the Starks, the people attacking his sworn enemies. There was fire and blood and he had nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quentyn had no idea what to do&lt;/strong&gt;. Doran sent him without anything to win Dany over and he basically had to wing it. They don&amp;#39;t even meet until she has already built and independent power base and much less need for Dorne.

And no I'm not talking about the fact that he convinced the world that Darkstar tried to assassinate Myrcella but Ser Arys Oakheart valiantly saved her life at the cost of his own. That's right in the books (but is indeed an example of Doran pulling off a scheme). What I'm talking about is that if you read carefully enough you realize that Doran did succeed in convincing the world that he's still able bodied.\n\nWe know that Doran, as of AFFC, is suffering terribly from gout and is practically bound to a wheelchair night all day long, incapable of walking. However, we also learn from Hotah that he moved from Sunspear to the Water Gardens while he could still walk 2 years ago as he knew the Sunspear was full of spies and he didn't want anybody to know how infirm he's become.\n\n&gt;The captain understood. Two years ago, when they had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran's gout had not been half so bad. In those days he had still walked, albeit slowly, leaning on a stick and grimacing with every step. The prince did not wish his enemies to know how feeble he had grown, and the Old Palace and its shadow city were full of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps he cannot climb. He would need to fly to sit atop the Tower of the Sun.\n\nAFFC occurs in the year 300. If you do the math that means that Doran was still walking and commanding in Sunspear back in 298 when the story began, and moved to the Water Gardens sometime in that book. It also means that all of Tyrion's correspondence with Doran in ACOK and ASOS, the setting up of the Trystane/Myrcella betrothal and seat on the small council for Doran and what not, occurred while Doran was at the Water Gardens. Hence at least partially why the seat on the small council was offered. Doran was expected to come to King's Landing because Tyrion had no reason to know that he couldn't.\n\n&gt;The Dornish leader forked a stallion black as sin with a mane and tail the color of fire. He sat his saddle as if he'd been born there, tall, slim, graceful. A cloak of pale red silk fluttered from his shoulders, and his shirt was armored with overlapping rows of copper disks that glittered like a thousand bright new pennies as he rode. His high gilded helm displayed a copper sun on its brow, and the round shield slung behind him bore the sun-and-spear of House Martell on its polished metal surface.\n\n&gt;A Martell sun, but ten years too young, Tyrion thought as he reined up, too fit as well, and far too fierce. He knew what he must deal with by then. How many Dornishmen does it take to start a war? he asked himself. Only one. Yet he had no choice but to smile. \"Well met, my lords. We had word of your approach, and His Grace King Joffrey bid me ride out to welcome you in his name. My lord father the King's Hand sends his greetings as well.\" He feigned an amiable confusion. \"Which of you is Prince Doran?\"\n\n&gt;\"My brother's health requires he remain at Sunspear.\" The princeling removed his helm. Beneath, his face was lined and saturnine, with thin arched brows above large eyes as black and shiny as pools of coal oil. Only a few streaks of silver marred the lustrous black hair that receded from his brow in a widow's peak as sharply pointed as his nose. A salty Dornishmen for certain. \"Prince Doran has sent me to join King Joffrey's council in his stead, as it please His Grace.\"\n\nTyrion was caught completely off guard when it was Oberyn who came to King's Landing instead of Doran.

It's still of course possible his plans will overwhelmingly fail, but I know of at least one that worked brilliantly.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My problem with Doran being a shitty schemer is that we&amp;#39;re indirectly introduced to a scheme that we know he did pull off, and relatively recently. And no I&amp;#39;m not talking about the fact that he convinced the world that Darkstar tried to assassinate Myrcella but Ser Arys Oakheart valiantly saved her life at the cost of his own. That&amp;#39;s right in the books (but is indeed an example of Doran pulling off a scheme). What I&amp;#39;m talking about is that if you read carefully enough you realize that Doran did succeed in convincing the world that he&amp;#39;s still able bodied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that Doran, as of AFFC, is suffering terribly from gout and is practically bound to a wheelchair night all day long, incapable of walking. However, we also learn from Hotah that he moved from Sunspear to the Water Gardens while he could still walk 2 years ago as he knew the Sunspear was full of spies and he didn&amp;#39;t want anybody to know how infirm he&amp;#39;s become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The captain understood. Two years ago, when they had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran&amp;#39;s gout had not been half so bad. In those days he had still walked, albeit slowly, leaning on a stick and grimacing with every step. The prince did not wish his enemies to know how feeble he had grown, and the Old Palace and its shadow city were full of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps he cannot climb. He would need to fly to sit atop the Tower of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AFFC occurs in the year 300. If you do the math that means that Doran was still walking and commanding in Sunspear back in 298 when the story began, and moved to the Water Gardens sometime in that book. It also means that all of Tyrion&amp;#39;s correspondence with Doran in ACOK and ASOS, the setting up of the Trystane/Myrcella betrothal and seat on the small council for Doran and what not, occurred while Doran was at the Water Gardens. Hence at least partially why the seat on the small council was offered. Doran was expected to come to King&amp;#39;s Landing because Tyrion had no reason to know that he couldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Dornish leader forked a stallion black as sin with a mane and tail the color of fire. He sat his saddle as if he&amp;#39;d been born there, tall, slim, graceful. A cloak of pale red silk fluttered from his shoulders, and his shirt was armored with overlapping rows of copper disks that glittered like a thousand bright new pennies as he rode. His high gilded helm displayed a copper sun on its brow, and the round shield slung behind him bore the sun-and-spear of House Martell on its polished metal surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Martell sun, but ten years too young, Tyrion thought as he reined up, too fit as well, and far too fierce. He knew what he must deal with by then. How many Dornishmen does it take to start a war? he asked himself. Only one. Yet he had no choice but to smile. &amp;quot;Well met, my lords. We had word of your approach, and His Grace King Joffrey bid me ride out to welcome you in his name. My lord father the King&amp;#39;s Hand sends his greetings as well.&amp;quot; He feigned an amiable confusion. &amp;quot;Which of you is Prince Doran?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My brother&amp;#39;s health requires he remain at Sunspear.&amp;quot; The princeling removed his helm. Beneath, his face was lined and saturnine, with thin arched brows above large eyes as black and shiny as pools of coal oil. Only a few streaks of silver marred the lustrous black hair that receded from his brow in a widow&amp;#39;s peak as sharply pointed as his nose. A salty Dornishmen for certain. &amp;quot;Prince Doran has sent me to join King Joffrey&amp;#39;s council in his stead, as it please His Grace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tyrion was caught completely off guard when it was Oberyn who came to King&amp;#39;s Landing instead of Doran. They knew Doran was sickly because they knew he only travels in a litter, but they had no idea he couldn&amp;#39;t make the journey. They expected Doran because they had no reason not to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, look at that last part I bolded&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My brother&amp;#39;s health requires he remain &lt;strong&gt;at Sunspear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oberyn you old slimy dog, you know perfectly well that Doran has been living in the Water Gardens for at least the last year and a half and isn&amp;#39;t in Sunspear. But Tyrion and King&amp;#39;s Landing doesn&amp;#39;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oberyn&amp;#39;s not only keeping up the pretext that Doran is ruling in Sunspear, he&amp;#39;s checking to make sure that that&amp;#39;s what they know.

He made no attempt to undermine Robert's regime, \n\nRobert is not his enemy. Tywin and the Lannisters are, and they are the target of his vengeance.\n\n&gt;He made no alliances and never tried to get friends into influential places (or make friends out of those already there). \n\nHere is where the Sand Snakes come in. I'd argue that Doran is SO careful, that he cannot even trust the Lords around him. He and Oberyn had to breed their own conspirators. Now, they have Sarella Sand in position with the Maesters, Lady Nym about to join the council, and Tyene in with the Faith. Furthermore, The Dornish Master Plan argues that Oberyn founded the Brave Companions and as such, Qyburn may be a Dornish agent as well.\n\n\n&gt;The Starks have a rivalry with the Lannisters, why not build a friendship? Open rebellion is out of the question, but what about covert assassination (of say, the Mountain) or sabotage?\n\nIf Qyburn and the Brave Companions are indeed working for Doran, that's a pretty covert way to kill Ser Amory Lorch and main Jaime.\n\n\n&gt;When the Greyjoys rebelled and attacked the Lannisters, Doran again did nothing. If he was plotting revenge, this was an opportunity. His foe was being attacked and the loyalty of the other lords was in doubt (that was what sparked the rebellion). The rebellion was probably doomed to failure, but that might not have been clear at the time. At the time Doran didn't know if he would ever get a better chance at revenge, yet he let he let the opportunity slip through his grasp.\n\nToo risky. I'd have passed on the opportunity too. The smallest kingdom decides they want to take on everybody all at once? Absolutely insane. Plus, Doran may have done some things behind the scenes during that war that we are unaware of.\n\n&gt;Doran never helped Dany and Viserys while they were homeless and hunted by assassins. That was when they truly needed major support, yet Doran did nothing. The marriage pact didn't help them at all, in fact they didn't even know it existed. Why make the pact and then ignore it for years? It's sheer luck that Dany is still alive and that's no thanks to Doran.\n\nPerhaps he doesn't actually care about them.\n\n&gt;Doran did nothing during the War of Five Kings. This is my biggest gripe on the list. For this reason alone the Fire and Blood speech was empty words to me. There couldn't have been a better opportunity for revenge. You couldn't dream up a better chance. The kingdom had collapsed, almost every major lord was going their own way such that not rebelling was more unusual than rebellion. The Lannisters were isolated and he could strike at the them with little risk to himself.\n\nIt's still too risky. Dorne will lose in any one on one fight against any other Kingdom and no side is fighting alone. Plus, the battlefield is almost safer than intrigue. Look what happened to Renly and Robb. Better to let the realm exhaust itself for a few years and pounce on whoever is King of the ashes.\n\n&gt;Had Doran intervened, he would have changed the tide of the war. He could have directly shifted the balance at the Battle of the Blackwater, or at least prevented the Tyrells from coming to the rescue. He never even tried to make contact with the Starks, the people attacking his sworn enemies. There was fire and blood and he had nothing to do with it.\n\nHe probably could have turned the tide, but there's a lot that happened leading up to this battle that no one could have accounted for, and none of it turned out as anyone expected. Doran would have found himself in league with Renly in the Stormlands and the Tyrells in the Reach only for Renly to die and the Reach to switch to his enemy's side. Suddenly the most populous kingdom and your neighbor has cause to march their flowery butts down to Sunspear and put you in your grave.\n\n&gt;Quentyn had no idea what to do. Doran sent him without anything to win Dany over and he basically had to wing it. They don't even meet until she has already built and independent power base and much less need for Dorne. The attempted wooing was pathetic, which is mostly Doran's fault.\n\nThe Dornish Master Plan argues that Doran wants Quentyn to fail...safely.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further corroborate my point that Doran may be up to more than it appears, I&amp;#39;ll try to give a reasoning as to why he didn&amp;#39;t rebel during the moments you list above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Elia was murdered. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you say, Dorne couldn&amp;#39;t fight the might of four kingdoms by themselves, so they must wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, Doran doesn&amp;#39;t actually do anything over the next couple of years to get revenge.

Tywin and the Lannisters are, and they are the target of his vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He made no alliances and never tried to get friends into influential places (or make friends out of those already there). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where the Sand Snakes come in. I&amp;#39;d argue that Doran is SO careful, that he cannot even trust the Lords around him. He and Oberyn had to breed their own conspirators. Now, they have Sarella Sand in position with the Maesters, Lady Nym about to join the council, and Tyene in with the Faith. Furthermore, The Dornish Master Plan argues that Oberyn founded the Brave Companions and as such, Qyburn may be a Dornish agent as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Starks have a rivalry with the Lannisters, why not build a friendship? Open rebellion is out of the question, but what about covert assassination (of say, the Mountain) or sabotage?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Qyburn and the Brave Companions are indeed working for Doran, that&amp;#39;s a pretty covert way to kill Ser Amory Lorch and main Jaime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the Greyjoys rebelled and attacked the Lannisters, Doran again did nothing. If he was plotting revenge, this was an opportunity. His foe was being attacked and the loyalty of the other lords was in doubt (that was what sparked the rebellion). The rebellion was probably doomed to failure, but that might not have been clear at the time. At the time Doran didn&amp;#39;t know if he would ever get a better chance at revenge, yet he let he let the opportunity slip through his grasp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too risky. I&amp;#39;d have passed on the opportunity too. The smallest kingdom decides they want to take on everybody all at once? Absolutely insane. Plus, Doran may have done some things behind the scenes during that war that we are unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doran never helped Dany and Viserys while they were homeless and hunted by assassins. That was when they truly needed major support, yet Doran did nothing. The marriage pact didn&amp;#39;t help them at all, in fact they didn&amp;#39;t even know it existed. Why make the pact and then ignore it for years? It&amp;#39;s sheer luck that Dany is still alive and that&amp;#39;s no thanks to Doran.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he doesn&amp;#39;t actually care about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doran did nothing during the War of Five Kings. This is my biggest gripe on the list. For this reason alone the Fire and Blood speech was empty words to me. There couldn&amp;#39;t have been a better opportunity for revenge. You couldn&amp;#39;t dream up a better chance. The kingdom had collapsed, almost every major lord was going their own way such that not rebelling was more unusual than rebellion. The Lannisters were isolated and he could strike at the them with little risk to himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still too risky. Dorne will lose in any one on one fight against any other Kingdom and no side is fighting alone. Plus, the battlefield is almost safer than intrigue. Look what happened to Renly and Robb. Better to let the realm exhaust itself for a few years and pounce on whoever is King of the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Had Doran intervened, he would have changed the tide of the war. He could have directly shifted the balance at the Battle of the Blackwater, or at least prevented the Tyrells from coming to the rescue. He never even tried to make contact with the Starks, the people attacking his sworn enemies. There was fire and blood and he had nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He probably could have turned the tide, but there&amp;#39;s a lot that happened leading up to this battle that no one could have accounted for, and none of it turned out as anyone expected. Doran would have found himself in league with Renly in the Stormlands and the Tyrells in the Reach only for Renly to die and the Reach to switch to his enemy&amp;#39;s side. Suddenly the most populous kingdom and your neighbor has cause to march their flowery butts down to Sunspear and put you in your grave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quentyn had no idea what to do. Doran sent him without anything to win Dany over and he basically had to wing it. They don&amp;#39;t even meet until she has already built and independent power base and much less need for Dorne. The attempted wooing was pathetic, which is mostly Doran&amp;#39;s fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dornish Master Plan argues that Doran wants Quentyn to fail...safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg4t9hb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969044.0, "created_utc": 1491940244.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4s8wy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Daverade", "parent_id": "t3_64sxpv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asoiaf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TBfdd_xNVo&amp;t=4s\n\nIt's a long YouTube series (you should also watch the Deeper Dorne which fleshes out a lot of these ideas) but this posits an answer to all of your questions.\n\nIn summary, Doran may have not done much on the surface, but behind the scenes with his brother he has already made some influential moves including but not limited to:\n\nThe rise of the sparrow movement\nJaime losing his hand\nThe death of Tywin (kinda)\nThe death of the Mountain (kinda)\nThe death of Ser Amory Lorch\n\nand soon to be Cersi's downfall.\n\nI may be missing something else that Doran has accomplished (maybe) but that's the broad strokes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TBfdd_xNVo&amp;amp;t=4s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TBfdd_xNVo&amp;amp;t=4s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a long YouTube series (you should also watch the Deeper Dorne which fleshes out a lot of these ideas) but this posits an answer to all of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, Doran may have not done much on the surface, but behind the scenes with his brother he has already made some influential moves including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rise of the sparrow movement\nJaime losing his hand\nThe death of Tywin (kinda)\nThe death of the Mountain (kinda)\nThe death of Ser Amory Lorch&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and soon to be Cersi&amp;#39;s downfall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may be missing something else that Doran has accomplished (maybe) but that&amp;#39;s the broad strokes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "name": "t1_dg4s8wy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491967958.0, "created_utc": 1491939158.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
