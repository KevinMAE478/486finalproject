So there are small problems with concept and big problems with execution that lead to rape standing out oddly in the show in ways it would be better off not to.\n\nHere's the deal with Sansa's rape:\n\n- There is a lot of rape in the story. There is nothing wrong with *depicting* rape, especially in a story about human suffering.\n\n- However, George tends to treat rape with a lot of deference and respect for the perspective of the victim. He has male and female rape victims, children and adults, and it's portrayed as a very sad, very devastating sort of thing, with a lot of shame associated with it and victimization, and he focuses on the parts of it that credibly matter to the experience of the victims. \n\n- Like take the rape of Lollys Stokeworth - a big part of Lollys Stokeworth's story is the shame of her pregnancy, the shame of her rape, how nobody respects her, she's *possibly* even mentally disabled and nobody really treats that with respect either. We get a lot of that - through rumors, through Bronn, it's a subject at court and has some importance to the story. But you know what we don't see? A lurid, sexualized depiction of Lollys's rape. There's no slow, sexy description of the shape of her hips or breasts while she's being assaulted. That makes sense - because it sure wouldn't be authentic to Lollys's experience for that to be the focus, and there's no real reason for the perspective of the rapists to be the solely privileged perspectives. \n\n- So, people get raped in this story. That on its own makes sense.\n\n- In TV, D&amp;D think they don't have the luxury of communicating indirect things about minor characters through court intrigue and side conversations (whether they have more of that luxury than they think and are playing it too safe in the show is another discussion). If there's a shocking thing or emotional thing that happens, they want to show it to you rather than have you hear about it from someone else. So, big example of this, is we see Robb Stark's relationship with Talisa - we see them get naked and boogie down and stuff - we don't just hear about Robb and Jeyne from Catelyn. That on its own makes sense.\n\n- So, D&amp;D look at the superficial content of the story for signals as to what is right or wrong to depict and what is part of this world they are working in, and they see rape is a subject George isn't afraid of talking about, and that he does actually depict from time to time. So, they put rape in their new story, thinking it isn't off-limits. And because they are TV people and lean on showing rather than telling, they actually show you characters being raped rather than have people talk about it or use other techniques George does to deflect attention away from the salaciousness of it. \n\n- And then, once it's in an episode, the episode is worked on to be made as entertaining as possible, without a coherent regard for the rest of the story. And there's a lot leaning on what they know, leaning on what is familiar and has worked in other shows, and letting the directors make important decisions. And the camera, just by virtue of how it is employed by default, it going to give you that salacious look at hips and breasts and stuff that the prose would definitely have avoided.\n\nSo, there's a rape scene with Sansa - it's in the story, it's in the script. This on its own is kind of shady and not the best idea, but D&amp;D are not George, they're not operating on that level, they're doing their best. Fine.\n\nThe problem is, once it's in the script, it gets directed like a rape scene from any number of places where you see rape scenes in TV or movies -- which is where it's usually presented as a sexual/power fantasy scenario, not much like the terror of actual rape at all, meant to titillate the audience, give people something to masturbate to, connect with people's sexual fantasies rather than with the reality of what this sort of thing means to people in real life.\n\nAnd this feels out of step with the way fantasy and reality work in Game of Thrones, where, yes, there are exaggerations that play off of fantasy, but there is at least a claimed authenticity of experience on the part of the characters because at least through the books and the first few seasons everybody's reaction to stuff is pretty grounded. \n\nSo, from the director's standpoint, you see a sex scene, you make a sex scene. It's just actors. Nobody is *actually* being raped. There's no moral crime here. You're just making spank bank material. \n\nAnd from the audience perspective (or at least some of the audience), you see a character you personally connect with or identify with being degraded in a really drastic and inappropriate way that doesn't make sense based on the previous expectations set up for her story.\n\nAnd that's because there's less overarching coherence to this show being shot by tons of directors and different units in different countries that has lost its adaptation material. It is such a huge logistical undertaking that the vision and context falters to compensate.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's the problem - the context. Sansa, Ramsay and Theon are not porno characters. They have other contexts set up for them and their stories are supposed to pay off in other ways. But if you make every episode in isolation with a different M.O., even a different director, and without a strong unifying vision anymore, the audience ends up knowing that context better than the director does and the director just tramples on it without knowing what's happening.\n\nVery similar with Arya's stabbing - it was all about the director wanting to do a Terminator Parkour scene and nothing at all to do with how it fit into the rest of the story.
