When TKotLT disappeared, Aerys declared him a Enemy. \n&gt;*\"No,\" said Meera. \"That night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each swore they would unmask him, and the king himself urged men to challenge him, declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of his. But the next morning, when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took his seat, only two champions appeared. The Knight of the Laughing Tree had vanished.

But the mystery knight vanished during the night, never to be seen again. This too the king took ill, certain that someone close to him had given warning to \"this traitor who will not show his face.\"*\n\nWe know that Aerys men were furiously trying to connect Rhaegar to ANYTHING that would allow them to remove him from any kind of power: \n&gt;*\"Had any whiff of proof come into their hands to show that Prince Rhaegar was conspiring against his father, King Aerys's loyalists would most certainly have used it to bring about the prince's downfall. Indeed, certain of the king's men had even gone so far as to suggest that Aerys should disinherit his \"disloyal\" son, and name his younger brother heir to the Iron Throne in his stead. Prince Viserys was but seven years of age, and his eventual ascension would certainly mean a regency, wherein they themselves would rule as regents.\"*\n\nAnd that Aerys had Varys finding plots and advising him: \n&gt;*\"he reached across the narrow sea to Pentos and imported a eunuch named Varys to serve as his spymaster, reasoning that only a man without friends, family, or ties in Westeros could be relied upon for the truth. The Spider, as he soon became known to the smallfolk of his realm, used the crown's gold to create a vast web of informers. For the rest of Aerys's reign, he would crouch at the king's side, whispering in his ear.\"*\n\nRhaegar says he only found the shield and no other information as to who the KotLT was. It would not have been TOO hard for someone who was looking to figure out Lyanna was the KotLT, given who she beat and the confrontation from the day before. Aerys thought someone had givin the mystery knight warning to escape and Rhaegar failed to identify the knight. Add to that Rhaegar naming Lyanna the QoLaB:\n&gt;*\"And when the triumphant Prince of Dragonstone named Lyanna Stark, daughter of the Lord of Winterfell, the queen of love and beauty, placing a garland of blue roses in her lap with the tip of his lance, the lickspittle lords gathered around the king declared that further proof of his perfidy. Why would the prince have thus given insult to his own wife, the Princess Elia Martell of Dorne (who was present), unless it was to help him gain the Iron Throne? The crowning of the Stark girl, who was by all reports a wild and boyish young thing with none of the Princess Elia's delicate beauty, could only have been meant to win the allegiance of Winterfell to Prince Rhaegar's cause, Symond Staunton suggested to the king.\"*\n\nSo it is easy to see why Aerys would think that the Starks and Rhaegar are working together, because he already thought it going in to the Tournament.\n\nSo at some point latter Varys (or another one of Aerys' men) tells Aerys the Lyanna was TKotLT and he would want to arrest her and have her confess that Rhaegar and the Starks were working against him.\n\nThere was no secrecy, it was just not widely heralded about arresting her, why would you announce that so the Starks could hide Lyanna? And every one knew about Rhaegar \"Kidnapping\" her because that was the point. Rhaegar had to let his father know that HE had Lyanna and not the Starks or Tullys.\n\nRegarding the prophecy, there WAS plenty of time which makes the case for SOMETHING happened that made Rhaegar act at that exact time to take Lyanna. Everything we know about Rhaegar says he was intelligent, well studied, caring and dedicated. Why would he act so impulsively and dangerously, and give up all of his plans to take the Throne to run off with Lyanna out of the blue? HE WOULDN'T.\n\nNothing points to Robert and Lyanna  getting married any time soon. Nothing points to Rhaegar making any huge strides in his plan to gather Lords to his cause to call a Grand Council.\n\nThe only thing that makes any sense is that Rhaegar had to act because he found out that Lyanna was going to be arrested by Aerys men. Rhaegar had men in the Court:\n&gt;*\"Prince Rhaegar's support came from the younger men at court, including Lord Jon Connington, Ser Myles Mooton of Maidenpool, and Ser Richard Lonmouth. The Dornishmen who had come to court with the Princess Elia were in the prince's confidence as well, particularly Prince Lewyn Martell, Elia's uncle and a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard. But the most formidable of all Rhaegar's friends and allies in King's Landing was surely Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.\"*\n\nIf Lewyn or Arthur had told Rhaegar of what was happening, the only real option Rhaegar had, to protect Lyanna as well as himself and his family was to save her from Aerys. This would also save the Realm form a war starting between the Starks and the Crown (or so he thought).\n\nOne last thing, the Prophecy does not saying anything about the Prince Who Was Promised fighting the Others, the Wall or any other thing about the location of the war.\n&gt;*\"There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world.
