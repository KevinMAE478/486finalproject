My dad wanted to go fishing again for a while before his health declined and he couldn&amp;#39;t go out anymore. I postponed it for a while before time ran out. He passed away last month and that is a regret I will hold forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will add that it was a few years ago that his health went bad and spent 6 years in hospitals and care facilities up until he passed away. His big problem was not taking care of his health or watching his weight before he hit his 60&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go fishing with your dad while you can. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "instant_regret", "name": "t1_dg69p3d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049028.0, "created_utc": 1492020228.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_32dy0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yy32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_32dy0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yy32", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6akuu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DJFlabberGhastly", "parent_id": "t1_dg6716j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/instant_regret", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was always great when there was some action.
