Hoffman wouldn't even associate with Hippies or the other 'psychonauts' on a bus, much less would see himself on a blotter of recreational acid for starry-eyed teenies and immature adults who will garner zero lasting impression from LSD other than \"look at the colors, man... whoooaaaaaa\".  It's an offense Hoffman is on the blotter.  \n\nOwsley: He made the good acid, and deliberately pushed it out to the population at large.  As an act of subversion.  He, also, believed the majority of people were not ready for the psychedelic experience (they are not), and his plan was that at least this would shake up society and provide an opportunity for change.  Owsley's idea of a better society is most definitely *not* in the Hippy mold.  Owsley believed humans eat meat, hippies are dumb, and most drug-takers are simple children who can be led, are moldable, having no original thoughts or impulses of their own.  Acid was a way to get people to question authority and look at things from a different perspective... so that the more intelligent and stronger could lead them away from the chains they willingly submit too.  Owsley expressed profound misgivings at the gifts of the LSD culture, as he should have.    \n\nOf course, I agree with all of these sentiments.  \n\nYou kids need to get off erowid and read some books.  \n\nPickard was into LSD production for the money.  Behind all the scenes of LSD, are the true believers.  Of course, getting the drug out there requires drug dealers and money.  Pickard went too far.  Just because the producers of LSD are non-violent, does not mean they are not serious.  They are.  Pickard crossed lines that should not have been crossed.

Did not believe Common People were ready for psychedelics (they are not), and his formal position was that psychedelics should be experienced by the Elite of the world (that&amp;#39;s not you), and &amp;#39;digested&amp;#39; in a philosophical sense.  Huxley would have been shocked at the fantastically rapid degeneration of LSD in a cultural sense which occurred between 1966 and 1969.  Huxley would certainly have had nothing to do with Thompson&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;crest of the wave&amp;#39; drug-addled, addiction-soaked, abuse, exploitation, and stupidity-rife Haight Ashbury scene.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hoffman:  Get real.  Hoffman wouldn&amp;#39;t even associate with Hippies or the other &amp;#39;psychonauts&amp;#39; on a bus, much less would see himself on a blotter of recreational acid for starry-eyed teenies and immature adults who will garner zero lasting impression from LSD other than &amp;quot;look at the colors, man... whoooaaaaaa&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s an offense Hoffman is on the blotter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Owsley: He made the good acid, and deliberately pushed it out to the population at large.  As an act of subversion.  He, also, believed the majority of people were not ready for the psychedelic experience (they are not), and his plan was that at least this would shake up society and provide an opportunity for change.  Owsley&amp;#39;s idea of a better society is most definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the Hippy mold.  Owsley believed humans eat meat, hippies are dumb, and most drug-takers are simple children who can be led, are moldable, having no original thoughts or impulses of their own.  Acid was a way to get people to question authority and look at things from a different perspective... so that the more intelligent and stronger could lead them away from the chains they willingly submit too.  Owsley expressed profound misgivings at the gifts of the LSD culture, as he should have.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I agree with all of these sentiments.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You kids need to get off erowid and read some books.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pickard was into LSD production for the money.  Behind all the scenes of LSD, are the true believers.  Of course, getting the drug out there requires drug dealers and money.  Pickard went too far.  Just because the producers of LSD are non-violent, does not mean they are not serious.  They are.  Pickard crossed lines that should not have been crossed.  Now he&amp;#39;s in prison.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LSD", "name": "t1_dgdc0o7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492453040.0, "created_utc": 1492424240.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcctjw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 32, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hhreplica1013", "parent_id": "t3_65pr1r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LSD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hardison, McKenna, Lemaire, Huxley", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardison, McKenna, Lemaire, Huxley&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LSD", "name": "t1_dgcctjw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395164.0, "created_utc": 1492366364.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr1r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcmvdu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lecter", "parent_id": "t3_65pr1r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LSD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The hit men.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hit men.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LSD", "name": "t1_dgcmvdu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492408364.0, "created_utc": 1492379564.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr1r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp0x1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Keenkeem", "parent_id": "t3_65pr1r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LSD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Damn no McKenna ): ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn no McKenna ): &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LSD", "name": "t1_dgcp0x1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492411259.0, "created_utc": 1492382459.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr1r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr1r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr1r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr1r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrkcx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lemmelickurcucumber", "parent_id": "t1_dgcr0o8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LSD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[He also discovered 4-AcO-DET and pioneered research on LSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann#Further_research) He kinda is a legend :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann#Further_research\"&gt;He also discovered 4-AcO-DET and pioneered research on LSA&lt;/a&gt; He kinda is a legend :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LSD", "name": "t1_dgcrkcx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492414748.0, "created_utc": 1492385948.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcr0o8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KylerGreen", "parent_id": "t1_dgcg8ob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LSD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow didn't know he was the first to do that with mushrooms.
