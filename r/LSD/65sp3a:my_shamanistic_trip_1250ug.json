Previous to this trip, I had done acid around 25 times. I consider myself an experienced tripper. I had done up to 800 mics before and wanted something even stronger. My good friend who had done acid a handful of times prior also wanted to absolutely take off. Both of us are incredibly interested in the expansion of consciousness, which fueled our interest in the beyond of LSD. It was Sunday night, and we didn&amp;#39;t have school the next day. We went into my acid stash and grabbed 5 tabs that were 500 mics each. We each consumed two and a half tabs for a total of 1250 mics each. I had read about 1000ug+ doses and still wasn&amp;#39;t prepared for what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We took the tabs in my room, and went out into the stormy night. It took about 45 minutes for the first effects to become noticeable. I consider the true start of the trip when we were sitting in a park, overlooking a creek. Beautiful psychedelic patterns began to swirl and morph over the water. As we listened to music, our souls began to weave and drift in and out of one another. We went back to my house and went to my backyard, which faces a mountain. It was cold and windy, the clouds illuminated by the near full moon. We sat next to each other, speaking without talking. My entire vision at this point consisted of intense psychedelic patterns and visions of cosmic beauty. We were smoking weed out of a blown glass pipe that seems to morph and writhe in our hands. From the backyard we went into my room and crawled into my bed. This is what I would consider the peak of the trip. With the lights off, we listened to EDM music while observing the visual splendor in the darkness. In the hyper-complex psychedelic waves, we saw our souls become interconnected. We formed a deep, indescribable spiritual bond that I expect will last us the rest of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to explain what happened past that point. When I try to recall the memory it is saturated by light, color, and beauty. We continued to smoke weed throughout the night and the next day, never sleeping a wink. On Monday night, after a full day of tripping, my friend had to return home. It felt as if half of my entire being was ripped off from me. I&amp;#39;m not sure how long I cried for, but it was a while. I barely could sleep, and the next morning I was still tripping. Exhausted, I continually hallucinated in class, and somehow made it safely home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The total trip time was a little short of 72 hours. In that time, we traveled through multiple realities and dimensions. The introspective knowledge gained was vast and indescribable. Additionally, we smoked around 7 grams of weed, which heightened the effects of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have tripped a handful of times, not going above 700 mics. I still feel the effects of The Trip, and I believe it has changed me forever in a positive spiritual way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I&amp;#39;ve never written this out, and I have left out some parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn on.
