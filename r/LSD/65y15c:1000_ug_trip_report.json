The clouds were still contorting, and i began to feel even weirder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take 2 more hits hoping that it would extend the duration. i know this wasn&amp;#39;t the wisest decision, it was a spur of the moment thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i started to lose myself fully. i felt like i had delved deep into the dimension lucy had taken me to. i felt almost like a baby born into a completely new universe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;we walked to his house and decided to take quite a few bong hits. We then walked outside and decided to go to a boat ramp overlooking the sound ( we live on a little town on an island). It  was unreal. all the house  lights on the land across the bridge and the boat lights in the water were twinkling, and were this very bright blue color. The water was a dark blue, but looked smooth. Like one of those rubber floors you&amp;#39;d have at a gymnastics building. i was playing a play list i had made. my friend asked me if i was okay a few times again. i wasn&amp;#39;t talking much at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this is when the most intense part happened. as we were listening to the music zoned out overlooking the sound, a new song began to play&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pwCgBhvck8\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pwCgBhvck8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as this song played, i lost myself completely. i felt spacey. i wasn&amp;#39;t of this place, i was an alien that had been brought here by God\u2019s chemical. i looked up at the sky and i was astounded. the sky was spinning, but i felt as if time had stopped again. i felt as if i were in the middle of the world in a bubble and the outside was spinning and rotating while the bubble stood still. i sat on the bench and the stars were swirling and traveling far away into space, getting farther and farther until another star would swirl in front of that star and take its place. some of the stars would connect by a white line (like a stencil) and then once connected they would turn into a very bright color such as purple and then would fade away, leaving nothing there. the stars were very bright and were twinkling. I felt alone. my friend wasn\u2019t there. Lucy had taken me to an introspective land of constant reflections both consciously and subconsciously. i was a new being. Lucy had taken complete control. i had also been silent for quite a while.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as we were walking back, my friend walked up a little bit and let me have some space (later on he explained that i seemed to be having my own little spiritual journey. he said he decided to just leave me be and let me explore)he said i was bending down feeling the texture of everything and i would stop and just gaze at a certain object until he would have to come tap my arm to come on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;when we got in his house. i sat on the couch and we played music again. he was still having a hell of a time too, but seemed more functional and in reality. he kept asking me if i was okay. he has a bright orange and green painted wall that connect. as i looked the walls seemed to be extending/bending/morphing/contorting/ etc. everything was breathing. I would constantly lose myself. It got to the point that my eyes began to burn from keeping them open and focusing on something for so long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;after a while, i decide to walk home and lay down and turn on family guy for the hell of it. i decide to turn down the tv and keep playing music, its just something i enjoy doing while tripping, its different. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i went in the bathroom and looked in the mirror. my face looked really strange. i looked like a goblin kind of. my face was growing and shrinking and my eyes were giant. I ended up standing in the mirror in the same place for about twenty minutes staring into my eyes and trying to figure out what lied behind them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i snapped out of it started to get pretty drowsy, which surprised me, a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i went and laid in bed and left a window open. it was almost pitch black except for an orange street light reflecting against one of my walls. the walls looked so strange, after a while it seemed like i was overlooking some sort of void. I finally closed my eyes and drifted off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;woke up this morning feeling different. Not a bad different. i felt great. i had had one hell of a trip and had left everything behind to travel to a distant place&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;later on i went to smoke at my friends house. he told me that the reason he had been constantly questioning whether or not i was okay was because he would start to talk to me and my mouth would begin to hang and that i would stare at the same exact spot with my eyes wide open for a good while. he said my pupils were FUCKED. And that he could tell i was really out there. he said i could barely speak, and that i would say words backwards and put certain words in front of others when trying to say a sentence. he also said i would hang my head a lot and stare at the ground and just stand there for a while and he would have to tap me and snap me out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i loved this to death. i feel like some people wouldn\u2019t have liked some of the things i experienced at times. i felt overwhelmed a few times. there were even a few times i had to remind myself to let go and to feel it and not fight it, which i was able to do pretty easily thankfully. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;im not going to forget this trip. it was unreal. i never thought i could experience such bliss and strangeness. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "yesterday i decided to take 1000ug ( 8 hits )\n\n dropped the hits, eager for the trip to begin\n\n shit starts to get weird. real weird. everything had just gotten 1000x brighter. everything was beginning to breathe. my perceptions seemed way off. everything began to seem farther and farther away and as if it were getting farther.\ni go to meet my friend. i have done lsd numerous times but he hadn\u2019t tried it yet. he decided to take 4, which i strongly advised against and suggested he take 2. \n\n: we decide to walk to a board walk near my house that over looks the beach. it was beautiful out. sunny, 80 degrees but with a nice cool wind. we sat on the board walk and my friend seemed different than he ever had. he was so happy, laughing hysterically, and extremely social.
