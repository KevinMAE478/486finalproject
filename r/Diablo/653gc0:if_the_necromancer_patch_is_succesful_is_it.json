Diablo and ROS has sold roughly 30Million Copies, and at a 50 dollar average (shading towards the 60 dollar price of vanilla with a small weight towards the 20 dollar ROS price), D3 has made 1500M since 2012. In overwatch's first half a year of product life, it has already made over a third of what d3 has made in five years -- just from it's PC revenue-- in addition to having a way to make money post-release. I'm not debating that d3 is a great game, or that i think packs are a good/bad idea. I just think that blizzard is astutely aware that they lost a LOT of goodwill early on in the diablo lifecycle, and although recent patches and QOL improvements to the game have made it far better, they will need some way to reestablish hype and show a willingness to create a \"modern\" game in order for d4 to succeed in the way they want and be a landmark game in the way overwatch was.

Diablo and ROS has sold roughly 30Million Copies, and at a 50 dollar average (shading towards the 60 dollar price of vanilla with a small weight towards the 20 dollar ROS price), D3 has made 1500M since 2012.
