I don&amp;#39;t mean to speak for everybody in my particular demographic group, but all I want is to just state my observations and make some hopefully accurate generalizations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an Indian guy, the son of Indian immigrant parents growing up in America, I was faced with a lot of confusion and contradictions while being raised in two separate cultures. I won&amp;#39;t waste your time by talking about all the different types of confusion (and man, I could go on about this shit). I want to focus on the confusion revolving around my sexuality, and how a warped combination repressive Indian culture and American pornographic mass media left me all kinds of fucked-up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother never used to let me talk to other girls, even when I was in elementary school. One time when I just was leaving middle school, she saw me talking to this Asian girl (we were just talking about an algebra test and what we got for our answers, nothing sexual) and she yelled at me about it for weeks, going as far as to check on me during the middle of the day and during my lunch hours to make sure I wasn&amp;#39;t communicating with members of the opposite sex (she got extra mad because it was a different race as well). My father was sick, weak, and irritable with kidney problems, and he didn&amp;#39;t care about being involved in my social life, leaving that mostly to my mother. This was around the same time I was going through puberty, and I was beginning to feel an attraction towards girls. When my mom was away at work and my dad was laying in bed upstairs coughing, I used to sneak downstairs and watch shitty TV shows involving a lot of sex because I was curious, and obviously, it felt good down there. This left me really confused. If girls were so evil like my mom made them out to be, how could they make me feel so good? I began to think about these things more deeply. It was only later after reading stuff online that I came across information on how repressive Indian culture was and how bad some Indian mothers could be with their sons, giving them too much unhealthy attention. I read about Freud and the Oedipus and Jocasta complexes (Western works of psychology). Sooner or later I realized that what my mom was doing to me was unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I blame American mass media and TV shows filled with sex for giving me a warped view of what my sexuality should be like as an Indian male. I used to watch the Big Bang Theory and always felt really sorry for Raj, the Indian astrophysicist. In the show, he was always surrounded by that which he wanted but could never have (white or blonde women) and the audience always laughed at him for this. To me this was just really sad. American society makes fun of Indian males in so many other ways (Apu in the Simpsons, the doctor stereotype). It&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re a joke. You hear a lot about feminists complaining how women are oppressed and the alt-right or whatever about how white men are oppressed, but honestly, the Indian male raised in American society has got to be one of the most confused, displaced, and laughed-at demographics out there. Our parents don&amp;#39;t allow us to have relationships with members of the opposite sex and at the same time we&amp;#39;re bombarded with lustful and tempting images from advertising, TV, and of course, porn. It&amp;#39;s like getting someone addicted to drugs and then stopping the supply to watch and laugh while they go through withdrawals. It&amp;#39;s cruel and not right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With nofap I&amp;#39;ve began to think about all these things in a lot more detail, and I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find my own way through all this. Nofap has given me the courage to defy my parents more- watching porn and MO&amp;#39;ing twice a day left me complacent and not caring about my situation. But now I feel very socially aware (in two ways, one where I&amp;#39;m actually more social with other people, and the other where I&amp;#39;m more aware of the mechanisms at play in society as a whole). In a way going through nofap has helped me reclaim some of my sexuality from the damage and confusion caused by the extremes of both cultures. I&amp;#39;ve still relapsed a lot but I plan to continue until I make it to 100 days, and maybe if I feel good about it, the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, I know this was long.

But there&amp;#39;s still that sense of, like you call it, emotional isolation sometimes. I don&amp;#39;t know why I want a romantic relationship so badly- is it because I simply want human affection or is it because I&amp;#39;m a sex-crazed pervert Indian like the media makes me out to be? That&amp;#39;s kind of why I&amp;#39;m on nofap, I want to take back my sexuality and focus on it some more, ask the important questions of what I want and what I should do with my life. But for now, I&amp;#39;m just feel like I&amp;#39;m in a state of suspended animation and contemplation. When I eventually come out of it, I think that I will be more powerful in some way.

You can have nerdy hobbies or work in nerdy professions, but you don't want to actively portray this as your primary image.\n\n(2) Disconnect from your parents as much as possible and as soon as possible, especially on topics of girls and sexuality.  This means things like MOVE OUT AS FAST AS YOU CAN, and don't listen to them regarding these things; downright ignore them if you have to.  It's YOUR life.\n\n(3) Join a gym, eat right, and get buff.  This will help SO much in countering any nerdy stereotypes.  Get a cool identifiable fashion style and lifestyle.\n\n(4) If you have an accent, get a speech coach and fix it.  Since you grew up in America, I'll assume that's not a problem for you.\n\nYes, it sucks about our upbringing and our repressive parents and all that.

Accept that time that you can't get back, and relentlessly work on yourself to overcome whatever weaknesses you have.  If you're over the age of 18 or 19 or so, there is nothing your parents can or cannot \"let\" you do - at this point it is YOU who is letting them do it to you.  If you adopt the right mindset and want it badly enough to take massive action, you'll make it.\n\nPersonal experience: I didn't get laid until my early 20s, and I was pretty depressed like you during my late teen years for many of the same reasons (though my parents weren't quite as bad as yours).
