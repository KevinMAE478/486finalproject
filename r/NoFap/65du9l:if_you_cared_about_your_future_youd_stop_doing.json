You were a young child. You didn&amp;#39;t know what masturbation or porn or any of that was. You didn&amp;#39;t reward yourself with that. You had a very natural curiosity about the world around you. There was so much you wanted to learn. You probably put effort into building legos or drawing pictures maybe building a snowman. You put in effort to do these things because you knew you would get a reward from doing them. You would get praise from your friends, parents, and teachers and you would be proud of your work. You handn&amp;#39;t been poisoned by the appeal of immediate rewards yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can achieve your goals if you believe you can, because what you put in right now determines your future. It&amp;#39;s still very hard to put your mind on this at times. But every second from now is your future. What you do right now can have a huge impact on yourself in the very short term and the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An extreme example would be if you went up to someone in the street and shot them. There would be huge consequences in a very short period of time. You would either get arrested and go to prison or you would have to run away and create a new identity for yourself. Obviously, most people are able to easily see the consequences of such action so they don&amp;#39;t do it (Of course some aren&amp;#39;t).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some consequences are harder to see though. One example would be eating a dozen twinkies per day. You may know that they&amp;#39;re bad for you but you don&amp;#39;t necessarily see immediate consequences for your actions. In the US, obesity is a huge problem because it is harder to be aware of the consequences of eating unhealthy than of the consequences of killing someone where there is a much more immediate impact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of unhealthy foods taste good and draw people to them more than the salad does because it gives them an immediate reward. Of course, eating healthy has more long term benefits, that are harder to see if you have a present oriented mindset. A lot more people are obese than commit violent crimes because it is much harder to see the consequences of eating fatty foods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the consequences of porn and masturbation? It&amp;#39;s hard to know when we have heard propaganda that masturbation is healthy and that it relieves stress. Porn and masturbation have been widely accepted as normal in recent years. On top of that, there is a high reward in the present for masturbating. It is stimulating and it releases a lot of dopamine in the brain which is why it feels so good when we do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this can create a habit where rewards are often found through masturbation. A person may not care to go through hours of work to get a promotion, or put in hours at the gym to improve their fitness, or build self confidence and invest in themselves so they can make more friends or get a girlfriend when they can just go to their room, and put in little effort and relatively little time and get that dopamine hit through masturbation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason it is so hard for people to do this is because it is so hard to grasp how much better their lives would be if they put their effort into improving themselves. They can&amp;#39;t see the rewards of putting blood, sweat and tears into something that gives them a return on their investment in the future. It&amp;#39;s much easier to go for immediate rewards because there is no uncertainty of being rewarded. When working towards their goals, people will often fail multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They will see this as proof that their goals are impossible and give up. BUT THEY ARE NOT. Only if your goal is unrealistic, can it be impossible. But even that may be a stretch. You didn&amp;#39;t achieve your goal yet because it takes time and effort and more time and effort than you thought it takes. Depending on your goal it may take a month, year, ten years or even beyond that. YOUR REWARD SYSTEM IS FUCKED AND YOU BETTER START UNFUCKING IT! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you can do is stop neglecting yourself. Stop taking these immediate rewards because they are teaching you that everything in your life is good. It&amp;#39;s not. There are things you have to do to improve your life. You can do better, but only if you put in work. And it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard but its gonna be worth it. Know what you do is affecting your future. Meditate on it. Become mindful of it.
