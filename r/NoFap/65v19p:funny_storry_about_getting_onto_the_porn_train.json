Quit PMO to better yourself and be an affirmation of life! not because it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; or bad to &amp;quot;touch my we wee&amp;quot; for fucks sake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, gays and trans people are bashed in this. OP likes it but is ashamed, he&amp;#39;s only pretending he&amp;#39;s not one of them. Porn addiction is unhealthy but don&amp;#39;t bash LGBT people because you feel ashamed because of religious/family/cultural backgrounds and norms. You don&amp;#39;t have to be 100% heterosexual to be normal, sex research has shown (since WAY before google btw) 100% heterosexuality is basically a myth. It&amp;#39;s not a conspiracy people, just empirical evidence that threw off the facade created and maintained by religion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck on recovering though. We should all focus on finding healthy relationships and self improvement. However, it shouldn&amp;#39;t matter who it&amp;#39;s with. May we all find the path to greatness with as little self-loathing as possible. Get what you want through affirmation, not negation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoFap", "name": "t1_dgdtmmw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479816.0, "created_utc": 1492451016.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdgpg5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NEVER_FAP_AGAIN96", "parent_id": "t3_65v19p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoFap", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This piece of art should be taught at schools.
