My fucking mind is blown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am lucky enough to be a tall, fairly handsome guy. But I didn&amp;#39;t always used to be this way. I fell into a long period of my life not taking care of my appearance. I&amp;#39;ve spent the last 2 years working out, using all sorts of creams on my face, looking up how to style my hair attractively, etc. So much so that I&amp;#39;m now pretty happy with my look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;56 days deep, the sexual energy is intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll share with you the secret to how I got chatted up by an intelligent 10. And I mean she is fucking 10, I don&amp;#39;t know where I can go from here unless there&amp;#39;s an 11.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s the process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 0: Get deep into a long NoFap streak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Work on yourself as much as possible. Get handsome. Style yourself good, dress good, speak well, carry yourself well. Whatever you style is, be it and live it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Meditate and do yoga / tai chi / gi gong / ju jitsu for hours each day. When you don&amp;#39;t have the time, make time. When you really dont have the time, bring mindfulness to all your activities. This is an 100% must.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3. Change your beliefs about woman. Know that they are good, but they are not like men. They love a full range of emotions and won&amp;#39;t behave in ways that&amp;#39;ll make sense to your logical man brain. They have an equally as good, but different perspective. (This is a generalisation, but generally true) Be patient, and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4. Write down a list of everything you want your next relationship to be like. Do a meditation where you go deeply into the feelings of falling in love. Imagine a beautiful woman and how good you&amp;#39;d feel with her... actually... how good you ALREADY feel knowing she is going to come at some point. Visualise making love, holding hands, being romantic together and really FEEL it. Do this for 5-10 minutes then LET GO and FORGET ABOUT IT. This is the most important bit!! (Bonus tip: do it before bed or in the morning for booster effect)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 5. Let go of it completely. Forget about woman. Concentrate 100% of your energy into your lifes mission and goals. If you don&amp;#39;t have a life purpose, get one now, a big one. Do what you need to work it out, now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Work on this life&amp;#39;s purpose out in public, where there are woman. Don&amp;#39;t be looking all the time at woman. Get on with your shit in the presence of other people. Ideas: Run workshops, go out and help people, vollenteer, play music in public, work on a laptop in cafes, survey people in the street, do your sport in a public park / place, set up a marketstall, go to seminars, events, etc etc. Whatever fits with your mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 7: if you&amp;#39;re doing it all right. Beautiful woman will come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 8: When they do come: just keep your life&amp;#39;s purpose your main focus. Don&amp;#39;t pedestalize them, don&amp;#39;t concentrate on them, hold your reality and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 9: repeat the meditation in step 4. Love yourself, feel loved, feel abundance, feel you don&amp;#39;t lack a relationship because you are so in love with the idea of one, and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t expect results as quick as me, I&amp;#39;ve been working on this.
