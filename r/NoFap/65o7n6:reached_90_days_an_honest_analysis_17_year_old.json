I litteraly became a chick magnet, so many girls get attracted to my natural maturity. My interest in reading became bigger, i recently started reading an interesting informative book (non-fiction). I became more mature, because of that i love to be around older people as well as teenagers. My urge to learn more about the world has grown (it wasn&amp;#39;t there at first). My journey was an emotional rollercoaster:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 1-25: \nA LOT OF URGES, much more energy, happier in general. More extraverted behavior, more motivated in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 25-45:\nThis was the so-called flatline. My dick was literally dead, no single urge appeared. I felt empty inside, had no motivation. My urge to go talk to people dissapeared. I didn&amp;#39;t have any social anxiety at all, but i didn&amp;#39;t see the point in talking to people. This was a very boring period, actually kind of depressing and empty. \nThe flatline is a phase where your brain is &amp;#39;rewiring&amp;#39; itself. Because of that, you will look at women differently (the way all men are supposed to look at women). If you find yourself in the flatline: KEEP GOING! There is light at the end of the tunnel.

The beauty in every woman becomes visible. A woman&amp;#39;s look is still very important tho, but her personality becomes a much bigger factor in attraction. I am living life at a much higher level, where most of the men are supposed to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life and my goals became much more clear. I know what i want in life, i dominate life.
