Day 188 for me and I see just minor improvement in conversations. \n\nI know its hard. We created block that is holding us back. 3 years ago when I still was drinking I noticed that I could converse like a boss, but only when I was drunk. Our brain is fine, but we believe that we cannot converse, and our subconscious, will make it happen. We need to persuade ourselves that we are great conversationalists, but this is not possible in short time. Once you will believe to it your converse skills will be as good as others people if not better. \n\nUnless you will deeply believe it you will be freezing. Personally when I talk I fake it and other feel it. Last week I decided to keep my mouth shut, and only speak when I feel like it. I see different approach of other people to me and to others. When they speak with me they are numb, but when they speak with others they are normal. So there is problem inside me.

Day 188 for me and I see just minor improvement in conversations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know its hard. We created block that is holding us back. 3 years ago when I still was drinking I noticed that I could converse like a boss, but only when I was drunk. Our brain is fine, but we believe that we cannot converse, and our subconscious, will make it happen. We need to persuade ourselves that we are great conversationalists, but this is not possible in short time. Once you will believe to it your converse skills will be as good as others people if not better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you will deeply believe it you will be freezing.

You sound like a very intelligent person with a lot to give to the world.\n\nIf you'd allow me... let me see if I can suggest a few things that might help you:\n\n1. Start meditating. Start with 10 minutes a day, and build up to 30mins - 1h a day. This is going to lower your stress and anxiety, and allow you for your active, intelligent mind to have less of a grip on your personal wellbeing. Look up how to meditate online. Find a style that suits you. Read Eckhart Tolle - The Power Of Now and listen to lots of Alan Watts.\n\n2. Take steps toward finding your life's purpose. You may not know it yet, and that's OK. The things you're doing now will reveal themselves later to be pieces of the puzzle that led to your ultimate dream. But this is how you know you're on your way... Ask yourself: What things make me feel: Excited, passionate, adventurous, connected, and contributing to others? Write down the things that make you feel the emotions I've listed, and start doing more of them.\n\n3. Start building a loving relationship with yourself. Congratulate yourself on your successes. Give yourself rest when needed. Know that you are loved and you have love to give other people. The more you love and accept yourself, the closer you'll be to attracting someone who loves and accepts themself, a reflection of the new you... which is your ideal life partner, not the people you'll attract now, which will currently be a reflection of your currently insecure and worrying self.\n\n4. If you feel like you don't fit in and don't have many friends that you really feel resonate with your heart, then it may be because you are destined for greatness and don't want to settle for the same mundane emotions and experiences that other people do. This is the burden of a highly intelligent person destined for greatness. They often have to travel a part of the road that is lonely. Use this time to work on your dreams and visions and goals, and doing the things that make you feel alive.\n\n5. Create a list of positive affirmations to read to yourself every morning that resonate with you. \"I am loved\" \"Today is another opportunity to take steps to realise my goals\". Make them ring with gratitude. Write down things every day that you are grateful for.\n\nPeace and love bro", "edited": 1492385918.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me congratulate you on your phenomenal achievements.
