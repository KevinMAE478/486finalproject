There is &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; power in libido. Yesterday I was in flirt mode with this girl for about a minute, and my libido skyrocketed. I was hard for hours. I didn&amp;#39;t feel the need to jerk off, I felt the need to go out and take it to the next level. At the same time, I felt an enormous amount of energy. I didn&amp;#39;t do it because I&amp;#39;m still worried about the consequences of just going with the flow, but the more I break out of my shell and not care so much about being hurt, the less I feel hurt, and the more I feel like living the life I always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoFap", "name": "t1_dg5x8mi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035728.0, "created_utc": 1492006928.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2skrn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q70v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64oq2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ManOnAMission76", "parent_id": "t3_64q70v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoFap", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is what nofap is all about.
