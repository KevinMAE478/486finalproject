Some other people think about it as a &amp;quot;cult&amp;quot;. Indeed, there are guys out there that worship it and exaggerate it a bit too much. But here is why it works. Very very simple facts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1. Addiction. People get addicted to a lot of shit.\nSome are addicted to food, some are addicted to videogames, some are addicted to internet, some are addicted to porn, some are addicted to social-media and countless other addictions.\nWhen you get addicted to something it becomes routine, you don&amp;#39;t even think about it.. you just do it.\nEvery time you find yourself in a position that you can&amp;#39;t do your thing, videogames, porn, social media you are starting to get cranky, irritated, you literally feel like shit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2. NoFAP does make you confident.\nWhy is making you confident? It&amp;#39;s not magic and you don&amp;#39;t need a professional study to understand it.\nFirst of all, you are addicted. Fapping makes you feel like shit because it&amp;#39;s a habit that&amp;#39;s eating too much of your life. You pleasure yourself instead of being a horny motherfucker pleasuring real women.\nIf you fap your anxieties away and your problems away you get an instant relief but the real problems remain unsolved. Not fapping will get you back on the real world where your problems live so you&amp;#39;ll start fixing them.. new haircut, new clothes, practice some speech, maybe a job since fapping non-stop makes  you a lazy motherfucker. Every little problem you fix about yourself will give you confidence, every achievement, it&amp;#39;s not NoFAP that does that for you, it&amp;#39;s actually you doing something about yourself instead of beating the monkey.  If you smoke too much and you quit it.. you get a little confidence in yourself, &amp;quot;wow man, I&amp;#39;m in control of myself, I quit smoking&amp;quot; , you feel more empowered, it&amp;#39;s not rocket science. It&amp;#39;s a sense of accomplishment. You can&amp;#39;t tell me that doing something for yourself doesn&amp;#39;t give you confidence because if you do, you&amp;#39;re an idiot. \nIf you spend 8 hours a day in front of the TV and you recognize it effects your daily life, quitting it will give you CONFIDENCE. See?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3. NoFAP makes you more attractive to women.\nAgain, it&amp;#39;s not some magic aura that does that. It&amp;#39;s just you being a horny motherfucker who&amp;#39;s trying to hit on real girls instead of beating the monkey. If you start hitting on girls you already have some confidence in yourself, don&amp;#39;t you? The more you do it, the more you learn. You become good at it. You will start taking care of yourself. Taking care of yourself and having a little confidence makes the women more attracted to you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4. NoFAP gives you muscles.\nHaving a little confidence while hitting on girls, you will understand what your flaws are.. maybe it&amp;#39;s the look, you are more likely to hit the gym. Again, it&amp;#39;s not NoFAP magically giving you muscles, it&amp;#39;s you feeling like a loser about yourself and taking some actions against it instead of fapping all day and dreaming that one day a woman will suddenly fall from the sky. The problem is, you won&amp;#39;t feel so sad like a little bitch when a girl rejects you because you have some confidence already, remember?\nYou will start fixing some of your flaws and become more appealing to them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5. You need to cut the shit for good!\nYou are not in control of yourself now, it&amp;#39;s the porn who&amp;#39;s controlling you. You wake up, brush your teeth, walk around the house and suddenly out of nowhere the monkey is in your hand and you have no idea how that happened. And you do it like a robot. Then you get back to real world, you feel a little shit.. move on with your day and 5 hours later you find yourself with your monkey in your hand at your friend&amp;#39;s house. It&amp;#39;s fucked up man. You need to cut the shit for good in order to get in control of yourself. It&amp;#39;s ok to have a little one after your crush is teasing you for an hour.. that&amp;#39;s healthy masturbation. But in order to achieve that healthy state of masturbation you need to gain control of yourself. You can&amp;#39;t convince a fat bitch to lay off the food by giving her 1 hamburger a day instead of 5. She needs to cut the shit for good for few months in order to have control of her habit. You don&amp;#39;t have to do it out of boredom, it&amp;#39;s weird. If you&amp;#39;re bored do something, get out of the house, watch a movie, meet some friends. Your monkey is not there to deal with your boredom, you don&amp;#39;t fuck because you&amp;#39;re bored. Sex is awesome man, it&amp;#39;s attraction, it&amp;#39;s arousal, it&amp;#39;s butterflies and .... big filled balls. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6. Placebo Effect? Some people say &amp;quot;Oh, it&amp;#39;s just bs, placebo effect&amp;quot;. Life&amp;#39;s a placebo effect man because of it&amp;#39;s subjectiveness. Whatever works for you, doesn&amp;#39;t have to work for everyone. If 5 people feel down and sad and one of them decides to go for a walk every morning and he comes back and says &amp;quot;Look man, going for a walk every morning, helped me.. I feel more confident in my daily life&amp;quot;. The others looking curious decide to try that as well and they come back and say &amp;quot;you are bullshiting man, going for a walk every morning does nothing to me, it&amp;#39;s placebo&amp;quot;.\nYou need to remember it&amp;#39;s a habit, not a disease. A bad habit can affect you in so many ways and bad habits are subjective. If you acknowledge that something is bad for you, it is, you goddamn feel it. We have different life experiences, some shit affect some people more than others. You can get dopamine spikes watching the sunset, if it makes you confident that&amp;#39;s goddamn placebo effect but it works isn&amp;#39;t it? YOU FEEL GOOD DOING IT!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it makes sense for everyone questioning it.\nAnd sorry for my english.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I don&amp;#39;t want you guys to feel bad. These are my most friendly and honest thoughts.\nA friend will always tell you &amp;quot;hey motherfucker, man up you loser&amp;quot;. You feel a bit bad but it&amp;#39;s your friend, you value his honesty.\nSomeone who doesn&amp;#39;t actually give a shit about yourself will use the soft bullshit language upon yourself trying to make you feel like a special snowflake which you ARE NOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've seen a lot of people questioning NoFAP and I will try to explain in a very simple manner why it works.
