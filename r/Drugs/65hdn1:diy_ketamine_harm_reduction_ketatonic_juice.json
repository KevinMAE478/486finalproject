This will potentiate the fuck out of your ketamine high and you will hole for even longer. Cool, so buy some 100% white grapefruit juice and mix in a few shots of some 100% cranberrry juice because that&amp;#39;s really great for your urinary health too. Awesome! Now green tea contains l-theanine which will not only help calm your anxiety and ease you into your trip but the catechins in green tea such as EGCG actually work to protect and reverse the harmful effects K has on your bladder and kidneys! So brew like 10 bags of green tea on the stove or in the microwave in a cup (buy decaf if you wanna be able to sleep). Let steep and then and spike your grapefruit/cranberry kocktail with that shit to complete the Ketatonic Juice Kocktail!
