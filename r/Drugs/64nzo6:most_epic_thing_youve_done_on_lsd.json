So I was at shangri-la music festival in Minnesota. At a bunch of these music festivals there's this continuous game of 'capture the flag' going. You only play the game if you know about it, look out for it next time you're at a festival. It's probably being played. The object is, if you see a pirate flag, you have to go get it. But if someone catches you taking it, you don't get it. \n\nSo it starts off with me dancing listening to the music. This dude tells me to take a bite out of this ten strip, so I took a couple hits off and ate them. He says that was a small bite and tells me I can have more if I want. I was already on acid mushrooms and MDMA so I figure why the hell not. I ate almost the whole thing. It tasted fine I wasn't really worried. \n\nSo, naturally , I start tripping way hard. I decide to go back to my tent and just drink some beers and take some etizolam that I had stashed up to take the edge off and maybe come back later. \n\nThe first thing that happens is that I can't find my tent. It's a tiny festival, it's pretty easy to find your way around. But I couldn't find it. Everything looked like a crazy circus. So I see this farmer guy wearing overalls, selling vegetables. I'm pretty sure there was even a straw hanging out of his mouth. It was clich\u00e9 looking and I was starving. I thought the tomatoes were apples. So I grab an 'Apple' and say, \"SIR. How much do you want for this apple? I need it very badly. You are a saint.\" He says, \"MY FRIEND. FOOD SHOULD BE FREE. Take whatever you like.\". So I take a tomato and a cucumber. It was funny when I bit into the 'Apple' to find out it was a tomato. \n\nAnyways, it doesn't stop there. That's not the epic part. So I still can't find my tent. Somehow while walking around, my visuals like highlighted this pirate flag up in the trees. I could barely see anything, how I even saw this flag beats me. \n\nI see 4 hammocks lined up between these two trees stacked on top of one another. There's people sleeping in 3 of them. At the top theres this deer stand with a fifth of whiskey on top of the pirate flag keeping it in place.\n\nIt was my grand moment. It was literally too easy of a situation. But I had to be sneaky. \n\nSo I crept up this tree, there were wooden steps nailed to it like a treehouse. I sneak over 3 sleeping people without waking them up. \n\nFinally, I'm almost there and I hear one guy waking up. I think 'oh fuck not now not now' so I jump up there really quick and grab the pirate flag and start screaming 'ATAYAYAYYAYAYYYYA' or something. Like some sort of calling ape. I hear him scream 'no! What the fuck no!!' It was too late. The pirate flag was mine and so was the whiskey. I wrapped the pirate flag around my head as a bandana and chugged this whiskey as much as I could. I then projectile vomited (on purpose) off of this deer stand into the night. \n\nI got down and the all the people were awake by now. They were sad they lost their flag but they were proud.

Still one of the trippiest experiences of my life. Just the multitude of colors and the diversity of the underwater life was mindblowing. It&amp;#39;s as if I were on an entirely different planet watching alien entities conduct their everyday business just as we would.

It was the dumbest thing we've ever done in our lives. We should of died and we are seriously lucky that we didn't wreck or got caught and honestly this wasn't planned, it just happened. (Also this was our first time taking \"real\" LSD).\n\nSo I had a couple friends that was involved in this. We'll call them (Tom \"who had his dad's camaro\", Chad \"who got the LSD\").\n\nTom's dad was out of town and he asked me to come ride in his dad's 2014 V8 Camaro. Of course I said yes and we started driving around and had some fun. I then got a text from Chad and he said he got some LSD, so me and Tom went to the town over to pick it up. We met Chad and he gave us a tab each and we took it so by the time it would hit us we would already be back at Tom's house. We got to Tom's house and it wasn't hitting us. An hour and half past and we still weren't feeling anything so we thought \"well it's not going to hit us\", and we decided to start driving around. It was about 9-10pm and we started jamming out to music and then it hit us... LSD isn't that hard to drive by itself so we kinda got use to it. We were taking back roads and having a great time. This is where it starts to get crazy.\n\nChad texted me and said to come back to Tom's house. We got back and we could tell he was tripping so much harder than us. We asked him how we was tripping so hard and he said he smoked a blunt. He told us that we had to smoke to amplify the LSD, so then we smoked. We didn't want to spend the crazy trip inside the whole time so since Tom gotten use to driving the manual Camaro for the past 2 hours, he suggested we should go drive. We all thought about it and we said \"fuck it, let's drive\". \n\nI know this is going to sound impossible but we drove for a total of 5-6 hours while tripping balls. To top it off our average speed the whole time was 100mph. The fastest we got it was 135mph on a straight stretch. We live in the country, so we mainly were taking back roads. The whole time we were out of our minds. When I'm sober I hate going fast but I was immune to the thought of how fast we were going. Chad was kinda in a hippie/peace trip so he was freaking the fuck out half the time and me and Tom were laughing uncontrollably and were completely pumped up. I don't know what kinda trip me and Tom really had. I never experienced anything like we did. I guess the best way I could describe our trips was like we did lots of cocaine. I remember looking out the window and I could barely see the surroundings outside. Everything was all blurred out cuz of how fast we were going. We were literally all insane. I remember Tom and I said that if a cop spotted us, we would out run him. We were so confident and we had no fear. There was a time where we were going down a huge hill and then it turned 30\u00b0 to the left. We were going about 110 down the hill and I remember when we went around the turn, we felt the back tire lose grip and we ended doing a hard drift. We said \"oh my god, we could of died\", while laughing... the whole time we were driving, we were peaking. Normally a peak wouldn't last 6 hours, but the rush of going so fast and our blood pumping just kept it going. We ended up getting back to Tom's house around 5am. People were starting to wake up and go to work and it wasn't safe for us to be on the road anymore.\n\nI don't know how we didn't die. I think about it every once in while and can't believe of how stupid it was for us to do it. We all decided to never do that again. I'm sure if we did a second time, it wouldn't go so well.

Then my girlfriend came over and picked me up and we started the day. I planned everything out to a tee for the day. Went and saw my best friend after surgery he was on pain killers and we laughed a lot while all of us smoked. Then after a couple hours of shooting the shit and mind melting I was peaking hard and asked my girlfriend to drive me to a very specific spot. When we got there I led her down this 2 mile trail while trying to keep my shit together. It was December and a bit cold but I felt alive and embraced it. Only 35 degrees outside thankfully. When we finally reached the end of the trail it has this 150 foot cliff that goes straight down into water. The view is a full 180-270 degree view of a massive lake with nothing but beautiful trees lining it. The lake stretches probably a mile and half over when you look at it from the cliff. It was beautiful the trees were doing that weird thing that I don't know how to describe. The water flowing back and forth had the most incredible visuals I had ever seen. I lit up a blunt for me and my girlfriend right as the clock hit 4:20. I thought it was very well timed and cool but probably not that important. We chain smoked blunts until the sunset came and left. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever been able to witness.

Then my girlfriend came over and picked me up and we started the day. I planned everything out to a tee for the day. Went and saw my best friend after surgery he was on pain killers and we laughed a lot while all of us smoked. Then after a couple hours of shooting the shit and mind melting I was peaking hard and asked my girlfriend to drive me to a very specific spot. When we got there I led her down this 2 mile trail while trying to keep my shit together. It was December and a bit cold but I felt alive and embraced it. Only 35 degrees outside thankfully. When we finally reached the end of the trail it has this 150 foot cliff that goes straight down into water.
