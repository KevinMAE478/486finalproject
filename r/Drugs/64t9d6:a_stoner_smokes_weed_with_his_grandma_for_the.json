Our teachers somehow believed that, so we got there in the self claimed &amp;quot;worst hotel in the world&amp;quot;, which isn&amp;#39;t as bad as it sounds, if you don&amp;#39;t mind the terrible food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, some guy from our class bought us the weed, because he knew his shit and we didn&amp;#39;t. We ate some brownies, nothing happened (after 30mins, we knew nothing) and so we drank beer and started smoking in the city. I don&amp;#39;t remember how I got in the situation, because we started next to a canal, but suddenly I sat in a diner with the girl I was madly in love with and two of her friends and cried my souls out because of my parents divorce a few weeks earlier. I got in the hostel somehow, met one of my roommates there who had also a shitty night, felt the urge to puke, did just that in the bathroom and the world looked much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were some guys much more fucked up than me and many inside jokes and great stories were created that weekend,  but let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m glad that I forget a lot when smoking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Btw second time smoking was the exact opposite, I trained to roll in the meantime and made a huge joint for 3 persons. Unpaused laughter and bonding with friends, even mild hallucinations, that was probably one of my favorite drug experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dg5d15g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491994096.0, "created_utc": 1491965296.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5bzcm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tejmin", "parent_id": "t1_dg5brga", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha!
