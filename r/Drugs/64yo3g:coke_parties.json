The guy Im talking to just walks away. I follow him, cradling my cup of vodka, not knowing what else to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont know many of these people but Im here to do cocaine and so are they. I dont like them. My friends let them around because they bring blow. Two of them deal. Half of them are gangsters. They make me uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone talks loudly to eachother about anything and everything but nobody listens. Someone pulls the plate out of the microwave. Clink clink clink. Chop chop chop. The scrape of a razor blade across a cheap ceramic plate makes me wince. I down the rest of my cup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some coked out dude keeps asking me about my shoes. Fuck it man i dont know, I got them online. Lemme see that dollar bill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This coke is so good you can barely feel it in your nose. I imagine that I can feel my pupils instantly dialate as the coke turns to cocaethylene somewhere in my body. A euphoric rush passes over me. I react different. I dont get talkative. I sit on a couch twitching. I look like I have tourrettes or something but I dont care because Im high as fuck. I feel like the life of the party and nobody even knows who the fuck I am except some friend of the homeowner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the twitching is a side effect from all the MDMA I used to do. I dont know. I dont really care but it makes people nervous. The coke dealer is talking about it. I can feel eyes landing on me. I can hear the hot whispers. The drunk bitch who loudly asks whats wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get up and go outside with my friend the smoker and a bunch of other sketchy people smoking cigarettes outside. Someone hands me a bottle of hennessy and I take a swig of the brown liquid. It tastes like shit. I go do another line. The drips are running down my throat now but I cant spit them out because my neck is so numb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Im drunk but not quite drunk enough. I need to drink harder to really enjoy the coke waking me up. I look back over my shoulder at the dancing people in the living room. The shitty lights make everything look orange. Nobody gives a shit about anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking around at these people makes me wonder what Im doing with my life. Im not a fiend. I havent been sober since Winter. Im not a fiend. Someone says my name and I snap back to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Remember that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah that was funny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what hes talking about. I look back at the dancers. Its just one guy now. The one who kept asking about my shoes. Hes dancing hard. Clearly drunk and feeling himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This motherfucker,&amp;quot; I laugh, gesturing to him to the crowd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone looks. He stops dancing and cocks his head like a dog. One of the coke whores says something stupid and everyone goes back to talking about that. A crying girl runs into the yard. My friend and another guy I know go to console her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whats wrong?&amp;quot; Mike says. He owns the house. Hes my best friend in the world. Hes also coked out of his mind and has drank a whole 24 pack of Bud Light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick, the other guy, echoes the question. I dont like that guy. Hes sketchy as fuck. Trained in Jiu Jitsu and known for street fights. He wants to fuck the crying girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her boyfriend staggers out, hammered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get over here you fucki&amp;#39; bish&amp;quot; he slurs out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Youre drunk Juan, why dont you go sit down.&amp;quot; Mike tells him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get the fuck outta my face man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Im not in your face bro. Just sit back for a minute. Chill.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You never liked me you fuckin cocksucker. You wanna... Piece of me? Lets fuckin get it.&amp;quot; he spreads his arms and starts walking toward Mike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shove him into the wall. &amp;quot;Why dont you watch how you talk in his fuckin house man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gets in my face. I can smell the liquor on his breath. &amp;quot;Who the fuck are you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who the fuck are you man? Get the fuck outta my face.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike grabs his shoulder and pulls him back. &amp;quot;Dude you need to either sit down or get the fuck out of my house.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine then. Thats how it is. Come on bitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Watch how you talk to her.&amp;quot; nick says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck are you gonna do about it? Huh?&amp;quot; juan grabs her arm and yanks her to her feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick tries to compose himself. I can see him shaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get the fuck outta my house.&amp;quot; Mike says. I can hear the steel in his voice. I think about the drunk and violent people all over. Most of them are leaving now. I know some of them have guns. I think about the shotgun in Mikes closet and wonder if any of them came here with Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A fat girl comes and drags Juan and his girlfriend outside. Apparently she&amp;#39;s their driver and brought them. The remainder of the party spills out front and we cut the music. People are looking for rides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time me and Mike get out there Juan is screaming in his crying girlfriend&amp;#39;s face. Someone confronts him and they square up but the guy walks away. Mike is yelling to get the fuck out of here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl says something and Juan slaps her. Thats when all hell breaks loose. All of us run at Juan and surround him, yelling. Nick cant contain himself any longer and tackles Juan against a car. They roll to the ground and when Juan rises to his knee Nick grabs the side of his head and slams it hard into into the wheel. He slumps to the ground for a moment, blood gushing out of the side of his head, then pops back up. Nick catches him around the waist and slams him face first onto concrete like a rag doll. He lays on him and pulls his arms behind his back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calm the fuck down!&amp;quot; Nick screams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick has outstanding warrants and all of us have drugs or weapons on us. We dont need police attention. Mike tells him to shut the fuck up. Finally, Juan calms down. Nick lets him up and tells him to leave. He staggers toward the car where the girls wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nah youre not riding with them.&amp;quot; Mike says. &amp;quot;call a cab.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Iss my fuckin car man. Im takin it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No youre not.&amp;quot; nick shouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For you kotherfucker.&amp;quot; Juan slurs. &amp;quot;I got somethin in there for you. Ima light all you up with a 44&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You wanna threaten to kill me?&amp;quot; nick screams and charges him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan hits the street with Nick on top of him and they roll around. Juan gets up and socks him hard in the jaw leaving him rocked long enough to leap in the car behind the fat girl. I see his arm come from behind the seat and grab her in a chokehold. He says something and the car takes off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im the only one here with a car so Im quickly talked into a drunken car chase to get the girls from this crazy motherfucker. Thank god its so late that theres nobody else on the streets as we chase them past city limits into the desert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They took a wrong turn and reach a dead end. My car squeaks to a halt behind them and we jump out and start running toward their car. The fat girl opens her door. Juan is leaning over her. The girls are both crying. Juan punches her hard and she starts driving past us. I hop back in my car and resume chase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They finally stop outside a metal fence surrounding a couple acres of property. The passenger door opens and Juan and his girlfriend jump out. We leap out of my car and rush him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fat girl grabs Mike, begging him to stop this. As soon as Juans feet hit the ground Im there with a long overhand that catches him in the mouth and he staggers back. He slaps the girl for catching him and knocks her to the ground. I go to her. He pulls back to punch me. All of a sudden I see a hand grab his head and waist. Nick lifts and throws him a few feet where he hits the ground hard and lays there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; i ask the girl. She keeps trying to run to her boyfriend despite her eye swelling shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan gets up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this guy is fucking invincible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tackles Nick from behind and hits him with a rock. They roll across the ground swinging and grappling. Finally Juan rolls on top with his hand on Nick&amp;#39;s throat. He grabs the rock again and pulls back to slam it on his skull. I take two steps and soccer kick him in the face with all my might. His head snaps back with a sickening noise and he falls on his back, still concious. Nick gets on top of him and hits him with a combo right out of street fighter before standing up over him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan is laying there covered in blood. Nick is bleeding too and his clothes are covered in a mixture of their blood. My shoes are probably ruined. The girls go over to my car and we&amp;#39;re talking about what happens next when I see Juan is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fat girl says shes gonna make sure he made it inside. I dont want to find out we were responsible for him drowning in blood and puke in his own front yard so even tho I think its a bad idea I tell her to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick takes the keys out of Juan&amp;#39;s still running car and throws them, leaving the car blocking the entrance. My heart rate begins to settle as the coke and adrenaline wear off. I start to think about sleeping when we get back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden tho, those thoughts are gone because the fat girl comes running out as we hear a gunshot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s got a gun!&amp;quot; she screams. &amp;quot;You guys need to go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get in my car!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll be okay, he&amp;#39;s after you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It worries me but not enough to die so I get in my car with the boys and drive like Ive never driven before knowing there will be a reckoning for this and it will be bloody.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coke parties are always so sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "The chirp of the microwave is barely audible beneath the beat of rap music from the stereo worth more than three months in this shithole apartment yet it still draws out the partygoers like moths to a flame.
