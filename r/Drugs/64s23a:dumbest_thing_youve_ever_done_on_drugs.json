It was 4:30am at this point and we had lost the other car at this point because we were not sober at all. In a terrible, drunken, and shroomed out decision we decide to just drive home down the 401. It was a 4 hour drive and we drank the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t drink and drive people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dg5pmb7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492022545.0, "created_utc": 1491993745.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s23a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg67e01", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xannieclaus", "parent_id": "t3_64s23a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Back when I was 16 I thought my parents had gone out for the whole night so decided to k hole.
