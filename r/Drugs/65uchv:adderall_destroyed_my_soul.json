I never needed it to begin with. I just liked the feeling.  At first, Adderall improved my life tenfold.

I was getting better grades, I was social, I could finish everything more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling of Adderall is amazing. Your problems go away, you lose weight, you look better, you feel better. It&amp;#39;s yourself, but literally better. There&amp;#39;s no other feeling in this world that compares to it. (Well Meth, but that&amp;#39;s a different story). Throughout my sophomore year of college, I was getting straight As and making friends everywhere I went. Even online. I use Twitter a lot and reached out to a lot of amazing people I&amp;#39;m friends with to this day. My usage started spiraling last summer. My dosage went from 20mg/day to 60mg/day in four months.
