Some little Lifetime Home Movie or some shit like that in one of those flimsy thin cases you get at the Dollar Tree. It was shrink wrapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I excitedly cut the plastic in Rudy&amp;#39;s kitchen with an unused car key and peel it off. The case pops open and a tiny mylar sleeve slides out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s in there?&amp;quot; Rudy asks me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess so.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m grinning like a kid on Christmas. I rip the mylar and twelve blue and white capsules are dumped into my hand. In this moment my life has changed. I am no longer someone who just smokes weed. Im no longer Rudy&amp;#39;s friend XXX, I am Rudy&amp;#39;s friend XXX who does drugs. I am not my parents&amp;#39; son who makes mistakes. I am my parents&amp;#39; son who does drugs. I am the drug friend. Twelve tiny capsules of 2C-B would change my relationship with everyone who knew me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Youre not gonna take one now are you?&amp;quot; Rudy giggles. He&amp;#39;s high and excited to see what I&amp;#39;m doing although he&amp;#39;d never do it himself. He&amp;#39;s the most innocent pothead I&amp;#39;ve ever met and one of my closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck no.&amp;quot; My eyes flick to the screen over the table displaying security camera views of his yard with a timestamp rolling in the corner. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not even two o&amp;#39;clock&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh shit we got an hour until Amanda gets out of school. You wanna play Rocket League?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hell yes I do. Almost as much as I want to drop this 2C-B down my throat instead of my pocket. Money has never burned a hole in my pocket like drugs do. I am innocent. I dont know what I&amp;#39;m getting into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We smoke weed and play Rocket League until his girlfriend gets out of school and then we go get her and do it again until I have to go home. I&amp;#39;m supposed to be job hunting. Fuck it. Im supposed to be a lot of things but I&amp;#39;m not any of them. I dont think about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spend every day at Rudy&amp;#39;s and every night at Mike&amp;#39;s. Mike is already a brother to me and we&amp;#39;ve hardly gone through anything so far. Still, he let&amp;#39;s me sleep on his couch when I&amp;#39;m sad, which is always, and he takes care of me. Id die for him. My parents hardly see me. They love me and I know it but I&amp;#39;m not even on the same frequency. Thats what happens when your life collapses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second I set foot in Mike&amp;#39;s I can&amp;#39;t wait to tell him about the drugs. I know he&amp;#39;s done a lot of coke in his time but Ive never seen him do it. He tells me he and his cousin used to sell ecstacy but that was before I knew him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The house is quiet. That&amp;#39;s unusual. I pet the dog and walk into Mike&amp;#39;s room. He&amp;#39;s sitting on his bed texting someone, an unusual pose for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s going on man?&amp;quot; I ask him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Party at Isaac&amp;#39;s.&amp;quot; He replies. &amp;quot;You wanna go?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As long as I can crash here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You already know dude. You can stay as long as you want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we have the same type of quiet sadness about us. I hide it in recklessness. He hides it in looking out for everyone like nobody looked out for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike drives us to the party in his shitty volvo with insane subs. He smokes a cigarette while he drives and it makes me choke out the window but of course I dont mention it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we drive, i tell him about the drug. He can&amp;#39;t get over the visual aspect of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So like you really see shit?&amp;quot; He keeps asking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess so dude.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s crazy man. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to know what thats like. Even when I took shrooms I didnt really...&amp;quot; He trails off as we pull up to Isaac&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The party is in full swing. Beer pong in the living room. Purple Christmas lights illuminating the front porch. Music you can hear down the block. I tighten my jacket around me and shiver. It&amp;#39;s September in the desert and cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walk inside, I just ghost behind Mike. I dont know almost anyone at this party. Who am I kidding, i dont know almost anyone at any party. Mike is in his element. He sloughs off the self-reflective skin with his jacket and melts into the party like it&amp;#39;s all for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sip on a beer for a while while Mike plays beer pong. Eventually I get his attention and swallow the first magic capsule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start a timer on my iPod and put it in my pocket. Im so giddy and nervous, I check it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The high hits me while Mike finds a jacket to go smoke a cigarette. The body load is the most fun thing Ive ever experienced but it also makes me feel pretty sick. I throw my beer away as my vision gets hazy and I walk out back with Mike and the smokers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike, looking cool as a cucumber as he smokes his cig, is telling some guy about the drugs Im on. The guy apparently used to move ecstacy with them. I think its crazy that there was enough of a market for three different ecstacy dealers in town yet I never heard of anyone taking ecstacy. Not my crowd I guess. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is it hitting you yet?&amp;quot; The guy asks me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nod. &amp;quot;I feel weird but I dont see anything yet. I&amp;#39;m definitely coming up.&amp;quot; I check my timer. &amp;quot;Should hit any second now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He laughs a deep throated laugh with his head back. &amp;quot;Youre timing yourself?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s timing himself.&amp;quot; Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wanna know for next time you know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He nods. Since Mike said it it must be cool. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s whats up. Smart.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They talk for a moment and I just stand there being high. The euphoria hits me in a rush like no euphoria I ever got from weed. &amp;quot;Holy shit&amp;quot; I mutter to myself. I can feel this beautiful ecstacy in my throat and my balls and my spine. I stretch backwards and exhale slowly. The shadows of the weeds are moving strangely. Almost like a line of ants or a group of roaches crawling in circles but not in a scary or gross way. Benevolent cockroaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Holy shit. Alright guys.&amp;quot; i interrupt them. &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;m seeing shit.&amp;quot; I dont break eye contact with the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Youre not sure?&amp;quot; Mike asks me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well unless there are bugs like... All over the ground right there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bugs?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And like up the wall.&amp;quot; my eyes sweep around. The dancing dots follow them. Colors begin to melt off of everything. &amp;quot;And over there. And over there...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike jumps up and down in excitement. &amp;quot;You see man?? &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; is what I wanna see. I have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see shit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Its pretty cool man.&amp;quot; the stranger hands me a cigarette and I bring it to my lips in my daze before remembering I dont smoke. I hand it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I dont smoke.&amp;quot; I giggle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike and the stranger bust out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck it dude let me take one.&amp;quot; Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I left them at your place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well let&amp;#39;s fuckin go then.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not one to argue with anything Mike said I followed him to his car. A friend of his, Alec, goes with us in case we need a driver and to hit an ATM or something. I dont like Alec. He makes me ride in the back even though Im the reason we&amp;#39;re going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within seconds of sitting in the car I couldnt give a flying fuck about anything in the world. The lights of the radio and the street take my breath away. The body sensations of the car revving up and driving are better than the best rollercoaster. The subs kick in and &lt;strong&gt;hooooooly shit&lt;/strong&gt; I can feel the hot breath of Lloyd Banks on the back of my neck as my ears are assaulted from all sides by &lt;em&gt;Beamer Benz or Bentley&lt;/em&gt;. Riding in that car is the most fun Ive ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ride around in the car for forty minutes or so. Pulling up to a stoplight and feeling my body keep going as the green tinged intersection warps like a sheet with the wind behind it is something I etch in my memory forever. I grab two capsules cus I&amp;#39;m willing to share and we get in the car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take it now, it takes a while to kick in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike doesnt need to be told twice. He swallows the capsule dry and heads back to the party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we hang out at the party, I am suddenly the center of attention. It&amp;#39;s a feeling I&amp;#39;ll admit that I relish. Mostly I&amp;#39;m just incredibly high. I sink into the couch like a stone and watch the carpet dance and breathe. The longer I stare without blinking the more elaborate the hallucinations get but I can only do it for so long. Isaac has this optical illusion poster of Bob Marley that mesmerizes me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike begs me for another pill every few minutes, citing his larger body mass and generally high tolerance. Eventually I say fuck it and pass him another one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as he takes the second pill, the first one hits him like a truck. Mike is a guy who likes to party, but he&amp;#39;s also a lowkey guy. Ive hardly ever seen him yell and he never admits how fucked up he is. Thats how I knew he was higher than heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We play beer pong together just to watch the tracers. Mike cheers and slams a hand on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do more people not know about this? This is what &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; should be doing! This is fucking sick! Thank you dude!&amp;quot; He high fives me with a grin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually the party begins to peter out. Neither of us can drive so we stand outside leaning on a car breathing the cool night air. Breathing on 2C-B feels like breathing the sweetest sharpest air from the highest nicest mountain. Standing feels like being filled up with an electric euohoria and cast into a sarcophagus of the finest gold. The intense euphoria washes over us in waves and we talk about it and the things we see. We&amp;#39;ve never been closer as we melt into the night in ecstacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had crossed a threshold I could not uncross and I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I got a DVD in the mail today.
