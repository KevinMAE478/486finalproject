If you decide to focus on the psychedelic head-fuck effects, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; really trip the fuck out on 2c-b. However, say a friend comes up to you as you&amp;#39;re deep in thought like that, you&amp;#39;ll then be able to switch from a LSD-like psychedelic headspace to one that&amp;#39;s more MDMA-like and enjoy socially interacting (talking) with your buddy. And if you want to go for a walk in the woods to look at the pretty colours, you can do that too, without stopping every two seconds to reflect deeply on the life of that tree over there and all the lifeforms that call it home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the intensity of the head-fuck aspect is supposedly dose-dependent in a nonlinear fashion. Meaning upping your dose by a few mgs can change the nature of a trip entirely, and potentially make it a lot more difficult (which for psychonauts may be a synonym for more interesting).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dge0u4a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487922.0, "created_utc": 1492459122.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdzf3j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "3gi3gi3gi", "parent_id": "t1_dgdrg42", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I felt the same until I took some at home while just lying down and watching a movie/listening to music, as I normally do on acid.

I have a friend who had never done drugs, then he got heavily into weed. Then he graduated onto harder drugs, but mostly psychedelics. And within a 3-5 month period he basically abused psychs way too frequently to the point of going completely off the rails (totaling his car, jail time, insane ideas and beliefs, stealing money from family etc etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a year long-ish period of sobriety+ supportive people has done him good.
