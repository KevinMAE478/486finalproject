It&amp;#39;s literally something doctors worry about daily because things happen all the time when you&amp;#39;re giving out opiates. Do you realize how addictive these drugs are and that some people cannot stop once they begin?  These things aren&amp;#39;t a joke. I did tons of opiates as a teenager and know firsthand how dangerous they can be. I used them fairly safely and was fine. I know they can be used responsibly, but that doesn&amp;#39;t automatically equate to safe with these drugs. I also watched my friend&amp;#39;s use turn from never doing drugs to having to slap him trying to wake him up because his lips were going blue from Dilaudid. Saying pain pills aren&amp;#39;t dangerous is fucking insane and shows a complete lack of knowledge of any of the pharmacology behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IF he isn&amp;#39;t doing them, obviously they&amp;#39;re not going to kill him. But maybe you&amp;#39;ve heard stories of previous drug users that have been clean for quite some time, then go back to using the drug due to some event right? That&amp;#39;s called a relapse, and they often lead to death because the user uses their old dose which can be fatal with no tolerance. Just saying dude, these are real fucking drugs that need to be treated with respect, and I can&amp;#39;t believe that anyone who has spent longer than an hour here could say there&amp;#39;s nothing dangerous about them. Go to &lt;a href=\"/r/opiates\"&gt;r/opiates&lt;/a&gt; and ask them if opiates are dangerous. They will laugh their asses off and say &amp;quot;fucking of course.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dg3nsw5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904232.0, "created_utc": 1491875432.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3njjs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dogjay100", "parent_id": "t1_dg3mxgy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There is nothing dangerous about weed and pain pills especially if he isnt even doing them", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing dangerous about weed and pain pills especially if he isnt even doing them&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dg3njjs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491903911.0, "created_utc": 1491875111.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3mxgy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Redditor11", "parent_id": "t1_dg3mbo9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Wanting your kid to keep felony level drugs out of their house (and not buy them in the first place) makes parents strict.
