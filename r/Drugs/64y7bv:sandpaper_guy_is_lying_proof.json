Just a bunch of high on fucks, him, and hopefully women tired of their boyfriends.\n\nHe snorted to himself, running his hand through perfectly brushed hair. Women, at a Reddit party? Any woman stupid enough to come here would never get the smell of sausage out of her club clothes.\n\nThe good Dr. walked up to the front door, already feeling the bass pump through his body. He didn't bother knocking, instead choosing to flip open the door and hollar as loud as he could \"Hey everyone!\", with a huge grin on his face.\n\n\"Hey DXM!\", the resounding cry came back. To his huge suprise, there actually *were* women here, and three of the hottest ladies he had ever seen were breaking off in his direction. He couldn't help it; a large, self satisfied grin fell intp place as they walked torwards him. \n\nThe first of the hotties reached him, blond and lithe with just the *right* amount of cleavage showing. Legs that went all the way down. A perfect package. \"Hey beautiful, I don't suppose you know where I could get a drink?\", he asked just loud enough to be heard over the music. She gave him a beautiful smile, hey big green eyes shining, opened her mouth, and nothing came out. \n\nWell, at first nothing came out. Then a soft, almost calming sound practically rushed into the room. Her beautiful green eyes had turned to a muddy brown, and were slowly expanding. The two beauties behind here were gone. Wait. No, not just them. Everything was gone. The blond was gone. The house was gone. It was all gone.\n\nDXM could hear a steady throbbing sound coming from the walls. Wait, what walls? they were gone. It was all dark. No wait, dark? It was black. And he could hear...He could hear the music still. Where was that coming from? Where was that incessant throbbing coming from? Why wouldn't it fucking stop?\n\nHe could feel...Well many things. But the most important was a prfound itchiness all over his body, and a wet...stickiness in between his legs. Wait. He had a body. He had legs! That throbbing sound...It was...It had to be his heart. He okay. He was going to be okay. Just relax. Relax.\n\nIt seemed to take days before DXM calmed down enough to even be capable of opening his eyes. To leave the calming afterglow that was surrounding him. He needed to though. He needed to get up. Glancing at the ever present alarm clock on his night stand. Midnight. Holyshit, it hadn't even been three hours since he swalled the caosules and layed down. Almost as an after thought, DXM reached up and took his earbuds out of his ears. \n\nHe slowly swung his legs off the side of his bed, stood up, and stretched towards the sky. With a loud yawn, DXM let his arms fall to his sides, then lazily reaches his hand inside his PJ pants to scratch at his balls. His dry balls. His dry crotch. \"Oh, what the fuck?!\", he groaned as the wet sticky feeling he'd been experiencing was now more insistent than ever. However now he could clearly feel its location. In the back. \n\nDXM tentantively reacbed his left hand into the back of his PJ botoms, and then immediately yanked it out again. \"Well fuck!\" He snarked at himself, getting up and starting the slow hobble of shame to the bathroom. \"You fucking idiot, how do you shit yourself and not even fucking notice?\".  \n\n\nSo, this story is *very* loosely based on the first time I ever did DXM. I did in fact, get so high I didn't notice that I had shit myself for a good hour or so. It was pretty disgusting when I realized what happened. \n", "edited": 1492084210.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair warning: I wrote this early in the morning while high on 60mg of Oxy (20mg is enough to make me nod on a empty stomach).
