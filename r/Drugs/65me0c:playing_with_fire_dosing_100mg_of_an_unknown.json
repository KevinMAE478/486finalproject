For real. I could have died. This story, like the others, is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point the stories of my experiments with 2C-B are the talk of the town if you hang out with anyone even a little interested in drugs. Scared of cops but in love with money Ive mostly refused to sell it. Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a bit of money and some time to kill I decide to order one of the other 2C&amp;#39;s from an unknown vendor. I come across a listing for 2C-E and ask for a sample, expecting to get a pill or two, and order another gram of 2C-B. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a quiet few days for the tiny drug scene around town as I wait for my packages. I let myself believe that everyone interested in drugs in town is watching me. Im at least partly right because everyone is talking about 2C-B within minutes of meeting me and Mike wont shut up about how much better the ecstacy we got was than anything he ever sold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting high is my new favorite hobby. A dangerous idea indeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pack lands and out slides two tiny baggies. A blue ziplock bag encloses a gram of 2C-B. May as well have been a gram of gold by the excitement in the room when I opened it at Mike&amp;#39;s. Nobody can wait to trip out again. Ive been liberally sharing among my group of friends and we&amp;#39;re ready to party hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You got two grams?&amp;quot; Mike asks, looking at the other bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s identical in every way except that the powder is champagne colored like MDMA and the bag is clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No that should be my sample of 2C-E but...&amp;quot; I drop the bag onto my scale. One gram. &amp;quot;I have no idea why he sent me so much. The dosage should be similar to 2C-B. Fifty doses is hardly a sample.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2C-&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot; Alec asks. He&amp;#39;s become a close friend of mine over the last few weeks, the second person I shared my 2C-B with and the first sober person I talked to when I tried crystalline MDMA. &amp;quot;What does that do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s like 2C-B but more on the acid side of things than MDMA,&amp;quot; I never called it Molly. &amp;quot;Should be interesting. He must have screwed up giving me so much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I cap out the 2C-B, selling some of it but keeping plenty for my friends and I to have a good time, and cap out a couple doses of the alleged 2C-E. I throw one in for free with the 2C-B, knowing the guy buying it thinks himself something of a psychonaut. Im nervous to try it for some reason. Some part of me deep down knows that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doses of 2C-E collect dust for a while. At one point Mike tries it while we&amp;#39;re out of 2C-B but nothing happens. At another point he tries snorting double the dose I thought it should be but still nothing happens. Recklessly allowing people to try it I eventually end up losing most of it and half forget about it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A three day weekend rolls around. My parents want to take my sibling somewhere and I have work so being the piece of shit druggy I am I decide this is the perfect time to get fucked up on drugs I know nothing about with no supervision alone in my house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where shit got weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I brought out the drug kit I&amp;#39;d haphazardly concocted and laid it on the cold granite countertop. Id rented some Tarantino movie and the sounds of violence played a strange soundtrack to my decisions. The nervousnes I felt was electric. I bounced up and down on my heels and sipped a Jack and Coke to take the edge off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted Mike that I was dosing 25mg, a dose which I knew would have no effect as a control. I parachuted it in some toilet paper and sipped on my drink nervously for thirty minutes. Nothing. Not even placebo. I dosed another 25 and texted him again. He tells me that he would just take a bunch and see what happens. I tell him I&amp;#39;m not gonna do that but I will switch to snorting for the faster onset. He warns me that it hurts but I already know that. From capping it up I can see that its the same weird texture as 2C-B.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I measure out a 50mg dose this time and scrape it into a shitty line. Ive never snorted anything more than a line of coke once before. I take a few deep breaths and a swig of whiskey. I can do this. I roll up a dollar and hit the line as fast as I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stand up straight. That wasnt too bad. Im so nervous Im sweating. That wasnt too bad at all. Doesnt even-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy fuck&lt;/em&gt; it burns like hell. My eyes start watering. The drip hits and it&amp;#39;s the worst thing I&amp;#39;ve ever tasted or will ever taste in my life. I chase it with Jack and try to swallow. I feel my stomach disagree. &lt;em&gt;I will not throw up. I will not throw up. I will not throw up.&lt;/em&gt; I gag but fight it down. After that it gets easier. I sip my drink. I text the guy I gave a capsule about how it wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything. He&amp;#39;s concerned that I&amp;#39;m alone. So am I tbh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im keeping him updated as I wait. Holy shit. I feel weird. Holy sh- &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt; my phone fell out of my hand somehow. Its like my hand just stopped holding on of its own accord. Do i not know how to use my hands? What&amp;#39;s happening to me? Im coming up hard but its not like any comeup Ive ever felt before. I feel very very different but not high. Not yet. All of a sudden my legs follow my hands suit and I slump down my counter and begin to slowly fall to the floor. As I fall strange thoughts run through my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I dying? Holy shit I&amp;#39;m dying. I just overdosed. Why dont I feel scared? I should be terrified.&lt;/em&gt; Just before I hit the floor something changes. It&amp;#39;s like a switch flipped and the most powerful euphoria anyone has ever experienced rushes through my body. &lt;em&gt;If I&amp;#39;m dying it feels *&lt;/em&gt;great*** I dont have a fucking care in the world as my limp body slides onto the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lay there in this strange euohoria. My whole body is buzzing. My ears are literally buzzing. Sound sounds weird. I giggle to myself. Sound sounds. But seriously, it sounds like everything is coming to me through a shitty radio or something. I have bad reception. I giggle to myself again and lazily grab my phone from the floor beside me. Oh my god moving feels &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. I begin making snow angels on the tile to relish the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I video call Mike. To my surprise, he answers. He&amp;#39;s having a smoke outside the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Bro. It definitely hit&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you laying on the floor right now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nod slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your pupils are fucking huge dude. Like there&amp;#39;s no color in your eyes at all. Its kinda freaky.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; I try to hold the camera to my eye and look at the screen at the same time while making snow angels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Making snow angels.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You wanna come over? Im thinking about heading out of here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldnt because I already told my girlfriend I wasnt going anywhere which is why she stayed in. But now that I&amp;#39;m insanely high and am a little worried that I&amp;#39;m just gonna keel over and die in an intense euohoric orgasm at some point. Im going to go. Ill just do the responsible thing and worry about it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I dont think I can drive.&amp;quot; I text her that I&amp;#39;m going out, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck dude my car&amp;#39;s broke.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you send someone else I dont really think I should be alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah I&amp;#39;ll figure it out. Get dressed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize I&amp;#39;m shirtless and he probably thinks I&amp;#39;m naked as he hangs up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, Aaron texts me that he&amp;#39;s outside. I reply that I cant stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Im not going to come carry you&amp;quot; he replies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grab the countertop and pull myself to my feet. As soon as I&amp;#39;m up, my whole energy changes. I can totally stand. In fact, I can run! Let&amp;#39;s fuckin go I&amp;#39;m ready to party! I grab my shirt and run out to Aaron&amp;#39;s truck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m high as fuck.&amp;quot; I tell him as I jump in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh man,&amp;quot; he says, assuming I mean 2C-B. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re gonna love my new subs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love them I do as my bones are rattled by every beat of the bass. My teeth chatter and grind together as my jaw muscles work overtime. I squeeze myself with my arms hard, enjoying the feeling of stressing my triceps and forearms. In this moment I am euphoric. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pull up to Mike&amp;#39;s and as usual there&amp;#39;s somehow already a huge party going on. People are everywhere, cars are parked up the block for his tiny 4-plex. You can hear the music up the street. We get out, my shoes crunching on broken glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I abandon Aaron and run inside. Holy fuck I&amp;#39;M A KING. I&amp;#39;m here to run this shit. I high five some people and feel like doing a front flip as someone hands me a beer. Alec daps me up and asks me to tell him and some people I&amp;#39;ve never met the story of when me and Cisco unknowingly took a few hundred mgs of THC in edibles with no tolerance. Tell it I do. People are literally rolling on the floor I&amp;#39;m so funny. Im the best version of me I can be. This is the best party ever. I&amp;#39;m not a king but a god. Nothing can stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until my phone begins buzzing from my girlfriend who&amp;#39;s pretty pissed I went out after telling her to stay home because I was gonna have a quiet night at home alone. I try to tell her that I live life by the moment and some other cliche bullshit but she&amp;#39;s having none of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could have stayed but I started to feel more like being a God for a little while was enough of being a God for now if it was gonna make her mad at me so I hung out for a bit longer and caught a ride home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I walked inside my high began to fade. I checked the time. Roughly three hours. I checked my drugs. Enough to do it one or two more times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chalk one up for reckless self destruction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Always test your drugs if you are ever in this position.
