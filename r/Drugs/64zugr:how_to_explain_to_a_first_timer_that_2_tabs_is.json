Then my friend starting freaking out a little and wanted to go outside. I tried to tell him that it probably wasn't a good idea, it was October, it was cold and wet, we could get lost, we were in a big city. \"Dude, the cold could kill us, it's literally deadly, it kills people\" I said. But my friend insisted on it. \"I just have to know that I can leave the apartment! I just have to know that I'm not trapped here man, just please!\" \n\nSo eventually I gave in and we went down to the street. We walked half a block and saw one of the main thoroughfares of the city we were in, a very busy street. There I saw one of the craziest hallucinations I've ever had on a psychedelic drug. Instead of one road with cars buzzing by, it was ten thousand roads, ten thousand exactly. I was seeing in 2d vision, it was like it was a sheet of acid and each hit was its own road. My friend said he saw the same thing too. Ten thousand exactly. \n\nThen we walked about half a block further and a group of drunk guys walked by being loud and boisterous and speaking in a foreign language. They were terrifying, I always find that drunk people are kind of scary when I am tripping. It was terrifying. At that point my friend turned to me and said \"You were right, this probably isn't a good idea.\" And so we went back to our flat. \n\nWe were probably only outside for about 3-5 minutes but it felt like hours. I was glad to be back in our flat again. By this point in time we were a little more coherent so we started pulling up music on youtube. I actually discovered some great bands that night like the 13th floor elevators, very trippy band from 1965, one of the first psychedelic rock bands. \n\nThen we were just fucking around with youtube. I typed in \"how to get on youtube\" into youtube and found random ass videos. One was this weird commercial with a fat little black kid in it, but to me he looked like Ghengis Khan. \"Holy shit\" I told my friend, \"this kid is a little Temujin\"(Temujin is Ghengis Khan's real name in Mongolian). My friend agreed with me. \"Definitely a little Temujin.\" We had a good laugh over that. \n\nAnother video was an Australian guy talking about how to make a good Youtube channel and to get people to follow you. He had dark hair and a dark goatee. As I was watching him, he slowly morphed into Satan, his goatee got longer, horns sprung from his head, he started turning red, he had a lizard tongue, flames and hell fire sprung up behind him and he was holding a pitchfork. Then all of a sudden he was normal again. But I had figured him out, he wasn't fooling me, I saw who he really was, he was the devil. \n\n\"Australians are bad people\" I told my friend. He nodded in agreement. \"Yes, yes they are, Australians are no good\" he said. \n\nThose were some of the things I remember distinctly. We spent the next few hours slowly coming back to reality and listening to music and such. We talked about a lot of things. We talked about life, talked about girlfriends, talked about Europe, the country we were in, it's history, we talked about Hitler and how crazy it was that someone like that even existed. \n\nThen we just sat there quietly for a while, the part of the trip where you are pretty much at the tail end of it and are just worn out and trying process all of what just happened. The realization that life itself is just a giant trip, and in reality all human beings are just as confused and scared as we were when we ate that acid and had no idea what was going on. Nobody knows what the fuck is going on, it's all just a mystery. \n\nThen the sun went up and we both went to bed. To this day I have no idea why the first tabs we got were completely inactive and why the other tabs which looked the exact same were so intense. Maybe the first strip wasn't properly stored and killed off the acid. Maybe it was some weird joke that the person who sold it to our dealer was playing on us, acid heads are weird like that so its a possibility. \n\nI can't say it was the most insightful trip I've ever had. I was simply too blasted to really contemplate anything too deep, I spent a great deal of the trip just trying to figure out what the fuck was going on and why I felt the way I did. Hell, I was too fucked up to even panic and have a bad trip. I was just completely confused for most of the time. \n\nA few days later we ate the rest of the tabs, except this time I only took one dose. It was still pretty intense, but was a lot more fun and insightful than the first time. \n\nTruly one of the strangest experiences of my life, and I still can't quite make sense of what happened, it was like a strange dream with no explanation, an alien abduction. It really had no specific meaning or reason behind it, just a really weird thing that had happened to me. I gained a newfound respect for LSD that day. And ever since then I've only ever eaten one hit when I trip, I already know what it feels like to be blasted to another dimension by Sandoz acid, I have no need for more than one hit. I think a lot of people overdo it with acid, one hit is really all you need, if the acid is too weak for that then its probably not even worth taking.

Here's Part 1:\n\nIt was the fall of 2008 and I was studying abroad and living in a European city. My friend and I shared a \"flat\"(as those Europeans call it) together and were spending our days either studying or partying. That night we were already partying pretty hard ourselves drinking lots of liquor and sniffing the shitty European coke they have there (I've heard that the coke scene has since gotten better there). Anyways, I was already at a solid [7] as you folks say and it was practically midnight when we got the call that our pot dealer had gotten more acid and was going to give us a 10 strip for free to make up for the bunk one he had sold us earlier in the week. We decide to walk over to his place (he only lived about a block or two away) and we picked up the doses. \n\nThe doses looked the exact same as the bunk ones, they had a bicycle day print on them which looked [like this](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.208142105.6075/mp,550x550,gloss,ffffff,t.3u1.jpg) except a little different. From what I remember it just had the guy on the bike (I presume is supposed to be Albert Hoffman) but with an all white background and no words or anything printed on them from what I recall. There was a little bicycle guy on every tab rather than it being a giant blotter art picture. The tabs were bigger than what you normally find from your average paper blotter acid, I'd say about 1 square centimeter in size or maybe a little bigger. It's been a long while so I don't remember exactly, but I do remember them being bigger than your average paper tab.\n\nOur dealer told us that it came from Switzerland and was \"Sandoz acid\", made by Albert Hoffman himself (he had just died in April of 2008 so it certainly was possible that the batch came from him or one of his proteges). I'm not sure if it truly was acid from Hoffman himself, but judging by how incredibly strong it was I would not be surprised at all. The \"orthodox\" acid makers from the 50s and 60s used to make individual doses far bigger than what we see today, at least 225ug-300ug per hit. \n\nAnyways, so we got the doses and went back to our flat. Now, it really is not a good idea to take any kind of acid around midnight after you've been drinking heavily doing shitty coke all night long. But then again, it was around midnight and we had been drinking heavily and doing shitty coke all night long, so our judgment was not exactly good at the time. We decided to eat them. I'm really not sure why we decided to eat them, it was just kind of an act of impulsivity. Since these looked identical to the beat tabs we had gotten I guess we were kind of incredulous about the whole thing and expected them to be beat. I don't think we even really thought about what we would do if they turned out to be real. It was just an act of pure drunken impulsivity without really thinking through the possible consequences. \n\nAnd of course, since we had already decided to eat them anyways, we figured it wouldn't hurt to eat a decent amount of them. So we each ate multiple tabs. I think I ate about 3 and my friend ate 4. This left us with three extra tabs we could have at a later date (if it turned out to be real that is). \n\nSo my friend and I ate the tabs and just kind of joked with each other that these were probably just beat. About 20 minutes in, I started to feel something. \"Huh\" I said. \"I think I feel something.\"\n\nAbout 30 minutes in it became apparent that these doses definitely weren't beat. \"I think this time the acid is good\" my friend said. \n\nAbout 35 minutes in I realized that not only were the doses good, but they were in fact pretty damn strong. \"Strong too\" I said. \n\nAbout 45 minutes in my friend and I gave each other a look I will never forget, a kind of \"uh oh\" look on our faces as we realized that we had just eaten multiple tabs of what may very well be the strongest acid on the planet, pure Albert Hoffman bicycle day LSD, and that we were about to go on the trip of a lifetime. \"Good god\" my friend said, \"what have we done?\"\n\nThe trip kept building and building in intensity. Now mind you, I certainly was no noob to psychedelics at the time, I had tripped many times before, I had had a number of very strong trips before. I had even had trips where I took way too much before. But I had never done something like this. First of all, many of those trips were already planned in advance, whereas this time it was completely spur of the moment. Just an hour ago I had no intention of tripping, let alone the trip of a lifetime. And this acid was different than other LSD I had taken before, this shit was so soo strong, no impurities whatsoever. I had to have eaten at least 750ug of the shit, maybe even more than that. These doses may very well have been 300ug each or greater. It could have been over 1000ug I took. I don't know, I was entering a realm where specific micrograms no longer mattered.   \n\nAbout an hour in I no longer felt drunk, I no longer felt coked up, all I felt was LSD. It was like a snowplow came through and pushed everything out of the way. \n\nWe slowly got deeper and deeper into the trip. Then we got into this crazy loop where we had no idea what was going on. The conversation went something like this:\n\nMy friend: \"Wait, what the fuck, why am I so fucked up?\"\n\nMe: \"I think its because we took LSD\"\n\nMy friend: \"What? We? Ohhhhhh. Yes. Yes I remember. We took LSD. But why am I so fucked up?\"\n\nMe: \"Strong\"\n\nMy friend: \"Oh yes, strong\"\n\nMe: \"Strong acid\" \n\nMy friend: \"Very Strong indeed\"\n\nMe: \"Strong\" [while nodding at each other with a very matter of fact look on our faces]\n\nMy friend: \"But why?\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know why\"\n\nMy friend: \"Why did we take this much acid?\"\n\nMe: \"I don't, I don't know man, I'm just, uh, this is a mystery I guess. I don't know\"\n\nMy friend: \"Wait, what? I'm so fucked up, why am I so fucked up?\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know man, it's a mystery\"\n\nMy friend: \"This is too much man, this is-\n\nMe: \"crazy, yes, this is crazy, we definitely-\"\n\nMy friend: \"took too much acid, why did we-\"\n\nMe: \"eat it? I don't know, man, it's a-\n\nMy friend: \"mystery dude, it's a mystery. Wait, this is weird its like we're-\"\n\nMe: \"completing each other's sentences. This is very strange. I'm not sure why we\"\n\nMy friend: \"ate so much acid. Wait, why am I so-\"\n\nMe: \"fucked up?\"\n\nThis conversation basically kept going around in circles for about a good 2 and a half hours. My friend said that I looked like an Indian chief with a full Indian headdress. I don't even remember any of the visuals I saw, I was just too far gone to care about visuals at that point. My vision was like a kaleidoscope. \n\n*See part 2*\n \n", "edited": 1492096688.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well ok, I had to break it up into 2 parts because otherwise it would be too long. Here&amp;#39;s Part 1:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the fall of 2008 and I was studying abroad and living in a European city. My friend and I shared a &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot;(as those Europeans call it) together and were spending our days either studying or partying. That night we were already partying pretty hard ourselves drinking lots of liquor and sniffing the shitty European coke they have there (I&amp;#39;ve heard that the coke scene has since gotten better there). Anyways, I was already at a solid [7] as you folks say and it was practically midnight when we got the call that our pot dealer had gotten more acid and was going to give us a 10 strip for free to make up for the bunk one he had sold us earlier in the week. We decide to walk over to his place (he only lived about a block or two away) and we picked up the doses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doses looked the exact same as the bunk ones, they had a bicycle day print on them which looked &lt;a href=\"https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.208142105.6075/mp,550x550,gloss,ffffff,t.3u1.jpg\"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; except a little different. From what I remember it just had the guy on the bike (I presume is supposed to be Albert Hoffman) but with an all white background and no words or anything printed on them from what I recall. There was a little bicycle guy on every tab rather than it being a giant blotter art picture. The tabs were bigger than what you normally find from your average paper blotter acid, I&amp;#39;d say about 1 square centimeter in size or maybe a little bigger. It&amp;#39;s been a long while so I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly, but I do remember them being bigger than your average paper tab.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our dealer told us that it came from Switzerland and was &amp;quot;Sandoz acid&amp;quot;, made by Albert Hoffman himself (he had just died in April of 2008 so it certainly was possible that the batch came from him or one of his proteges). I&amp;#39;m not sure if it truly was acid from Hoffman himself, but judging by how incredibly strong it was I would not be surprised at all. The &amp;quot;orthodox&amp;quot; acid makers from the 50s and 60s used to make individual doses far bigger than what we see today, at least 225ug-300ug per hit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so we got the doses and went back to our flat. Now, it really is not a good idea to take any kind of acid around midnight after you&amp;#39;ve been drinking heavily doing shitty coke all night long. But then again, it was around midnight and we had been drinking heavily and doing shitty coke all night long, so our judgment was not exactly good at the time. We decided to eat them. I&amp;#39;m really not sure why we decided to eat them, it was just kind of an act of impulsivity. Since these looked identical to the beat tabs we had gotten I guess we were kind of incredulous about the whole thing and expected them to be beat. I don&amp;#39;t think we even really thought about what we would do if they turned out to be real. It was just an act of pure drunken impulsivity without really thinking through the possible consequences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, since we had already decided to eat them anyways, we figured it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt to eat a decent amount of them.
