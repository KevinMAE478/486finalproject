You also explained that an alternative is that people simply can&amp;#39;t empathize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My situation is that I can see the logic, I can understand that perhaps these animals have empathy. But you know what, I don&amp;#39;t care. I don&amp;#39;t believe in an after-life. These animals are harmless to me. These animals are bred to be eaten, they&amp;#39;re conditioned to it. I can safely assume they don&amp;#39;t mind, and if they do, I won&amp;#39;t know or think about it or care because it tastes fucking delicious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I did was add my opinion and compliment you, and you came with aggressive tone and insinuating comments, treating me like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no, I won&amp;#39;t stand for it.
