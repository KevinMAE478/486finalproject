Awesome idea! I would be interested to see how cocaine impacts your decision-making and chess skills. Perhaps the stimulation would be helpful in some ways, like the amphetamines?

Don't try if you have any underlying heart conditions though for sure.\n\nI'd also be interested in how MDMA impacts your chess skills. You may lose the short-term memory skills to see any benefits from the stimulation seen in that substance. Maybe you'd become too immersed in the life and story of the other player, choosing to spend your time chatting with them and dancing to your music than actually caring about the game at hand.

At some point you probably just go horizontal and can't play anymore lol, but how you play before then would be intriguing. \n\nYou should also try dabbing or THC extract to see how that impacts your skills vs. just smoking regular weed. It seems that regular weed didn't change your ability too extensively, but really strong THC extract can be more psychedelic in nature, so I reckon' you struggle a bit more in comparison!\n\nAnd lastly, although I don't necessarily encourage such depending on your previous use and genetic pre-disposition to addiction, it would be interesting to see how opiates affect your chess skills. Even in lesser amounts, such as 5-15mg hydrocodone from the dentist or an old 10mg oxycodone from breaking a bone or something. Again, not encouraging such use, as I know that can lead down a rabbit hole of bad news. That being said, Brett Farve played some of his best NFL football during his hydrocodone addiction, and opiods are a weird mix of both performance-hindering and performance-enhancing depending on the amount, tolerance, the specific opiate in question (some are more sedating and some more stimulating), and what the performance looks like. You may nod off and be terrible, or you may feel that slight euphoria and lack of pain/anxiety enough to perform better, for a short while at least. It may actually be a better idea to try 1-4 grams of kratom leaf instead of a harder opiod for that experiment, as the addiction potential is much lower, though you can still feel some of the opiate-esque effects from the kratom plant without jumping on board the painkiller addiction train.
