For me it was hard. At the time I could get basically any drug except booze and I really wanted to try it. After reading a news story about teens drinking Germ X to get drunk, I decided that Germ X was my only hope. After taking a small taste, I quickly realized that drinking it was not an option. If you didn&amp;#39;t know, Germ X is actually infused with Denatonium, the most bitter substance known to man in order to keep teens from drinking it. From what I know, Germ X itself isn&amp;#39;t too terrible to drink although I wouldn&amp;#39;t say its safe. It&amp;#39;s actually 62% ethanol AKA drinking alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But basically it tastes like complete and utter ass to the point where it&amp;#39;s almost physically impossible to taste let alone drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me, being the genius that I am, figured the only solution was to take it in my ass. That would get rid of the taste and get me drunker anyway, right? I read a lot about teens buttchugging in order to get drunk, and it seemed like a pretty great idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I got one of those plastic syringes parents use for shooting medicine down toddlers throats, filled it with like 50% Germ X and 50% water and injected a buttload of Germ X up my ass over the course of 30 mins. I did this while laying on my back, asshole facing the ceiling. Im definitely glad a family member did not walk in to behold that yoga worthy position. I also shot some leftover beer from the bottom of some cans up my butthole, real classy. It burned terribly, made me feel like I had to shit 24/7, and was overall a terrible experience, but for some reason I figured it was worth it. WOOO IM GONNA GET FUCKED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME BABY WOOOO!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 30 mins later, I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling anything and had the incredibly strong urge to shit. I kept it in my ass hoping it would absorb but nothing was working, so I just said fuck it and went to shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EXPLOSION as soon as I hit the toilet. Projectile diarreah that was about 60% liquid. At this point im freaking out. Wtf is happening? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I NEVER STOP SHITTING&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize that my entire anus has swollen to the point where it constantly feels like I have a huge turd in my ass that needs to come out. Imagine feeling like you have to take the biggest shit of your life, but nothing except a few drips of poo comes out when you sit on the toilet. I am in constant mid shit. It feels like I have a collection of marbles in my ass, like a rat crawled its way up there and died and is just stuck. Also, it burns my ass when I shit as the Germ X is coming back out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go back to my room, but the pain is starting to come up. Now, not only does it feel like i&amp;#39;m in constant mid shit, but my ass also feels like it just got fucked by an elephant. An incredible dull aching pain is now taking its toll on me, combined with a feeling of nausea at the whole situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run to the bathroom to try and shit again. EXPLOSION. Oh good, until I look down and see RED and PINK. I am now officially shitting blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bathroom begins to smell a terrible putrid fishy odor that was being produced by my pink ass juice for some reason. WHYYYYYYY!? The toilet is now filled with a toxic red and brown soup of diarrhea, piss and blood. I fall onto the floor crying, begging god for this nightmare to end. I proceed to shit blood and diareah for the next 5 hours, staying up until like 5AM because of the pain and the persistent feeling of having a gigantic turd in my ass. Also, after going on google, apparently my intenstinal walls may have been shedding which is why the blood was pink. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start to get anxious thoughts. If this kills me, what will they say at my funeral? That I died from shooting germ x through my butt? Or will they just say something like &amp;quot;lethal injection&amp;quot;? If my ass doesn&amp;#39;t heal, I can&amp;#39;t tell my parents about this, I can&amp;#39;t tell a doctor. Will I be in the news paper? Will this go viral? Will they call me &amp;quot;Germ X Boy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Swole Hole&amp;quot; at school? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my ab muscles start aching because they&amp;#39;ve been making a team effort to push shit out for the past 5 hours, i&amp;#39;m dehydrated and starving because I lack the motivation to eat, and incredibly tired and fatigued, and my back hurts from the pointing my asshole towards the ceiling when administering the lethal injection. I&amp;#39;m also soaked in sweat. I feel like i&amp;#39;ve been starved and gang raped with no lube in a Japanese POW camp and left to die. And I also had work in the morning if I remember correctly, which is just fucking great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im &amp;quot;fucked up&amp;quot; alright, but in a completely different way than I expected to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I contemplate voluntarily breaking my arm just to distract from the pain in my war torn bunghole. I contemplate running outside and going to every dark alley I see in order to find some heroin to take this horrible unholy pain away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smoke some weed to try and take the pain away and help me sleep, but it barely does jack shit. The only thing it does is put me in a dissociative state where I can pretend the pain is somebody elses, which is a really hard feeling to explain if you&amp;#39;ve never felt dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My asshole stays swollen and pained for the next 5 days and I continue to shit pink fishy smelling blood. Honestly one of the worst experiences of my life.
