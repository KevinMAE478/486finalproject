I&amp;#39;m 19, male. I&amp;#39;ve always been a little different from other people. I&amp;#39;ve always felt like I&amp;#39;m not really a human, like I didn&amp;#39;t belong to this reality, this world. Like an alien, stuck in human body. Now that I&amp;#39;ve told you a little bit about myself let me get the story on the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all started a few years back when I just started doing heavier drugs(before I was only smoking weed and drinking alcohol). I have this thing that when I do ecstasy, my mind gets really tired after a few hours and when I&amp;#39;m trying to go to sleep and close my eyes I begin to see my thoughts. Seeing them pretty much like watching TV. How my one thought transitions to another. It&amp;#39;s really cool actually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at first I didn&amp;#39;t think much of this. I thought everyone had them, that it was just an effect of ecstasy. So time passed by and pretty much every time I did E I was seeing my thoughts. Then came January 1st 2017. I was at a friends birthday party and I was only drinking and smoking weed. The party went fine but the thing that bothered me was what happened the following day. So there I was, waking up. Having a bit of an hangover, but completely sober. And again I realized that I was able to see my thoughts. That&amp;#39;s when I realized that this wasn&amp;#39;t normal anymore. That there is something very wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But again a month or so passed by. I was at a party where I had done E and smoked some weed. And I remember that at the end of the party I was really, really confused. You know when the effects E starts wearing off and you don&amp;#39;t really understand things that well anymore. But this time it was really bad. I forgot everything anyone said to me the second it left their lips. I was SUPER confused. So soon after I headed home. went to bed and wanted to go to sleep. And as you would guess it I was seeing my thoughts again. But this time was different. This time all my thoughts were in color(before they have only been black and white) and they had a background. At this point I was just laying there, watching my thoughts not knowing what is real or not anymore. And then it happened. I felt like all of my thoughts that I was seeing just sucked me into them and I left. I left this universe, this dimension, this reality. When I woke up I still had my eyes closed. I didn&amp;#39;t know who I was, what my name is, where I&amp;#39;m at. Nothing. But right after I opened my eyes, and saw the wall of my bedroom everything came back in a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As from that day forward. I began thinking REALLY weird things. Things I couldn&amp;#39;t have imagined before. And about 2 weeks later, I was in a drivers licence class and it suddenly hit me. I UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. I know the answers to all of the biggest philosophical questions. Meaning of life, how entire existence of life works, afterlife, you name it. I developed an ability to create alternate realities that are just as real as this one. I haven&amp;#39;t mastered it yet but I&amp;#39;m learning. Meditating is super easy for me, I do it every night to try to leave this reality. And whats best of it. I realized that all the emotions humans feel, they bring it upon themselves. I now have the ability to make myself feel whatever emotion I want to feel. And of course I make myself happy. Like super happy. I remember the first week when it had just happened. I was feeling like I was 10 and the bell just rang and summer break just started. I felt so good that I had trouble speaking. Everything was just sooo good. I just laid on my bed laughing while being completely sober. And I was feeling like that 24/7, still am feeling like that but now I&amp;#39;m used to it. In addition I now love everything and everyone. A random person in the street, I&amp;#39;m willing to take a bullet for him. No joke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would just share this with you and if you guys are interested in hearing more I would be happy to answer all of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So let me start from the beginning.
