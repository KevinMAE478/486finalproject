Combined with nicotine, addie, coke, and Molly here and there, I&amp;#39;ve gotten to a point where I get heartaches randomly throughout the day, which no otherwise-healthy 19 year old should be saying. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgcpqmr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412241.0, "created_utc": 1492383441.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qv8w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcuri8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TroubleInMyMind", "parent_id": "t3_65qv8w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hair of the dog", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair of the dog&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgcuri8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419072.0, "created_utc": 1492390272.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qv8w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvdee", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "123skrt", "parent_id": "t3_65qv8w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "SO TRUE", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SO TRUE&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgcvdee", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419875.0, "created_utc": 1492391075.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qv8w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd834n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Xortin", "parent_id": "t3_65qv8w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I use sustained release caffeine capsules and a few (threshold) doses of 3-meo-pce/pcp for this purpose.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use sustained release caffeine capsules and a few (threshold) doses of 3-meo-pce/pcp for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgd834n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492440740.0, "created_utc": 1492411940.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qv8w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdajs5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dtom_", "parent_id": "t3_65qv8w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't forget the Blue Meanies in the neighbour cow paddock", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget the Blue Meanies in the neighbour cow paddock&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgdajs5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492447999.0, "created_utc": 1492419199.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qv8w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdckug", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vvvalium", "parent_id": "t3_65qv8w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Currently smoking a few cigs while drinking a coffee I made last night before getting like knocked the fuck out basically, didn't even touch it.
