To start, let me give you all my backstory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was five, I was diagnosed with a spinal cord tumor. It was wrapped in and around my spine on a level of &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(CORRECTION: THE TYPE OF TUMOR IS ACTUALLY A C7-T5, AND WAS DIAGNOSED AS PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA.

Hope this helps!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...for those who want the specifics. Basically, I underwent surgery in order to remove the tumor, which paralyzed me from the waist down as well as damaged the nerves, meaning that after the surgery I wasn\u2019t able to walk or even feel my legs at all. During the process of recovery, I regained partial movement through intense physical and occupational therapy, but sensation still stayed dull. Overtime I went from being in a wheelchair, then walker, and then crutches, but then had to get another surgery to remove the tumor again when I was 9, and had to go through the process of recovery once again. And here I am now, 19 years old, and I can say without a doubt that after this experience on MDMA that I can now feel my legs again, and I fully believe this was due to this psychoactive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have quite a history of experimenting with psychoactives, mostly pot, adderall and vyvanse (for studying), various psychedelics including LSD and Psilocybin in high school, but having reached college I don\u2019t do much of anything these days. I\u2019ve had 2-3 experiences with MDMA, but only with minimal doses that didn\u2019t have much of an effect on me in the long run.  I decided to hang up the phone long ago, realizing after a rocky trip that I was bordering the line between expansionism and escapism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went on a camping trip with my friends last weekend, and had no desire to alter my state of consciousness for this trip, even though a good majority of my peers were planning on tripping on acid and shrooms. However, I did bring a molly rock with me for this trip that I picked up at a festival the week prior, but with the intention of distributing it amongst my friends. I went to the campsite during the evening, around 8 PM or so, when most of my friends got there in the morning and already set up the tents and food. Immediately I felt extremely welcome and got an amazing vibe from the current setting, as everyone was happy, joking around, eating fruit and other great foods. Despite my original intention to stay sober for this trip, my instincts after feeling out my surroundings, both internally and externally told me otherwise. The moment felt so right that it told me that taking the MDMA was meant to be for this exact time. Thus, I took the rock like a pill with some water, sat down on a blanket next to my one of my friends in front of a roaring fire and waited to see what the night had to offer me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;0-30 minutes: I\u2019m still sitting by the fire, and immediately I feel absolutely amazing. I\u2019m able to pick up on the energy of all my friends around me, watching them walk around the fire, some dancing and laughing, with tracers following their every movement. Someone threw another log in the fire and it becomes a roar of warmth, and captured my attention and completely threw off my sense of time for what felt like eternity. I specifically remember a \u201877 live version of Dancin\u2019 In The Street was playing (I\u2019m a diehard deadhead) and I was rendered speechless. I had no thoughts or any sort of introspections, but was instead was so immersed by the music and environment that I felt no need to use words or talk to my friends. Little did I know what was going to happen to me that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 minutes-1 hour: My friends and I had moved from the campfire setting to a beach volleyball area, where we decided to lay under the sand and look at the stars. I hit my peak immediately when my feet stepped on the sand, as a massive surge of energy went into my spine and resonated throughout my entire body, including my lower half, and caused me to fall down from the shock. My friends around me said \u201cYo are you good dude?\u201d, given that they had no idea how I was feeling and merely just saw me falling down. I said, \u201cYes, I think so..\u201d and was feeling new sensations that I knew were familiar to me yet at the same time were also brand new. I was wondering, \u201cWhat the hell am I feeling? Where is this coming from?\u201d I looked down at my feet, moving them around in the sand, and was immediately in disbelief, realizing that these sensations were coming from my legs. I stood up, and began to walk around in the sand, thinking \u201cIs this real?? Or is this just really good mdma??\u201d To test it out, I ran over to a grassy area to see if I could distinguish the difference between the two textures, and to my surprise I could. Walking on sand felt like walking on a cloud, and walking on the grass brought me back to a newfound connection with nature that I haven\u2019t felt since I was very young. All the while I was doing this without the aid of crutches, and this just registered to me now, and brought me even higher than I feel most people have never been before. \u201cI\u2019m walking!! I can feel my legs!!\u201d I was shouting to my friends as they stood there in disbelief as I began to walk everywhere, with a childlike sense of wonder that I haven\u2019t felt since, well, before my first battle with the tumor. It was such a beautiful moment, not only with myself but with all of my friends, we were all crying tears of joy over the unexpected moment of beauty that had occurred. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-6 hours: The rest of the night mostly consisted of me walking and running around, feeling the blessing of being able to feel my legs again and hanging out with all of my loving friends and being able to share this moment with them was more to ask for. To my surprise, I had no comedown at all, which is what I was anticipating, but I think this is due to a naturally found state of ecstasy from merely the events that took place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in my shoes, as someone who hasn\u2019t been able to feel his legs for 14 years, to a wonderful experience on mdma where, looking back on it, I like to think that, since it\u2019s a psychoactive that directly affects the central nervous system, fired up neurons connected to the spine that were numb for a very long time. I think that it created a mind to body connection that hasn\u2019t been there for 14 years, and is still there now and is there to stay. I\u2019m in tears writing about this now, still in disbelief that something like this happened, and immediately felt a need to write about it and spread it to all of you, not only for the advancement of the psychedelic movement but for the future of spinal cord injuries. I will admit, my legs are in a great deal of pain (but I am also extremely grateful to even be able to feel this pain), given that I didn\u2019t use my crutches at all that night and strained my body after not being able to walk without them for such a long time, but I feel that after this story is hopefully published and is spread all throughout the internet, that people my situation should also consider this for themselves. Despite my excitement for this miraculous discovery, I have to constantly remind myself to take it easy and go slow into my recovery, and I plan on hitting the treadmill, stretching my legs, and doing whatever I can to make it so I\u2019ll be able to walk someday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As lucky as I am, I will also admit that taking the mdma was foolish, as I had no idea whether or not it was legitimate prior to taking it. If there\u2019s anyone out there reading this who shares the same set of circumstances as me who is thinking \u201cHoly shit let me take an extremely high dose of molly for my own physical benefit.\u201d, I recommend waiting until more research is done, so that hopefully the medical legalization of mdma becomes more prominent in contemporary society. I know this story sounds miraculous, uplifting, and very much unbelievable, but I can tell you all with absolute certainty that it\u2019s nothing but the truth. Please do me the favor of staying safe, and also spreading this, as to increase awareness for the medicinal properties of not only mdma, but other psychedelics in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much love to all of you, safe journeys.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I had this experience on MDMA that exponentially changed my life for the better merely three days ago.
