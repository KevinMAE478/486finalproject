Something which is helped by the convention of parents granting more freedom to their children as they grow up, therefore meaning the teenager is inflicted less and less over time with the unjust authoritarian impositions and power plays of the parent; which makes the reason they resented their parents fade more and more into memory, and not seem so in their face, which makes it easier to forgive, cause the resentableness of the parent is located mainly in their abuse of power to get their way in spite of their child's desires, which is legitimised unjustly by society.

Something which is helped by the convention of parents granting more freedom to their children as they grow up, therefore meaning the teenager is inflicted less and less over time with the unjust authoritarian impositions and power plays of the parent; which makes the reason they resented their parents fade more and more into memory, and not seem so in their face, which makes it easier to forgive, cause the resentableness of the parent is located mainly in their abuse of power to get their way in spite of their child&amp;#39;s desires, which is legitimised unjustly by society. But ultimately it&amp;#39;s more the child learning to forgive and get along with the parent, rather than the parent actually stopping being so resentable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But if the parents weren&amp;#39;t so unjust and shitty in the first place their kids wouldn&amp;#39;t hate them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise if you give up trying to be cool and sociable and interesting when you leave university or whatever then yeah by the time your kids are teenagers you&amp;#39;re probably going to be really embarrassing to people. Fairly easily solvable by just not giving up on life and remembering to keep participating in the society you exist in. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oops i accidentally a whole thesis, sorry \ud83d\ude15 &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgdfkoo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492461926.0, "created_utc": 1492433126.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfyz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhjbn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bookwitchx", "parent_id": "t1_dgd7cnl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "so, babies shouldn't scream. we pump them full of formula + they get gas + we medicated them and switch formulas and their guts are like wtf guys! than they get put down in a baby chair and we want them to sleep alone in a crib in a room alone and they cry because that's fucking terrifying and yeah.
