They obviously don&amp;#39;t have a lot of knowledge of actual biology. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just curious how an individual who CHOOSES to go NUMEROUS times over a PERIOD of WEEKS and POTENTIALLY MONTHS in a nominal/elective activity is a rape victim?&amp;quot; Hmm...sounds very similar to describing an abusive relationship where one partner stays despite, in some cases, being raped on a regular basis. Either because they&amp;#39;re too scared to leave or numerous other things. Like you say, you cannot always make rational decisions in situations like that. Brains aren&amp;#39;t computers.
