I said I'd make it up later and even though it's technically tomorrow from when I said it, it's still today for me cause I haven't got a sleep yet cause of feeling so guilty. I wanted a opportunity for redemption and here I find the perfect chance. Talking about this combination of drug got me membering my pal Louis Baloncestos. \n\nLouis was a wild child, full of vim and vinegar. He would spit at the cats in the neighborhood and always stole the bones away from the puppies. He liked climbin trees and water skiing with no skis, his stinky feet right on the sparkling water of the crick. He was every mummas worsed nightmare and spent lots of time getting scolded by the ladies in the neighborhood, cause of him always hollering at the younger kids, and stealing the meat pies from their fridges.\n\nBut his favorite thing to do was to get spun out on alcohol and pot - crossfaded as they said. He would get out the school and start drinkin and smokin like a filthy bohemian jazz musician. He even started playing a guitar, singin songs about sexing himself on gals and eating medium-rare steak. He got pretty good at his guitar, and his songs found a niche in the up-and-coming generation of scallywags who liked red meat and doing sex onto each other.\n\nPretty soon, Louis Baloncestos had made a name for hisself, and was booking gigs at the state fair. Whenever he played he was crossfaded. But then the drought hit, and all the pot dealers couldn't sell Louis his sweet sticky licky.

Once Louis Baloncestos took stage with his musician pals, they started to play, but Louis just started to cry. I never seen so many tears. Louis cried liked when you forgot you had to go bathroom and so you did it inside your pants and then your friends all laughed at you for being a bungus.\n\nHe couldn't play his guitar and sing his songs about medium-rare steaks and sexing gals without being crossfaded. And the town was dry as a scarecrow where pot was concerned. His fans turnt on him like lions turned on their tamers in the circus. They ate him up. They had gotten so excited about hearing about juicy steaks in Louis' songs that they got hungry. But when they're ear-hunger weren't satisfied, it turnt to tummy-hunger. It was like watching Discovery channel with humans for the hungry animals. \n\nThe savage events of the state fair got lots of coverage by the top music magazines and so every one knew about it. That's why Katy Perry wrote her song about 'hear me roar' - it was a memorial to Louis Baloncestos and the way his fans turnt into hungry lions and ate him. I can't hear that song without getting flashbacks now.\n\nAnyways, the lesson here is to never run out of marijuana if you get crossfaded while practicing your guitar, else you'll forget how to play your guitar and sing, then you'll cry, and your fans will turn on you and eat you like a medium-rare steak. \n\nRIP Louis Baloncestos.

I said I&amp;#39;d make it up later and even though it&amp;#39;s technically tomorrow from when I said it, it&amp;#39;s still today for me cause I haven&amp;#39;t got a sleep yet cause of feeling so guilty. I wanted a opportunity for redemption and here I find the perfect chance. Talking about this combination of drug got me membering my pal Louis Baloncestos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Louis was a wild child, full of vim and vinegar. He would spit at the cats in the neighborhood and always stole the bones away from the puppies. He liked climbin trees and water skiing with no skis, his stinky feet right on the sparkling water of the crick. He was every mummas worsed nightmare and spent lots of time getting scolded by the ladies in the neighborhood, cause of him always hollering at the younger kids, and stealing the meat pies from their fridges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But his favorite thing to do was to get spun out on alcohol and pot - crossfaded as they said. He would get out the school and start drinkin and smokin like a filthy bohemian jazz musician. He even started playing a guitar, singin songs about sexing himself on gals and eating medium-rare steak. He got pretty good at his guitar, and his songs found a niche in the up-and-coming generation of scallywags who liked red meat and doing sex onto each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon, Louis Baloncestos had made a name for hisself, and was booking gigs at the state fair.
