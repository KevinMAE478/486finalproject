He goes to college in NY, and my parents planned a road trip to go visit him this week due to him getting kicked out of a highly prestigious school (that I could never in a million years get into) for dealing drugs. So after visiting family in Ohio, they headed up to NY. I was hanging out with my girlfriend like I would any other night. I was eating Zaxby&amp;#39;s at her dinning room table when my grandparents texted my sister and I to get the hell home. I knew something had happened. I immediately texted my mom to make sure she was okay. She texted back after 5 minutes. My sister and I were freaking the fuck out. I got home after what felt like forever. Late last night, my grandparents informed me that Travis had overdosed, and my poor fucking mother found her dead child lying on the floor in his apartment. She said he was purple beyond belief. He was gone for hours by the time my mom and dad had found him. Whilst also selling and doing, he began with weed, then went on to LSD, and now, he&amp;#39;s dead from a heroin overdose. So fucking selfish. So. fucking. selfish. Why would you even do that the day your fucking mother was coming to visit you. Do you realize how retarded you have to be...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m more mad than sad, to be quite frank. I know my mom is gonna blame herself for the rest of her life when all she ever tried to do was help him. My entire family knew he had a drug problem and we all tried to fucking help and he wouldn&amp;#39;t fucking listen. My grandparents prayed twice a day while also being in constant communication, my sister talked to him constantly about stopping and the effects it had on her life and why she stopped, my mom and dad never disowned him or made him feel terrible; he had the world handed to him. I can&amp;#39;t believe he did this to my mom. I can&amp;#39;t believe he was selfish enough to think this wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt anyone. I understand addiction is a problem, but we tried everything we could and he still wouldn&amp;#39;t fucking help himself.
