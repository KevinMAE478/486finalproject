All of my stories are true. Any changes made are to protect identies of people involved. For those of you who just wanna read my account of the fight I&amp;#39;ve bolded the beginning of it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike let Nick stay at his house again. I hate this fucking guy. He sleeps in my spot on the couch. He&amp;#39;s obnoxious. He&amp;#39;s dangerous. Despite it all, I tolerate him because I think he&amp;#39;s kind of pathetic and a little extra muscle is good to have around in an ever more dangerous city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the anniversary of Nick&amp;#39;s last big fuck up. He was supposed to get married a year ago today to some girl up north. Before he did whatever he did to fuck that up, he claimed to be in love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Degenerates like him dont get love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got locked up again for something stupid and ended up homeless and alone again when he got out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#39;s the anniversary of his failed wedding and he wants to make it count. In ususal fashion we decide to celebrate by drinking and doing drugs until we cant stand up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive got 2 tabs of acid, a few ecstacy pills, 5 capsules of 2C-B, and like six bucks. Im not gonna be supplying the whole group with drugs tonight so I do the next best thing and shoplift bottles from a grocery store before heading over to Mike&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let myself in without knocking. The coke party crowd is long gone without a ghost of ever having been here. This is how I like this place. I feel home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I begin emptying the contents of my bag onto the glass table in the living room. Cards against Humanity, Dominos, 2 bottles of New Amsterdam Vodka, 1 bottle of Tennessee Honey and a bottle of tequila.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick hears me clinking bottles onto the table and walks in from the backyard, exhaling the last of his cigarette and letting Mike&amp;#39;s big blond pit bull inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;XXX? What&amp;#39;s going on man?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dap him up cus I have to and tell him Im here to celebrate his failed marriage. He looks at the alcohol on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Fuck&lt;/em&gt; yeah bro. Let&amp;#39;s fuckin get it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s Mike?&amp;quot; I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the shower.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nod. Mike has another roommate too, Cisco, we go way back but dont hang out much anymore. I peek my head in his room to see if he&amp;#39;s there but he&amp;#39;s at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I return to the living room, Nick is already pouring himself vodka into a coffee cup. He knows the Honey is for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ive been drinking since like noon,&amp;quot; he laughs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God damn.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m trying to get fucked up tonight. I already asked Mike to promise me to not let me stop drinking under any circumstances and I want you to too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure whatever.&amp;quot; I grin thinking about how much his next morning is gonna suck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike comes out of the steamy bathroom in just boxers and spots me from the hall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up bro?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smile at his mere prescence. The older brother I never had. I follow him into his room and lean the door shut behind me to talk as he pulls on pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So he&amp;#39;s getting trashed here tonight?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Guess so.&amp;quot; he shrugs with a smile. &amp;quot;I dont really care. He knows he&amp;#39;ll be out on the street if he does anything stupid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dude,&amp;quot; I reply. &amp;quot;Check it out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take the drugs out of my pocket and drop the tabs onto my tongue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s get fucked up then.&amp;quot; I say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door opens behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that 2C-B?&amp;quot; Mike asks excitedly at the capsules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I thought you were all out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I found a few more laying around. You want one?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He nods and swallows a capsule quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s 2C-B?&amp;quot; Nick asks behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothin.&amp;quot; I say, putting everything in my pocket again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh I see how it is.&amp;quot; he replies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Youve been drinking since noon dude.&amp;quot; Mike says. &amp;quot;You have no idea how you&amp;#39;d handle it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;C&amp;#39;mon dude, what even is it?&amp;quot; he asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s like acid.&amp;quot; I tell him. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll sell you one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I dont have any money man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That sucks.&amp;quot; I duck past him into the living room and take a swig of honey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;C&amp;#39;mon dude. Please?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tell him I&amp;#39;ll think about it. Quit asking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike turns on some loud rap music and we get to drinking and fucking off. A few other people show up through the course of the night trying to drink but Nick is on a mission to get alcohol poisoning and most people cant hang. Within an hour or so I start tripping pretty hard and only sip on a beer or a jack and coke. Nobody notices in their own drunkenness. Mike, who is absolutely an alcoholic, drinks normally without telling anyone how high he is yet somehow isnt a sloppy mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night goes as well as it possibly could until around four AM when its just the three of us and two other people and Cisco in his room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cisco walks out shirtless to get a snack as the rest of us play dominos and bullshit in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn dude when did you get so fat?&amp;quot; Nick asks him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When did you get so fuckin stupid?&amp;quot; Cisco snaps back. He openly hates Nick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut the fuck up.&amp;quot; Nick stands up starting to get angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dont talk to me like that in my own fuckin house!&amp;quot; Cisco shouts in his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before Nick can say anything, Mike gets in between them and makes Nick sit down beside me. Cisco goes back to his room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vibe has changed a bit and I decide to try to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I got a game for us.&amp;quot; I say. &amp;quot;We lay out all the dominos face down and randomly draw them. The guy with the highest total on his domino has to take as many shots as the largest number on his dominos. We keep going til theyre all gone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees. The first few rounds cycle. Everyone has taken a couple shots. Finally theres only one round left. We all draw tiles. Nick cries out with his face in his hands and tosses his tile into the middle of the table face up. Its double sixes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pour him six shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You told us not to let you stop drinking.&amp;quot; Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pour him two more to grow on and we talk him into taking them. He gets four down before running outside to puke. After the fifth one he falls down but gets back up and takes the sixth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike and another guy take the two extras. Ive never seen Nick this open. He starts dancing like an idiot and takes his shirt off and talking about love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally he sits down as everyone leaves except me and Mike. We play dominos for a few minutes. Cisco comes out and sits with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Done pouting?&amp;quot; Nick asks him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Done sleeping on my couch?&amp;quot; Cisco replies. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to ask you, what was jail like?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick gets quiet. &amp;quot;I dont really remember.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Too busy suckin dick inside?&amp;quot; I ask the melting face of Nick behind the swirling colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nick punches me in the nuts where I&amp;#39;m sitting. I double over trying not to puke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot; I demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You said I was suckin-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I punch him in the stomach while he&amp;#39;s talking and shove him down. Normally I couldnt do that as he&amp;#39;s a good six inches taller and thirty pounds heavier than me but fuck it, thats what you get for being a drunk jackass. He moves to do something but a look from Mike stops him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ooh if I didnt need to stay here...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What would you do?&amp;quot; I demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;XXX &lt;strong&gt;I would knock you out with one hit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aw fuck off youve never knocked anyone out in one hit. You couldnt knock my brother out in one hit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You wanna bet?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go get your gloves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep boxing gloves in my car for illicit matches here sometimes but nobody has boxed Nick yet. His reputation precedes him. I tell myself that I can handle it as I take my shirt off and pull the gloves out of my trunk, feeling the cool night air flow over my bare skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three of us march over to the dirt lot across the street and put on gloves. Theres no streetlights. No rules. No witnesses. We fight until someone says they have had enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;d better not fly off the fuckin handle.&amp;quot; I tell him, barely able to see anything on acid in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wont.&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wont let him.&amp;quot; Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike is smaller than Nick but around the same weight, built and known to be able to fight. He and Nick fought once and he beat the shit out of Nick but it was years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I&amp;#39;m done,&amp;quot; Nick says. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My back hurts, Nick, and if you make me fight you right now, I&amp;#39;m gonna fuck you up.&amp;quot; Mike replies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lets see if you still got that right hook.&amp;quot; Nick says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tighten my gloves with my teeth. &amp;quot;Lets go already.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERES WHERE THE FIGHT STARTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We square up. I can see him but only barely. Flashes of red swirl through my vision. If not for the acid Id be too tired to move. I can already tell that drunk Nick isnt ready to box. Hes trained in Jiu Jitsu and is only a good street fighter becauae most people cant wrestle well. Without that hes just a confident guy with long arms. I tell myself I can do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We circle slowly. Nick keeps goading me, trying to get me to strike first. Finally I fient with my right and hit him with a left hook in the side of the head. He staggers to the side a bit but doesnt retaliate yet. I hit him two more times. With him not attacking I go all out on a combo and leave him with his head tucked down, bent over, with his hands over his head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stand up and fight me!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will.&amp;quot; He grins like a cartoon villain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know hes waiting for that angry adrenaline to kick in and it scares me. I put a hand on his back and uppercut him in the face with all my might.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He snaps up, spitting blood. I throw an overhead right but he sees it and moves. With my acid distorted view though, I swipe through his chasers as he hits me hard in the back of the head. I see stars for a moment and stumble forward but manage to turn and stay standing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not knocked out.&amp;quot; I say. &amp;quot;Guess you lose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gimme another shot. That doesnt count.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes it does.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;C&amp;#39;mon. Hit me again.&amp;quot; he pokes his head forward, jaw out, hands down. &amp;quot;Hit me. Hit me. You know you want to. Hit me. Hit-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I balled up and threw the cleanest punch Ive ever thrown, catching him in the jaw with a crack and dropping him. Not enough though. He pops back up and hits me again. I block his next one and drop my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thats enough. Im not knocked out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine,&amp;quot; he replies. &amp;quot;Now you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I toss Mike my gloves and he squares up with a sigh.
