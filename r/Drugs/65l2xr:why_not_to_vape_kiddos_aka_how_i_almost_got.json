Me and some friends are hanging out in my dorm room (on a college campus) cause my roommate&amp;#39;s gone and, as most drug stories begin, we decide &amp;#39;fuck it, let&amp;#39;s do something stupid&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pull out a bag of DXE (think ketamine) and 4-aco-DMT (think shrooms) and we get to work. Most noticeably is my friend, &amp;#39;Daniel&amp;#39; and me. Daniel&amp;#39;s never tried shrooms before, but he&amp;#39;s down for a good time, so he throws 25mg 4-aco down the hatch. I&amp;#39;ve had my fair share of dissociative experiences, but I&amp;#39;ve never properly &amp;#39;holed&amp;#39; on anything, so I start cranking out 10mg lines of DXE and railing them as fast as they can be produced. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon we&amp;#39;re both feeling it. Daniel puts on Svefn-g-Englar by Sigur R\u00f3s and I just fucking lose myself in the music. I don&amp;#39;t even notice that everyone else has left. Me and Daniel spend a good hour just laying in beds staring at the ceiling, listening to ambient rock. At this point I&amp;#39;ve ingested 130mg of DCK, and Daniel&amp;#39;s taken a good 20mg as well. He&amp;#39;s vaping heavily off a vape pen, cause the nicotine helps with the trip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the fucking fire alarm goes off. I open my eyes and the room is so full of vape smoke that I can barely see the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;God damn it. Of course that would set off the smoke detector. What were we thinking?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sit up, and I can&amp;#39;t even remember who I am.

I later discovered that he&amp;#39;d fucking booked it and ran half a mile in a blizzard outside WITHOUT SHOES to another dorm, and spent the night with a friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ANYWAYS, the hall security people come about 30 seconds after I get back to my room, and run past me to sniff the air in my bedroom (weed&amp;#39;s a big problem on campus). Then once they realize it was just vapor, they calm down and chill out a bit. My memory&amp;#39;s a bit hazy at this point. But with slurred speech and intermittent gurgles and murmurs, I somehow convinced them that &amp;#39;yes, sirs I am completely sober and was being a rule breaker by vaping in my room when that&amp;#39;s not allowed in buildings on campus.
