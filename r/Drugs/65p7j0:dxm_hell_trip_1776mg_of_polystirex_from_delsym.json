This was around my 7th or 8th trip, and was when I was 16 years old. So I decided to go to the store and pick up what I thought was two 3oz bottles of delsym. I came home and let those bottles sit there for a few days, until a Friday, which was the perfect time to drink them, since my parents wanted to take me to a christmas lights show that you drive through, and I was decent at acting sober. So I downed one bottle all at once, and downed the other bottle 30 mins later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until I started feeling the come up that I realized that the bottles weren&amp;#39;t 3oz, they were fucking 5oz. 888+888= 1776mg of fucking dxm, and I was with my parents. I just remember slowly fading out of the world, and the car was a whole separate missile blasting into space. As we were driving through the christmas lights, I remember trying not to let my brain explode, and trying not to freak the fuck out. We decided to stop at the gift shop on the way out, and I robowalked my ass all the way to the bathroom, somehow avoiding detection. I was just destroyed, thinking about how much I fucked up, taking 1776mg instead of just around 1000mg, which was a decent poly trip. I looked in the mirror, and my pupils were so huge. They reminded me of black holes, and I got scared of looking at them. So then I robowalked back to the car, and just stared right in front of me until my parents came back. On the drive home, they kept asking me questions, they didn&amp;#39;t suspect I was fucked up or anything, just conversing with me normally. It was so fucking hard to talk, like, it took so much of my energy to speak normally. They caught onto the fact that I was speaking a little slower than normal, but passed it off as me being tired since it was 12am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we arrived home, I went straight to my room, and felt like a huge lift was taken off of my shoulders, now that I could actually relax without my parents suspecting that I was chugging bottles of cough syrup to get high. So the trip was still hitting me fucking strong, since poly lasts so damn long. I remember going into my room at a 3rd person perspective, seeing myself robowalk in, and slowly phase into the bed. I managed to turn on the tv, and turn on some random tv show. My room felt like a large abyss, with my tv screen the only source of light for miles. As I lay, I remember thinking about deep corners of my life, and also thinking about how my walls looked like they were melting, and they actually did melt. My walls fucking MELTED, it was the coolest thing out of this entire hell trip. So I don&amp;#39;t remember drifting to sleep, but I somehow managed to. I woke up the next morning to go to church, but the trip barely faded. I was still tripping at 80 to 90 percent, except now my vision was fucked. If my head wasn&amp;#39;t completely straight, and I turn it slightly to the left or the right, my vision would warp into 2 separate sights, it&amp;#39;s very difficult to explain. I robowalked even worse around the house, feeling somehow I got even more intoxicated than the night before. This day was slightly different, I could think better and speak better, but my motor movements were worse, and I couldn&amp;#39;t see shit. This time my parents picked up on it. On the drive to church, we parked and stopped. My mom turned around, and said &amp;quot;Hey X. You know we love you right? And you know we want the best for you right? I know you&amp;#39;re on something. Would you like me and your father to take you to the hospital so you can feel better? You don&amp;#39;t look too happy about it.&amp;quot; This in turn made me immediately shit my pants, and I dodged and lied, &amp;quot;No mom, I&amp;#39;m fine. No mom, I don&amp;#39;t do fucking coke, it&amp;#39;s ok&amp;quot;. She thought I was on coke for some reason. She said that when she looked at me, one eye was normal, but the other eye, my pupil was the size of a black hole again. I robowalked my ass over to the youth center as normal, and sat there tripped the fuck out at church, explaining to my friends what the fuck I was on. They helped me out thankfully, giving me some tips on how to look like I wasn&amp;#39;t fried. The rest of the day was very foggy, but I remember that each day the trip faded out more and more. I also remember that I wasn&amp;#39;t really sober until about a week after first drinking those two bottles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From that day on, I always make sure I drink the right fucking size of bottles, because that was some crazy ass shit. It would&amp;#39;ve been way better if I didn&amp;#39;t have to act sober for 3 days straight.
