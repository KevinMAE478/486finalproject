My buddy OG has pissed himself, we went too hard at the club and he couldn&amp;#39;t hang. Our friend has abandoned us at club egg, where we leave shortly since OG has just pissed himself. I have to get this man sober to get him to a hotel, ya feel me ;). I ask the owners for something to drink for my friend, and they bring him more soju. By time I notice he has chugged the bottle. &amp;quot;Hey kid, you looking for a watch?&amp;quot; A soothing Boston accent comes from the alley between the 7/11 and a massage parlor. No, but do you have any crack for my friend? I replied. &amp;quot;Woah bud, alow your roll, try these...&amp;quot; A small white pill with the words CAFFEINE60 on top is passed between us. I offer the man thanks, he asks for a blowjob to which I decline. While crushing the pill I am lured into its trap and snort the thing in a haste. I can&amp;#39;t remember much at this point as I black out, but the police report states I robbed the store at finger gun point and jerk off several guys at the massage parlor. Caffeine, not even once. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgdfapk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492461391.0, "created_utc": 1492432591.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdew1a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BananaBraed", "parent_id": "t1_dgder1x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Woah now that's a story I want to hear!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woah now that&amp;#39;s a story I want to hear!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Drugs", "name": "t1_dgdew1a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492460586.0, "created_utc": 1492431786.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgder1x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KumonRoguing", "parent_id": "t1_dgdenax", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drugs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I once had to buy some from a guy in an alley behind a 711 while I was in Korea.
