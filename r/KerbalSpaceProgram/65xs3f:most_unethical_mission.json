And it was just this past Saturday.\n\nStill early in my career save, I got the contract to perform an orbital docking. Nice payout, and I've never docked but want to start building stations as well as run an Apollo-style Mun landing (to be my first ever mission to put a Kerbal on any extra-Kerbin body, despite nearly 150 hours spent in this game over the years!). I had a good, reliable rocket sporting the trusty Mk1 pod, so I swapped out the nose-mounted parachute (still leaving a pair of drogues and a pair of radial chutes -- I tend to over-do the chutes) for a Dock-o-Tron Jr and promptly launch newcomer pilot Magne into a ~150km orbit.\n\nOnce she's up there, Valentina launches in an identical rocket. Took me a while to get the hang of how to catch up to another orbit (and I didn't bother trying for an opportune launch window for the rendezvous, I literally just launched as soon as Magne finished circularizing), but eventually I got the two craft docked and pocketed the nice payout (including the world-first reward).\n\nNow, at this point, I was tired, as it was late in the day. I should have left them there and brought them back down on another day. But I was eager, and excited at having just hit that milestone in my all-time playing, and so I ignored the voice of reason and decided I'd bring them down now.\n\nSo, given that I'm bringing them back down, I should have undocked the two craft and brought them down separately. But I was tired, and wanted to finish this mission up and then go to bed. So, I shut down one of the engines of the nose-to-nose craft, and ignoring reason once again fired up the other engine to do the de-orbit burn.\n\nMan, those docking ports are *flexible!!*\n\nI start to panic seeing Valentina's pod waving and wobbling around to a full 90-degree bend -- and more! -- and start slowing the engines until I have an aerobraking trajectory, and then I cut them off altogether. Again, reason told me I should abort the re-entry -- plenty of dV left in the tanks to get back up to a reasonable parking orbit -- but I decided to ride it down. Again, tired and lazy.\n\nHit the atmosphere, and despite the ships being designed to jettison all engines and fuel tanks and come down pod-only (well, plus heat shield and chutes, of course), I start running the engines again to slow the decent through the atmosphere -- something that's become a favorite technique of mine so as to attempt to maximize recovery funds by keeping as much attached and intact as possible and performing a semi-powered landing. Again, the docking port wobbling is worrying, but now as the reentry heat builds and temperature bars start to show up, the panic is rising.\n\nI try to stage, reasoning that ditching the heavy tanks and engines will allow the pods to slow down more quickly to let me deploy the chutes. Nothing happens. I panic (yes, there was a lot of this on this mission!), try again, and still nothing happens.\n\nAh, that's right! I had locked the staging so as to avoid accidentally dumping my engine and leaving a helpless pod drifting in space! Unlock staging, stage, and watch tanks and engine fall away.\n\nNow there's a new problem. Somehow, in docking, the staging got all messed up, and I didn't bother to look at it before starting re-entry. If I hit the spacebar again, it will activate my chutes, but I'm moving way to fast even for the drogues to safely deploy. I still have one of the pod's tank and engine attached, which means I'm still way too heavy to be slowing down -- and by this time I am deep into the atmosphere!\n\nIt takes me far long than it should to reorder the stages (literally drag S0 down to become S2) and then jettison it, and now I'm *really* close to the ground. Still too fast, I hit the drogues anyway (\"Oh hey, they're armed but not deploying yet! Neat!\"). As just a pair of pods tumbling out of control, I'm actually slowing pretty quickly, and soon the I hear the sound of drogues being released--\n\n--followed not a moment lated by the sound of the pods slamming into the ground and every single little part instantly exploding into pure vapor.\n\nMagne and Valentina lost their lives because I was too tired and too lazy (and too stupid) to wait and bring them down properly.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mine is a tale of laziness (and no small amount of stupidity) overcoming sound, ethical judgment. And it was just this past Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still early in my career save, I got the contract to perform an orbital docking. Nice payout, and I&amp;#39;ve never docked but want to start building stations as well as run an Apollo-style Mun landing (to be my first ever mission to put a Kerbal on any extra-Kerbin body, despite nearly 150 hours spent in this game over the years!). I had a good, reliable rocket sporting the trusty Mk1 pod, so I swapped out the nose-mounted parachute (still leaving a pair of drogues and a pair of radial chutes -- I tend to over-do the chutes) for a Dock-o-Tron Jr and promptly launch newcomer pilot Magne into a ~150km orbit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once she&amp;#39;s up there, Valentina launches in an identical rocket. Took me a while to get the hang of how to catch up to another orbit (and I didn&amp;#39;t bother trying for an opportune launch window for the rendezvous, I literally just launched as soon as Magne finished circularizing), but eventually I got the two craft docked and pocketed the nice payout (including the world-first reward).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point, I was tired, as it was late in the day.
