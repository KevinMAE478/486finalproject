You'll also need my [Functions Library file with my janky PID control tuning bits](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2-h41qiJELMVlhKYVpRYTNHem8).  \nKeep in mind, I haven't programmed since taking a PASCAL class in high-school in the early 90s.  So forgive my code.  This has been a learning experience.\n\nThe basic premise is set up a landing zone in the middle of the KSC runway (latlng(-0.049230959, -74.63131123)).  Based on if I'm approaching from the West (like from a typical orbit) or from the east, I set a landing zone 1200 meters from the center towards the closer end.\n\nI set up 3 \"way points\" at increasing distances from the LZ, for now, at 10km, 20km, and 40km.  The point of these is to set up an approach, hopefully parallel to the runway. The 2 subsequent ones These may not be needed when coming in from an orbit, but I was testing this with a partially fueled version of the SSTO, which does a big U-turn throwing off the approach angle.   The first one is at 7000m altitude, to make sure I don't slam into Mt. Whoopstooshort when approaching from the West.  The subsequent ones drop altitude to 3000 and 1000 m.\n\nAssuming I make it to the runway, once crossing the LZ or hitting 100m altitude (which ever comes first), I level out my pitch, drop gears, and throttle down.  There's a bunch of bugs still to be worked out, obviously, like the whole crashing into the hangar.\n\nThe heart and soul of the script are the 3 PID Loops.  There's a loop ton control ascent/descent rate, which of course affects speed.  This makes the next PID loop complicated, as it maintains speed (180m/s for this script for now), and the 3rd PID tries to hold altitude by controlling the ascent/descent loop.  Everything interacts, and I'm still trying figure PID loops out in general.  \n\nThere's a LOT of oscillations.  To make tuning the PID loops easier, I put in a temporary manual adjustment sub-routine (QWE/ASD adjust the Kp, Ki, and Kd of the ascent/descent PID, RTY/FGH for altitude hold, and UIO/JKL) for speed/throttle.  They output to the screen, and you need to manually change them in the Script file, as they won't be retained after ending the program / crashing the plane.\n\nThe good news is, if I go with putting in a keep to the center of the runway PID loop, it shouldn't really interact with the other ones.  My main worry is oscillations there would be really, really bad.  I need to figure out the deadzone function.\n\nIf you download the script, and want to adjust the PID constants, you'll need to de-comment the \"getinput().\" lines.  I was trying to debug some stuff, and wanted to simplify things now that I've tuned the PID loops well enough.
