I had mastered the art of taking two metal hangars, tying them together and making a loop so you could wrap it around the inside handle and pull down to open up the door from the outside. I had lots of practice, earning a few beers from desperate neighbors and even once got a request from an RA to open a door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the night&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 4:00 am I drove home and notice that I had exactly two metal hangars in my closet.

Holy shit, I was breaking into his office (did I mention that he was all the dean of the department?). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 4:15 am I was outside his office with two hangars trying to break into his office. My adrenaline was pumping, I had some pieces of papers and a pretty lame story about what I was doing there if someone walked by. His office was in a very open space and it was a lot harder to break in then I remembered. The bottom of his door was really low and the hangars were losing their integrity. 15 minutes in I was losing hope when I felt it grab on, I pulled down and opened the door.
