I don't know you or if this applies to you, but here's something to think about.\n\nWhen you strongly fantasize about a romantic relationship with someone, you can change your natural reactions to their interactions. You might start staring just a bit too long and a bit too lustily -- something totally appropriate for a boyfriend, but it can seem really weird and creepy when it comes from an acquaintance. If you fantasize with them in the room, I guarantee they notice you daydreaming while looking in their direction --again a bit weird if you don't know why someone is smiling and staring at you. It will also affect the words you use, making you slip into familiar language that people normally don't use outside of romantic relationships.\n\nWorse, since you've fantasized more than you've dated, you might have invented relationships that are weirdly scripted, like in a movie rather than the typical in real life. This will also seem weird to someone who doesn't understand why you're acting the way you do.\n\nMy suggestion is that you need to stop fantasizing about real guys that you want to date. It won't \"work\" as well to pretend to date some character from TV or a perfect imaginary guy, even an older fantasy in a past class.
