The request that your boyfriend made - for you to support and help him long term in the potential parenting of this child, essentially to form a permanent family - needed to be done in a very mindful, serious and properly planned way, with plenty of time for discussion, reflection on both sides - a decision that needs to be made over the space of a couple of weeks, not a few days or (god forbid) one occasion. This is an incredibly seriously commitment that he is making, and that he is asking you to make. \n\nI would ask your boyfriend to take a step back and go back to the discussion/reflection/thinking it through stage. \n\nSuch a decision needs to be made from the totality of who each person is, which includes their readiness to put the interests and needs of another at the centre of their heart  - a readiness that younger people often have not yet had the time to develop (and some never develop). \n\nBe aware that when you do whole heartedly put the interests of another at the core of your life, something amazing happens .. what seemed impossible becomes possible, what is very hard can even become joyful, because you are committed, because your commitment to doing that thing, being that carer, becomes integral to who you are. I mention this because you need to be aware that you have the capacity to change and grow, and this is an opportunity for you to do so.\n\nLife changes, all the time - you know that, don't you? And sometimes it changes suddenly. \n\nSuch occasions do often come along suddenly in life. Someone's girlfriend gets pregnant unexpectedly - what is he going to do? He likes his carefree life, and suddenly, there is a prospect of a very different life, the prospect of him being asked to open his heart, his time, his effort and his life to putting a vulnerable, dependent being first, to putting a child at the centre of his life. Is he going to cling to his old way of life (which of course, will pass away in time anyway, and probably sooner than he thinks it will) and reject his girlfriend? Or will he be open to change and grow?\n\nNotice that I'm not saying it's the adult OR the child that \"comes first\". That's not how family life works (although the responsibility of adults in the relationship, does mean that parents need to prioritise the daily physical and emotional care of nurture of their children - but equally they must not neglect their own, or each other's). It's about the adult(s) AND the child(ren), together, everyone loving each other, everyone helping each other, everyone committed to each other. In other words, as it is between your boyfriend and you now. It seems that the world is offering you the chance to open your heart and include this child within that loving circle. Think of it not as an abandonment of your previous life, but a development, a growth.\n\nYou need time to think and feel this through, and to talk it through very thoroughly with your boyfriend, giving him time to feel and work it through too. If after that process you still feel the way you do now, and he still feels that he is committed to this prospective parenting future (which of course isn't a decision that's totally in his hands to make, there's going to be legal and regulatory/social welfare processes to deal with), then absolutely you would be making the right decision to consciously, mindfully leave the relationship - or rather, that would really be a decision you would need to come to, together. \n\nThat's a premature conclusion though. From what you have said, I think you have a lot of love for this child, but you doubt yourself. That's good, to challenge yourself. If you don't remember anything else I've written here, please remember this: whatever you decide - which must be with your head, heart and soul, combined - do it and commit to it with your whole heart.

Sometimes people with cancer drive partners away, or do not handle the cancer situation well and become abusive partners, or perhaps the SO is already disabled themselves and just cannot be a caregiver, ore perhaps the relationship was already dead and gone before the diagnosis, or a million other situations. Sometimes it is best for all concerned to end a relationship.\n\n&gt; Why even bother with relationships if you answer 'yes'?\n\nThat's a childish perspective, absolutist and just plain silly.

That doesn't make someone a bad person, nor does is make them \"ineligible for all relationships.\" That's just nuts.\n\n&gt; You don't scurry away and run at the first sign of struggle.

OP has made a very carefully considered decision related to a situation that was ENTIRELY created by and the fault of other fucked up people. What happened to the kid is not her fault, and it is not her responsibility to fix it. It is not even the BFs responsibility, but he is choosing of his own free will to do it anyway.

If she does not want that for her life, she absolutely has 100% rights to walk away. In fact she has the obligation to walk away.\n\nOP is NOT in any way selfish. And to be honest the BF is. He may be unselfish to the child, but he is being selfish to OP. Expecting someone he's barely been dating to suddenly drop their entire life, their life plans, their hopes and dreams to take on a kid at the drop of a hat with zero discussion about it.... NOPE. That's not OK.\n\n&gt; OP's way is the coward way.\n\nNo, it's not. OP is incredibly brave and is sacrificing by leaving a relationship she enjoys because that is the best choice for all concerned.\n\n&gt; At least give the kid a chance! \n\nIt's not about the kid, it's about OP's life too.

He is going to most likely have problems for the rest of his life, and may in fact be a dependent \"child\" for the rest of his life. There are 40 year olds with far, far fewer issues than this child who are still living at home with their parents. If you think this kid is going to suddenly \"snap out of it\" after a couple of years of good food, and a few dozen therapy sessions... no, not going to happen.\n\nMost likely, this will be a 10-30 year road, if not a lifetime road. Most likely, this kid will have to be planned for in OP's Will to ensure it still has care after he's dead.\n\nIt takes 18 years to raise a normal, healthy child to adulthood... the BF in this case could still be helping this kid with homework when he's retired.\n\nAnd even if your \"3 year miracle\" were going to happen, that STILL does not make this OPs problem.

If you decided to stay with your boyfriend and you didn&amp;#39;t live together, you would probably have less time together while his nephew gets better but you could perhaps plan dates together  without the child (and limited time together with the child) as your boyfriend will need some recharge time as well and will need to maintain somewhat of a life outside the child for his own personal well being. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "confession", "name": "t1_dgaouz6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294879.0, "created_utc": 1492266079.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659dat", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc6rua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "C_D_M", "parent_id": "t3_659dat", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/confession", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can understand why you don't want to stay, a child is a huge commitment and stress.\n\nBut that being said, you're going to regret this in the end.
