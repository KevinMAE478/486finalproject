[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "confession", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the confession, here&amp;#39;s some information about my family tree so you understand: my mother and father were both married before they got together. My dad never had kids with his abusive, alcoholic ex-wife, but my mum had 3 children with her abusive, alcoholic ex-husband: Sarah, Kevin, and Joanne. Sarah was 2 years older than Kevin, and 10 years older than Joanne. When my mum left her ex, Joanne was only a few months old. Their biological father isn&amp;#39;t interested in staying in touch, so my mum looks after her kids alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 years later, my mum met my dad. They fell in love, and my half-sister&amp;#39;s referred to him as dad, my half-brother was &amp;quot;too cool&amp;quot; to call him dad, but he will do if it&amp;#39;s a situation where the family is pulled closer together, like the situation I&amp;#39;ll mention later. My dad loves my half-siblings, and he loves being a father. 6 years into their relationship, they get pregnant with me. At this point, sarah is 19, Kev is 17 and Joanne is 9. Everyone&amp;#39;s happy, and my parents, convinced they were having a boy, bought as many baby boy clothes as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my mum is 6 months pregnant with me, she gets an unexpected surprise: Sarah is also pregnant. My mum was going to be a grandmother at 36 years old, and she was actually excited. She gave birth to a little girl in the January of 96, and sarah gives birth to a little boy in July of 96: Ryan. My parents were just glad that the boy clothes weren&amp;#39;t going to waste (though I still played on the fucking awesome remote control police bike). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joanne was so happy. She had a baby sister and a baby nephew to look after. She loved kids. It also didn&amp;#39;t hurt that Ryan and I got on well together as we got older, so there was never any fighting. Me and Ry were besties, to say the least. Joanne and I also had a great relationship, she looked after me a lot and did my make up and other sweet things sisters do together. She also gave me my fear of spiders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Joanne was 16 she got knocked up by her 22 year old boyfriend, Gareth. Sarah had had 3 children by this point, and was expecting a fourth. Kevin was also expecting his first child. My mum wasn&amp;#39;t happy; she&amp;#39;d seen herself struggle with teenage pregnancy, and didn&amp;#39;t want Joanne to do the same. But Jo was excited. In June of 2003, she had her first child, Anthony, and at 7 years old I was an auntie to 6 kids. Me and Ryan still had an insanely strong friendship, so I saw him as more a twin brother than anything, but the rest were like cousins. I was allowed to be a dick to the older 3 because of my age, but I&amp;#39;d also die for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joanne was a brilliant mum. She adored Anthony, but her relationship with Gareth wasn&amp;#39;t going well. When she was 25, in an attempt to save her relationship, they had another child, a daughter called Ruby. This kid is my mini me, I swear. We look so alike, poor kid. Jo makes sure her children are well fed and are wearing clean, new clothing before she even considers anything for herself. My mum often had to take her shopping just for clothes for her. We were proud of Joanne. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joanne and Gareth eventually split up. He&amp;#39;s been hitting her. He&amp;#39;s been horrid to their children. She kicks him out, and he spends over a year trying to make her life hell. But Joanne doesn&amp;#39;t care, she&amp;#39;s moved on to Danny, the son of my mum&amp;#39;s old best friend. Danny and Jo were inseparable as kids until my mum moved in with my dad, which is when their friendship ended. When she saw Danny again, Jo fell instantly in love. We were happy for her. Her kids started calling Danny &amp;#39;dad&amp;#39;, and we saw a lot of similarities within her story to my mum&amp;#39;s, so my mum thought everything would be fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 years into the relationship, Joanne breaks down and announces she&amp;#39;s addicted to Cocaine, and it&amp;#39;s Danny&amp;#39;s fault. What&amp;#39;s worse, in order to get drugs when she had no money, Jo fucked the dealer behind Danny&amp;#39;s back. The dealer now was obsessed with Joanne, and was threatening to kill her and her entire family if she didn&amp;#39;t be with him. My parents sort everything out. Joanne gets cleaned up, Danny takes her back, and she vows never to do drugs again. We believe her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next 2 years, everyone in the family got sick of Joanne&amp;#39;s constant mood swings. One minute, she&amp;#39;d be excitedly yelling about her holiday plans, the next she&amp;#39;d be screaming at my mum for not caring about her. She became an alcoholic, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which became her excuse whenever people called her out for her shitty attitude. We asked her if she was still on cocaine, but she promised she wasn&amp;#39;t. So did Danny.  But the kids started looking different. Their clothes weren&amp;#39;t so clean anymore, and they were often starving when they came to visit. Ruby&amp;#39;s hair wasn&amp;#39;t brushed often, either, and she&amp;#39;d often ask my mum to do it for her. We knew something was up, but if we even suggested it Joanne wouldn&amp;#39;t let my mum see the kids for weeks on end, which hurt her so much. Joanne&amp;#39;s mood swings were the butt of all jokes, and me and Ryan referred to having a meltdown as &amp;quot;doing a Jo&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On December 1st, 2016, my family was pretty much destroyed. Ryan died very, very suddenly. His body wasn&amp;#39;t found until the day after. He&amp;#39;d followed me to my university, and I was ecstatic. But Ryan had diabetes, and didn&amp;#39;t keep up with his medication. He died alone, and I will never stop hurting for that. Sarah found his body after not hearing from him for 24 hours, and she&amp;#39;d travelled to check on him. She won&amp;#39;t ever recover from this. Neither will my mum. Neither will I. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night we found out, Kevin travelled 3 hours to be with us. Joanne came over and instantly started drinking. I cuddled Anthony, who is 13 by this point, as we cried. He&amp;#39;d lost another cousin that summer to leukaemia, and it was horrible seeing all his tears. Ruby, at 7 years old, didn&amp;#39;t really understand. Jo stood in front of us all and announced that no one should argue anymore. We agreed, letting it slide that most arguments in the family were caused by her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t have Ryan&amp;#39;s funeral until the 29th of December. The whole family pulled together, and my extended family is quite large. My dad, Sarah&amp;#39;s husband, ryan&amp;#39;s younger brothers, and my uncle John carried Ryan&amp;#39;s coffin. Me, Sarah, and Ryan&amp;#39;s youngest brother picked out songs, and I helped everyone write eulogies, including one for myself. I was the only one who could stand up and actually speak, though. I wanted to make our Riggy proud. I also served as mediator between sarah and the university. Everything I did was to help Sarah, none of it was for me except for my eulogy. Kevin resigned himself to collecting photographs of Ryan and restoring them. But Joanne? Joanne didn&amp;#39;t do anything, and then threw a tantrum 2 days before the funeral because she wasn&amp;#39;t given anything to do. She was treating his funeral like a game. She wanted to be involved. She yelled at Sarah, called my mum a bitch, and announced she wasn&amp;#39;t going to the funeral because she felt unwanted. She gave in, and drove me and my boyfriend in the funeral procession. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the way there, turned to me and snapped &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t cry when you&amp;#39;re reading, Natasha. You&amp;#39;ll fuck it up.&amp;quot; I started to truly hate my sister then. She didn&amp;#39;t care what anyone else was feeling except for her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the following months, things got worse. My 21st birthday was awful. It was my first birthday without my best friend by my side. Joanne showed up drunk, and embarrassed the entire family, and made people so uncomfortable they left. She made a hard day infinitely harder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last month, she had another breakdown. She announced that Danny was making her do cocaine. My parents were livid, I was heartbroken. Joanne left Danny. But only for a night. The next day she was screaming and begging for Danny to come back, and it turned out Danny wasn&amp;#39;t making her do drugs, she&amp;#39;d been going off and doing it with friends during &amp;quot;lunch dates&amp;quot;, and occasionally doing so with Danny. My parents go apeshit. They tell her she could get her kids taken away from her, and all she says is &amp;quot;So?&amp;quot;. She proceeded to only list Danny, holidays, and cocaine on the list of things she wants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s where my confession starts. From that moment, I began wishing she had died instead of Ryan. That he deserves to be alive but she doesn&amp;#39;t. Her kids would be better off without her, the family would be better off without her. I thought it was just grief talking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But things started to get worse. She wouldn&amp;#39;t let anyone in the family see Anthony or Ruby, including my mum. This was awful for her. She just lost one grandchild, and now she was having 2 more taken away from her. Then Joanne said she thought Sarah wasn&amp;#39;t really arsed about the death of her son, because Sarah would post about the dogs and the other kids as well as posting stuff about Ryan. Joanne acted like sarah didn&amp;#39;t care about her dead son, and that is why I now just wish she was dead. I wish she fucking tried to kill herself again and she succeeded. I wish she accidentally OD&amp;#39;d on cocaine, or that she drunk drove her car into a tree whilst driving alone. Anything so that she could stop being a toxic human being. Our family has been through too much, and she&amp;#39;s making the pain greater and more drawn out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m justified or not in wishing I didn&amp;#39;t have to deal with my sister anymore. I don&amp;#39;t know if I should feel remorse or not. I don&amp;#39;t know if it is still the grief talking. I just can&amp;#39;t believe that Joanne, the sister who taught me to drive, who would go hungry so her kids looked nice, who was such a good mum for 10 years, is gone. Now there&amp;#39;s a spiteful cunt in her place, and I want it gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: my sister has continued to emotionally torture the family, announced she doesn&amp;#39;t care what happens to her children and made life harder in the months following my 20 year old nephew&amp;#39;s death and I wish she was dead instead. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Before I get into the confession, here's some information about my family tree so you understand: my mother and father were both married before they got together.
