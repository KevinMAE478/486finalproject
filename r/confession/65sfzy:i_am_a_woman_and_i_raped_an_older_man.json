We met while I was on my year abroad in the USA and I have never felt so strongly about anybody. He was a masters student and we met at a house party. I was consumed by him; I spent every waking hour thinking about when I would next see him, and we had a very intense 3 months together -- an intense 3 months that was arguably the most memorable romantic experience of my adult life, despite several lasting long term relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We broke up as he was moving away, and I spent few months mourning and finding excuses to text him. He got back with his ex, who was only 23 herself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But four months after I saw him last, he comes back to visit town. I bump into him at a house party and we talk and it&amp;#39;s good, but not like it used to be. He&amp;#39;s distant, colder. He&amp;#39;s not available any more, and he&amp;#39;s obviously not as interested in me now.\nHis friend Max is at the party and takes a shine to me. I brush him off, interested only in Jesse. I crash out at the party and wake up to find Max&amp;#39;s fingers plunged into me like a fish hook, his body coiled around my back, and I scream and run to the bathroom. I tell Jesse about it the next day and he&amp;#39;s freaked out.

I know I was drunk, but he was really drunk. I&amp;#39;m no better than Max, in some ways. \nAside from a couple of phonecalls and a few pleasantries, we never spoke to or saw one another after that night.
