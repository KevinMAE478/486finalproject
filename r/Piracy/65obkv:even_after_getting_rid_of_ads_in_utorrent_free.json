Anyone who has 'debugged' a relative's PC will understand how easily this happens.\n\n\n\n&gt;The problem is that many of the checkboxes in uTorrent\u2019s installation wizard are selected by default, which means spamming the \u2018Next\u2019 button will result in potentially unwanted software installations.\n\n\n\n&gt;Moreover, Epic Scale didn\u2019t actually have a checkbox.

And even if it's not designed as such, it is needlessly confusing.\n\n\n\n&gt;It must be said, however, that many companies employ these methods, and not just for software. Many of you will recount times you accidentally signed up for an automated e-mail newsletter, a browser toolbar, or an added surcharge for an online purchase. However, the mix of check boxes and Accept/Decline buttons on our build of uTorrent just adds to the confusion.\n\n\n\n&gt;**The Ugly**\n\n\n\n&gt;The ugly aspect of this is that installing Epic Scale is very different to signing up to a newsletter, and here\u2019s why.\n\n\n\n&gt;Unlike toolbars and newsletters, Epic Scale isn\u2019t a tangible addition to your cyber-life. If you accidentally installed it, you likely would never notice.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;This is because Epic Scale runs in the background, only interacting with your processor.

Unnecessarily ugly. *Obviously* ugly in ways that are simple to fix, yet isn't. Not even after multiple updates.\n\nAnd it's often awkward.

He (it's usually a \"he\") doesn't give a shit that a simple tweak can make your life significantly easier, or his software significantly more usable. He's not deriving any income from it, so he doesn't give enough of a shit, as long as it works for *him*. Any complaint about the software is usually rebutted with \"fix it yourself\" or \"be grateful you have anything\".\n\nI love open source software, because I ***trust*** it, because I *can* trust it. For me trust is the most important thing software can have. This means I end up *tolerating* shitty interfaces or crappy usability simply so I can sleep peacefully at night.\n\nI run my own mail server (postfix/dovecot), cloud server (ownCloud), I even replaced the OS on my phone (with Cyanogenmod - I haven't yet upgraded to LineageOS) because of all the ways google monitors all aspects of life. My security is important to me.\n\nI trust qBittorrent (and recommend you switch to it as well), but I still remember that \"erk\" feeling I got when I first switched to qBittorent from uTorrent.

Open source is much better now than it was 20 years ago, but it still can't match closed source.\n\nFor example, the Mozilla Suite (which eventually evolved into Seamonkey, Firefox, and Thunderbird) was completely unusable until version 1.2, and I couldn't stand using it daily until version 1.5. And even then, anybody who saw me using it would exclaim how hideous it was and \"why are you using *that*?!\"\n\nEven today, LibreOffice is completely unusable to me. I'd sooner pirate or pay for MS Office than suffer the indignity of using LibreOffice again.

I completely understand, and it's not a lame reason for not using it.\n\nBut I believe qBittorrent is worth tolerating the initial \"erk\". It actually grows on you, now I can't imagine using anything else.

Closed freeware like uTorrent, however, make their money from advertising, bundling third party software, or installing shitware like bitcoin miners.\n\nWhile you can turn off all that advertising shit and avoid (obviously) bundled apps, you simply don't know exactly when uTorrent will choose to silently install performance killing shitware again. And you can't trust that you'll hear about if they do, because most technically minded people stopped using it the last time they chose to fuck over their users.\n\nFor all you know, uTorrent 3.4.9 is just fine, and won't silently install malware on your machine.
