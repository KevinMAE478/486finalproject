I have read through posts explaining how to pirate adobe products and think I understand how to do it though there are a few questions I need clarification on, any help would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I know I install the app from adobe&amp;#39;s website and use a crack (I have downloaded a file called amtlib.dll via a link someone posted in a previous thread) to allow me to use it for free. I am now ready to download after effects from the adobe website and it is asking me for a login so I understand I must register on the website. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where my question comes in. I previously downloaded premiere pro cc from pirate bay and installed the programme using a crack but without having to set up an adobe ID. Now that I want to install after effects I am required to create one. Will creating one now in any way affect the use of my copy of premiere pro? I am worried that I will get after effects up and running and be blocked out of premiere pro. Or blocked out of both. I don&amp;#39;t really get what to do with my adobe ID once I&amp;#39;ve created it, will I be logging into my programmes with it or is it simply required to enable me to download apps from their site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading this if you have made it this far and any help would be appreciated.
