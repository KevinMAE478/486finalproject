Water season, castaways with a loved one still in the game are a much bigger target, and they have the advantage of having someone they care about as close, while San Juan Del Sur proved that not having that loved one was a huge advantage because you weren&amp;#39;t perceived as having anyone who was by default on your side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His strategic abilities are more than enough to get him through this game, but it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how this all plays out.
