It won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, which is as strong critical acclaim within the genre as any Fantasy gets. It&amp;#39;s the author&amp;#39;s best-selling and most widely read work, and has the same average rating on Goodreads as his general body of work (4.11 on American Gods vs 4.13 across 1,069 distinct works).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course there are vocal critics of literally every book, and contrarian opinions thrive here on reddit, but American Gods was an immediate success that is still well-regarded 16 years after its publication. In fact, on &lt;a href=\"/r/books\"&gt;/r/books&lt;/a&gt; (which is a constant mess of gripes) American Gods clocks in as the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_fantasy\"&gt;6th most recommended Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, after Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, His Dark Materials, A Song of Ice and Fire, and The Hobbit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgcubwp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492418496.0, "created_utc": 1492389696.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbvvt8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrCaul", "parent_id": "t3_65nz6w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The reactions to the book I've seen or heard seems very mixed, so it'll be interesting if the reaction to the show will be the same or if they have a hit on their hand.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reactions to the book I&amp;#39;ve seen or heard seems very mixed, so it&amp;#39;ll be interesting if the reaction to the show will be the same or if they have a hit on their hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgbvvt8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492364243.0, "created_utc": 1492335443.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nz6w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nz6w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nz6w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcqcj9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stevemacdev", "parent_id": "t1_dgcjx8z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Perfect thanks!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgcqcj9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492413094.0, "created_utc": 1492384294.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcjx8z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigmethod", "parent_id": "t1_dgceifa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "April 30th", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 30th&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgcjx8z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404497.0, "created_utc": 1492375697.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgceifa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stevemacdev", "parent_id": "t3_65nz6w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's the release date?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the release date?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgceifa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492397446.0, "created_utc": 1492368646.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nz6w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdcdas", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "psykobyte", "parent_id": "t3_65nz6w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never read the book but I'm just so hyped for this show.
