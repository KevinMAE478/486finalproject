Why are certain characters like Zach, Jessica and Alex worried throughout the series about what happens if they are caught when all they did can be considered bullying and nothing more? Hannah mentions Zach threw away her letter but we later find out that it wasn't the case and it gets explained by it being \"her truth\". What else is \"her truth\"?

Hell, the guy who plays Zach is actually 26. Whilst I understand it can be difficult to cast actual teenagers in these time consuming roles, it feels like they just didn't care enough to hunt for youthful looking actors and instead went down the road of 'Napolian Dynamite'.\"\n\n- Pretty much every show in hollywood casts high schoolers from a pool of 20+ year olds.\n\n\"Clay keeps bitching constantly to Tony about \"what's on his tape\", so why doesn't he just LISTEN TO HIS FUCKING TAPE!? Nothing's stopping him from skipping ahead. The main character keeps making assumptions based on only what he's heard instead of listening to every tape like most people are telling him to. It's retarded and the pacing in which it handles makes a 13-episode series feel like it could have wrapped itself up in 6. If you're done playing by the rules Clay, then why are you still playing by the rules? There's no gun to your head, just listen to your tape.\"\n\n- It was out of respect for Hannah. He wanted to do it how she wanted with the tapes, he didn't want to skip. It's hard to hear, but it needed to be heard. People deal with things in their own way, and he was the one person who truly loved her. So he wanted to hear how bad everything got, but couldn't handle it, needed a push to handle it.\n\n\"The show forgot about the very important map Hannah left by episode 4.\"\n\n- It didn't, how do you think he kept showing up to all these places she talked about? They just stopped having her give a location on the map. It was on the tape, just not something we heard every episode.\n\n\"What's the deal with these types of shows teaching young people how to misuse 911? You don't dial emergency response to knocking over a stop sign or indeed to report said crime weeks later. All those gunshot and robbery victims will have to wait, we've got minor property damage to deal with! Do directors not know about the non-emergency hotline or do they just not care?\"\n\n- I don't think a lot of kids know what to do. So it's actually very real, and 911 could direct them to the correct number. Sure, it would be nice to distinguish between the two. It got the message across of trying to do the right thing.\n\n\n\"Just when I feel like they're getting serious on a point or a scene turns dark, it springs back into an episode of \"Heartbreak High\". Whist this did kind of happen in the last few episodes, there were so many chances to really hit home\"\n\n- Was Hannah's rape scene not \"hitting home\"? The way she just gave up was brutal to watch. The last few episodes got pretty dark at some points, the suicide scene was dark. Idk how those scenes weren't hitting home.\n\n\nOf course shows are never going to feel like an exact copy of real life, but it definitely portrayed the message it wanted to give very well imo.

She knew what she was doing, so she played it out over and over in her head. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every single &amp;quot;highschool&amp;quot; character in the show is played by an actor who&amp;#39;s minimum 20 years of age, and it shows. Hell, the guy who plays Zach is actually 26. Whilst I understand it can be difficult to cast actual teenagers in these time consuming roles, it feels like they just didn&amp;#39;t care enough to hunt for youthful looking actors and instead went down the road of &amp;#39;Napolian Dynamite&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pretty much every show in hollywood casts high schoolers from a pool of 20+ year olds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Clay keeps bitching constantly to Tony about &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s on his tape&amp;quot;, so why doesn&amp;#39;t he just LISTEN TO HIS FUCKING TAPE!? Nothing&amp;#39;s stopping him from skipping ahead. The main character keeps making assumptions based on only what he&amp;#39;s heard instead of listening to every tape like most people are telling him to. It&amp;#39;s retarded and the pacing in which it handles makes a 13-episode series feel like it could have wrapped itself up in 6. If you&amp;#39;re done playing by the rules Clay, then why are you still playing by the rules? There&amp;#39;s no gun to your head, just listen to your tape.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It was out of respect for Hannah. He wanted to do it how she wanted with the tapes, he didn&amp;#39;t want to skip. It&amp;#39;s hard to hear, but it needed to be heard. People deal with things in their own way, and he was the one person who truly loved her. So he wanted to hear how bad everything got, but couldn&amp;#39;t handle it, needed a push to handle it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The show forgot about the very important map Hannah left by episode 4.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t, how do you think he kept showing up to all these places she talked about? They just stopped having her give a location on the map. It was on the tape, just not something we heard every episode.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the deal with these types of shows teaching young people how to misuse 911? You don&amp;#39;t dial emergency response to knocking over a stop sign or indeed to report said crime weeks later. All those gunshot and robbery victims will have to wait, we&amp;#39;ve got minor property damage to deal with! Do directors not know about the non-emergency hotline or do they just not care?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think a lot of kids know what to do. So it&amp;#39;s actually very real, and 911 could direct them to the correct number. Sure, it would be nice to distinguish between the two. It got the message across of trying to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just when I feel like they&amp;#39;re getting serious on a point or a scene turns dark, it springs back into an episode of &amp;quot;Heartbreak High&amp;quot;. Whist this did kind of happen in the last few episodes, there were so many chances to really hit home&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Was Hannah&amp;#39;s rape scene not &amp;quot;hitting home&amp;quot;? The way she just gave up was brutal to watch. The last few episodes got pretty dark at some points, the suicide scene was dark. Idk how those scenes weren&amp;#39;t hitting home.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course shows are never going to feel like an exact copy of real life, but it definitely portrayed the message it wanted to give very well imo. Easing up on nitpicking every detail will make the show a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgdsrcb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478862.0, "created_utc": 1492450062.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vs63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vs63", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdt233", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BetterThanOP", "parent_id": "t1_dgdntkt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's probably fair, and relatively common for reddit and other hiveminds to dislike something because of its fanbase rather than for the actual product.

Everything is super unrealistic how people just end up in the right place at the right time while listening to the tapes. My biggest complaint is probably how long it is taking Clay to listen to the tapes, like I&amp;#39;d want to listen to those as fast as possible.
