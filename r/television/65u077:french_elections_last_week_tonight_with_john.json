I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s really possible to cast Bernie Sanders in an &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; light (lord knows they would try) the way you could Trump, Hillary, or even Obama, Romney or McCain.    Everyone knows he&amp;#39;s a pretty ok guy, they would actually have to attack his policies and knowing the American public&amp;#39;s view of &amp;quot;Socialism&amp;quot; it would be all too easy, especially when much of the voting population still has memories of the cold war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard theorizing that &amp;quot;Bernie would have beaten Trump&amp;quot; etc.  But to be honest, (and it&amp;#39;s just a gut feeling), I fear he would lost pretty much the same vs Trump... and possibly Goldwater&amp;#39;d vs a regular opponent.   Heck, his best voting group was the youth, who have terrible turnout and he did poorly among minorities vs Hillary (a MUST for any Democrat).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgdj0eb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467394.0, "created_utc": 1492438594.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdino6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 126, "report_reasons": null, "author": "krdaito", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfzpx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a feeling if Sanders had won the nomination, your right-leaning friends would have been comparing Clinton favorably to that \"godless socialist\".", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling if Sanders had won the nomination, your right-leaning friends would have been comparing Clinton favorably to that &amp;quot;godless socialist&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dgdino6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492466907.0, "created_utc": 1492438107.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 126}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u077", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdq3v1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rogue100", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfzpx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hillary was the front runner, and had been in the crosshairs of the right for decades while most were only just learning who Sanders was after the primary season had been underway for awhile, and well after any realistic chance for him to win the nomination had slipped away.
