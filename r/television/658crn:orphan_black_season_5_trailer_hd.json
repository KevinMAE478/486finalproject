She is a major component to making Tatiana believable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I could cry thinking about her,&amp;quot; Maslany said of Alexandre, her Orphan Black clone double, during a Screen Actors Guild Foundation interview. &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s so amazing. She memorizes all of the lines, all of my blocking, all of her blocking, my mannerisms, my impulses; she, somehow, memorizes all of that and gives it back to me with a performance I can play off of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logistically, Alexandre acts opposite Maslany any time two or more of the clones interact \u2014 which is quite frequently \u2014 and delivers a screen-worthy performance before being replaced during post-production. While many actors would balk at the seemingly thankless job, Alexandre considers it the role of a lifetime.\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/meet-the-woman-beisdes-tatiana-maslany-who-plays-every-singl?utm_term=.fhyaM8P5V#.vsrVRGmJ5\"&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/meet-the-woman-beisdes-tatiana-maslany-who-plays-every-singl?utm_term=.fhyaM8P5V#.vsrVRGmJ5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dg95za6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207504.0, "created_utc": 1492178704.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658crn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8sy9x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PotentNerdRage", "parent_id": "t1_dg8kdgq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I mean, I liked season 1 well enough, but the plot basically went full retard from season 2 onward.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I liked season 1 well enough, but the plot basically went full retard from season 2 onward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "television", "name": "t1_dg8sy9x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492175986.0, "created_utc": 1492147186.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658crn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658crn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8x7te", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shedcape", "parent_id": "t1_dg8wstg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/television", "controversiality": 0, "body": "All of the female clones are played by Tatiana Maslany.
