I'm hoping we won't see that kind of scenes in the series anymore, because he's closed off that part of his life. I can't remember when he says it (one of the comics or the movies) when he goes 'Frank Castle died with his family'. \n\nHe doesn't see himself as Castle anymore, now he's just a figure that punishes evil. His motivation is still based on what happened to his family, but he removed all of that out of his life (as the final scene at his house makes clear).\n\nThe 'real' Punisher is not full of doubt, talking about his family, excusing himself for his actions. He isn't looking for human interaction, or a woman to understand him. He just wants to put as many murderers/rapists/traffickers/etc. in the ground as he can.\n\nIf you're worried that can't be interesting to watch, I would recommend reading Garth Ennis' Punisher MAX run. He takes the concept and runs with it.
