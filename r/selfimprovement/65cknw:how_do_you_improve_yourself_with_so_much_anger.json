To be human is to experience every emotion. Being angry is different from acting on anger.

It's compensation for feeling hurt and that you were trampled on by people you cared about. You were taken advantage of.\n\nI've been there. What helps me keep anger at bay is developing and asserting healthy boundaries. The key here is to address breaches of boundaries as soon as they happen. Developing respect for yourself means being honest with everyone - whether it's a potential employer, a woman you want to impress, or a new friend you want to build a relationship with. You tell them all the same thing when they step over the line. \n\nA simple \"Hey, I know you didn't mean to single me out/say something hurtful/ignore my message but it hurt me, and I didn't appreciate it.\" Say it like it casually, like you were giving someone directions. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \n\nThink about what you're willing to accept and what's nonnegotiable for you.\n\nI'd read up on ego states. As children, we form neural networks that guide our thoughts and behaviors. When the Child ego state is activated, we act like the children we once were.\n\nWe can also enter Parent state, which is the internalization of the way our parents raised us and how we experienced it. If your parents belittled and mocked you for doing something wrong, you'd likely do the same when you get into this mode. Let's say you have a subordinate that fucks up or doesn't follow your exact orders. It'll throw you into a vengeful mindset where you'll want to unleash your wrath against their betrayal.\n\nThe Adult state is rational and objective. You think things through and see them for what they are.\n\nThese are all subconscious mechanisms. I doubt you wake up and decide \"Okay, I'm gonna fuck everyone's shit up today.\" The fact you want to improve this aspect of your life proves it.\n\nIt's great that you're aware of the excessive anger you're both feeling and acting on. Unfortunately, a feature of the brain is that the rational neocortex is far away from the amygdala. We respond to situations by feeling emotions before our reason kicks in. Good news is you can overcome it.\n\nChances are there is a pivotal experience from your childhood, whether it was friends, parents or teachers that you were afraid to disappoint. That's a vulnerability you have, and people figure it out and use it to get what they want from you. You felt bad when you let someone down, even if you couldn't or didn't want to do whatever the other party was expecting.\n\nYou're going to calibrate and tone down the aggression gradually until you reach a point where you're assertive about your values and boundaries while still sacrificing yourself for the people and situations you care about.\n\nIf you can afford it, therapy is probably the best way to facilitate the process. Don't go to a psychotherapist though; your dog walker can be a psychotherapist. Get a real psychologist.\n\nMeditation can help with learning let go of anger.\n\nWhat worked best for me was writing it out. I opened a document and wrote to my younger selves. Starting from my earliest memories, I wrote about painful experiences and gave my younger self the grown up advice he needed to hear. Don't hold back. Let everything out. You'll reach a point where it'll pour out, and you'll have 10,000 words of pent up anger finally expressed. Then forgive yourself and forgive others. \n\nThis works because the anger is coming from a place of hurt from your *past*. Maybe you blame yourself for being a wimp and not standing up for yourself. Maybe you feel guilty about being afraid to say \"no\". When you write out the situation, your feelings about it, what it really meant - your adult reason gets activated, and it hits you that there's no reason to feel angry about the past. \n\nLook at them as lessons and learn from them. Laugh at how dumb you acted in a situation or how embarrassed you were in another. Acceptance is the only way to move on. Accept that you're angry, pause for a moment before reacting, think about where the anger is coming from, and decide whether it's something to be angry about.\n\nI think you have a journey ahead of you to start loving yourself.
