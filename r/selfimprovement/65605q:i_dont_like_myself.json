I was in a similar situation (and mindset) as you and am slowly but surely getting out of it.\n\nOne thing that has helped me tremendously are some bits of advice from Mark Manson.\n\nOne point he makes in his book *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck* is what he called the \"backwards law\". It basically says the more you chase something, the further it gets from you.\n\nSay you don't have many friends and want to make more. You might say to yourself, \"I wish I was a cool and charismatic person who was comfortable around everyone I met. It'd be so much easier to make friends.\"\n\nThe problem with this method of thinking is that you're focusing on what you lack, so you're reinforcing the negative idea of not having friends.\n\nA MUCH better solution is to change the value from \"I want to be cool and liked by everybody\" to \"I want to be OK with not being liked by everybody\".\n\nThat's something you can control. And surely enough, when you're OK with the NOTs of things (Not being super attractive; not always being funny, etc), you often end up excelling in those areas. It's bizarre, but it's true.\n\n*\"I want to be OK with NOT...\"* is the formula\n\n**The biggest problem is that my happiness and well-being is totally centered on this other person, and I know it shouldn't be.**\n\nMark has an article called \"LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH\" that I think you should read. (I had a link here but didn't realize links were prohibited in this sub)\n\nAnyways, going back to the anxiety, Mark has a course in his \"premium\" subscription (which is only $4 / month) about anxiety. In total, it's about an hour and I've only watched it once, but it's helped me tremendously already. I imagine it'll help more and more the more I watch it. I'd definitely recommend you check that out to help with any anxiety issues and just to improve your perception about things.\n\nAll the best!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey man. I was in a similar situation (and mindset) as you and am slowly but surely getting out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that has helped me tremendously are some bits of advice from Mark Manson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One point he makes in his book &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck&lt;/em&gt; is what he called the &amp;quot;backwards law&amp;quot;. It basically says the more you chase something, the further it gets from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say you don&amp;#39;t have many friends and want to make more. You might say to yourself, &amp;quot;I wish I was a cool and charismatic person who was comfortable around everyone I met. It&amp;#39;d be so much easier to make friends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with this method of thinking is that you&amp;#39;re focusing on what you lack, so you&amp;#39;re reinforcing the negative idea of not having friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A MUCH better solution is to change the value from &amp;quot;I want to be cool and liked by everybody&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I want to be OK with not being liked by everybody&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s something you can control. And surely enough, when you&amp;#39;re OK with the NOTs of things (Not being super attractive; not always being funny, etc), you often end up excelling in those areas.
