I used to be like you and can now give you a whole year of self-improvement experience summed up:\n\n* Right now, think about who you are and what your values are. Since you said you don't really know who you are, you can also make up some values. For example, what kind of music do you like? You seem to be one of these people that like \"all kinds of music\". Explore which kinds of music you really like, without considering if anybody would ridicule or like you more because of you liking a certain genre. How important is honesty for you? When meeting a stranger, do you assume the worst about him until he has proved himself, or do you assume he is a great person until he shows otherwise? Is it okay to talk about other people behind their back? If yes, is it only okay criticize them, or is it also okay to insult them? I hope these examples help you understand what I mean by \"find out who you are\". You just need to find rules, values and boundaries for yourself, and **then stick to them**. It might help to write your thoughts down.\n\n* Learn to love yourself. Every morning, take two minutes to think about stuff you like about yourself. I also have an exercise that will help you right now, right here, as you're reading this. Close your eyes, cross your legs (ankle over knee if you are male), put your hands behind your head and in your mind repeat the sentence \"I love myself\" over and over and over. Think about the sentence. If your thoughts turn to other things, gently return them to the sentence. You love yourself. I am aware of the fact that this sounds stupid as hell, but since a stranger on the internet took the time to write such a long text for you, do him the favour of at least trying it out.\n\n* Whenever you find yourself wondering what a person thinks about you, what you can do or say to make people like you etc., just consciously stop thinking about it. I know that it is much harder than it sounds to not think about something so I have invented a trick for this: examine your environment so precisely that there is no more place for any other thoughts to arise. This also helps to avoid any kind of negative thought. Negative thoughts are never good.\n\n* Say what you think, not what will make other people like you. Of course, there are certain exceptions to this.\n\n* Find a passion and dedicate your life to it. You might not see the correlation to becoming a true individual and having a great passion, but I am sure that this is the most important step to being YOURSELF. Most of the people who are unindividual validation seekers don't have any great passions, they have small hobbies at the most. All great men of the present and past have (had) passions. Not only does following your great passion help you being yourself, it also has positive aspects on most other aspects of your life. Plus it makes you happy.\n\n* If you want to read the stuff that helped me the most, read the book Psycho-Cybernetics and a blog called Centered Man Project.
