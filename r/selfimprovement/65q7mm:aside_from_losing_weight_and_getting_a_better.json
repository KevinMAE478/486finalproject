Copy paste below:\n\nThere are so many things... but in most environments/cultures men don't bother and the baseline of what's expected has drifted way down. \n\nThis actually offers a *huge* advantage to any guy that wants to give a shit about his appearance. You say that women have an unfair advantage... but women actually have it really shitty. Having your hair done, being well dressed, and having your makeup on is *expected* of women. If you don't do those things as a women people think you look sickly and you don't have your shit together. The bar for personal care is so much lower for men that doing just about anything above the bar makes you look like a god damn super star. \n\nI won't even give you abstract examples, I'll give you examples of things that I personally do that 99% of the men I know don't (and I get mother fucking compliments hand over fist from women for it). \n\n* Take care of your skin. Use good cleansers, use alpha-hydroxy wipes to break down sebaceous filaments (those look-like-tiny-black heads-but-aren't things on your nose and upper cheeks), moisturize, use sun screen so you don't look like an old shoe. /r/SkincareAddiction for more info. \n\n* Groom your eyebrows. For fuck sake everyone *groom your fucking eyebrows*. This doesn't mean waxing them so you look like a drag queen or a damn chola, it means plucking between your eyebrows, plucking lightly under and above them to get rid of those stray freakish hairs. Don't shape your eyebrows, that's feminine. Just clean around the natural shape of your eyebrows so that they look sharp and defined and not like a caterpillar slowly melting into your face. \n\n* Buy clothes in the right size, in a flattering cut, and get your shit tailored. I'm a slender guy. I look ridiculous in your typical fat-guy-American cut dress shirts, like a kid wearing his father's shirt for a bad job interview. You need clothes that fit. Nobody wants to see somebody in a suit that looks like they stole it from their Andrea the Giant size grandfather. \n\n* Have a sense of style. I have a *distinct* style. It isn't about exactly what my style is, it's about having a style, a personal mark. If you showed somebody a photo of me with the head completely blacked out, they'd know it was me. \n\n* Have a scent. Don't wear some bitch ass body spray like a high school boy. Whether your signature scent is the aftershave you use or a cologne doesn't matter. Have a heavier winter scent and a lighter summer scent. Experiment until you find one that works well with your body chemistry.\n\n* Stand up straight. Seriously, this is grandma-level-1 advice, but stand-the-fuck-up-straight. Shoulders back, gaze level, etc. People with good posture and a strong gaze dominant the room. \n\n* Get a good hair cut. Either have a damn good old school barber or go to a salon. I've been getting my hair cut at a salon since I was a teenager. The difference between shitty haircuts and good haircuts is about $200 or so a year. $200 a year is a small price to pay to not look like you were raped by a Flowbee. \n\n* Shave your neck. The *back* of your neck. Don't wait 4 weeks to go back to your barber/stylist to have the carpet that is slowly growing down from your hairline to your shoulders managed. That neck fuzz guys get between haircuts looks awful. A simple pass over the area in the shower once or twice a week will keep it looking neat. \n\n* Take care of your hair. Almost every guy I know just buys whatever shampoo is on sale when they're (also) buying their frat boy body sprays. Don't do that. Buy a quality shampoo and conditioner suited for your hair style. You want compliments on your hair? Good hair cut, good hair products. \n\n* Speaking of hair, know how the hell to manage facial hair. Either you shave it clean (and properly, see /r/wicked_edge) or you trim it right. Unkempt facial hair is hideous. It looks like sprawling pubes devouring your face. I have a beard. I keep my upper cheeks and neck clean shaven. I clip my beard every few days by doing an upward pass through the beard with a #2 guard (1/4\") and then a downward pass with a #1 guard (1/8\"). I get at least a few compliments a week on my beard and they're almost always along the lines of \"I really don't like beards on men, but your beard looks great... what do you do so I can tell my boyfriend/brother/dad/son?\"\n\n* Get a good looking watch. Not necessarily an expensive watch... a good looking watch. Since we're talking office environment, this means no watches that look like you forgot to take them off after coaching a track team, climbing a mountain, or going on a deep sea dive. This also means no watches that are popular among school age boys. You should be wearing a respectable looking and subtle watch that doesn't look like a plastic piece of shit, a piece ripped off a boat's navigational spread, or a god damn hub cap from Pimp my Ride. \n\n* Speaking of the general region of the wrist and hands... take care of your hands and nails. Most guys have disgusting hands. Moisturize your dry ass hands. Clip and properly shape your nails. Clean under your nails. No woman is attracted to a man with filthy hands and a cesspool of smegma and bacteria under his nails. That screams \"he's going to fingerbang me into having a horrible vaginal infection\". Push your cuticles back. If you have heavily ridged nails that make you look like an old coke head, polish them down with a buffer once a week. You'll get really healthy looking nails without looking like you're getting manicures all the time or wearing nail polish. Even if you don't take this section seriously, at minimum: moisturize your hands and clean that shit out from under your nails. \n\n* Enough about your  hands. Take care of your feet. I know, I know. You asked about office apparel. What does taking care of your feet have to do with that? Most men have feet that *fucking stink*. Most men also don't take *care* of their feet... so they stink. You need to exfoliate your feet. Keep a pumice stone or similar tool in the shower. Use it to rub the dead skin off your feet a few times a week (or every shower, really). You'll be absolutely revolted at how much dead skin comes off. That's what the bacteria eat. Your shitty ass dead-skin-covered feet are like an Old Country Buffet for bacteria. The more you exfoliate and clean your feet, the less nasty they'll be. Don't be the guy in the meeting that's smelling the joint up. \n\n* On the topic of feet and smelling the joint up... learn how to properly take care of your shoes. Don't wear the same pair of dress shoes to work every day until they disintegrate. They'll smell. They'll never air out properly. The leather will suffer. Buy a few pairs. Rotated them. Let them breath. Polish them. Put cedar trees in them to keep them smelling fresh. You might not give a shit about shoes, but other people notice. \n\nNow... that all seems like a lot. You said you don't have an extra hour before work every day. You don't need an extra hour before work every day. I hardly spend anymore time on my daily grooming than your average guy... I just do it more efficiently. Just get in the habit of taking care of yourself. Switch from a shitty bar of soap to a quality facial cleanser. When you're looking in the mirror while you're brushing your teeth and you notice a stray hair on your brow, pluck it out. When you're in the shower contemplating the universe, scrub the nasty ass callouses off your feet. When you're shopping for clothes, leave it in the store unless it fits and flatters you (or you're willing to pay someone to make it fit and flatter). \n\nAll those little changes add up and suddenly you're dapper as fuck.

I fuss with my hair w/o noticing, and often enough, i'd love to have brushed it real quick before I run up the hall to my Bosses' offices.  There is a big difference between brushed and 'finger-combed'.\n\n* I'm no master at this, but I occasionally do a number of different face/muscle exercises like any other muscle/fat/bone ratio, this one is benefited by regular exercise.  Fine, it's a bunch of eyebrow and ear wiggling, i imagine that most faces 'sit' a little better with good muscle tone underneath.  You won't notice the difference, but if you believe working out is good for you, there's no reason a diligent facial exercise wouldn't benefit the same way.\n\n*  My wife makes a face cream for me that helps with the dry flakes I've recently started to get over the eyebrows.  There's a nice clean look after I'm done with this.\n\n* iron your shirts.  I don't iron all my shirts, and I'll go through phases anyways, but this is huge, even for some of those poly shirts that hang fairly flat normally.  Whether people notice or not, though, I know *I* stand a little straighter and taller for it, because I spent all that damn time ironing I sure as shit don't want to wrinkle things up.  Also:  My best fitting, snazziest styled shirts *require* ironing to be snazzy, so if I'm not ironing, I'm definitely not pimping.  When I am in an ironing phase, I iron 3 shirts a week.  Not enough to be overwhelming and burdensome, plenty enough to be helpful.\n\n* if you wear shoes that ought to be polished, learn how to polish them yourselves.   Some folks are also fastidious about cleaning/whitening their running sneakers, but I don't go that far.\n* Keep a lint roller or two in the car or desk drawer, for when you wear black, or dandruff goes crazy.\n\n\nYou'll note that #4 and #5 aren't about \"*getting a better wardrobe*\", but more about \"Taking care of the wardrobe you have\".    A little bit of personal habit-building can go a long way with some of this stuff.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n**EDIT:**  Revised because I included a link.
