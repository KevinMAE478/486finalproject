Simply put, you should almost never EVER chase money UNLESS you absolutely love money and that is your one true desire that rules above all else. \n\nWith the internet and technology today, there is almost anyway to make a living doing what you love or at least have interest or gain enjoyment in. \n\n&gt; try and find some work in a store or restaurant etc. \n\nWhatever you do, my best advice would be to find work that is remotely connected to what you eventually want to do, be it writing, fashion, or music. That way it will either help you figure out whether that's the thing you really want to go all in on, or cancel it as a possibility, leaving you with the others. (So again, don't just get a job for the sake of it, or at least if you do, don't settle there. Keep looking for somewhere else related to your interests)\n\n&gt; I play guitar and sing, people seem to think I'm pretty good, I get told to audition for the X factor quite often.\n\nDo you enjoy playing though? \n\nI'm guessing most of these people complimenting you don't play or sing themselves. It can be quite easy to seem impressive to anyone that has never trained in an art/craft before. If this is feedback from professionals or teachers though then their feedback has much more weight. How often do you actually play or practice?\n\nWould you be willing to put in hours playing and getting better each day for several years? Have you looked into how Ed Sheeran got successful? \n\nAlso with your written songs you need to show others to get some feedback and actually improve on it. Yeah it sucks being vulnerable and potentially getting 'hurt' but you need to get real critical feedback to improve at anything. Writing something and never showing it to the world is a bit of shame cos no one gets to experience it. \n\n&gt; I watch a lot of men's fashion YouTuber \n\nWould you say you procrastinate on watching these videos the most? What naturally draws your most time and attention away when your procrastinating on things? You should try and follow that because it shows that you clearly enjoy it to some degree and when you have the most fun and joy, things barely feel like work.\n\n&gt; I'd like to get into but I want to start dressing how I actually want to now as opposed to what I see as normal\n\nAim to start working retail at a fashion store then perhaps and start dressing like you want! :)\n\n&gt; I was looking at moving to England and starting a Higher Apprenticeship which is essentially a Apprenticeship but not in a typical trade\n\nThis could definitely be an option too.\n\nHere's a few options from what you've mentioned so far:\n\n* If you think you would be willing to dedicate many hours to getting exceptionally good at singing/guitar. Then you could do that and make your own YouTube channel and covering songs etc. Going on x-factor. From what I can tell though, this isn't something you're actually all that interested in. More so that other peoples opinions or ideas have gotten to you. But then again, if you do like it then go for it, and in the future you could always venture into fashion\n* Writing could be a great avenue for you. Seeing as you read a lot and research a lot, both prerequisites for writing. You can start out as a freelance writer on Upwork.com researching into topics of interest (or writing about what you already know) and get paid for it. At the same time you will get better at your craft of writing. \n* You can then transition or start straight away in writing a men's fashion blog (and potentially pairing it with a youtube channel). You'll need to learn about marketing/business/blogging as well as writing but it seems like you should be fine there as you like to research/learn. \n* Higher apprenticeship in England\n\nSo yeah, it seems like you really dig fashion and you should embrace that. Don't be ashamed of liking it. Do you and BE YOU! It's a great feeling to be liberated from acting like someone else or trying to fit in and be 'normal'.\n\nBest of luck with whatever you choose to do, just know you'll need to work hard and smart but as long as you do those two things you'll eventually get to where you want to go", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;a business degree can get you work anywhere &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let you in on something I (and many, many others) have learned the hard way that is crucial - especially in today&amp;#39;s age! Simply put, you should almost never EVER chase money UNLESS you absolutely love money and that is your one true desire that rules above all else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the internet and technology today, there is almost anyway to make a living doing what you love or at least have interest or gain enjoyment in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;try and find some work in a store or restaurant etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, my best advice would be to find work that is remotely connected to what you eventually want to do, be it writing, fashion, or music. That way it will either help you figure out whether that&amp;#39;s the thing you really want to go all in on, or cancel it as a possibility, leaving you with the others. (So again, don&amp;#39;t just get a job for the sake of it, or at least if you do, don&amp;#39;t settle there. Keep looking for somewhere else related to your interests)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I play guitar and sing, people seem to think I&amp;#39;m pretty good, I get told to audition for the X factor quite often.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you enjoy playing though? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing most of these people complimenting you don&amp;#39;t play or sing themselves. It can be quite easy to seem impressive to anyone that has never trained in an art/craft before. If this is feedback from professionals or teachers though then their feedback has much more weight. How often do you actually play or practice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you be willing to put in hours playing and getting better each day for several years? Have you looked into how Ed Sheeran got successful? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also with your written songs you need to show others to get some feedback and actually improve on it. Yeah it sucks being vulnerable and potentially getting &amp;#39;hurt&amp;#39; but you need to get real critical feedback to improve at anything. Writing something and never showing it to the world is a bit of shame cos no one gets to experience it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I watch a lot of men&amp;#39;s fashion YouTuber &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you say you procrastinate on watching these videos the most? What naturally draws your most time and attention away when your procrastinating on things? You should try and follow that because it shows that you clearly enjoy it to some degree and when you have the most fun and joy, things barely feel like work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to get into but I want to start dressing how I actually want to now as opposed to what I see as normal&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aim to start working retail at a fashion store then perhaps and start dressing like you want! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking at moving to England and starting a Higher Apprenticeship which is essentially a Apprenticeship but not in a typical trade&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could definitely be an option too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a few options from what you&amp;#39;ve mentioned so far:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you think you would be willing to dedicate many hours to getting exceptionally good at singing/guitar. Then you could do that and make your own YouTube channel and covering songs etc. Going on x-factor. From what I can tell though, this isn&amp;#39;t something you&amp;#39;re actually all that interested in. More so that other peoples opinions or ideas have gotten to you. But then again, if you do like it then go for it, and in the future you could always venture into fashion&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing could be a great avenue for you. Seeing as you read a lot and research a lot, both prerequisites for writing. You can start out as a freelance writer on Upwork.com researching into topics of interest (or writing about what you already know) and get paid for it. At the same time you will get better at your craft of writing. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can then transition or start straight away in writing a men&amp;#39;s fashion blog (and potentially pairing it with a youtube channel). You&amp;#39;ll need to learn about marketing/business/blogging as well as writing but it seems like you should be fine there as you like to research/learn. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Higher apprenticeship in England&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it seems like you really dig fashion and you should embrace that.
