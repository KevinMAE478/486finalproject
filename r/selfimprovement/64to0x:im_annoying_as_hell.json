If you looooove to talk, and express yourself, this can be VERY draining for other people, especially those you are close to. \n\n&gt;I always expressed how I felt.\n\nThis is definitely a behavior that many consider to be annoying, because - and I know this sounds harsh - but  ***nobody cares about your feelings.*** This is the kind of thing that's appropriate to talk about to a therapist, or to write in a journal. And a friend will be there once in a while to listen when you are having a rough time - ONCE IN A WHILE. Like during a breakup, or if a family member dies. But day-to-day feelings? Nobody cares. We ALL have feelings every day and we don't talk about them because...well...we ALL have them. It's just insufferable for someone to express their feelings all the time. Now I have to deal with my feelings AND your feelings, and that's not being a friend, that's being really self-absorbed. \n \nSo here are a few things to help with this behavior. \n\n1.   Start a journal. That is where you can write ALL of your feelings, thoughts and ideas. You can do it online and invite others to read it if you want (like in Blogger or Wordpress) but don't be surprised if no one comments. The absolute worst blogs are the ones with subtitles like \"One man's random thoughts...\" or \"This woman's personal journey...\" or \"My life examined...\" or similar. For the same reasons we avoid people who just talk about themselves all the time.  \n\n2.   Set up an appointment with a therapist. That is the appropriate person to discuss real issues with. \n\n3.   Ask people about themselves. \n\n4.   Remove the words \"I\", \"me\", \"my\", and \"mine\" from your vocabulary. \n\n5.   Ask your friend \"You up for talking?\" If he says no, THAT'S OKAY. Say \"Okay, no problem,\" and leave him alone.  \n \nOver time, you'll fall into a better routine and become more empathetic and less focused on yourself. \n \nMy second thought on all of this - even though you might want to dial it back on the talking, you also have to consider the source. A roommate is not the most objective person to judge your character.  He might just be the kind of person who needs more silence. Or maybe he had other issues going on. One of my best friends lived with me for about 6 months, and while he was clean, and polite, and respectful, and quiet, I also wanted to murder him after about 3 months because he was just always THERE and I couldn't get an hour to myself. I realized I am the kind of person who can't really live with other people, and it doesn't matter who that other person is, they will annoy me after a period of time. (My husband travels for work so that's how it works for us.) So maybe go a little easy on yourself and don't take his word too hard.
