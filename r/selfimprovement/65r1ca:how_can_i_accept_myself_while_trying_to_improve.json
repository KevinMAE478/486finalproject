You will see more shit in your life that you should be appreciating and things all around just feel better.\n\nNow the issue is that we do not appreciate ourselves and we tend to fear that doing so will make us look arrogant and self absorbed. This is so far from the case its ~~not even funny~~ scary.\n\nSelf improvement is the shit. You are upgrading yourself. What we need to do here is get vulnerable (yeah I know, this is hard af on its own) and look into why we are trying to improve ourselves. \n\nFor years I unknowingly kept going hard at self improvement because I was never good enough for myself. I did not appreciate myself and it was killing me inside. (this is a driving force behind my addiction) Gratitude is an action word. You do not just say \"I am grateful\" and expect some shit to change.\n\nCheck this out.\n\"I have a million dollars\"\n\nsee; no different.\n\nWhen you are grateful, you show appreciation. Tell someone you appreciate them; Pay forward what the universe has given you. You get what you put in but I did not need to tell you that. We know better than to half ass self improvement right?\n\nWhen I do yoga I am thinking about how I am grateful my body can handle the things I try. An instructor can not push me hard enough (I love when they try) and I get better and better with dealing with the discomfort caused by stretching and fatigue. I had to stop smoking. How can I be grateful for my body functioning well yet at the same time do things to it that are bad for it?\n\nWhen I am driving, I think about how blessed I am to have a car that runs great, with all the amenities I want in it.\n\nLets look a little deeper. My car did not come with most of what I like about it. I did every modification to it myself. I show self gratitude and appreciate that I developed the ability to do all this shit to this car. Its not just appreciating the sound system and how it feels smooth as butter at 6krpm. In my head I am the shit because I made all of this happen.\n\nWhen you eat some food and its really good you tell the person who cooked it that it was really good right?\n\nWhat about the food that you cooked? Are you appreciating yourself for a job well done? Do you appreciate how much better you are getting with every skill you develop and goal you reach.\n\nI am going to guess you are more along the lines of \"If I could just learn this or accomplish that I will be worthy of being accepted.\" The thing about addiction is that you will always want more. You will never be satisfied. I spend years chasing that one good high. It does not exist.\n\nWith this mentality you are looking for validation externally which is just as bad as me shoving bags of heroin up my nose.\n\nAppreciate yourself. Think about what parts of your existence need to be appreciated and start taking actions to appreciate them. You will not see it all at once. It takes time like any other skill. You will start seeing all these things about yourself that you were not appreciating and little by little you will go from putting conditions on what makes you good enough to seeing yourself as a good thing you are making better.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is 4benny2lava0 and I am an addict...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that that is out of the way lets talk about gratitude. See I am an ungrateful piece of shit. In trying not to be that every night when I go to bed before I go to sleep I pull my phone out and make a list of everything I have to be grateful for that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This works the way you get a car and then start seeing more and more of them.
