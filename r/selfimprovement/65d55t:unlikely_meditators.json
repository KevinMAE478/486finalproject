How and why you meditate is entirely up to you. You may meditate for 30 seconds of your day sitting in your office chair, listening to music, or practice by lying on your couch for an hour. You\u2019ll find that there are infinite purposes for meditation, so don\u2019t be stifled by some lousy definition. You can meditate to reduce a little stress and anxiety, become more patient, improve decision making, to be spiritually and universally balanced, or for no direct purpose at all!\nThe most beautiful part of meditation is that it can be practiced anytime, anywhere, so there\u2019s no excuse for you to not be practicing yourself. When you\u2019re done reading this, I challenge you to sit with your eyes closed for a brief 30 seconds and practice a little mediation.

Don\u2019t feel pressured that you have to \u201cthink about nothing\u201d or be totally quiet in your mind. Start by focusing on your breathing.
