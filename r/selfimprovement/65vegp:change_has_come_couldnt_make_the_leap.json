Before, although I have a lot of interests, I had problems to express myself and talk about anything at all. Moreover, I am introverted, so it was hard to determine where the introversion ends and social anxiety begins \u2013 or in other words, where is the thin line between the basic need and natural curiosity that drives you to spend time with others, and putting pressure on yourself because you think you have to keep up the conversation in order to become a good company. The other problem was that I\u2019ve always seen myself as someone who is not very good-looking, and it became a self-confidence issue as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is all behind me!

It was a big shift of mind: I slowly started to get control of everything. The self-consciousness slowly went away; I\u2019ve learnt how to dress well, got in a very good shape and generally gained a lot of attention from the opposite gender; I also learnt recently that I am a source of inspiration for some people around me and that means a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, here is the problem: I love to spend time alone and work towards my goals but it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s good for me anymore. I feel like I am curious about generally everything, I have many hobbies but I&amp;#39;m unable to enjoy longer time with someone because sooner or later an aching, bottomless loneliness kicks in. I think it\u2019s something that is remained from the times I was very insecure and unhappy with who I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve discovered recently that I am craving for someone to be beside me though. To support me, to understand me, who we can rely on and inspire each other. It is a simmering sense of incompleteness, making me feel restless and I know I have to face with this problem. To tell you the truth, I have never been in a relationship before \u2013 I had relationships of course, but something was always in the way to call it official (lately, I see it as unconscious act to protect myself and keep the distance).
