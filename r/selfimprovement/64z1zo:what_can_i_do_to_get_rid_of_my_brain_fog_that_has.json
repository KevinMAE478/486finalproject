I'm cured!\" so they stop taking the medication, and they they are confused as to why the \"cure\" didn't stick. ADHD meds are not like antibiotics where you take them for 2 weeks and they \"cure\" you. Some people are on them for life.

You need Magnesium, Vitamin D (lots of people are REALLY deficient in this), Vitamin E, Vitamin C, B6, B12, Thiamine, Riboflavin (B2) just to name a few. You will not get these from potatoes. Find a vegetable like spinach, kale, broccoli, green beans, asparagus, or the like and get a serving or two EVERY day. Take a multivitamin too, as well as other supplements. Your brain is starving for these nutrients, it can't get what it needs to function. \n\nExercise as much as you can. You can do plenty of exercises at home. You can go for walks, too.
