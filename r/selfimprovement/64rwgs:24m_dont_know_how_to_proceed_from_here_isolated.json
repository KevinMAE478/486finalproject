I ran away from a group of friends that did nothing but getting drunk and using drugs, and dumped my ex gf who was making my life truly miserable.

The shame of being unemployed and still living with my parents, without any friends is holding me back from a lot in life. Also because of being bullied in my childhood, i don&amp;#39;t realy have a high self esteem and experience social anxiety at times, which prevents me from meeting new people, and even from going to the grocery store at the beginning.
