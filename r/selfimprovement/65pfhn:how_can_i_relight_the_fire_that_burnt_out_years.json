It was a game development project. Have you ever had a feeling when you just knew you had to do something, or that it felt like fate was guiding you to this moment in your life? That&amp;#39;s how it felt then. I had no idea what I was in for, but I was incredibly excited about what the future held for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I started from scratch without any development skills other than a &amp;quot;logical mind&amp;quot;. I taught myself everything I needed to know along the way, and I hyper focused on that project for a year until reaching the first major beta release. Every moment of spare time I had I would use to further the project. When I needed to chill for a few hours I&amp;#39;d watch some tv shows or anime, or play a game. I even worked on it during school hours in the classroom, or long into the night. Whenever I was outside or away from home I was always thinking about the next step, what to learn next, my weaknesses and challenges and ways to overcome them, etc. I had absolute clarity on the present situation and the future. I was incredibly driven and creativity and inspiration and motivation was practically on fire for that entire time. It was (and still is) the best time of my life, where I had the most fun ever recorded in my memories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a name for myself in the community, got a lot of fans and people who supported my work without even trying. I say without trying because all I did was release the beta and the fans gathered on their own. I didn&amp;#39;t do any promotion, I don&amp;#39;t have any social skills to do it. I just made a forum post on some site with a download link. I didn&amp;#39;t actually do it for the attention or anything I simply did it for myself, but it was nice to see people appreciated what I did. The fans and how they treated me was even more of a reason to be driven. The 2nd major beta was finished roughly a year later but the game itself was not, there was still about 30% left to complete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then everything changed. I remember it clearly, my fire burned out around the age of 18 practically right after I released that 2nd beta. All I did was tell myself &amp;quot;I got quite far, maybe I&amp;#39;ll take a week off before starting the next bit&amp;quot;. I never got truly back into the swing of it. My fans kept asking me for release dates, I had to keep telling them &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;i dont know&amp;quot;. I could no longer see my future, I lost my absolute clarity on the situation. Everything became hazy, and my drive was basically 0. Every couple of months I&amp;#39;d muster up some motivation to work on the project for a month or a few weeks. I used this time to make the most of it and was able to release another beta, which had about 1-5% of progress compared to the previous ones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then 2 years passed and I&amp;#39;d done nothing, then another 2 years. 8 years later (today) and that project is still left unfinished. Fans are still waiting, and that damn forum post I made back in the day still gets users posting on it. I still get fans tweeting me saying how much they like the game and asking when the next release is. Over the years it&amp;#39;s changed from &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;i dont know&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;maybe never&amp;quot;. There&amp;#39;s been over 10 million downloads of the beta since the last release 6 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the real problem...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, since that day I never got my fire back. I can&amp;#39;t motivate myself to do a single thing for more than 1-3 weeks. My life now is quite a challenge. I run a bunch of projects which bring in enough money for me to survive. I&amp;#39;ve got ideas and plans for another 20+ projects, and the skills needed to make them come alive. If I was able to motivate myself to make them then my future would be secured. You&amp;#39;d have thought that would be enough to motivate me but it&amp;#39;s not. The only thing I&amp;#39;m lacking is the fire to actually get going. To best describe it, even the slightest small thing is hard to get going on. I have a hazy head and everything feels like a big bad boss, even when it&amp;#39;s just a 5-10 min task. Feeling like this makes it even harder to start anything new as that usually takes longer than 5 mins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most puzzling thing is that I really like my work. In fact, all of the things I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to do are things that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I enjoy doing. Both work and leisure. I&amp;#39;m able to hype myself up and get excited for what it would be like after I did something, but it does not go further than that. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking over and over and over about this problem for years. Back in the day when I first started to notice that I slowed down big time, I thought &amp;quot;oh I&amp;#39;m just burned out, i&amp;#39;ll bounce back soon&amp;quot;. I never bounced back, not for more than a few weeks. Even those few week spurts are not how I used to feel, just a shadow of my former self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends and my business partner don&amp;#39;t seem to understand how it feels, as they just call me lazy. They don&amp;#39;t understand why I&amp;#39;m not using my skills to become a millionaire, and I&amp;#39;m with them wondering the same thing. As each day goes by where I got nothing done I get increasingly worried that my life is going to be like this forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got no idea what I need to do to get back my lost flame, and hoping someone has some tips for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; I know what I want to do.
