Never got severely out of shape but it was noticeable how much weight I gained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always told myself I&amp;#39;m going to get serious about my fitness, and about 8 years later, I&amp;#39;m finally doing it. In the last 2 months, I&amp;#39;ve gone to the gym on average of 5-6 times a week, started running, and cleaned up my diet. I&amp;#39;ve lost almost 30 pounds, and while I may not look the way I want in the mirror, positive change is happening and that&amp;#39;s all I need to keep going. It&amp;#39;s never easy, but I&amp;#39;ve started to enjoy it and I&amp;#39;ll say it gets less hard every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck to you man!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg60smh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039763.0, "created_utc": 1492010963.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xoeo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xoeo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg63dxz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Flobro4", "parent_id": "t1_dg62gbh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good luck!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg63dxz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042584.0, "created_utc": 1492013784.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg62gbh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "robetyarg", "parent_id": "t3_64xoeo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep.
