I have dated a lot in recent years. The amount of empowered women who would shout me down when it came time to dump them was almost textbook. They would always resort to shaming tactics, telling me I couldn't handle strong women, or that I was a threatened little boy. It made me laugh in the end.\n\nPersonally, I don't care how qualified you are or what you do for a living. Outside of certain professions e.g. animal testing, really I do not care a damn about your career. But the amount of career bitches hitting up things like tinder and the like with an outward aggression juxtapose against the nice guy's inability to ask a girl out is almost comical.\n\nI have had women ask me specifically what I earned per annum on date one. I have had women cuss me down when I refused to do dinner on the first date - I NEVER do. I have had women try and tell my friends I was a fuckboy when I got sick of her shit and dumped her. That was a fun one. I have had empowered women try and show me up in public with tropes like \"I earn more than my bloke, I take care of him\" like it's some sort of victory parade, making me out to be barely a warehouse worker. It was just an attempt at emasculation. Newsflash, that isn't how you bag a decent man. He's going to stand up for himself; if you're trying to get a good bloke, don't make him stand up for himself AGAINST you especially if you're desire is for him to stand up FOR you. That's called a headfuck.\n\nIt's a bit laughable really. These same women will complain that all men are fuckboys and that they don't grow up. Well, here's the newsflash, you are ALMOST right... But you cannot measure men by womens' standards. That's what happens in schools all across the USA and UK. Boys get judged by female standards. And boom, ADHD, troubled teens and a whole bunch of lost and confused boys but who cares, right? \n\nAs a guy, I can tell you that men do not grow up past 13. You're right! We will still get up to dumb shit, we'll still laugh at bewb jokes and we will still be impressed by explosions. And you can shame that if you want to, but it just makes you a sexist cunt! I could shame you for spending \u00a3100 on shoes, or for liking Justin Bieber, or for a bad hair day. Or you could go the other way, realise that's the case and embrace that in your men. Just because he doesn't grow up past 13 doesn't mean he doesn't mature. Two different things.\n\nI have a girl now I've been six months with and she's amazing. She's not the most qualified out of these empowered womyn, she's not got masses of earning potential, and you know what there were some previous girls with bigger boobs. But she's amazing and seems to just already know all this stuff. She knows I'll go and goof off with my band somewhere, she knows that I'll want to watch the odd horror flick, but when it comes time to painting the house or repairing a doorframe, I'll be right there to do that too. \n\nI think the possibility that she's French means she had a different upbringing to a lot of English and Irish girls in that her expectations that I supplicate to her every whim just isn't there. But there have been a lot of girls that really for the reason of being a \"empowered womyn\" were really barely only worth a hump and dump. In some cases, their empoweredness was a total turn off and I didn't even want to have sex with them.\n\nIn short, if you think you're an empowered womyn, get over yourself. Men aren't impressed with your paycheck, we're far more impressed by your femininity, your sexuality and your attitudes towards us, you're ability to laugh with us, etc. Men are usually looking for their best friend in a girl. You can try and change it from the get go by pathologizing the male sense of self and being from a young age, calling every 5 year old boy that doesn't want to play with my little pony as ADHD and try and medicate the male out, but that's what creates armies of \"nice guys\" that don't understand that women won't want them and eventually turn them into sexist arseholes who end up hating women - but they don't know why.\n\nIt's not \"all womens' fault\" by any means, mind... but when most teachers in the profession are female and when most single parent families are female led and when in most nuclear familiies the man goes to work and the women look after the kids, you only have a single perspective to learn from really! As Tyler Durtden said, we are a nation of men raised by women. \n\nThe nice girl is merely a consequence of most of these things put together. I know a lot of families who promote the hell out of their daughters especially over their sons. I've actually witness workmates who say how much they are pushing and pushing daughter through university and follow up with, \"Oh SON isn't going to go, he'll have to figure that out himself. I doubt he'll bother with A-Levels even!\"... absolutely no support to get ahead at all. Add all that into the mix of the current feel-good-factor of wanting to get more women into XYZ careers or STEM subjects, that's when quotas come into mind and yep more girls are getting socially promoted ahead of boys. \n\nThis to me seems to be a fallacy. I honestly do not understand why we want to push more women in particular career directions ahead of men. Myself and most software developers I know today all started the same way; we self-studied from a young age, made games and applications on computers and took that forward to university. An overwhelming amount of girls I have interviewed for developer roles usually say that they had never programmed a PC until second year of university. That to me says, \"I'm not interested really!\". The person who grew up with a PC and learned to program themselves, that's the one I'm more interested in. Yet the push from HR is \"We need more women\". Why I honest do not know. But more women it is.\n\nSo now we have this weird situation where we have a lot of men who had the male pathologized and medicated out of them and constantly told to be good boys and be kind and don't do anything hostile or aggressive in any way ever. Wear a fucking hat too! And we also have a whole bunch of women working their way up the ranks who are now career bitches and empowered womyn who are earning all the cash.\n\nYou can shout girl power all you like and say how great it is that the boys' club has been torn apart and us women are now in charge. But I hope you can keep a straight face when you drive home at 9pm after having your brains fried over some project that's way past deadline and other empowered womyn are breathing down your ass and oops now things are all responsibile and you can't just fuck it off and go home... and as you open the door, there's your husband in a little flowery apron wearing those horrid yellow cleaning gloves and asking how your day was honey,\n\nThis is the world we're headed for. \n\nEr... yay... girl power?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty accruate.
