Even better, you'll meet people who not only like blue light, but fucking hate yellow light. If you had emitting yellow light forever, you will have never known these people existed. Meeting these people blows up your whole belief structure about how people work.\n\nIf you keep taking risks, and emitting different colors of light, you'll see that there will always exist people who are attracted to your hue, or can at least tolerate it, even if there are less of them in quantity.
