Those aren't reasons not to do everything in your power to mitigate what you can. That's not what being human is about. I know depression well. That voice that tells you not to try because it's pointless. Well it would have been fucking pointless anyways. Life has no purpose. That's freedom, my friend. It feels like the greatest obstacle to happiness but what it means is that no one has placed the burden of purpose on you. You only live within the cage of your physical limitations and what you're willing to strive for. If your answer to the issue is to wonder why you should even try then you've missed the point. \n\nWe **get** to live. That is beautiful. Even when you live with pain everyday, it is beautiful. Even when there is no certain reward for your actions, it is amazing that you can even strive for anything in the first place. Your depression, despair, anxiety? What fascinating things. They are driving forces in both of our lives, but when I consider them all I can think is that while I have been forced to struggle, at least I get the chance to. I didn't have my life wiped away just after birth. I was born here and now. To my parents with my brothers and with this disease. I hate it. I hate my fucking illness. I spite it by living anyways. I often think of how when I die I wont feel so much pain, but for now I relish it. That, for me, is what life feels like and I wont begrudge the fact that I got to live just because my body doesn't work as it should.\n\nIf you hate your circumstances then deciding to let them conquer your aspirations is the opposite of what you should do, hopeless or not. No. Live well, my friend. Have hopes and dreams that burn so brightly that they consume your struggles and blind you from your circumstances. I can't promise you that you will accomplish anything more than if you never tried, but to try at all is to take advantage of a very unique opportunity. Our chance to exist and to have mattered at all. Maybe you only affect one persons life, but that is what it means to change the world. Does that seem small? I don't think so. Joy is such an immense thing. Happiness has no measure. Giving these things to another person or even just having the chance to are the height of being. That goes for those of us born with struggle and those who never had a moment of want. We all relish in our opportunities for joy. Don't forsake life because you get fewer. To have any at all is awe inspiring. Depression tells you otherwise, but depression forces us to lie to ourselves because self hatred keeps us from changing and change, even positive change, is uncomfortable. Anxiety tells us we'll fail before we start. Fuck both of those things. \n\nTry even when failure is assured. It's more than a lot of people ever get, and for the small joys that are inherent to life, all the pain and pointless struggle is beyond worth it. Live, and strive while you live, and then die. For all the things that make life a worthy experience, I beg of you: Do not not perish while you still draw breath. That's what it means to never try. Your friends will suffer to see you wither under the weight of the things you let conquer you. I am your friend today, and I want you to promise me that the next time you see an opportunity to try that you take it. Whoever you are. Whatever your dreams. Whatever your obstacles. Live because you can, and let death be something that takes you by surprise and against your will. Don't let the lies formed by depression and anxiety be the foundation of your experience. Break free and be the person you dream that you can be. Do it or die trying, and I can at least promise that you will not die with regrets. No one ever looks back on life to find that they tried too hard to make something out of their life, whatever they were up against. Have a wonderful day, and if you intend to consider my advice then also have a wonderful life. Send me a message when life gets too big or you can't help but feel small.
