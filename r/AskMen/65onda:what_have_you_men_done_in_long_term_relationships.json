What I say in moments like this is \n&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t get upset at someone for not taking the garbage out when you never asked.&amp;quot; Communication is key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to see from the other side. You could be having a hard time, but your partner could be holding their emotions in to help you out. We all have problems, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to bring them up in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that change never happens over night. It takes weeks of practice to change an old behavior. \nContinue to improve your relationship to your partner by making small changes. If they are offended by something, maybe ease up on it, remember their perspective when defending why you do it. Talk about it and why it has an issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember no one wants to upset the other in a relationship. Trust the words they say, it&amp;#39;s honest &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t have to sound sick when talking to a friend to prove to them you&amp;#39;re sick, you&amp;#39;re just sick and they trust.&amp;quot; Same applies to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your partner never will &amp;quot;out of nowhere&amp;quot; blow up and become upset. Maybe you missed something and they never spoke up about it &amp;quot;remember the garbage thing I said&amp;quot; It always comes from somewhere, maybe not even from you but from another outside source. When this happens remember, no one is out to hurt their loved ones, just poor communication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love one another, open up lanes to talk about anything. Bring up issues within yourself, maybe your partner can help and support you in a time of need. Don&amp;#39;t be scared, be in love and express yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell yourself that you&amp;#39;ll work as hard for your loved one as your job or career. Reach that position you want and know the road is hard but you&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love you all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgcbcmq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393227.0, "created_utc": 1492364427.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onda", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgccdn0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drinkthebleach", "parent_id": "t3_65onda", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A whole lot of talking about uncomfortable stuff.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whole lot of talking about uncomfortable stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgccdn0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492394572.0, "created_utc": 1492365772.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onda", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgce48w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sterlina", "parent_id": "t3_65onda", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "10 years here.
