So I thought let&amp;#39;s have a little party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we ended up getting s bunch of four loko and had about 25 people in my house. It was getting rowdy early because none of us knew how to drink without blacking out and puking. So after a few hours everyone is smashed. There is one of my friends up on my balcony and was asking if he should jump down onto the couch, of course our drunk asses were like, &amp;quot;hell yeah, do it!!!&amp;quot; So here we are chanting for him to jump, wasted out of our little 14 year old minds. He jumps... And breaks my family room couch in 2 pieces... So here I am panicking trying to fix the broke couch. I flip it over and give it surgery, putting 10 or so duck tapped books under the couch so it doesn&amp;#39;t sag. It looks horrible but it&amp;#39;ll do, I ended up making up something like, &amp;quot;I jumped on it playing with the dog and it broke.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my parents really knew why because they ended up calling me around 11 or so telling me to get everyone out of the house or I&amp;#39;m in big trouble. They had my neighbors watching my house to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t do exactly what I did haha. So I ended up kicking everyone but my close friends out. But in the end I didn&amp;#39;t get in any trouble. Good memories. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgc5d3r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385269.0, "created_utc": 1492356469.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oy2s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc712u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JonMadd", "parent_id": "t3_65oy2s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Got quite drunk, someone punched a hole in a wall, sobered up and helped the parents clean the house up with some friends.
