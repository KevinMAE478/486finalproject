They want to be feared, but more importantly they want to be rich. Their desire for treasure makes them less ruthless because they\u2019d rather be rich than die.\nNinjas are hired to kill. They fear nothing - not even death - as proven by their willingness to commit seppuku.\n\n \n2) Pirates can never sneak attack anyone. We can see their boats miles away. They have parrots. Parrots squawk loudly and poop everywhere so we always know if a pirate is close by. Plus their peg legs make lots of noise as they walk.\nNinjas are swift and silent and can walk on water. All their attacks are surprises. They blend in with the night. No one can see ninjas even when they\u2019re standing right there in your face!\n\n \n3) \u201cYarg!\u201d isn\u2019t an intimidating war cry, but the silent stare of a ninja is deadly.\n\n \n4) Ninjas can walk on walls, do acrobatics, and almost fly because of their intense training.\nWhat can pirates do? Pirates can only sword fight or shoot canons from a long distance. Plus, pirates are always drunk! They drink rum all day.

They want to be feared, but more importantly they want to be rich. Their desire for treasure makes them less ruthless because they\u2019d rather be rich than die.\nNinjas are hired to kill. They fear nothing - not even death - as proven by their willingness to commit seppuku.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Pirates can never sneak attack anyone. We can see their boats miles away. They have parrots. Parrots squawk loudly and poop everywhere so we always know if a pirate is close by. Plus their peg legs make lots of noise as they walk.\nNinjas are swift and silent and can walk on water. All their attacks are surprises. They blend in with the night. No one can see ninjas even when they\u2019re standing right there in your face!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) \u201cYarg!\u201d isn\u2019t an intimidating war cry, but the silent stare of a ninja is deadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Ninjas can walk on walls, do acrobatics, and almost fly because of their intense training.\nWhat can pirates do?
