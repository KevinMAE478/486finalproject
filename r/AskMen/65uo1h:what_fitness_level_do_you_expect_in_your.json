I'm older and have dated chubby women, and quite fit women.\n\nI actually have no problem with larger body as I really like curves. The appearance was not a problem. I'm just as attracted to the bodies of curvy larger girls as I am to athletic ones. I don't acutally like athletic bodies on women all that much to be honest.\n\n\nBut despite that when I was at my fittest I found that an unfit women was not much fun to be with. They could not keep up with all the outdoor stuff I'd like to do. \n\nWhen you have a fit body its like owning a sports car. Sure it looks great, but the real fun is taking it for a fast drive. You want to go running, and play sports, and do generally do lots of physical things because you have a strong fast body and its lot of fun to use it. An unfit partner just can't keep up. They literally cannot go running with you or do the same rock climbing things you do.\n\nSo when you're with an unfit partner it creates a big mismatch of lifestyles. They want to go out to eat all the time. They want to do indoor things. It can get a little boring if you're used to *doing* stuff rather than just socialising, watching stuff and eating.\n\nAlso many guys who got fit had to work hard for it. That means watching what you eat and eating a pretty carefully chosen diet. That does not mean your food is boring or that you're eating celery all day. But when your partner want to go the this dessert cafe or eat pizza for the second time this week it forces you to use up will power hanging around junk food and not eating it. You'd rather just be around a healthy lifestyle and healthy food 24/7 so you don't have to think about it. Watching someone eat pizza and ice cream while you do the opposite is not fun. Over time it just wears you down and you get fat yourself.\n\nWhen I dated a girl who was really into health and well being it was really great. We'd both eat healthy all the time and food was just something we did not turn into a big part of what we cared about. I could take her for a strenuous hike up in the mountains and she'd be having fun the whole time, keeping up with no effort at all. She would not be pretending she was into it, then runing the hike for both of us by not being able to keep up and needing to rest all the time. We could go for a run to the park together. She'd give me all these tips on keeping healthy that I'd never even looked at because it was from a more feminine perspective but they were super helpful. We could just go out the door for an activity any time and she'd be up for it. She was never too tired to do something. And when I was doing my gym time she kind of knew what I was trying to acheive and I could talk to her about it. Being fit is a big part of your life so its nice to be able to talk to your partner about it.\n\nIf I was really fit again **I'd probably look for a partner that could comfortably run a 10k. And I do mean run**. I wouldn't be out there with a stop watch or anything, but I feel that's a good indication of a good level of fitness. Someone who could do just about any activity and would always have plenty of energy for stuff. That might sound like a high bar but once you start getting fit you realise its not that hard actually. Anyone who is serious about fitness and has gotten down to a reasonable weight and is injury free could build up to running a 10K in three months fairly easily.\n\nI also would not be intersted in dating a girl who is starting on the path of losing weight and getting fit. A lot of partners when they start dating someone fit make a 'committment' to get fit themselves but it just does not work that way. If you cared about enough to really do it, you'd have done it on your own regardless of what partner you're with. I don't want to be your life coach helping you lose weight and become fit so you can feel we're a better match. Its a *really long* and difficult path getting fit and healthy, and everyone has to do it their own way and for their own personal reasons. Doing it for a guy you've been dating a couple of months is not really a great way to go about it.\n\nI don't judge anyone who is fat and unfit. I've spent more time that way myself than healthy. I know how hard it is to change and I know its not a moral failing or anything like that. But because its so hard to change, and its so different being fit I'd have trouble being in a relationshp with an unfit girl while being very fit myself.

You&amp;#39;d rather just be around a healthy lifestyle and healthy food 24/7 so you don&amp;#39;t have to think about it. Watching someone eat pizza and ice cream while you do the opposite is not fun. Over time it just wears you down and you get fat yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I dated a girl who was really into health and well being it was really great. We&amp;#39;d both eat healthy all the time and food was just something we did not turn into a big part of what we cared about. I could take her for a strenuous hike up in the mountains and she&amp;#39;d be having fun the whole time, keeping up with no effort at all. She would not be pretending she was into it, then runing the hike for both of us by not being able to keep up and needing to rest all the time. We could go for a run to the park together. She&amp;#39;d give me all these tips on keeping healthy that I&amp;#39;d never even looked at because it was from a more feminine perspective but they were super helpful. We could just go out the door for an activity any time and she&amp;#39;d be up for it. She was never too tired to do something. And when I was doing my gym time she kind of knew what I was trying to acheive and I could talk to her about it. Being fit is a big part of your life so its nice to be able to talk to your partner about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I was really fit again &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;d probably look for a partner that could comfortably run a 10k. And I do mean run&lt;/strong&gt;. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be out there with a stop watch or anything, but I feel that&amp;#39;s a good indication of a good level of fitness. Someone who could do just about any activity and would always have plenty of energy for stuff. That might sound like a high bar but once you start getting fit you realise its not that hard actually. Anyone who is serious about fitness and has gotten down to a reasonable weight and is injury free could build up to running a 10K in three months fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also would not be intersted in dating a girl who is starting on the path of losing weight and getting fit. A lot of partners when they start dating someone fit make a &amp;#39;committment&amp;#39; to get fit themselves but it just does not work that way. If you cared about enough to really do it, you&amp;#39;d have done it on your own regardless of what partner you&amp;#39;re with. I don&amp;#39;t want to be your life coach helping you lose weight and become fit so you can feel we&amp;#39;re a better match. Its a &lt;em&gt;really long&lt;/em&gt; and difficult path getting fit and healthy, and everyone has to do it their own way and for their own personal reasons. Doing it for a guy you&amp;#39;ve been dating a couple of months is not really a great way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t judge anyone who is fat and unfit. I&amp;#39;ve spent more time that way myself than healthy. I know how hard it is to change and I know its not a moral failing or anything like that. But because its so hard to change, and its so different being fit I&amp;#39;d have trouble being in a relationshp with an unfit girl while being very fit myself. It just does not work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgdczj5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492456029.0, "created_utc": 1492427229.0, "depth":

So if a guy tells me he can&amp;#39;t dance it would be a relief for me!\nWell I actually don&amp;#39;t have good coordination as I always injure myself a lot, but I like trying at sports. I just haven&amp;#39;t been good at them and it doesn&amp;#39;t come naturally to me. I am someone who likes to be perform ing good at everything I do and when I keep failing at something, it eventually becomes discouraging. I always loved martial arts but when I was younger my mom thought it was a &amp;quot;boy sport&amp;quot; and so she tried to send me to ballet and gymnastic instead, which I hated and so I ended up not doing much sports. When I was 18 and in college, I had the freedom to choose my own sports so I started with Taekwondo, I tried it for 3 years and I sucked at it. I guess I wasn&amp;#39;t that bad, but it sucked I couldn&amp;#39;t win many fights and it was so discouraging although I loved the sport. I quitted after 3 years and started with Judo, which surprisingly I was good at and I was winning a lot of the matches even against the guys. I had to stop due to some life circumstances, but I am scared that this time around that I want to try, I won&amp;#39;t be as good as in my early 20s. What I am trying to say, I will try anything, I am not a skier and I tried it when I went to ski trip with friends and even went up again the day after hurting my back from a hitting a tree and in pain, because I enjoyed it and wanted to get better. But if I keep failing at some sports and I suck bad, I don&amp;#39;t care if the guy thinks its cute, I just hate to see myself suck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgdqh69", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476322.0, "created_utc": 1492447522.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkoct", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "resinis", "parent_id": "t3_65uo1h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I hate when girls use the \"I don't have coordination\" excuse.
