That said, there&amp;#39;s no reason to believe that non-monogamous societies are/were any less varied than monogamous ones.  Not all monogamy is alike- compare marriage in the United States and Saudi Arabia, for example.

It&amp;#39;s this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy has five partners he has been with for years and doesn&amp;#39;t ignore any of them, he writes multiple books on the regular and goes on book tours, and he&amp;#39;s developing a strap-on the wearer can feel based on sensors that... I don&amp;#39;t even know. But it basically allows the wearer to experience sensations of being inside the person the strap-on is penetrating. And it works.
