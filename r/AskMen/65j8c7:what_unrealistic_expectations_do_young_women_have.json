Most of the times I&amp;#39;ve ghosted girls, if I really told them the stuff they did that turned me off/was inconsiderate, Im sure they would be baffled because to them its just how they&amp;#39;ve always acted/what they usually get away with/they honestly dont see anything wrong with their behavior.  I know when I go out that I am scheduling the date and paying and I&amp;#39;m happy to do that... but if I dont get some sort of non-obligatory &amp;#39;thanks&amp;#39; or some heartfelt token that this effort was appreciated and my time is just as valuable, she&amp;#39;s done.  The only guy who would put up with that is one with no options, because hes pathetic (or \n super horny willing to honey dick, hence all the &amp;quot;guys only want sex!&amp;quot; girls running around completely oblivious they have created their own reality).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just to proactively reply to the  &amp;quot;lol &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;/r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; comment... I&amp;#39;m not saying &amp;quot;women only like assholes&amp;quot; or are unnatracted to nice guys/good guys/whatever.  I am saying that I think guys who have &amp;quot;game-ified&amp;quot; dating are the only ones increasingly likely to put up with the chronic &amp;#39;small rudeness&amp;#39;/disregard/just plain &amp;#39;not trying&amp;#39; I see a lot of girls in their late 20s exhibiting while lamenting the dating treadmill/how dudes never pan out.   I  think a lot of pretty girls get psychologically whipsawed by all the attention they get early on and dont realize that they are just queen nothing over shit-guy-pile.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a &amp;quot;great guy&amp;quot;, however you define that, you will very likely need to treat him as an equal from day 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think &lt;a href=\"/u/KingEsoteric\"&gt;/u/KingEsoteric&lt;/a&gt; expressed this in a more contextualized (and succinct) way in his post: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/65j8c7/what_unrealistic_expectations_do_young_women_have/dgar15v/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/65j8c7/what_unrealistic_expectations_do_young_women_have/dgar15v/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgaqqsw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492297784.0, "created_utc": 1492268984.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 489}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j8c7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb7djl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 42, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pariah_D0g", "parent_id": "t3_65j8c7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That being able to work out relationship problems isn't a necessary skill because their \"perfect man\" will be on the exact same wavelength at all times.

The older women that ended up running the movement into the 1990s and beyond were those that stayed true to the ideology and didn&amp;#39;t move on from it, while the older women that moderated and lived lives outside of the ideology, moving on to a more wholistic view of the issues of the world no longer were the drivers of it.  The most extreme voices remained and influenced the later generations.  Plus there is a fairly large number of people with personal issues that represent the leadership of feminism, which really seems to drive the movement; people like Andrea Dworkin and Gloria Steinem had serious emotional problems stemming from rape in the case of Dworkin and a broken home in early childhood with Steinem (who helped actually push the feminist movement away from it&amp;#39;s socialist roots toward a neo-liberal brand it has today while working in the employ of the CIA, about the pinnacle of all things patriarchy).&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Steinem#CIA_ties\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Steinem#CIA_ties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgawprj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492306112.0, "created_utc": 1492277312.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 80}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatgti", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 139, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ebu-Gogo", "parent_id": "t1_dgasd3e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I consider myself a feminist, but one huge thing that bothers me about the internet brand of feminism is the lack of self-reflection going on.
