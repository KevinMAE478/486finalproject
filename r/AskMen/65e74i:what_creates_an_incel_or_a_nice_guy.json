My self-esteem dropped to zero during puberty, though it was absolutely fine as a kid. I had a bunch of friends as a kid and teenager, got along with all different kinds of people. Was never bullied, never overweight, no family problems or anything. However come puberty, I felt like the ugliest, most worthless and repulsive being on the planet.     \nThe idea that any girl could possibly be attracted to me was insane and I thought that me trying to approach a girl or showing that I had romantic or even sexual cravings would be about as gross as some 80 year old hobo asking you to suck his dick.      \n\nThe thing that strikes me the most is just how misunderstood a lot of FA/Incel/NiceGuys/whatever are. For example:    \n\n1. Everything is taken as an attack on women.    \nSure, I was bitter about not being able to get any attention. I was mad that I, as a guy, have to put forth all the effort in dating. I was mad that women mainly consider X, Y and Z attractive when I had traits A, B and C. But that did not mean that I blamed women in any way. Though other people always constructed it as that.     \n\n2. The word \"should\" and only accepting strawmen    \nI can't recall how often people put me in the \"well, if you are overweight and sit at home playing games all day\" corner. And whenever I explained that no, I actually do go to the gym, I do dress well, I do work on my education and I do have hobbies, they'll either not post again, critisize you for not wanting to change or pull the \"if that was true then you should be confident\". If you don't fit the strawman criterias, you'll make people angry, if you do meet the criterias, they'll be angry as well.      \n\n3. The lack of entitlement.      \nThis is a very big one. I, and a lot of other guys, regularly get accused of being entitled and thinking that being nice, respectful, employed, etc. should be enough. That is nit the case. A lot of FA guys do feel unattractive and don't think that any girl should like them. It's the opposite of entitlement. I even thought castration would be a good option for me to drop out of the genepool if I couldn't kill myself.   \nHowever, even at this point, I thought that I should be more attractive than a criminal, abusive, drug-addicted deadbeat. But there were a bunch of criminal, abusive addicts who do fine with women. So I thought that must mean that a woman would rather be beaten up than be with me.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only speak for myself as I have definitely considered nyself a FA/Incel and have been accused of being a NiceGuy as well.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t make out a real reason for it. My self-esteem dropped to zero during puberty, though it was absolutely fine as a kid. I had a bunch of friends as a kid and teenager, got along with all different kinds of people. Was never bullied, never overweight, no family problems or anything. However come puberty, I felt like the ugliest, most worthless and repulsive being on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe idea that any girl could possibly be attracted to me was insane and I thought that me trying to approach a girl or showing that I had romantic or even sexual cravings would be about as gross as some 80 year old hobo asking you to suck his dick.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing that strikes me the most is just how misunderstood a lot of FA/Incel/NiceGuys/whatever are. For example:    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is taken as an attack on women.&lt;br/&gt;\nSure, I was bitter about not being able to get any attention. I was mad that I, as a guy, have to put forth all the effort in dating. I was mad that women mainly consider X, Y and Z attractive when I had traits A, B and C. But that did not mean that I blamed women in any way. Though other people always constructed it as that.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; and only accepting strawmen&lt;br/&gt;\nI can&amp;#39;t recall how often people put me in the &amp;quot;well, if you are overweight and sit at home playing games all day&amp;quot; corner. And whenever I explained that no, I actually do go to the gym, I do dress well, I do work on my education and I do have hobbies, they&amp;#39;ll either not post again, critisize you for not wanting to change or pull the &amp;quot;if that was true then you should be confident&amp;quot;. If you don&amp;#39;t fit the strawman criterias, you&amp;#39;ll make people angry, if you do meet the criterias, they&amp;#39;ll be angry as well.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of entitlement.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is a very big one. I, and a lot of other guys, regularly get accused of being entitled and thinking that being nice, respectful, employed, etc. should be enough. That is nit the case. A lot of FA guys do feel unattractive and don&amp;#39;t think that any girl should like them. It&amp;#39;s the opposite of entitlement. I even thought castration would be a good option for me to drop out of the genepool if I couldn&amp;#39;t kill myself.&lt;br/&gt;\nHowever, even at this point, I thought that I should be more attractive than a criminal, abusive, drug-addicted deadbeat.
