Here are a few bits of a few things I've written about it before.\n\nThe open shot of the first movie is amazing. You see the rebel cruiser fly overhead pursued by the giant Imperial Star Destroyer and you're immediately hooked. If it's not the most iconic single shot in all of cinema, it has to be near the top of the list. You could (and I'm sure someone has) write pages on that shot alone.\n\nThe duel between Vader and Obi-wan is the least flashy of all of the fights in the trilogy, but it's still excellent. It shows that you don't need jump kicks and flips and crazy choreography to make a good fight scene. There's so much going on between the characters, the dialogue is great, and the tension and excitement stays high since you don't know what is going to happen next. At the end of the duel, nobody expects Obi-Wan to sacrifice himself, but he does, and it's amazing.\n\nThe duel between Vader and Luke (in *The Empire Strikes Back*) is really cool. Definitely one of the best in the series. Vader pretty much dominates Luke and is toying with him for much of the fight. Yoda and Obi-Wan told Luke that he wasn't ready to fight Darth Vader yet, and they were right. In so many movies, the hero is just randomly better than the villain at whatever the villain is actually supposed to be the best at; that doesn't happen here.\n\nOne scene that I haven't heard many people talk about, but I think is really cool, is when Han meets Darth Vader on Cloud City. As soon as Han sees him, he pulls out his gun and starts shooting, and Vader easily absorbs the lasers with his hand somehow.  Han is a shoot first and ask questions later sort of guy, and this scene solidifies it. He doesn't panic, he doesn't think, he just acts. It's a cool scene for Vader too; if we didn't know how much of a badass he is, we certainly do now.\n\nJabba's Palace is very cool and creepy. I think that Jabba's introduction would have been way cooler if he hadn't seen him in already in Episode IV (which was true when this was orginially released) or Episode I (if we're counting that as something we've seen \"before\" this). He doesn't really add much in either of those films, and I think that spending a few movies having referenced and talk about before being revealed to be a giant, evil, slimy slug creature would have been really cool. While he's plenty evil and menacing looking, hearing about him and not knowing exactly who are what you're dealing with would have been even more frightening.\n\nIn *The Return of the Jedi*, the duel between Luke and his father is very good. There's so much going on with each character trying to control his emotions while they're fighting and trying to bring out certain emotions and the other guy. Most of the fight isn't actually about trying to hit the other guy with your lightsaber. I think it's a really well shot sequence as well. Luke is dressed in all black, as is Vader, and you often see them just moving as silhouettes with their lightsabers brilliantly crackling against each other.\n\nI loved the sequence where the clone troopers execute Order 66. I think it's one of the best in the series. It's beautifully shot and really emotional. I think it's the one part of the movie that George Lucas got 100% correct. It says so much about Palpatine, the government, the clone troopers, and the Jedi themself.
