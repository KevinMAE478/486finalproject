I&amp;#39;ve been told by many, many women that where mine is is the sexiest spot for a tattoo, mostly for the reasons listed. They like that I can show it off or hide it depending on the setting. For my girlfriend personally, for whatever reason, it drives her crazy when I have my sleeves rolled just below the elbow so you can see about half of it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you said that you don&amp;#39;t have one mostly because there hasn&amp;#39;t been anything that&amp;#39;s inspired you to get one, but if you change your mind and are wanting a place where you can both show it off and hide it, forearm just below the elbow is the place to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg83v1v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141551.0, "created_utc": 1492112751.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655fzm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655fzm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8thyz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mccurds", "parent_id": "t1_dg81y1x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The #1 complement I receive is \"Oh, your skin holds the ink so well\". #2 is \"Your skin is perfect for these colors\".
