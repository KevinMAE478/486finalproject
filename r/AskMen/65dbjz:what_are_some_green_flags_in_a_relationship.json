She'd sneak cute notes into my jacket pockets and things like that. \n\n- Whenever I left her alone in my apartment (say, if I left for work and she wanted to sleep in until she had to go to work), she'd clean and straighten up around the place without my asking.  She insists on doing this. I often come home to clean dishes, to clean litter boxes. \n\n- If she sees little things she thinks I'd like while she's out and about, she'll get them for me. \n\n- No matter how crazy a dream of mine is that I've mentioned, she's been supportive without a hint of doubt that I could accomplish it.  \n\n- She passes no judgement.  Even little things like, I had a day off the other day and talked a big game about getting up early and catching up on all these errands I needed to run. She texted me to ask how my productive day went, and I kind of sheepishly responded that I slept until noon and watched an entire season of a TV show, and her response was something like: \"that's amazing! No day has ever been better spent. I'm sure you needed it after working so hard this week!\" Without mentioning anything like \"well, when are you going to get to XYZ.\"  She trusts me to adult with having to act like a mom. \n\n- She comes through when I need her.  I make a little more money than her, so I like to take care of her when we're together.  She often insists on doing something for the both of us, but mostly lets me pay for her because she knows that I like to.  Well, a couple months back I had some unexpected hospital bills I had to pay and I had to dip through my savings.  After paying rent, I literally had like $250 to last me a full two weeks until my next paycheck.  When I told her we'd have to have some quiet nights in the apartment until I got paid, her first response was \"nonsense! Now I can finally be sugar momma for a change, it'll be fun!\" And she insisted on taking us out. \n\n- She cares about her friends and family deeply. She'll travel three hours to visit a friend she heard is having surgery.  She'll get up at 3 in the morning to get her brother who's lost downtown.  She visits with her grandparents. That sort of thing.  She takes interpersonal relationships really seriously. \n\n- She's just moved in, and even though I make more than she does, she's insisting on paying half of the rent/expenses.  I tried to argue (for a while) that we should do it proportionally to our income, but she maintained that her half of the expenses were well within her means to still have spending money and save, and it was important to her to contribute 50%.  She said if we ever move somewhere outside of her means, we can do proportional payment, but since she can afford it, she insists on contributing it.  \n\nShe's a wonderful woman.  I think when someone has strong values and principles, it will shine through in all manners of their behavior and interaction.  These are just a few of the first examples that come to mind, but she is constantly making me smile and mutter to myself \"I love this woman!\" She keeps surprising me with how kind and thoughtful she is.

She&amp;#39;d sneak cute notes into my jacket pockets and things like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I left her alone in my apartment (say, if I left for work and she wanted to sleep in until she had to go to work), she&amp;#39;d clean and straighten up around the place without my asking.  She insists on doing this. I often come home to clean dishes, to clean litter boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she sees little things she thinks I&amp;#39;d like while she&amp;#39;s out and about, she&amp;#39;ll get them for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how crazy a dream of mine is that I&amp;#39;ve mentioned, she&amp;#39;s been supportive without a hint of doubt that I could accomplish it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She passes no judgement.  Even little things like, I had a day off the other day and talked a big game about getting up early and catching up on all these errands I needed to run. She texted me to ask how my productive day went, and I kind of sheepishly responded that I slept until noon and watched an entire season of a TV show, and her response was something like: &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s amazing! No day has ever been better spent. I&amp;#39;m sure you needed it after working so hard this week!&amp;quot; Without mentioning anything like &amp;quot;well, when are you going to get to XYZ.&amp;quot;  She trusts me to adult with having to act like a mom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She comes through when I need her.  I make a little more money than her, so I like to take care of her when we&amp;#39;re together.  She often insists on doing something for the both of us, but mostly lets me pay for her because she knows that I like to.  Well, a couple months back I had some unexpected hospital bills I had to pay and I had to dip through my savings.  After paying rent, I literally had like $250 to last me a full two weeks until my next paycheck.  When I told her we&amp;#39;d have to have some quiet nights in the apartment until I got paid, her first response was &amp;quot;nonsense! Now I can finally be sugar momma for a change, it&amp;#39;ll be fun!&amp;quot; And she insisted on taking us out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cares about her friends and family deeply. She&amp;#39;ll travel three hours to visit a friend she heard is having surgery.  She&amp;#39;ll get up at 3 in the morning to get her brother who&amp;#39;s lost downtown.  She visits with her grandparents. That sort of thing.  She takes interpersonal relationships really seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s just moved in, and even though I make more than she does, she&amp;#39;s insisting on paying half of the rent/expenses.  I tried to argue (for a while) that we should do it proportionally to our income, but she maintained that her half of the expenses were well within her means to still have spending money and save, and it was important to her to contribute 50%.  She said if we ever move somewhere outside of her means, we can do proportional payment, but since she can afford it, she insists on contributing it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s a wonderful woman.  I think when someone has strong values and principles, it will shine through in all manners of their behavior and interaction.  These are just a few of the first examples that come to mind, but she is constantly making me smile and mutter to myself &amp;quot;I love this woman!&amp;quot; She keeps surprising me with how kind and thoughtful she is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg9ebub", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492217538.0, "created_utc": 1492188738.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 395}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dbjz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dbjz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9u1q4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "whatcouldpossiblygow", "parent_id": "t1_dg9cy27", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thats some deep shit right there homie - thanks for articulating it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thats some deep shit right there homie - thanks for articulating it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg9u1q4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236521.0, "created_utc": 1492207721.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dbjz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb8on1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Beloveddd", "parent_id": "t1_dg9cy27", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;one-who-is-also-two\n\nI love this!\n\nAlso my next username is going to be KInky-Ass Energiser Fuckbunny.
