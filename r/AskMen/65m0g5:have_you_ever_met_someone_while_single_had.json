I was turned on as fuck. Unfortunately, I was really drunk and when I left the club with my mates, I forgot that she had slipped her number into the back pocket of my jeans. I washed those jeans and found the note all wet and murky. I went back to the club multiple times but I never saw her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a wonderful girlfriend now but you always wonder...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dgbty03", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492357880.0, "created_utc": 1492329080.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m0g5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbngja", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TISparta217", "parent_id": "t3_65m0g5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep.
