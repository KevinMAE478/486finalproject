From what I can tell: People are only good if it's beneficial to them to be good. Otherwise it's just wasted effort. Generally, I think people do whatever is most beneficial to them, and nothing else. \n\nAlso... believing doesn't actually GET you anything. You can believe whatever you want... it doesn't make it real. I always wanted to start my own family, that's pretty much the only goal I think is truly worth achieving. Materialistic goals may add to happiness, but they don't provide the base needed for happiness. However, due to my many physical health problems I got over the last 2 years and my lack of experience with women at my age. You're fucked. I imagine that it would be like dating a teenager. But there's nothing you can do. Nobody wants to date a teenager at that age and you will never advance from being a teenager if you never get the chance to date. Also... nobody really is keen on dating a guy with that many physical health problems. So.. you're fucked. What do you do? You try, you fail, you try again, you fail, you try, you fail, you try, you fail, you try, you fail. It's really hard to keep inconstent beliefs up. \"Things will get better\" then it gets worse, but you keep thingking \"Things will get better\" then it gets worse, you keep thinking \"Things will get better\" but at some point the brain can't keep the delusion up and faces reality. Once your brain faces reality you become depressed. Depression is a state of mind where the brain refuses to keep up the delusion of a good world and faces reality. But depression doesn't kill you. Technically, I'm not depressed. Depression requires anhedonia. I want to do millions of stuff, I wanna go hiking, I wanna go travelling, I wanna marry, I wanna have kids, I wanna go climbing outside, I wanna go bouldering outside, I wanna go on bike trips, I wanna hang out with friends, I wanna play in a band but I can't do any of those things. If you're not healthy enough to keep up with the friends you had, you will be left with none. Usually somebody is now going to comment 'you had shitty friends'. No, they just were regular people, they weren't 'shitty friends' they were humans. 99.99...9% of people would have behaved exactly the same way. It's just convenient to label these people as 'shitty friends' because then you don't have to face the reality that people aren't as good as you think they are. It's the same thing when a guy/girl doesn't find some guy/girl attractive: \"He/she is a shitty person\". No, he/she is a normal human being who just wasn't into you. It's convenient to label them as 'shitty persons' because then you don't have to face the reality: that you were not attractive enough. 99.99.9% of people would have behaved exactly the same way. \n\nI'd be happy if just one person a month would pay me a visit but that's already way too much to ask. Like I said. You can't expect people to adapt to you. Everybody does what's most beneficial to them and hanging with a sick guy on a saturday afternoon isn't beneficial. Trust me... I haven't been visited once in more than half a decade. Nobody has invited me really to their birthday parties or whatever because they know I can't come but nobody is going to move their party from 10pm to 4pm just so one person could come because then a lot of other persons probably wouldn't come (nobody goes to parties before 10pm). Nobody invites you to roadtrips if you have to pee roughly every 60minutes. It sounds trivial, but trivial things already have devastating impacts on your social life. I can't even drink alcohol because my body can't process it correctly which sounds like a really trivial thing. So what. Can't drink alcohol... It's a huge deal. You wouldn't believe how many people (men and women) will tell you 'not a real men' just because you don't drink alcohol. It's all trivial things, but trivial things already make your life fucked. And now imagine you have a lot of these little things, then some worse health problems and all the consequences of those. I can honestly say that *everybody* in my position would commit suicide within 6 months. I'm dead certain of that. They'd all say \"If I had your money\" or \"If I could play a music instrument\" but they don't realize that these things are *completely useless*. They are only like a multiplier. 2x0 is still 0.. The idea that playing a music instrument makes your life better is bullshit. I'v tried it. Multiple times. That's why I can play multiple instruments. But you'll still be alone 99.9..% of the time and that kills *everything*. It makes your life better if you already have a decent life, otherwise it doesn't do shit. I have a six pack, honestly. I do. Not a very much defined one but yes. I try to look after my body even if my non restaurative sleeps makes me a cognitive vegetable not even capable of finding my way out of a shopping mall but I have a couple of hours a day where I can do stuff. So I go climbing, I work out, I play instruments, I read books, I try to work but it's not a satisfactory life. A car needs four wheels, otherwise it's a useless car. Even if it's a nice car.
