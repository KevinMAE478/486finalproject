I&amp;#39;ve come to realize that women seem to go into dates expecting to have a connection immediately, and if they don&amp;#39;t, they move on. So you pretty much have to keep putting yourself out there until you find that person you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; click with immediately, and in the meantime, just have fun and don&amp;#39;t let &amp;quot;failures&amp;quot; get to you too much, because they might not be your fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also get the sense that a lot of women aren&amp;#39;t really meeting me halfway in trying to make a date fun and finding a connection, but I&amp;#39;ve also realized that women suck at dating almost as much as men\u2014it&amp;#39;s just men&amp;#39;s mistakes are much more obvious, since they have a more active role. I think the solution is realizing that, and make sure you&amp;#39;re taking as active a role as possible in the dating experience, and don&amp;#39;t let it get to you if women aren&amp;#39;t really doing their part\u2014they might just be really bad at it. Maybe your efforts pay off, maybe they don&amp;#39;t, but hey, there are plenty of fish in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing what you want and being excited about finding that helps a lot, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, in general, romance is fickle, and it might not be your fault, nor is it necessarily her fault/apathy, and when you realize that you can accept &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot; better, without bitterness and resentment, and just keep trying until you find something that works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d recommend using online dating as a supplement to dating. Meet people in real life, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg4p8bm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491964748.0, "created_utc": 1491935948.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5182v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Redcup47", "parent_id": "t1_dg4rfi7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like u", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like u&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg5182v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978401.0, "created_utc": 1491949601.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4rfi7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 39, "report_reasons": null, "author": "long3hat1", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lrw6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;  life is less \"everyone has a number\" and more \"everyone is an oddly shaped jigsaw piece\"\n\nbeautiful", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;life is less &amp;quot;everyone has a number&amp;quot; and more &amp;quot;everyone is an oddly shaped jigsaw piece&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;beautiful&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg4rfi7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491967069.0, "created_utc": 1491938269.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4u350", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThinkerTanker", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lrw6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is actually really helpful", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is actually really helpful&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg4u350", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969950.0, "created_utc": 1491941150.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg51kfp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "joeb361", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lrw6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never considered life like that, thanks.\n\n(Already got an amazing girlfriend though, just assumed she was delusional or something)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never considered life like that, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Already got an amazing girlfriend though, just assumed she was delusional or something)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg51kfp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978833.0, "created_utc": 1491950033.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rwtr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ggfr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thewayon", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lrw6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Poetic.

I don&amp;#39;t know why so many men don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s okay to seek out meaningful friendships but it does seem to be an issue which I think affects more than just dating, but dating would sure be a good example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing, quite frankly, is that if anyone&amp;#39;s self esteem is wholly tied up in their success or otherwise in online dating they are sorely lacking perspective. Online dating is what it is - if a person has decent self esteem (from the rest of their life, only a tiny portion of which should really be online dating), even continuous negative experiences with online dating shouldn&amp;#39;t be enough to make a person feel totally worthless.
