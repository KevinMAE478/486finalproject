It takes time and effort to do and it helps if you have something that keeps you together (mutual friends or hobbies for example). My high-school/part of college girlfriend and I were together for 5ish years and our families had grown really close so we saw a lot of each other. That was hard for awhile but eventually you get used to it and move on. She ended up marrying one of my best friends. I was in the wedding. I'm an unofficial uncle to their child. As a more recent girlfriend put it, it sounds weird but when you're around us it all seems very natural.\n\nFor my most recent ex, it was a conscious decision to stay friends. We had been very serious but the break up wasn't so bad considering. We were both more sad than angry. It really helps if you don't resent each other. At same time, I think think we both understand that this was the right move so neither of us are going to try to rekindle anything. I think that sense of finality is important. We also have a shared hobby that causes us to see each other most weeks so it's easy (though a little awkward at first) to keep in touch. \n\nAs for the next relationship, that can get tricky.
