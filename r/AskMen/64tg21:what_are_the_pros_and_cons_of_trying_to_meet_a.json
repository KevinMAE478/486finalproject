Internet dating has a habit of people picking old photos, so when they turn up they do not look like what they actually look like.\n\n* It's way quicker.  Internet dating can be slow, and a bit painful.  If you meet somebody you get on with in real life and click, it's game on - you both know what each other are like and the rest is chemistry.\n\n* It's unforgiving in a completely good way.  As long as you are you, and they're into that, you can't go wrong.  Internet dating allows you to Google things to sound smarter, think of witty responses, and flirt fearlessly with complete safety behind your screen and these do not necessarily translate to real life because meeting women is really scary.  It's like they're not even people.\n\n* You don't have to find out they can't spell until later on.\n\n* It's a way better story.  Because, c'mon, meeting online, these days, is boring.\n\nPros of Meeting People Online:\n\n* You get to put your best foot forward all the time.  Perhaps you're a little shy, or going through some rough times, but that doesn't mean you don't deserve love.  Either way, there are no such things as an 'off day' with Internet dating because you can just take a break if you aren't feeling it.  In real life, once you're talking to the bangin' hottie at the bar, you have no option other than to be no less witty and charming than James Bond, lest you go home alone and bring shame upon your family.\n\n*  It's easier.  Rejection is, put bluntly, terrifying.  Internet rejection doesn't hurt at all.  Almost.  So, it's a perfect way of getting your self esteem up if you're of a nervous disposition.  You can 'look' any time and any where.\n\n* Selection.  There will be times where you are completely barren thinking about messaging the 'large but has a pretty face' kinda gal just to make yourself feel better, and then actually seriously contemplating taking a break from messaging because you have way too many potentials lined up.  A nice problem to have.\n\n* Makes great practice.  In all fairness, dating experience is something everybody wants to have.  Internet dating makes it so much more accessible for you to practice meeting people, socialising, doing fun things and, of course, having sex.  To be a little cynical, you don't want to meet your dream person only for them to shoot you down because the sex is bad.\n\n* Everybody is single.  I can't remember who coined the phrase, but the best quote about Internet dating is, 'imagine going to a bar, or place, where you know everybody is single'.  Of course, this isn't always true (I'm looking at you, ex-flatmate with a husband, you piece of shit).\n\n* It's actually super exciting.  Meeting people for the first time you're genuinely interested in is extremely fun.  Plus, you get to meet people you'd ordinarily have absolutely no chance of meeting because your paths simply wouldn't cross otherwise.  So, it's really fun.\n\nCons of Meeting People IRL:\n\n* You have no idea if they're single.  You meet the hot person from across the bar and you're gambling on them being single.  In my opinion, if somebody is into you and are up for taking it further, they'll let you know.\n\n* You have to find out they can't spell later on.\n\n* You have to literally go up to them and start talking AND win over their friends.  They might like you, but if their friends don't, it's almost certainly a no go.  It's hard enough to not sound like a creep talking to one girl, let alone, three of them.  It's basically tripling your chances of screwing up.  Online, it's just them you have to win over to get that first date.\n\n* It can be mentally damaging.  Rejection in real life is something that all men go through, even the super attractive ones.  It's really rough and it'll stick around until you have your 5 minutes of being a social savante and meet somebody nice.\n\n* It requires effort.  You have to get dressed, look nice, and not drink too much.  Internet dating requires you to have a phone or laptop with which you can message people stuff like, 'Hahaha, sounds fun.  What are you doing Friday? We should go and grab a drink' whilst taking an enormous shit or cleaning up after masturbating over their photos.\n\n* Almost all of the places you can meet people involve being sociable, which is what you're trying to avoid anyway.  Most people meet whilst drinking in bars in loud places.  They don't meet at the coffee shop or at the library.\n\nCons of Meeting People Online:\n\n* You need to know how to spell and use correct grammar.  It counts.\n\n* Competition.  In a bar, if you have the stones to walk up to a girl, be charming and natural, then fucking great.  The last time I talked to a girl in real life (swear I'm not lying), I said to her, 'So I heard you're into Asians' because that's what her friend told me and it was true (context: am an Asian dude).  \nIn real life, you can talk utter bollocks and get rewarded for it provided you do it without sounding like a creep.  Online though, you need good photographs, an interesting, yet on point, profile, and need to use actual grammar.  Then you have to write the right first message which is better than the bajillions of messages all the moderately attractive girls will be getting smashed by.  The choice is theirs and it's not uncommon for them to be talking to you one second only to have a better offer the next day.  People don't swoop in at bars because it's a dickish thing to do and almost certainly will backfire.\n\n* If you go on enough dates, somebody somewhere will DEFINITELY NOT look like their photos.  Jesus fucking Christ.  This can happen.\n\n* They might not be like they are over messages.  This is totally fine - people are allowed to have off days and it's up to you whether or not you want to see them again.  It's a bit of a shame you might have to wait a couple of weeks to see if they're as cool as they make themselves out to be, but that's the game.\n\n* Your favourite spots might be ruined.  As I said, Internet dates come in waves and if you keep taking all of your lovely dates to the same place i.e. your favourite ones, then there's a chance you could end up not liking them anymore.  Or go there anymore if the barman decides to grass you up \"passively\" along the lines of, 'Oi oi, that's the third one in three weeks! Ha ha ha'. Like a proper cunt.\n\n* They might not turn up.  Meeting somebody in real life gives you a decent idea if they're, say, an axe murderer or not.  Unfortunately, online dating does not give you this natural indicator making cold feet more than likely.  \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend doing both.  Ultimately, don't force yourself to 'increase your chances'.  Invest time in yourself, picking up hobbies you enjoy, working on your physical and mental health, and then just see where things go.  You'd be surprised how being selfish and doing a bunch of shit you want to do for you impacts the people around you positively.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, I can do this one:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pros of Meeting IRL:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see is what you get.  Internet dating has a habit of people picking old photos, so when they turn up they do not look like what they actually look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s way quicker.  Internet dating can be slow, and a bit painful.  If you meet somebody you get on with in real life and click, it&amp;#39;s game on - you both know what each other are like and the rest is chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unforgiving in a completely good way.  As long as you are you, and they&amp;#39;re into that, you can&amp;#39;t go wrong.  Internet dating allows you to Google things to sound smarter, think of witty responses, and flirt fearlessly with complete safety behind your screen and these do not necessarily translate to real life because meeting women is really scary.  It&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re not even people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to find out they can&amp;#39;t spell until later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a way better story.  Because, c&amp;#39;mon, meeting online, these days, is boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pros of Meeting People Online:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get to put your best foot forward all the time.  Perhaps you&amp;#39;re a little shy, or going through some rough times, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you don&amp;#39;t deserve love.  Either way, there are no such things as an &amp;#39;off day&amp;#39; with Internet dating because you can just take a break if you aren&amp;#39;t feeling it.  In real life, once you&amp;#39;re talking to the bangin&amp;#39; hottie at the bar, you have no option other than to be no less witty and charming than James Bond, lest you go home alone and bring shame upon your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easier.  Rejection is, put bluntly, terrifying.  Internet rejection doesn&amp;#39;t hurt at all.  Almost.  So, it&amp;#39;s a perfect way of getting your self esteem up if you&amp;#39;re of a nervous disposition.  You can &amp;#39;look&amp;#39; any time and any where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selection.  There will be times where you are completely barren thinking about messaging the &amp;#39;large but has a pretty face&amp;#39; kinda gal just to make yourself feel better, and then actually seriously contemplating taking a break from messaging because you have way too many potentials lined up.  A nice problem to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makes great practice.  In all fairness, dating experience is something everybody wants to have.  Internet dating makes it so much more accessible for you to practice meeting people, socialising, doing fun things and, of course, having sex.  To be a little cynical, you don&amp;#39;t want to meet your dream person only for them to shoot you down because the sex is bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody is single.  I can&amp;#39;t remember who coined the phrase, but the best quote about Internet dating is, &amp;#39;imagine going to a bar, or place, where you know everybody is single&amp;#39;.  Of course, this isn&amp;#39;t always true (I&amp;#39;m looking at you, ex-flatmate with a husband, you piece of shit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually super exciting.  Meeting people for the first time you&amp;#39;re genuinely interested in is extremely fun.  Plus, you get to meet people you&amp;#39;d ordinarily have absolutely no chance of meeting because your paths simply wouldn&amp;#39;t cross otherwise.  So, it&amp;#39;s really fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cons of Meeting People IRL:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have no idea if they&amp;#39;re single.  You meet the hot person from across the bar and you&amp;#39;re gambling on them being single.  In my opinion, if somebody is into you and are up for taking it further, they&amp;#39;ll let you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to find out they can&amp;#39;t spell later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to literally go up to them and start talking AND win over their friends.  They might like you, but if their friends don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s almost certainly a no go.  It&amp;#39;s hard enough to not sound like a creep talking to one girl, let alone, three of them.  It&amp;#39;s basically tripling your chances of screwing up.  Online, it&amp;#39;s just them you have to win over to get that first date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be mentally damaging.  Rejection in real life is something that all men go through, even the super attractive ones.  It&amp;#39;s really rough and it&amp;#39;ll stick around until you have your 5 minutes of being a social savante and meet somebody nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It requires effort.  You have to get dressed, look nice, and not drink too much.  Internet dating requires you to have a phone or laptop with which you can message people stuff like, &amp;#39;Hahaha, sounds fun.
