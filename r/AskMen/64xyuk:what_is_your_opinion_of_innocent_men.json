If I invite you to a bar and you say \"I don't drink,\" it sounds like you're shutting me down and don't want to come to those types of events.  But if you say \"I don't drink but I'd love to come hang\" or just go ahead and come, then that's totally cool.  I have plenty of friends that don't drink or smoke pot.
