I work in tech and have done for a decade now. I absolutely disagree with you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my current company we hire a woman for every three applicants and a man for every seven. It was the same when i worked in government service. The government did a lot of studies on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What drives women away tends to be local and organisational leadership and the fact that STEM jobs are hard. The biggest slice of women leaving STEM jobs was down to them having children and electing to return part time but finding it hard to maintain the top tier skills needed to excel without putting in more than full time hours (i.e. the men typically put in an extra 25% unpaid to learn latest skills). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this unfair? Maybe. You can either view it as the same as two violinists of equal skill, where one suddenly decides to half their practice time OR you can blame men for not forcing their wives/partners to return to work full time against their wishes OR you blame the government for not letting them take even more time off, to the point of negation, to account for the training burden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "name": "t1_dg7ebjl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492109630.0, "created_utc": 1492080830.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg73m8w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hungry_Lion", "parent_id": "t1_dg7238u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a Microbiology major and my classes are actually like 60% women.
