You want to know how to get free coins. So here in the UK, if you get packs of m&amp;amp;ms, snickers, minstrels alongside some other brands, you can get \u00a31 googleplay credit for each pack. You will need to buy 3 packs to get \u00a33 googleplay credit. It&amp;#39;s also not limited, so buy loads of pack and get credit to spend on Pokemon go. Tesco is currently selling a pack for \u00a31, and that&amp;#39;ll translate into \u00a31 googleplay credit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I know what your thinking this isn&amp;#39;t really free but stop for a second and think about it, you get to buy loads of chocolate and get credit to spend on google playstore. It doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be Pokemon go that you spend it on. That and you don&amp;#39;t need to eat all the chocolate yourself, share it with your family and friends. Alongside the fact the Easter event has been announced and those of you that spend will be spending. So might as well make the most of your money, not that Niantic won&amp;#39;t rake it over the next seven days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry that this promotion isn&amp;#39;t available worldwide, I myself only found out about it yesterday but maybe have a look and see if any of the confectionery companies are running similar offers around you. The Tesco discount won&amp;#39;t last forever as normally the big packs cost around \u00a32. Happy hunting everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just want to add that the promotion is running until 13/08/17. Depending on how often Tesco and other supermarkets put the packs on sale, you can carry on sort of profiting.
