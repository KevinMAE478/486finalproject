We couldn't do any of this without him, and it's about time he got an official corner office.  Executives donate a ton of time to this community, and it's not a position that we assign lightly.  ~~Marco~~ Executive Ceppi represents the best of this community - he's a chill, friendly traveler with deep expertise in dev ops and a long track record of helping lift our community.
