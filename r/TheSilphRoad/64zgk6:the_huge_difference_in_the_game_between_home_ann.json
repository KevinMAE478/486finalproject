Family, being family, is often hard to deal with in a time like this. I have my game, and kntting to keep me from losing it and my mind occupied, and I know I will make it through this funeral and visitation with strength. I have an escape plan when the arguing starts (money, and while it helps in life, I would rather have my crumugeony dad here). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know where I can play and it&amp;#39;s worth a trip home now just to see my old haunts and play there. In all seriousness, I have huge social anxiety and this game has gotten me out and about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did hit Gallup Park yesterday, but didn&amp;#39;t bring the Puggle-Duck (read puppy). So if I missed you, I will meet you in the future. Thank you so much to this group for saying the right thing, &amp;quot;I am so sorry, here&amp;#39;s where I play.&amp;quot; Incredibly kind and  amazing, as always. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dgaf412", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492269853.0, "created_utc": 1492241053.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zgk6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6e05h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "augustussmash", "parent_id": "t3_64zgk6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry for your loss, also AA has the live map we all wish was everywhere, I've driven 50 minutes many times and the catches are amazing!
