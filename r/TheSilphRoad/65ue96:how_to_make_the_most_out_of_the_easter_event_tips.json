The reason why I said it&amp;#39;s not worth the investment is that 2km&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t give much candies anyway and some rares aren&amp;#39;t even moved to 2km. Use your precious coins on other stuff instead (Lucky eggs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoard as much lucky eggs as you can before the bargain ends. Even though they take up so much space in your bag. The deal is just too valuable to not take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the most out of your eggs. If you&amp;#39;re using your eggs while catch/spin grinding, there will be idle moments when you are not catching. Those idle seconds eat up your egg timer.

It is best to time your lures in such a way that when you arrive to the next lure, you just caught the Pokemon from the last lure and the Pokemon from the next lure just spawned. With this you won&amp;#39;t miss any spawns thus you are getting the most out of your lure modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the most effective ball in catching a Pokemon to save time. Use a Great ball/Ultra ball in higher level Pokemon to reduce the risk of it breaking out. Don&amp;#39;t just throw right away when the Pokemon spawns in front of you. I just pointed this out because there are still a lot of players in our area that does this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you have a steady source of Pinap berries, Pinap those magnificent Pidgeys. 2 catches with Pinap will let you evolve your Pidgeys right away. You can also do this with other 12 candy and 25 candy evolvable Pokemon. This can really speed up your XP gain by a lot.

I evolve all my Pokemon weekly with a Lucky Egg. For an event like the current one, I do the loops as described by the OP, adding that I run 9 incubators while looping. I generally have candy for a mix of Pokemon and just evolve on the fly or loop in a nest with something I have enough candy to get started in the walk, spin, catch, hatch, evolve cycle. Looping during this event yields 100,000+ XP per hour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think in terms of XP/Hr,looping is definitely the most time efficient way to gain XP; mass evolve sessions are the most efficient use of a Lucky Egg. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assume someone has 500 Pokemon and the needed candies saved up to evolve for a 4x (with Lucky egg) event. During the event, that&amp;#39;s worth one million XP. However, if done before the event, it would be 500,000 XP. The typical player gets about 150 evolutions per hour without various &amp;quot;tricks.&amp;quot; So basically it takes 3 1/2 hours of mass evolve time to get 500,000 more XP. Walking loops, you would get 350,000+ XP during that time. So basically, a person may have prepared for months only to gain 150,000 or less additional XP. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That difference may be worth it for some, but personally not worth it for me since I can more efficiently make up that XP just playing an hour or two more during the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dgdjk2c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468144.0, "created_utc": 1492439344.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ue96", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdebgl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kdubina", "parent_id": "t1_dgdb760", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You make good points.

The ones I pointed out in my post are just tips I found very efficient in a general situation as not all players live within or near a Pogo hotspot. \n\n\n* Not all people find rares daily so Pinaps would mostly pile up. I just suggested that it can also be used in Pidgeys so they won't go to waste. Make the most out of the event.\n\n\n* Not all people \"sit on thousands of gold\". Coins are scarce. Not all people claim 100 per day so a lot of players would like to spend their coins in the most efficient way possible. 2kms can give you rares but I just find the value low since the stardust and candy given is not much for each hatch. But if a player is really hunting for some rare high IVs then incubators are their best bet. Also, using an egg during the event vs after it would technically save you 2 times the effort. \n\n\nGameplay is different among all of us. These are just my two cents.
