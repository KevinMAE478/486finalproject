I've only 1 Alakazam, have enough for my second one just from Saturday; I've 4 Exeggutors, but that was because the biggest nest in the city I played in was an Exeggcute nest twice (I could only go there during one of two times), I haven't seen an Exeggcute since. Drowzees are a dime a dozen where I live, so I could theoretically get one Hypno a day between 1200cp and 1600cp if I wanted to without trying too hard. Talking about CP... \n\n* Espeon is even harder to come by. I used up the nickname trick on my 100% Eevee to get Espeon, so I can get it to 3000cp at lvl40. Not walking 10km just to evolve another one for prestiging, would rather I continue walking my Chansey so I can get enough candy to make a 3rd 3000cp+ Blissey. \n\n* I naturally get Hypno between 1200-1600cp from evolving most random Drowzees I catch. I've thrown out a few dozen Hypnos already. It's no effort to get Hypnos where I play. I don't have to worry about healing my Hypnos after I use them to prestige; they're so plentiful that I can transfer them after they faint, and then evolve another lvl28 Drowzee to get another Hypno, gym training ready, so I won't have to waste any potions or revives. \n\n* I'm not sure if I'm correct, so lemme know if I'm mistaken, but I'm guessing: 1500cp Hypno *should* be stronger than a 1500cp Exeggutor and Espeon; not sure about Alakazam. Since Hypno caps out at 2048CP, whereas Exeggutor and Alakazam cap out closer to 3000CP, and Espeon caps out at exactly 3k CP. \n\nFor these reasons, I think Hypnos are better than all other Psychic Pok\u00e9mon for *prestiging only*, in any situation I have ever imagined, and in all situations I have ever been in. However you could be right that there are other situations for prestiging (the premise of my claim) where Hypno is not the optimal Pok\u00e9mon; if there is a more time, energy, candy, and item efficient Psychic Pok\u00e9mon to prestige, **please** share it with me!

So I keep everything that&amp;#39;s above 1k for the right situation where I can use them for &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; gyms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.2k CP was fine for prestiging maybe half a year ago; nowadays it&amp;#39;s 1400-1600 in my area given the power creep in gyms. I rarely see anything at the bottom of a developed gym less than 2800 CP, unless it&amp;#39;s a Blissey.
