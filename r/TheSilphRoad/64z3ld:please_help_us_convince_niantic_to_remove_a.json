But the address for portals with physical danger - https://support.ingress.com/hc/fr/requests/new?ticket_form_id=164378 - goes to a blank page, and as I'm not located in the area, I can't do it from the application itself directly.\n\nThe PokeStop is located at \"Grands Moulins de Paris\" in Marquette-lez-Lille (59520, France), it's an old flour mill, here is the exact GPS address and a photo if it can help Niantic :\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grands_Moulins_de_Paris_(Marquette-lez-Lille)\nhttp://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/pokemon-go-la-mairie-de-marquette-craint-un-accident-ia22b49744n3658872\n\nAccording to the journalist who wrote the article, it should be this one (pointed with the mouse, named in Ingress \"Boy in Black\"):\nhttps://twitter.com/valeryan24/status/852468353230934019\n\nIf someone has an idea how to contact Ingress / Pokemon Go / Niantic, you're welcome :)\n\nI'm not sure how exactly reports were made by the mayor / journalists, if \"safety\" label was well checked, nor if the owner has been involved (there will be soon a new one), just the first answer from Niantic in August 2016, telling that for them \"there is no danger\", proves they well read a report clearly stating there was a risk, they can't ignore the situation.\n\nConcerning the modification of OpenStreetMap tags on the area, very good idea, I just added them, hoping I didn't make any error (I never edited OSM since now, I put the suggested tags landuse=construction and access=restricted).\n\nThe location is :\nhttp://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=50.67209%2C3.05655 (click on Hauts-de-France, France on the left bottom column)\n\nIt is a very large site, in addition to holes there are fires, squatters, it is difficult for police to securize all the area... definitively not a safe place for young people, so the best is to not attract more of them here with a PokeStop, and spawn point(s) has to be (re)moved, too.\n\nhttps://www.francebleu.fr/infos/societe/dangereuse-chasse-aux-pokemon-dans-une-friche-industrielle-pres-de-lille-1470070048\nhttp://www.nordeclair.fr/48451/article/2017-03-30/squats-et-incendies-aux-grands-moulins-de-paris-le-maire-alerte\n\nYes, the tweet I sent to new account NianticHelp was the fifth of a conversation, because I discovered the article about dangerous PokeStop in the time I was writing other tweets and made research on PokemonGo, so I added it to the 4 initially planned. As there is no section on Niantic support site for \"feature requests\", I didn't want to pollute their reports dedicated to PokeStop or spoofing and thought this help Twitter account was perfect for my minor improvements ideas (esthetic addition, ergonomy, game rewards that I'd like to get...).\n\nBut as the link I provided was in French and perhaps not useful for them, I wrote this whole translation here to explain in detail the situation, after a short discussion with the journalist involved.\n\nYes, I'm an active player (as I said level 36), I read some arguments saying everyone should assume their acts. It's true for responsible adults, but unfortunately teenagers love braving the danger, even at the risk of their lives, and role of the city / society is to protect them, even against themselves.\n\nFor example, in center of my big town (Toulouse), near a park with lots of Pokestops, there is a militar basis, with one PokeStop just at the front (available to spin from the pavement) and one inside the basis, which entry is completely forbidden for the public. I sometimes spin the one outside, but I never thought (and will never) try to enter the basis (even if the second is not far from the street) to get it and trespass in a private area, with high risk to be arrested.\n\nI also don't report the PokeStop to Niantic because it's in a non-public site, if soldiers are happy with it, so much better for them, I don't care ; if not they own the location, it's their role to make a report.\n\nSituation is not the same with the PokeStop described here, as in addition to forbidden access, there is a real matter of public security.\n\nHappy Pokemon Go Eggstravaganza to everyone !", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll make a global post to answer all the good questions and comments, it will avoid to spam the thread with 20 messages, thanks again for all your suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, as advised and as I also have an Ingress account, I wanted to do myself a report for the portal concerned, with a short message insisting on security and link to this thread.
