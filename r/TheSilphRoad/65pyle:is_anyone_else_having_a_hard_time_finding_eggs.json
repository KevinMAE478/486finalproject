Used a few blue incubators on 2ks to clear spots and get 5-10s. Walk walk walk. Hatched 2ks. Got more 2ks. Lateher rinse repeat. Basically blew through all 8 blue incubators. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday: Then I mostly stopped getting eggs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today: have 5 2ks left. Go out hunting at a local mall (parking lot has tons of mon but is not a safe place to walk except Sunday morning when everything is closed). Spinning stops as I go. No eggs. Hatch all five 2ks. Basket empty. Head back toward home, decide to hit pokestop farm again because I have few balls left.
