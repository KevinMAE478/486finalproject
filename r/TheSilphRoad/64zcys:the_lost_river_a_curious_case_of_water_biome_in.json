First, please forgive me if my english is a bit weird or academic, i&amp;#39;m french as you can see above and only learnt it at school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to tell you about a strange spawn pattern I found close to my place in Paris recently. I walk on the same street everyday twice a day, and I noticed a few month ago that one Pokestop in particular would always have a Magikarp around it, whereas the biome in the neighborhood is the boring Pidgey/Rattata stuff that we get here in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought it was just RNG or something, but, curiously enough, it only spawned Magikarps and nothing else, contrary to a nest or a Pokestop with rare spawns, as you sometimes get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t really think about it until recently. Last Sunday, since I had some time ahead of me, I tried to map the area of Magikarp spawn, and I was quite surprised to find out it made sort of a broken line across the 5th and 13h districts of Paris. Just to confirm, I cheated a bit and went to a french tracker, as you can see on the picture below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://hpics.li/8f9f694\"&gt;http://hpics.li/8f9f694&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching this, this sort of a line reminded me of something: if you ever visited Paris, you do know that the Seine river is flowing through the city. However, there used to be a second smaller river, flowing across the left side of the Seine: the Bi\u00e8vre river. If you speak french ever so slightly, you can read Wikipedia about it, it&amp;#39;s quite well written (&lt;a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi%C3%A8vre_(affluent_de_la_Seine)\"&gt;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi%C3%A8vre_(affluent_de_la_Seine)&lt;/a&gt;, the english article is a bit crappy), but to make a long story short: this river was covered during the 19th century and now flows underground. As you can see on the right of the picture linked above, the former river and the Magikarp spawn pattern seem to fit quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it will certainly not give you any XP or help you get a Dragonite, I thought this observation was quite nice when it came to understanding how biomes were generated: there has to be some automatic process in that, considering the huge area covered by Pokemon Go. However, this type of pattern strongly suggests that Niantic does modify biomes in quite an intricate and clever way, to fit to the history of a certain place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you found that interesting.

Our city is huge and it has a perhaps innumerable quantity of underground rivers that unfortunately were buried during a long expansion period (there is a lusophone short-documentary on this matter in youtube: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwh-cZfWNIc\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwh-cZfWNIc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do have an interest on the subject and I know about some of those underground rivers. I&amp;#39;ve noticed some water spawns far from mapped water bodies, but didn&amp;#39;t really give it much attention. Nonetheless, during the water event I captured a Lapras in a street where there used to be a river, and I did notice that -- by the way, there is no water mapped in a 1km radius of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might just be a single water biome spawn point or RNG, but now that I&amp;#39;ve found this Paris precedent I will definitely give this some attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit - typos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg68zgf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048301.0, "created_utc": 1492019501.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zcys", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zcys", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zcys", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg84m00", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shiranui85", "parent_id": "t1_dg6q9zg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're right, someone marked the \"dry pool\" around the tower as \"natural\"=\"water\" even if I had never seen water in it, except when it rains haha.

I was finding Omanyte every morning going to work, Staryu, Magikarp and one of my 10k eggs hatched led to my first ever Lapras from there. Spots 2,4,5 although related (especially 2) to the river have never yielded anything interesting other than a Nidorana and that was located outside a gym, marked as a red/orange box in the top right corner.  \n  \n  \n[Map 2](http://i.imgur.com/12Acckp.png) is the northern continuation of said river, again never visible to the naked eye yet  harbouring very interesting spawns across its visible tracks. Pre-tracker and with GPS drift, i was able to pick up Omanyte, Magikarp, Psyduck, Staryu at position 2 which is a complete dead-end in terms of biome - nothing of interest, a stranded junction, *apart from the fact that it lies on this river*. This spawn point ceased to exist after the tracker/spawning on stops was introduced. All other stops in the area, apart from area 5 have never yielded water-based mons and yet stop 1 has yielded 2 chanseys, and stop 5 has spawned, in the past, Dragonair and Dratini. Stop 5 is a collection of spawn points in a park with a fountain/water feature and a church. Greek maps are inundated with churches and most of them have been converted to pokestops/gyms. I work in area 4 so i have extensive knowledge of the surrounding areas as well as commuting to and fro everyday, mentally recording spawns of note and oddities.
