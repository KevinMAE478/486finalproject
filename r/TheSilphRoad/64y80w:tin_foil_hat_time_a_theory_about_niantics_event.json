Tin is cheaper than aluminum, but aluminum is replacing tin.\n\n2. Aluminum is stronger and used for industrial purposes and for other industries, such as aerospace or automobiles.\n\n3. Tin is most commonly used for plating steel sheets.\n\n4. Aluminum is more abundant in nature when compared to tin.\n\n5. Tin is weaker compared to aluminum, which is much stronger and more lightweight than tin.\"\n\n(You might ask why is tin cheaper if aluminum if \"tin is rarely found on Earth, as it is the 49th most abundant metal; whereas aluminum is the 3rd most abundant metal and the 9th most abundant element on Earth, found almost everywhere\"? Because it is much more difficult and expensive to extract aluminum from ore than tin. But it is much less expensive to extract from recycled aluminum.)\n\n\n[Why were the Romans at all interested in conquering Britain?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_sources_and_trade_in_ancient_times) Tin. Because Britain was the primary known ancient European source of tin, which was one of the two ingredients of bronze, as in \"The Bronze Age.\"\n\n&gt; \"[T]he only Bronze Age object from Central Europe whose tin has been scientifically provenanced is the [Nebra sky disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebra_sky_disk), and its tin (and gold, though not its copper), is shown by tin isotopes to have come from Cornwall. In addition, a rare find of a pure tin ingot in Scandinavia was provenanced to Cornwall. Available evidence, though very limited, thus points to Cornwall as the sole early source of tin in Central and Northern Europe.\"\n\nEDIT: moar\n\nEDIT2: moar and moar", "edited": 1492028189.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/56563/why-do-we-sometimes-call-aluminum-foil-tin-foil\"&gt;Why Do We Sometimes Call Aluminum Foil &amp;quot;Tin Foil&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt; (at Mental Floss) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the early part of the 20th century, most of the foil produced was, in fact, made of tin.  ... In 1926, the U.S. Foil Company (the parent company of Reynolds Metals) introduced aluminum foil. It was an immediate hit.  ... So even though tin foil has been out of vogue for almost 80 years, some people still cling to that name\u2014maybe because it has three less syllables than aluminum, or maybe because that\u2019s what grandma always called it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Aluminum foil was much more expensive than tin foil for many years after its introduction, and took some years to catch on. So in the early days of science fiction, &amp;#39;tin foil&amp;#39; would have been more common phrase, as well as being easier to say.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat#Origin\"&gt;&amp;#39;Tin Foil Hat&amp;#39; origin at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;The concept of a foil hat for protection against interference of the mind was mentioned in a science fiction short story by Julian Huxley, &amp;quot;The Tissue-Culture King&amp;quot;, first published in 1927, in which the protagonist discovers that &amp;quot;caps of metal foil&amp;quot; can block the effects of telepathy.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.differencebetween.net/object/difference-between-aluminum-and-tin/\"&gt;The Difference between Aluminum and Tin (at &amp;#39;Difference Between&amp;#39;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tin is cheaper than aluminum, but aluminum is replacing tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum is stronger and used for industrial purposes and for other industries, such as aerospace or automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tin is most commonly used for plating steel sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum is more abundant in nature when compared to tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tin is weaker compared to aluminum, which is much stronger and more lightweight than tin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(You might ask why is tin cheaper if aluminum if &amp;quot;tin is rarely found on Earth, as it is the 49th most abundant metal; whereas aluminum is the 3rd most abundant metal and the 9th most abundant element on Earth, found almost everywhere&amp;quot;? Because it is much more difficult and expensive to extract aluminum from ore than tin. But it is much less expensive to extract from recycled aluminum.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_sources_and_trade_in_ancient_times\"&gt;Why were the Romans at all interested in conquering Britain?&lt;/a&gt; Tin. Because Britain was the primary known ancient European source of tin, which was one of the two ingredients of bronze, as in &amp;quot;The Bronze Age.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[T]he only Bronze Age object from Central Europe whose tin has been scientifically provenanced is the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebra_sky_disk\"&gt;Nebra sky disk&lt;/a&gt;, and its tin (and gold, though not its copper), is shown by tin isotopes to have come from Cornwall. In addition, a rare find of a pure tin ingot in Scandinavia was provenanced to Cornwall. Available evidence, though very limited, thus points to Cornwall as the sole early source of tin in Central and Northern Europe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: moar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: moar and moar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg6ey7t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054440.0, "created_utc": 1492025640.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y80w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5z8ut", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mikehaydon1", "parent_id": "t1_dg5xucd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We've always called it al-foil.
