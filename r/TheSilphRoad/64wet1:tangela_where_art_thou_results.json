The survey was open from noon GMT for roughly 18 hours, captured 1200+ responses. The timezone allowed for good coverage across the globe as it was open during daytime or evening in most places. (Love London for this). However, given TSR\u2019s subscriber base, North America, Canada and European responses predominated, so I represent the information as percentages.\nQuestions were:\n* Rough latitude\n* Rough gauge of how frequently Tangela is spotted in the wild. \n* Egg hatches were excluded on the basis that, anecdotally, in areas where Tangela is very rare, it does still hatch from eggs and is the predominant way for trainers to get hold of the Purple One&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/7Bs6f?\"&gt;Table with results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above 50N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tangela\u2019s rarity increases sharply with 83% of respondents above this latitude reporting 1 or no wild sightings. This population also report rare hatches, no nests and this being the last Mon to complete their regional dex. My theory is that the key differentiator vs other rare\u2019ish spawns is the fact that Tangela does not nest \u2013 Scyther is similarly rare in the wild in my biome, but does nest (if infrequently).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if Tangela was purely a latitudinal spawn, we would expect this to be consistent, but 16% above this latitude report some (if rare sightings) and a very small 0.3% report an abundance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abundant sightings were reported for the forests in Northern Sweden and Northern Norway. This is extremely interesting and warrants further study as a) it is cold there, very cold and b) it is north, very north.  This is our first hint that there is more to Tangela than latitude, but also that it does not necessarily only spawn in warmer areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between 40 and 50N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;55% of respondents report Tangela as very rare, but for 45% it is fairly to very common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aha you say, there\u2019s a magical line at 41.xN that Tangela does not cross! I give you Portland, Oregon,  Jersey, Channel Islands and the western Coast of France, all report more frequent sightings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we can also start observing a potential influence of biome on spawns. Barcelona (41N, 2E) has regular spawns, but Madrid (40N, 3.7W) has none. It may be that these two cities lie on either side of a longitudinal line, but then London falls right in the middle between the two longitudinally, and the spawns in this city is super rare. So my interpretation is that biome has an influence on the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South of 40N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a clear increase in abundance and decline in rarity the further south one ventures, but in each latitudinal channel there are reports of extreme rarity and abundance, further pointing to biome influencing the results. Respondents were predominantly from above 40N (given TSR\u2019s subscribers I guess), so the sample sizes are smaller but no less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, these anomalies highlight the biome point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretoria (25.7S, 28.2E) and Johannesburg (26.2S, 28.04E) are 50km apart yet Pretoria reports rare sightings where Johannesburg reports some in parks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo (35.6N, 139.7E) has abundance, but Chigasaki (35.3N, 139.4E) has less of an abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A traveller in Australia reports: \u201cIt&amp;#39;s very rare for me to see them North of Sydney, but you can draw a line South East from around Windsor, NSW to the Sydney CBD. If I happen to cross that line in my travels, anything South is Tangela city.
