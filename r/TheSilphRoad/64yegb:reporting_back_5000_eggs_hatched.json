(I'm not very savvy with using a calculator so this took alot longer than i expected and i'm getting kinda hungry. lol.)\n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nHere\u2019s wishing everyone good upcoming hatches!\n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nCheers\nian\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Analysis", "id": "64yegb", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 279, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kickasbadas", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64yegb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.TheSilphRoad", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OUxmGW_Ixu1DqhF55ILfGDaNSUegkjbn4tT5debNkGE.jpg?s=05776d75ce4b5f1b867e3c17898059d3", "width": 400, "height": 388}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OUxmGW_Ixu1DqhF55ILfGDaNSUegkjbn4tT5debNkGE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=0ce3fb26a8ef5819318f64fb30be713f", "width": 108, "height": 104}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OUxmGW_Ixu1DqhF55ILfGDaNSUegkjbn4tT5debNkGE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=3ff593215e48075533be56a89808eb7f", "width": 216, "height": 209}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OUxmGW_Ixu1DqhF55ILfGDaNSUegkjbn4tT5debNkGE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e198aa376f3d74d10e35adc45717fd9c", "width": 320, "height": 310}], "variants": {}, "id": "9RliZQ3zWnl5qfkV4hUnBOBYYEwf0_XnAnKjaW_3GUY"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "edited": 1492007541.0, "link_flair_css_class": "analysis", "author_flair_css_class": "southeast-asia-volcano", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/64yegb/reporting_back_5000_eggs_hatched/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035314.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/64yegb/reporting_back_5000_eggs_hatched/", "author_flair_text": "Singapore", "quarantine": false, "title": "Reporting Back @ 5,000 Eggs Hatched", "created_utc": 1492006514.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 160, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 279}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61drm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kickasbadas", "parent_id": "t1_dg607e0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "hahahahhahah!! :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;hahahahhahah!! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg61drm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040408.0, "created_utc": 1492011608.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7aola", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kickasbadas", "parent_id": "t1_dg75v7c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "this exactly!

Everything worse off (like Dragon Claw) then gets &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, i arrived at this naming system quite organically. you see, the first 3 Dragonites i evolved learnt Steel Wing when i badly wanted DB/DC, so in a fit of fury, i named them all with the last letter &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;. When i learnt that SW/DP was the best defender\n(pre Gen2), then my sole SW/DP Dragon got upgraded to &amp;quot;HD&amp;quot;. When i finally evolved a DB/DC one, ahh.... that&amp;#39;s when &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; marks the spot, lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Collectively, this lets me know at a quick glance, which Pok\u00e9mon to select, which have good skillsets, which ones I need to work hard at evolving more of and which ones could be sent to the professor if i&amp;#39;m in need of space. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg744x6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084946.0, "created_utc": 1492056146.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7au4c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kickasbadas", "parent_id": "t1_dg6n9ry", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "sweet nickname HugeSpaghettiMonster! \n\nbtw, i replied the naming thing above. \n\n", "edited": 1492076560.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;sweet nickname HugeSpaghettiMonster! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;btw, i replied the naming thing above. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg7au4c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492099202.0, "created_utc": 1492070402.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6n9ry", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HugeSpaghettiMonster", "parent_id": "t1_dg69nat", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yup I'm curious too on his naming convention.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yup I&amp;#39;m curious too on his naming convention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg6n9ry", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492063549.0, "created_utc": 1492034749.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69nat", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Absolute_Animal", "parent_id": "t1_dg61ckq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do the letters represent, after the names?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do the letters represent, after the names?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheSilphRoad", "name": "t1_dg69nat", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048978.0, "created_utc": 1492020178.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c2d7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yegb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74dxr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kickasbadas", "parent_id": "t1_dg6a3f3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheSilphRoad", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol!

I, too love reading and talking \"shop\" and have no one else to discuss with, so Silph Road is greatly appreciated.  It was very kind of you to go into great detail and I am sure your response may help other high quantity hatchers out there.\n\nI am stunned and still processing all of the great advice you've shared about your numerical groupings.  It will take me a bit of time to determine if I can incorporate it into my playing style and mindset.\n\nPokemon Go is my first experience with Pokemon, so I am learning from scratch and solo.  Once I found this subreddit, I have become more informed, and have overcome my fear of gyms to really enjoying battling and prestiging.\n\nThat said, my thinking is NO WHERE near as organized as yours!  I do heed  the great advice I read here, such as preparing for Gen 2, I hoarded candy and saved all high IV examples of the Pokemon who evolved in Gen 2, such as all Polis/Porys/Chanseys/etc.  So, I was well prepared when Gen 2 was released and had good luck with the evolution items.  But, because of my lack of knowledge and experience, I had no idea which would be actually useful in gyms.  \n\nTBH, After preparing and waiting , I have been underwhelmed with those specific Pokemon!

I, too love reading and talking &amp;quot;shop&amp;quot; and have no one else to discuss with, so Silph Road is greatly appreciated.

Once I found this subreddit, I have become more informed, and have overcome my fear of gyms to really enjoying battling and prestiging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, my thinking is NO WHERE near as organized as yours!  I do heed  the great advice I read here, such as preparing for Gen 2, I hoarded candy and saved all high IV examples of the Pokemon who evolved in Gen 2, such as all Polis/Porys/Chanseys/etc.  So, I was well prepared when Gen 2 was released and had good luck with the evolution items.  But, because of my lack of knowledge and experience, I had no idea which would be actually useful in gyms.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TBH, After preparing and waiting , I have been underwhelmed with those specific Pokemon!
