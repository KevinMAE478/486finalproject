Hacker News readers reported the issue as well: \n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14111499\n\n###Are we good to go?\n\nYep - a fix has been pushed already, and a refresh will clear things up if you experienced this.\n\nThis was very bad thing to have happen on Unpkg's infrastructure.  We unfortunately don't feel confident using them for our .js CDN moving forward and have elected to use CDNjs instead for the Atlas effective immediately.\n\n###How can we prevent this?\n\nIn order to prevent this from occurring again (despite this being an extremely rare thing to happen on any sizable CDN) we'll be pulling our .js includes off *all* CDNs and will self-host the scripts instead.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these terms, CDNs are 'Content Distribution Networks' that simply host files.  Files that we \"include\" in the Atlas to help make the map.  In this case, the file includes were hacked on their servers to point to the wrong file.\n\n###How's Iceland?\n\nWell thanks for asking!  Amazing place - beautiful.\n\nAlso, finally saw a Mr. Mime shadow on the Nearby and drove the rental car with the Mrs shouting directions riding shotgun.  It disappeared and we rushed the final 90 seconds to where we remembered it last.  It popped up!  Wife caught it.  I ... didn't. Bah.

Hacker News readers reported the issue as well: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14111499\"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14111499&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Are we good to go?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep - a fix has been pushed already, and a refresh will clear things up if you experienced this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was very bad thing to have happen on Unpkg&amp;#39;s infrastructure.  We unfortunately don&amp;#39;t feel confident using them for our .js CDN moving forward and have elected to use CDNjs instead for the Atlas effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How can we prevent this?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent this from occurring again (despite this being an extremely rare thing to happen on any sizable CDN) we&amp;#39;ll be pulling our .js includes off &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; CDNs and will self-host the scripts instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with these terms, CDNs are &amp;#39;Content Distribution Networks&amp;#39; that simply host files.  Files that we &amp;quot;include&amp;quot; in the Atlas to help make the map.  In this case, the file includes were hacked on their servers to point to the wrong file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How&amp;#39;s Iceland?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well thanks for asking!
