However, one CU in each SE is disabled: it allows processors with small defects to still make their way into final consoles (fully enabled chips are available only for developers in the new Scorpio dev kit). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That explains why the Scorpio dev kit has 44 CU. It&amp;#39;s basically the off the shelf Scorpio chip with the remaining 4 CU left activated. Since they&amp;#39;re basically for overheads leaving them, on even with minor defects, isn&amp;#39;t really a problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dgb6s4r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319804.0, "created_utc": 1492291004.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xbci", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j0cp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xbci", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j0cp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgt16", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChunkyThePotato", "parent_id": "t1_dgb4sn6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xboxone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The main thing is that it'll significantly reduce the draw call load on the CPU, freeing it up to do other tasks.
