Does the map help or hurt these choices? What changes to the team do we make when they&amp;#39;re winning 2-0? Which Titan&amp;#39;s abilities are optimal for countering the enemy team&amp;#39;s strategy? And so on. If a stryder/&amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; Titan chassis could equip Scorch&amp;#39;s flame shield... that&amp;#39;d completely throw things off balance and change everything. This way, there are dedicated classes for different powers and Titan types, and people get to have more fun with varying themes emodied by each Titan (people, including myself, love Scorch because it arguably has one of the highest skill ceilings of the Titans, and that makes it incredibly powerful and fun).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And lastly, Titanfall doesn&amp;#39;t need to justify flames coming from the ground or a shield that stops things in their path and throws them back with even more velocity and power. It&amp;#39;s a giant mech game and all the various types of weapons are so creatively thought out that no other FPS compares in amount of sheer fun it is to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay I&amp;#39;m done I swear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dg8mroj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492165858.0, "created_utc": 1492137058.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8jagp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "falconbox", "parent_id": "t1_dg8bilp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xboxone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't like the huge variations of titans in Titanfall 2.
