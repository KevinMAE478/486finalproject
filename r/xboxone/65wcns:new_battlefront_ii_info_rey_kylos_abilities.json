This wasn\u2019t supposed to be showcased at all to the wider public and the video is likely to be removed soon by Electronic Arts, but it does contain some interesting stuff, chiefly a brief look at a melee system that seems heavily borrowed from Battlefield 1\u2019s with a character ambushing another from behind with a vibroblade or electrostaff. On the multiplayer side, it was confirmed that characters may use various gadgets and customizable droids to fight.\nGame Director Mark Thompson said that Battlefront II\u2019s campaign will deal with unanswered questions that fans have been thinking about since The Return of the Jedi, such as \u2018What happened to the galaxy between the Death Star and Starkiller base?\u2019 and \u2018What happened to the Empire without an Emperor\u2019?\n\n&gt;He also added that a Battlefront story had to be told from a soldier\u2019s perspective. Then the video shifted to a brief interview with actress Janina Gavankar, who gave her likeness and voice to main protagonist Iden Versio. She said:\n\n&gt;\"Iden has been trained to be a leader since she was a child. She had a natural ability, mostly because her father was a high-ranking officer in the Empire. She had somebody to look up to.\n\n&gt;Watching Inferno Squad go through their trials and tribulations while they\u2019re trying to do what they believe is good, is what you\u2019re going to experience.\"\n\n&gt;A hint of what happened to the Empire after Palpatine died was also shown in the video. We can see a Sentinel droid model delivering a prerecorded posthumous message from Palpatine: \u2018Operation Cinder is to begin at once\u2019. This was a contingency plan that ordered the attack of several worlds, starting with Naboo; it\u2019s likely that Battlefront II will showcase Inferno Squad deployed to these scenarios.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s not all, though.
