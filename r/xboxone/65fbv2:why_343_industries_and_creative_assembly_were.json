class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Halo Wars 2 wasn&amp;#39;t a very good game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i think thats fair, but to also be fair i think making a very good console rts is a high order to fill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so for me it has a solid place in my game line up and ill probalby be coming back to here it here and there for the foreseeable future. after a while i just need a game that isnt a shooter, rpg, button masher, or story based (whatever you call something in the vein of tomb raider or uncharted). i think halo wars 2 is a good game to mix up things from that and righ tnow its actually my top game in rotation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dga4bw4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created":
