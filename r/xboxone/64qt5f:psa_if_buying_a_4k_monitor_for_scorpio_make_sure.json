But basically, what it means:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a decent amount of new monitors, there is a feature called freesync&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a new version of vsync that only works on AMD chipsets. When used, it causes the refresh rate of the monitor to match the current frame rate of the game, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This eliminates screen tearing as normal, but reduces input delay and allows for inbetween frame rates (since normal vsync is 30/60)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the monitor, this can be capped to only work over display port (a more and more common monitor cable, equivalent to HDMI but often capable of transfering more data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also (not relevant here, but on PC), freesync chips can be used to increase monitor refresh rate up to it&amp;#39;s dynamic cap, if you have the hardware to do so. For example, I have an nvidia GPU, so I can&amp;#39;t make use of the dynamic vsync, but I still use it to get 75fps instead of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Fixed a few minor mistakes/typos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dg4a6qr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947856.0, "created_utc": 1491919056.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xbci", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qt5f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4do1p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "droillest", "parent_id": "t1_dg49bna", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xboxone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're good! you'll still get the 4k etc but just not the extra features that freesync offers on monitors only.
