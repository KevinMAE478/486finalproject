The big shift IMO was that servers started becoming a paid service. Xbox Live and PSN are run by MS and Sony, not the community.. and they don't give a damn if you're a little shit, they want you to keep playing and keep paying.

All these kids (and plenty of older people) found they could treat others like complete and utter trash with *no repercussions whatsoever*. Scream, swear, tell you to kill yourself, tell you you're trash and should uninstall.

People have *literally* been talked into suicide by these monsters.\n\nAll this in a *game* we play *to relax*. For *fun*. I don't know about you but sometimes I feel pretty shitty and fire up a game to cheer myself up. Getting told I'm awful and should hang myself? Not conducive to that goal.\n\nEven those who don't just scream about fucking your mother or telling you how you need to kill yourself often act like 5-year-olds on a playground. I am literally in a CS match as I type this, with voice on because I was just playing a comp match and didn't turn it off yet. Some kid is yelling \"PATRICK.. PATRICK.. PATRICK...\" at someone, who is screaming at him to shut up. Another is screaming for no reason. One more is making sure to hit his mic as he coughs and splutters. Someone else is playing rap music.
