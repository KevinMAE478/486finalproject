The screen shows the frame it previously rendered again and waits the full 33.33 milliseconds. This causes [stuttering](https://i.gyazo.com/c59a289b168103b3e301d2cab8f2390a.gif) in games and for a moment it feels like you're playing at 30fps instead of 60.\n\n2.

Displays don't refresh all their pixels simultaneously, rather it starts with the top line of pixels, then goes on to the second line. So it's showing an image, then halfway through it starts showing a different image.\n\nA variable refresh rate is that the screen doesn't update the image at set intervals. It waits until it receives a new frame and then immediately renders it. So say you're playing at 60fps, then your screen will refresh at 60Hz. Then it drops to 55fps, which makes your screen drop down to 55Hz.

There is too much going on and the game only sends a new frame after say 17.3 milliseconds. By this time the display has started refreshing its image. This is where there used be two options :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen shows the frame it previously rendered again and waits the full 33.33 milliseconds. This causes &lt;a href=\"https://i.gyazo.com/c59a289b168103b3e301d2cab8f2390a.gif\"&gt;stuttering&lt;/a&gt; in games and for a moment it feels like you&amp;#39;re playing at 30fps instead of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the image go through as soon as it can, which causes &lt;a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eca45d7d1e44a2f78541c27fe49f5e28fe66be0e/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f333738393232362f3439323436372f34323630643034612d626162322d313165322d383731662d3338316536343163336538332e706e67\"&gt;screen-tearing&lt;/a&gt;. Displays don&amp;#39;t refresh all their pixels simultaneously, rather it starts with the top line of pixels, then goes on to the second line. So it&amp;#39;s showing an image, then halfway through it starts showing a different image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A variable refresh rate is that the screen doesn&amp;#39;t update the image at set intervals. It waits until it receives a new frame and then immediately renders it. So say you&amp;#39;re playing at 60fps, then your screen will refresh at 60Hz. Then it drops to 55fps, which makes your screen drop down to 55Hz. Then when it goes up to 60fps the screen goes back to 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It continuously keeps the two in sync, which offers a much smoother gaming experience..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dg4vk96", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971604.0, "created_utc": 1491942804.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4rdkc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "monstere316", "parent_id": "t3_64qq0v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xboxone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can someone ELI5?
