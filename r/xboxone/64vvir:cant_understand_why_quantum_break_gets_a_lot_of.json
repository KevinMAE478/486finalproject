This game, along with games like Alan Wake do them the wrong way. The collectibles are these notes most of the time that are very dry reads and to get them you basically just have to walk over and hit the A button if you see a glimmer off to the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like blitzboom said, the Arkham games did a good job with collectibles as there was a fun task or challenge that was associated with getting them. The same could be said for Assassins Creed games where you have to find some unusual path to get up to certain collectibles that you wouldn&amp;#39;t normally take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its boring when you just have to wander aimlessly hoping to see a random glimmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dg60uxr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039834.0, "created_utc": 1492011034.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xbci", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vvir", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65k0m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Robalypse", "parent_id": "t1_dg5o3a1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xboxone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think reading over and over about the collectibles in Alan Wake is why I passed on that game.
