These comments around $299 are comical.  If you honestly think it will sell for $299, the same as a Switch that uses a Tegra mobile processor, I&amp;#39;m not sure what to say.  The R&amp;amp;D and tech that has gone into the Scorpio is phenomenal at a console level.  It is NOT a console for everyone.  That is the S.  The Scorpio is for more serious tech junkies and hardcore gamers.
