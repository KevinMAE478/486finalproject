The part that everyone is raving about is the fact that Turn 10 has done this, at max settings, and still managed a solid 4K60 with plenty of room to spare after only 2 days of porting with next to no platform specific optimisation. Not even a GTX 1070 can do that on the PC optimised version of Forza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, the Forza engine is one of the best examples of an engine that is incredibly well optimised for the Xbox and I would like to see a more popular engine like Unreal or Frostbite ported to see what kind of performance gains they can achieve, but for now, what the ForzaTech demo shows us is extremely promising. It shows Scorpio is far more than just the sum of its parts and will likely be able to keep up with many high end PC rigs of today in the graphical quality department. That alone is enough cause for excitement in the console community. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just be patient, we&amp;#39;ll see what it can do with other engines before long.
