Resolution is FAR from everything when it comes to graphics. And far less important then people here seem to think. Untill we have the power to run games a 4k with maxed graphics then its a waste of time. Look at 4k games on the PS4 pro now. They look far far worse then their 1080p version because to have them run at a playable framerate at 4k requires almost all the graphic settings lowered. It will be the exact same on the scoripo or even a high end PC as of todays hardware. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xboxone", "name": "t1_dgdbaw2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492450626.0, "created_utc": 1492421826.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdaunu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ocbdare", "parent_id": "t1_dgd5k6s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xboxone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A 1080p/120fps display is a waste to me.
