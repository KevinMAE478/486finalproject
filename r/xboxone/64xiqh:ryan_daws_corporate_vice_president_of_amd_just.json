An rx 480 is more than capable for VR on PC.  you might not be able to super sample much,  but that&amp;#39;s not such a big deal.  The cpu might be the limiting factor.   One you start to increase frame rate, the cpu becomes a limiting factor.  Doing 4k at 60fps may be easier for a cpu than doing 1080 at 90 fps.  The scorpio looks like it may run off of AMD&amp;#39;s old jaguar architecture, which could be a limiting factor.  60 fps is more likely to cause sickness which is why the rift and vive went with 90.  Anyway, i hope i cleared some things up.
