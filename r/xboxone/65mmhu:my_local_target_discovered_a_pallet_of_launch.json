Probably 2-4 in a normal-looking cardboard box rather than the ones you see, for reasons. \n* There's no space ANYWHERE in the warehouse, so the case gets put up on the eighth shelf like fifteen feet off the ground. Because inventory tetris is a *real thing,* they put them in longways against the back of the shelf, probably behind something else. It is now completely impossible to see unless you're on a ladder.\n* The pull-scheduling system has them pull from every other location with Xboxes, because it's smart enough to know that pulling from the location that you need a ladder for is going to take longer, and big retail cares about nothing as much as they care about labor efficiency.\n* The Xboxes sit there unpulled until the Kinect bundle goes on clearance. The guy who's pulling clearance that day either sees that it's on the eighth shelf and says \"fuck that\" and marks it as an inventory error without looking; or gets halfway up the ladder, doesn't see the box, and marks it as an inventory error; or gets up there and doesn't see it behind the other stuff on the shelf and marks it as an inventory error. (As an aside: we're not supposed to put products behind non-identical products for exactly this reason, but at Christmas you *really* don't have a choice.)\n* Eventually, the location is polled for random audit, or a supervisor who needs hours and has literally nothing else to do goes and manually audits electronics.
