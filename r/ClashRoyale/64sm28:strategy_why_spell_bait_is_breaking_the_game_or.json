I think this can be attributed to the release of the Goblin Gang.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the Goblin Gang is a card that never should have been released with the stats it has right now.\nLet&amp;#39;s analyze it mathematically, using the other &amp;quot;value pack&amp;quot; cards:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeleton Army gives 15/3 = 5 doots/elixir, Skeletons give 4 doots/elixir, so Skeleton Army gives 25% more value than Skeletons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minion Horde gives 6/5 = 1.2 minions/elixir, Minions give 3/3 = 1 minion/elixir, so Minion Horde gives 20% more value than Minions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Musketeers gives 3/9 = 0.33 musketeer/elixir, Musketeer gives 0.25 musketeer/elixir, so Three Musketeers gives 33% more value than Musketeer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, lets look at the Goblin Gang:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Goblin Gang gives 6/3 = 2 goblins/elixir (since spear and stab each costs the same, we will treat them as having the same &amp;quot;elixir value&amp;quot;), while each of the goblin packs separately give 3/2 = 1.5 goblins/elixir. This is 33% more value, &lt;strong&gt;the same percentage gain of the 3 musketeers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you may ask, why is this a problem, it gives the same value profit as the 3 musketeers?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, usually, the game should be like buying stuff in the store. Spending more means you get more value (Ex. buy one get one free, or those discounts you see at Walgreens where you can get 1 drink for $1.25, 2 drinks for $2.25, 3 drinks for $3). The more you spend, the more value you get. This effectively causes cards like the 3 Musketeers and the Minion Horde to be high risk, high reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, Goblin Gang (and even Skeleton Army to an extent), gives more value that a pack that &lt;em&gt;costs more&lt;/em&gt; than it. That&amp;#39;s like saying, hey, you can buy 1 drink for $1, 2 drinks for $1.75, 3 drinks for $3! Obviously you would never buy 3 at a time, because you could just keep buying 2 at a time for maximum value! This effectively causes Goblin Gang and Skeleton Army to be low risk, high reward, which knocks the high risk, high reward cards out of the meta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has caused a huge rise of spell bait, which before the release of Goblin Gang (and the zap nerf), was already healthily in the meta (with Horde, Skeleton Army, Goblin Barrel, Princess). The massive value Goblin Gang just gave it a huge boost to the top, and took away the balance from the game, as it just threw some cards out of the meta. Stab and Spear Goblins are now almost never used, and have dropped to F tier in Clyde&amp;#39;s tier list. Minion Horde is rarely used as well, unless the deck already has the cards that give more value (Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang). I also believe that this is why Mirror found its way back into the meta. Despite giving an automatic negative elixir trade (with the +1 elixir mechanic), it can still give value if played on a Goblin Gang or Skeleton Army, and it can even give more value if you already baited your opponent&amp;#39;s spell(s) with the non-Mirrored version!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Fix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the Skeleton Army, the fix is simple, just revert one of the 2 changes from &lt;a href=\"https://clashroyale.com/blog/release-notes/balance-changes-coming-10-20\"&gt;last October&amp;#39;s balance changes&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe adjust stats accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, for the Goblin Gang, there is no clear fix. It is hard to change the stats because that will alter the stats of the already underused stab and spear goblins. Changing the elixir cost to 4 will kill the card (as it would give 0% more value than each of the goblins). My proposal is to nerf the level of the goblins given (maybe by 2), so it would effectively tone down the stats of the card without nerfing each of the goblins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; - Goblin Gang provides too much value for 3 elixir, out-shadowing the other &amp;quot;value packs&amp;quot; such as minion horde and giving rise to already strong spell bait decks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, any feedback/critique would appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edits: Pretty new to reddit, was experimenting with the formatting and fixing grammar mistakes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Recently, there has been a huge uptick in spell bait decks.
