This is to be expected, because you can face people who are in the 5k trophies, just like you can face people who only just got their deck to tournament level (or sometimes aren&amp;#39;t yet at tournament level). Now that I am a fairly experienced player, I see mistakes that the less experience players make, which I probably didn&amp;#39;t notice back when I was in their shoes (and likely made myself). Here are some of these mistakes I see regularly, and what you can do to fix them. This guide is aimed mostly at the less experienced players, though I do see some of those mistakes on ladder above 4k, so even if you are more experienced, you can do a mental checklist to see whether or not these apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Edit/TL;DR]&lt;/strong&gt; I understand this is a lot of text, but I tried to make the section titles fairly clear, so if you want a TL;DR, just read the section titles. If you feel one might be a mistake you make, or a concept you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with, then read the whole paragraph. If it&amp;#39;s something you already know, then feel free to skip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t repeat the same move, hoping for different results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Situation: Opponent pushes with a Giant and minions. You place an inferno tower for the giant and a musketeer for the minions. Opponent reveals they had lightning and hits your tower, inferno tower and musketeer. That sucks, but it happens. Unless you were playing against a well known meta deck, you probably couldn&amp;#39;t guess that they had lightning. However, if the opponent builds the same push and you try to counter it with inferno tower + musketeer positioned in the exact same way, that&amp;#39;s totally on you. It seems obvious, but I see those mistakes happening constantly.  It&amp;#39;s understandable when you think about it. You practice a given deck a lot, you start finding patterns that work, and since you often have to react quickly, they become automatic. Still, being able to adapt is one of the most important skills you need to develop to get better. In the situation above, learn the anti-lightning positions for inferno tower, or place your musketeer far enough that the opponent can&amp;#39;t hit both it and the i-tower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vary your defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opponent puts ebarbs at the bridge. You surround them with skarmy. Awesome, you countered ebarbs for positive elixir trade! A cycle later, opponent puts ebarbs at the bridge. Are you going to surround them with skarmy again? You probably shouldn&amp;#39;t. Maybe you&amp;#39;re playing against an opponent that didn&amp;#39;t read my first mistake, but you should probably assume that your opponent is playing properly (even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;#39;re playing ebarbs). You should therefore assume that the opponent is expecting skarmy and will have a log/zap ready for it. Maybe they&amp;#39;re going to send a prediction log! You really need to vary your defense when possible. Something as simple as placing skarmy in the middle will mess with a prediction log. Or use a knight this time, since it&amp;#39;s pretty much immune to zap/log. People will usually prepare their next push in a way that counters the defense they know you use, so varying your defense really throws a wrench in their plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same is true for offense in fact. Just because a barrel placement worked well once, doesn&amp;#39;t mean you shouldn&amp;#39;t use a different placement next. Just because a certain push composition worked well doesn&amp;#39;t mean they won&amp;#39;t be prepared for it next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving up early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is more of a mindset issue than a skill issue, but seriously, just because you&amp;#39;re down one tower in the first minute of the game doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re done for. I played a game earlier today. Opponent plays golem in the back. I take this opportunity to push the other lane and it pays off, because I take his tower with little investment (ram + goblin gang). Meanwhile, his golem push deals about 800 on my tower, with me spending all my elixir to defend against it. Opponent rage quits. This is a horrible decision. Opponent saw basically all my deck at this point, because I had to use almost all of it to defend against the push. So they know what they&amp;#39;re up against and can plan a defense to protect their other towers. They still managed to get damage on my tower on their first push of the game (this is actually fairly rare in my experience against golem decks, usually the first push is fairly easy to defend against and is more intended to probe the defense) Sure, I wasn&amp;#39;t at full elixir, since I used some to take down his tower, but there&amp;#39;s a lot of time left, and if I couldn&amp;#39;t fully stop their push at normal elixir, imagine how it will be when they get to double elixir and can completely overwhelm my defense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game as a whole is designed to make it harder to take the second tower (well... generally, though some cards such as 3 musketeer and RG are exceptions to this), to allow come backs. Losing a tower early sucks, but it&amp;#39;s not the end of the world. You have plenty of time left. Not only is it possible to come back, but those games where you lose the tower early, yet still manage to win are the most rewarding and most fun games. Play your games through! If nothing else, it&amp;#39;s extra practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your towers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you see a naked minion hordes coming towards your tower, what are the counters? Most people will immediately think of fireball, arrows, fire spirit, princess, etc. Less experienced players might not think of skeletons, knight or other such cards as a counter. They can&amp;#39;t attack air, right? But your towers can. All you have to do is give your towers enough time and bring the attacking troops to the kill zone where both towers can attack them. Similarly, knight is really good at countering lava pups, just place him right in front of your tower just before the hound explodes. Most, if not all the pups will target the knight while the tower kills them one by one. You don&amp;#39;t always need anti-air troops to deal with flying troops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, the game is about trading elixir for tower damage, and vice versa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t a hard rule about how much damage 1 elixir is worth. It really depends on your deck and on the situation. However, too often I see people spend elixir to defend something that&amp;#39;s not worth defending, or refuse to take tower damage when it would be favorable. For instance, both you and your opponent are fighting in the left lane. Somehow, due to how they positioned their minions while defending, the minions end up flying toward your right tower. Do you zap them? Sure, that&amp;#39;s a +1 elixir advantage and saves your tower damage, but in reality, it&amp;#39;s not the tower they are attacking, so the damage on that tower is likely to be irrelevant. Often, you&amp;#39;re much better off ignoring them and taking the +3 elixir advantage. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some situations where you want to avoid that (for instance, you know you&amp;#39;ll end up trading the towers on the left and it&amp;#39;ll come down to a fight for the right towers... or your opponent has a deck that can easily switch lanes), but at least take the time to consider whether or not you need to counter them. In a similar vein, a princess is moving towards the bridge. You are fairly low on elixir. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; place a knight, so that he soaks up the damage and kills the princess, but since you&amp;#39;re low on elixir, you probably can&amp;#39;t properly turn that into a counter push, so it&amp;#39;ll just end in a neutral trade. Alternatively, you could let the princess lock on your tower and place skeletons. In this case, you&amp;#39;re trading a bit of tower damage in exchange for a +2 elixir advantage &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you get to keep your knight for something more important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, some people are obsessed about elixir advantage. I often see comments like &amp;quot;well, if you&amp;#39;re at an elixir disadvantage, you got outplayed&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s simply not true. If I send a goblin barrel at my opponent&amp;#39;s tower and they ignore it, I&amp;#39;m at a -3 elixir advantage, but I did significant tower damage. In the end, what&amp;#39;s important is to be aware of how big the gap is and how much elixir you need in order to defend your opponent&amp;#39;s push. If, for instance, I know I can defend my opponent&amp;#39;s 8 elixir push with 6 elixir, then I don&amp;#39;t mind falling a bit behind, as long as I make sure that when they have 8 elixir, I have at least 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes, the best defense is an offense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A question that comes up a lot is &amp;quot;how do I defend against [insert huge 15 elixir push]&amp;quot;. The answer generally is &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let the 15 elixir push happen in the first place!&amp;quot; If you constantly put pressure on your opponent, then they have to spend elixir to defend. Elixir they spend defending is elixir they can&amp;#39;t spend on their push. If you see your opponent place a lavahound at the back, and you know your deck has a hard time defending against a lavahound + balloon push, the solution isn&amp;#39;t to wait for the push to come and cross your fingers that you&amp;#39;ll manage a miraculous defense. The solution is to immediately push the other lane. By doing so, you force them into a dilemma. Either they spend elixir defending your push, in which case they won&amp;#39;t have any left to play the balloon, or they go all in and try to race your push. Now, balloon does a lot of damage quickly, but since they started the lavahound in the back and it takes a while for it to reach bridge, let alone your tower, so you have a head start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a guaranteed win for you, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to win you games more often than hoping you can pull off the miraculous defense against a push designed to be hard to defend against. Note that this only applies if your deck is weak to lavaloon to begin with. If your deck has a super easy time defending against lavaloon (e.g., executioner + tornado), then use that, but maybe in turn your deck is weak against golem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This strategy works against any strategy that intends to build a huge push behind a tank. The more you can divert their elixir away from the push, the easier it will be to manage. You might think that you&amp;#39;re wasting elixir that could be used to defend, but generally, what happens is that a small push can be countered with little elixir. A lone golem can be stopped with a single inferno tower. However, big pushes are typically composed of units that protect each other&amp;#39;s weakness, to a point where you can no longer defend at a positive or even neutral elixir trade, or worse, can&amp;#39;t defend at all. A golem with an electro-wiz that resets your inferno tower, and a knight that defends the electro wiz against melee troops, and archers that protect everyone from flying troops... you might not have enough elixir to defend against that! Don&amp;#39;t let that death ball build up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-=edit=- Just a little note on having the right mindset. I know it&amp;#39;s frustrating to face over leveled people. If you face someone with a level 13 RG at 3000 trophies, you&amp;#39;re allowed to be annoyed. However, if you join a challenge or tournament without having tournament level cards, that&amp;#39;s entirely on you. I&amp;#39;m not saying that you shouldn&amp;#39;t join challenges with sub tournament level cards (well, you probably &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; join grand challenges!), but if you&amp;#39;re level 8 with level 7 commons, don&amp;#39;t start BMing people who have tournament level cards and wreck you.

Most of the time you have an advantage on defense assuming you&amp;#39;re at even elixir, and if you can&amp;#39;t generate an advantage a lot of the time, you need to reconsider your deck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashRoyale", "name": "t1_dg6a03z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049347.0, "created_utc": 1492020547.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6mmhx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jjcoola", "parent_id": "t1_dg6jflv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashRoyale", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks so much for actually replying, I'll check your stats out when I get back from work as they block stats royale :( \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for actually replying, I&amp;#39;ll check your stats out when I get back from work as they block stats royale :( &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashRoyale", "name": "t1_dg6mmhx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492062764.0, "created_utc": 1492033964.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg725mf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "El_Derogator", "parent_id": "t1_dg6jflv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashRoyale", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nice deck and solid advice.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice deck and solid advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashRoyale", "name": "t1_dg725mf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492082067.0, "created_utc": 1492053267.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6jflv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Storm1220", "parent_id": "t1_dg6gcib", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashRoyale", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, yeah I use balloon freeze deck.
