It&amp;#39;s the Rum Ham here with a strategy article that I promise will improve your game by hundreds of trophies.  So many games I watch are lost because player&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t know which side of the Doomsday Machine they are on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have an upcoming video on this concept, this article is a way for me to get my thoughts on paper and get feedback from your great minds!  Check out my &lt;a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/therumham\"&gt;Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13Wn-IuMV4i78-bk3A7dzg\"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for more Clash Royale strategy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Doomsday Machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me present a HYPOTHETICAL, NOT A REAL PROPOSAL card to you: a 10 Elixir &lt;em&gt;Legendary Building&lt;/em&gt; with a Lifespan: 90 seconds.  If you have 2 &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Machines&lt;/em&gt; on the field, you win the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this card existed, it would definitely be a strategy that people attempted to win with.  How would you fight this strategy?  If you knew your opponent was going to attempt to put 2 of these together to win the game, you would view the value of your cards differently.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you play Elixir Collector or Furnace? Probably not, since you&amp;#39;re less than 20 Elixir from losing instantly to the Doomsday Machine.  You&amp;#39;ve got to attack, and do it right when they are most vulnerable - when they are investing in building their machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Rum Ham! That card doesn&amp;#39;t exist!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, but ask yourself this question - if your deck was completely an totally uninterrupted, what is the biggest, baddest push you could put together?  In a matchup of any two decks, the bigger, badder push will win in a heads-up fight.  The risky trade-off is that the bigger deck has moments of vulnerability due to the big investments.  But if you don&amp;#39;t attack precisely at those moments.... they build the Doomsday Machine and roll over you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Golem Lightning beats Giant Poison because if uninterrupted they can invest more Elixir into Collectors and 8-cost tanks, then play high-cost, high-impact spells.  If the Giant player answers Collector with Collector, Golem in the back with Giant in the back, and tries to play toe-to-toe with Golem... they will lose.  The Golem player is spending all that time building a Doomsday Machine and the Giant player isn&amp;#39;t trying to disrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assuming freedom to play your cards without disturbance, the player with the offense most capable of winning a heads-up fight holds The Doomsday Machine.  The other player&amp;#39;s path to victory is by attacking at precisely the moments of Doomsday investment. \n If you fail to do this, your opponent will put together their Doomsday Machine and you will lose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two players start off the game not knowing the other&amp;#39;s deck.  Whether or not they realize it, one player is going to benefit more from simply executing their gameplan head-on.  The other player needs to switch into aggro-mode &lt;em&gt;even if their deck is not normally played like that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the biggest mistakes I see is the aggressive player &amp;#39;trading&amp;#39; pushes - waiting until right after the tank is dead to throw down a Hog Rider.  This is how a Doomsday Machine wants to play, hitting you with big punches and taking little jabs back.  You must play for the reactionary attack in response to their investments or you are playing into their hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giant Beatdown vs. 2.6 Hog Cycle&lt;/strong&gt; - The Giant deck has the strongest gameplan: a full Giant + Bowler + Poison + Mega Minion is going to roll over a Cannon + Musketeer.  The Hog Rider player must take a high-tempo gameplan, attacking opposite lanes when the Giant or Bowler is played to win.  These decks naturally fit into the roles of aggressor and big-combo-push.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giant Beatdown vs. Golem&lt;/strong&gt; - Though Giant was the Doomsday Machine against Hog Rider, a Giant-Bowler duo is no match for an all-in Golem push.  Saavy Giant players know they should not play the Giant head-to-head with a Golem - instead Giant turns into a aggressive play at the river.  When Golem is played in the back, that 8 Elixir is answered with a Giant + Mega Minion at the river in the opposite lane.  This aggressive posture is how a Giant deck wins that matchup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LavaLoon&lt;/strong&gt; is a perfect example of a Doomsday Machine against most decks.  12-20 Elixir all flying in the air with Spells to back it up is too much for any defense.  A really common mistake I see is people &amp;#39;trading&amp;#39; pushes - playing a Hog Rider immediately after a defended push.  Since nearly every deck can&amp;#39;t defend the LavaLoon Doomsday Machine, you have to switch your gameplan.  No more tanks in the back, instead bide your time with support troops in the middle, and capitalize when the Hound hits the board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trick is that you don&amp;#39;t know what role you have at the game&amp;#39;s start.  You must figure out their deck, your role in the matchup, and start playing accordingly before your opponent does the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good example of this is Golem vs. LavaLoon matchup.  Unlike Hog Rider or Miner decks, decks that usually assume the aggressive/disruptive role in a game, both of these tank decks entering the game with the assumption the possess the Doomsday Machine.  But when the Lava Hound is dropped in a lane and the Golem is played in the same lane, foreshadowing an upcoming battle... the Lava Hound player knows he is borked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LavaLoon loses to Golem in the same lane - badly.  Probably it&amp;#39;s worst matchup.  The Lava Hound player has made a mistake (without realizing it) by playing the Lava Hound investment in the back.  While his opponent had the Doomsday Machine, he played the equivalent of a Furnace - a weaker investment that isn&amp;#39;t going to disrupt the enemy Doomsday Machine.  The LavaLoon needs to become an aggressive strategy, playing Balloons at the river along with the other air troops to steal a tower when the Golem is played.  Many LavaLoon players can&amp;#39;t break out of the idea that they don&amp;#39;t hold the Doomsday Machine - they keep trying to force their combo on the opponent while the opponent has a better combo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So look at your deck - on a scale of 1-10, how powerful do you think it&amp;#39;s optimal push is compared to all of the things possible in Clash Royale?  At the start of the game, should you be building towards your powerful push or trying to disrupt the others? Are you building a Doomsday Machine or trying to stop your opponent from doing the same?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey gang!

Unfortunately I think they often see a potentially aggressive card like EBarbs, right when it shows a lot of success in the meta, the player base will lose to it a lot, and thus turn &lt;a href=\"/r/ClashRoyale\"&gt;r/ClashRoyale&lt;/a&gt; into a NON-STOP COMPLAINT FACTORY, and Supercell caves and nerfs them into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashRoyale", "name": "t1_dgcf44z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492398250.0, "created_utc": 1492369450.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pz7s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcirvm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AnotherThroneAway", "parent_id": "t3_65pz7s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashRoyale", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Clickbait title delivers.

But sometimes you play against people who can&amp;#39;t stop Hog Rider and then you switch into Doomsday Machine mode - the more Hogs you cast, the more likely to are to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashRoyale", "name": "t1_dgcgjp8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400130.0, "created_utc": 1492371330.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3bog8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pz7s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgceanm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bot_yea", "parent_id": "t1_dgcd7ep", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashRoyale", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If played right.
