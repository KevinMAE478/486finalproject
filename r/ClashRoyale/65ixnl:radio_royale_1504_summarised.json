The upvote for the post that they sort of like is worth just as much as the upvote for the post that they really like. So if a type of content (like memes) is really easy to make and just funny enough to get people to atleast sort of like it, it will probably get more upvotes for 2 reasons one being reddit's voting system The other being the fact that meme posts have a broader audience. Everyone likes jokes. Not everyone plays Hog rider. So if someone makes a guide on hog rider that you happen to really like. A lot of people are likely going to ignore it because they dont play hog. The post that has a broader audience will always get more upvotes. Which is why meme posts are all over the front page. It's not because the community wants their sub to be filled with memes.

Most people who looked at the meme once and then chuckled will probably upvote it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discussion posts will not get as many upvotes because\nThey can be controversial\nSome users arent willing to read it as opposed to a meme where you just have to click on it &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repetitive Salt posts will be popular because\nEveryone hates the 2 cards that people are always complaining about\nThis sub never really seems to get tired of royal giant salt posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strategy posts will naturally get less upvotes because\nNot everyone is interested in what the guide is about (They are often very specific)\nThey are really long and not everyone is willing to read them&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although the community wants a mixture of all of these things some of them are more prominent. So although what is at the front page is what people upvoted for they don&amp;#39;t realize that there are alot more meme posts then there are of anything else because of how easy they are to make. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also what is on the top isnt always what people want on the top\nSome people upvote a post because they like it or find it somewhat funny but they would hate to have a sub filled with content just slightly about average.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is the problem with reddit&amp;#39;s voting system at it&amp;#39;s core. If someone finds a post that they kind of think it&amp;#39;s sort of funny but not really that funny and they upvote it anyways. (which many of us do myself included) Then they find a post that they really like and they upvote that. The upvote for the post that they sort of like is worth just as much as the upvote for the post that they really like. So if a type of content (like memes) is really easy to make and just funny enough to get people to atleast sort of like it, it will probably get more upvotes for 2 reasons one being reddit&amp;#39;s voting system The other being the fact that meme posts have a broader audience. Everyone likes jokes. Not everyone plays Hog rider. So if someone makes a guide on hog rider that you happen to really like. A lot of people are likely going to ignore it because they dont play hog. The post that has a broader audience will always get more upvotes. Which is why meme posts are all over the front page. It&amp;#39;s not because the community wants their sub to be filled with memes. It&amp;#39;s because memes have an insanely broad audience and they are incredibly easy to make one that is atleast somewhat funny.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashRoyale", "name": "t1_dgbl9fn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492340559.0, "created_utc": 1492311759.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbhpv4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Agnt_Michael_Scarn", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2hs6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashRoyale", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You understand that what ends up on the top of the feed is what the people want on the top, right?

However, they prevent me from being more creative and versatile with my deck choices, as I *have* to have multiple counters to each in a deck.  When a single card dictates how you play the game if you want to win, it's taking away from the gameplay experience as a whole.\n\nI don't believe that these tweaks will really change much, as doubling the RG's deploy time won't really effect how it is countered.  It still forces you to react in basically the same way, and since you have to play a building once it's in range anyways, won't give you more leeway in that area.  In my opinion, a way that they could nerf it to make it more manageable but remain viable would be to increase damage and reduce hit speed so that the DPS remains the same, and to reduce its HP by a bit.

They're just trying to make it seem less appealing to play, but a 0.1s delay in the initial hit speed changes nothing.  A rework that i think could work for EB could be a similar approach to what I stated for the RG.  A reduction of HP and hit speed, but an increase in damage.  EB are supposed to be 'high risk, high reward' cards, but at the moment they're really more 'slight risk, guaranteed reward', as opponent's are required to often overspend in order to completely mitigate damage, and it is relatively hard to do so considering the speed at which they attack.  Also, even if the response is a *little* bit late, it's very hard to prevent them from doing huge amounts of damage, as they deal damage so quickly, and can tank a lot of damage before being stopped.  Therefore, another change I think may work would be to actually keep the initial hit speed as it is, increase DPS by a little, and reduce HP by a lot.  This'll actually make it a 'high risk, high reward' card as you risk not doing any damage and giving the opponent an elixir advantage, but stand to gain more in a skillful play of the card.  Right now, it doesn't really require much skill to use the card at a decent level, as playing it basically guarantees  that you either deal a *lot* of damage, throw your opponent's cycle out of whack, or make them spend more elixir than they should need to.\n\nAt the end of the day, let's just hope supercell addresses these imbalances properly soon, as facing the same damn cards over and over is tiring.  People need to stop calling for 'nerfs' or 'buffs', and instead look at how the cards are *balanced* in relation to the other cards.
