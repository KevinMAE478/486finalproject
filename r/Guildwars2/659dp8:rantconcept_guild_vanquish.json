Here\u2019s a bit of background to explain where I\u2019m coming from:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I am a solitary/small group player by nature, it wasn\u2019t long after making my first character that I was roped into a guild and quickly got caught up in more frequent group content. At the time, that was mainly binging dungeons and helping with guild missions. Through my progression from member to leader and back to being too busy to lead, I have done, lead and/or taught just about everything to be done as a guild. World Boss trains, weekly Hero Point trains, major world bosses, dungeons, Fractals, guild missions, WvW, PvP, custom guild activities, you name it. And while anything can become repetitive once it\u2019s turned into a routine, no matter how fun the group, I\u2019ve noticed nothing got stale anywhere &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; as quickly as Guild Missions did. The mission &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; became better organized, but the content itself quickly became something done out of obligation and desire to help all members get their Commendations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I\u2019m not a big fan of relative privation, but I understand that there are a lot of far larger group content sources that demand a lot more attention due to sheer scope and current outstanding issues. I can understand that of all the things to table for the time being, Guild Missions are an easy pick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, guilds are supposed to be a major aspect of the game both mechanically and in the lore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, I\u2019m of the opinion that we\u2019re a few story chapters away from the brand name being more than a reference to GW1 background lore. We seem to be headed there, what with Braham apparently listening to Rox and organizing his version of DE better, and I imagine the Inquest will become a major antagonist when there are few Elder Dragons left, but\u2026 Well, Rytlock said it himself. There really isn\u2019t a Destiny\u2019s Edge anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there isn\u2019t a Dragon\u2019s Watch either. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braham spent so long biting his anger down to focus on the mission at Maguuma that he\u2019s now letting it consume his reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rox is away getting Braham to slowly come to reason and explain to him that gaining the power to give an Elder Dragon cavities is no reason to become the Norn version of emo Venom-bonded Spiderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kasmeer is currently stuck in the background because her presence in any of the recent events would have resulted in instantly exposing deceit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marjory is busy riding piggyback on the floaty goldy guy that is either Lazarus (If the White Mantle is wrong and Caudecus simply had the poisoned aspect), a Seer, or an impostor whom, for all we know, is actually Jean-Baptiste Immanuel Zorg. Because she\u2019s happy to work for the boss, but doesn\u2019t want to be bossed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canach needs some space after being in a really demanding, PUNishing and co-dependent relationship, and he\u2019s only ready to be friends for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncle Trombone is in jail. Probably boredly beating the tar out of everyone in the Bane while Smodur eats popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This pretty much just leaves us with Taimi. Now, while I\u2019m not pleased with having left her alone in Rata Novus after establishing how unsafe it was (I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have doubted any other party member if they wanted to be left alone in Chak Central), she\u2019s in a wonderful spot right now. She\u2019s our ground control, which is great because our spaceship sure doesn\u2019t know which way to go without her. And she\u2019s overcoming her disadvantage by playing to her strengths and assuming a leadership role in a very dangerous situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two does not a guild make. But I\u2019m very interested in what the potential big reunion will be like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And mechanically? Well. We don\u2019t have GvG, and it takes transfer shenanigans to organize that in WvW. Which takes me to the point of this ramble, and a pipe dream/concept I\u2019ve had in mind for a while: &lt;strong&gt;Guild Vanquish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, the content consists of a guild upgrade granting access an instanced version of a major map or part of one, representing a more present time rather than the moment of the story that each is set in. Once purchased, members of a guild are able to access it through their guild hall\u2019s portal. Members can enter on their own and in parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This instance has a high event/enemy density and a meta progress bar with various minor milestones and a major milestone at 33%, 66% and 99%. Progress is reset on a weekly basis, requiring consistent activity or a good push to \u201ccomplete\u201d the instance before it is reset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instanced map is divided into three major regions, divided by extremely dangerous environmental threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each region contains a combination of various forms of PvE content: Simple enemy patrols, a series of events, and roaming champions. As guild members clear infested areas, complete defensive events and defeat scaling champions, the meta progress bar is slowly filled. Upon reaching 33%, the arena for a raid boss is enabled, allowing a squad of 10 to activate it and become isolated inside. Once it is defeated, the next region becomes accessible/its events become accessible. This is repeated twice, with the Vanquish being considered complete after the defeat of the third boss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point: Guilds would be able to participate in this content both casually and in an organized manner. Members/parties would be able to either drop in and out to clear HoT-like events and champions, while squads would get major raid-like bosses. Each of these events would have individual rewards/drops for the members to pursue, while the guild itself would receive rewards according to how far the bar was filled, with bonuses for each milestone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: Instanced, chaotic version of Queensdale. White Mantle activity and something more sinister has plunged the land into chaos. The Orders/Pact are spread thinly as is with the Elder Dragon threat, so the Seraph relies on the assistance guilds instead. Starting from the entrance to Divinity\u2019s Reach, guild members push outwards by driving away bandits, White Mantle or otherwise, dealing with sabotagers and bloodstone-crazed enemies and beasts. At 33%, a White Mantle boss bars their way. Once this threat is dealt with, they must then deal with emboldened centaur forces running in greater numbers than before, seizing the opportunity posed by the battered defense forces. A massive earth-and-wind elemental is being conjured and will be the boss that players have to deal with at the 66% mark. But its defeat reveals a worse threat: Shadow creatures have begun pouring in, drawn in by all the death and mayhem. The Shadow Behemoth awaits, manifesting a purer form and bringing forth stronger minions than ever. Its defeat completes the Vanquish and leaves behind the portal through which it finally entered our plane fully, allowing the selection of a different Guild Vanquish the next week: The Fissure of Woe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Well, that was a ramble. As a disclaimer of sorts, I understand how massive of an undertaking this would be, and how the manpower required means that making anything like this would only be possible if it was planned before beginning expansion development. This is simply how I envision undertaking a major endeavor as a guild.
