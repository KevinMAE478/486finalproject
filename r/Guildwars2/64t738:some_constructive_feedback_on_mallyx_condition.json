However, it runs into a few problem when it comes to how it stacks up compared to other profession\u2019s condition damage builds. I wanted to list some key problems I think Mallyx Revenants face, and offer some solutions to those issues that I mulled over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DPS. Let\u2019s address probably the biggest elephant in the room; comparing Revenant objectively to other classes, it falls short of just about every condi build in the game, barely managing dps above 20k in near perfect conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some ways I believe Revenant could be buffed is in some traits in the Corruption line, and a small tweak to mace skill two. The T3 minor trait, Yearning Empowerment, could be buffed to bring some sort of damage buff to the Revenant\u2019s torment application, much like how the Guardian receives a damage buff to their burning condition. What this percent should be, I\u2019m no mathematician, but it\u2019s clear the tech is there to tweak the damage of specific conditions on professions, so it could be applied here to buff what is, in most situations, a fairly weak condition in terms of damage potential, albeit being the one of the signature conditions the profession applies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another small suggestion is to buff the application amount of the major trait Venom Enhancement to two or three stacks. Perhaps another specific buff to Revenant\u2019s damage specifically with the poison condition is applicable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, another small way that could help buff condition damage would be to look at the mace main-hand skill, Searing Fissure. A key issue with this skill is the fact that the fire field is stationary, and acts fairly wonky sometimes with the terrain. Sure, an enemy sitting still will take a fairly respectable amount of burning damage, but we all understand how active Guild Wars 2\u2019s combat is (one major reason I play this lovely MMO!) We understand that movement is as key to combat as using skills are, and it\u2019s unrealistic to expect monsters to be standing still long enough for the condition to really show potential for the revenant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help tweak Searing Fissure into a more formidable skill, perhaps you could consider reducing the duration of the burning condition applied, but increasing the applications to two or three in such a fashion that is a net dps gain and is careful not to overpower the skill. Or, perhaps you could frontload the applications of burning on the initial strike, increasing it to two or three stacks of burning, slowly simmering down over it\u2019s duration and applying fewer stacks of burning as it dissipates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another area that could help Revenant\u2019s AoE damage would be by tweaking Unyielding Anguish. As it stands, it is one of Revenant\u2019s few reliable ways to really commit to some AoE condition application, yet it applies few stacks of torment and, for the energy it costs to use, it feels fairly under-tuned. Would it be an acceptable tweak to increase the stacks of torment it applies to two?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thought comes to mind when considering Unyielding Anguish; it could be transformed into a control ability, (something lacking within the Mallyx kit.) I don\u2019t know which developer decided that red-scaled reptiles should be able to pull me in and apply nasty, deadly amounts of confusion to my character, but let him or her know that they can chalk a few of my deaths in-game to those sunscale kitten-munchers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, stay with me, what if Unyielding Anguish\u2019s initial damage was a pull to the center of impact? This has amazing synergy with mace/axe playstyle, allowing the Revenant to neatly pull his prey into a tightly knit group to unleash his Searing Fissure\u2019s upon. It also gives Mallyx a way to finally assist in breaking defiant bars beyond a 15 second cooldown in axe off-hand\u2019s skill four, Temporal Rift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just some initial thoughts I had. I really do enjoy this build, and I plan on playing it, even if it is a little bit below the herd in damage, but I would love to see the developers reiterate on some of the designs so that the play style can bloom into something even more enjoyable and contributes better to the party as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look forward to comments, ideas and criticism both, and further discussion on bettering a gem of a specialisation, stance, and gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Original link.](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/revenant/Some-Constructive-Feedback-of-Mallyx)\n\nHello fellow players (and hopefully curious developers!)

Making such a change could difficult from a development perspective.\n\nWhat I prefer to see would be a traitline overhaul for condi rev similar to what OP suggested. Venom Enhancement is pathetic and the Master trait is 100% situational. Make Venom Enhancement 33% duration have a 4 or 5 second ICD and turning the chill on 10 sec ICD into an automatic Unyielding Anguish field on hitting an enemy with 10+ torment, or even maybe burning stacks, would be a good example. How about 1% extra damage for each condition on both you and your enemies? Last, but not least, there needs to be a better third traitline for condi rev than Devastation.

It's a clunky skill that has a horrible cast time and has the lowest priority in the rotation despite being the second lowest cooldown. Even worse, it's often a dps loss to use it off cooldown since even a second of missed Searing Fissure is worth less than the damage you receive from casting it as soon as possible.\n\nAs for Unyielding Anguish, the main issue with buffing it at this point is it conflicts with Embrace the Darkness and energy costs. The rotation while in Mallyx is already tight on energy, often running out just as you swap legends. I don't think the damage needs to be increased, but the energy cost does need to be lowered as well as EtD's while we're at it.
