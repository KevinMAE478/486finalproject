Idk where these ideas from the Eldar come from though.\nAlso forgot to mention that the &amp;quot;Old Ones&amp;quot; created the Eldar to combat a demonic foe although there are somethings that are never really explained like the fact that the Eldar also have gods that physically existed, does that mean that the Old Ones created the gods for them too? I&amp;#39;m unsure but the lore on the Eldar is very vast and i&amp;#39;m sure you can find many correlations between the two universes. I think there&amp;#39;s alot of divergence since Starcraft 2 though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgalkgq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492288622.0, "created_utc": 1492259822.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h5r0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h5r0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb6vby", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "E_M_A_N_R_E_S_U", "parent_id": "t1_dganx2e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Badly worded on my part, the Protoss aren\u2019t entitled the Firstborn without a reason.
