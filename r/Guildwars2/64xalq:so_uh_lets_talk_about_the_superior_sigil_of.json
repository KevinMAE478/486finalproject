You can wait for everyone to be grouped before dropping your wells and still have optimal quickness. A DPS class will lose damage if they delay their rotation ever - this also means that DPS classes don&amp;#39;t have the luxury of being able to dodge blue circles without losing any damage like chrono.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also there is no way you have played the Ele Sc/W build if you think it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;6 button rotation&amp;quot; and you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about general strategy. You have two separate conjure weapons that you need to pick up off the ground, and you have to drop them next to the place the boss is going to be at when you get through two more cycles of your rotation. That&amp;#39;s really hard to do reliably without a lot of practice. And the rotation is mechanically difficult - there&amp;#39;s a lot of room to lose damage if you are slow to use skills, or if you position yourself poorly for wildfire or orb of storms. A bad Sc/W ele could easily have less than half the DPS of a good one in an actual raid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying chrono is the easiest shit in the world but again I was specifically addressing where you said it was &amp;quot;substantially harder&amp;quot; than DPS classes and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s true at all.

However, for people like me who are ranger/druid mains there is one other factor to consider: multiple armor sets. I have a power (that, granted, I almost never use unless I&amp;#39;m doing some LS content where power is preferred), a condi set so I can do condi ranger/druid, and a full heal set. Obviously, the full heal set doesn&amp;#39;t need to be ascended, but after doing fractals for so long everyone of my characters is full ascended, it also helps for 100 cm when people can&amp;#39;t dodge/ aren&amp;#39;t paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for concentration sigil, there is one off meta build on a full heal druid that uses it, but it&amp;#39;s off meta, so not as popular. Druids have to use runes from dungeons mostly, either Nightmare (TA) for condi or Monk (AC) for heals. But 2-3 days of doing all paths should cover most of those. Now, condi food is also pretty expensive, where Bountiful Sharpening Stones (used by chronos) cost about 55s each (the recipe crafts 5, so have to divide that) and the Toxic Focusing Crystal costs about 45s each to craft, but requires an account bound currency that can&amp;#39;t be bypassed (or you pay 80s on the TP for the finished product). For food, prices are similar, especially considering the farther we get from Lunar New Year&amp;#39;s. But when you consider the current meta, with it&amp;#39;s condi heavy DPS bias, everyone is using (or should) expensive food, so don&amp;#39;t feel especial. The notable exception is a druid, because their food/utility is much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for high level fractals, you don&amp;#39;t need healers or tanks at all. Before HoT you didn&amp;#39;t even have dedicated healers and everyone was fine. Also, tanks in fractals are hard to determine because every other boss seems to agroo on a different pattern or it&amp;#39;s just random. I&amp;#39;ve seen healers in fractals who will run full heal to cheese fights, but often times I see druids who never even go into CA so I&amp;#39;m sure they only traited the druid line for the speed boost trait.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg5wpic", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035085.0, "created_utc": 1492006285.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xalq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5uwox", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "spcwarmachine", "parent_id": "t3_64xalq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I started working on a new wvw build, we did the rough math and it will take near 52 days just for the time gated crafting mats (were all too poor to just buy such large amounts on the TP and some stuff is account bound on acquire)\n\nabout 120g for the sigils we need (last I looked it was about 54g for just concentration)\n\nIt will then take us about 10 or so days to make the 3 weapons we need starting from scratch and another 10 days to make all the armor we need\n\nWe rounded it out to about 300g (including food and sigils) and 45-50 days of farming gold, mats, time gated materials and crafting the weapons and armor with HoT stats.\n\nI'm not sure how bad it is for PvE, but 40 days for anything crafting wise is near a lifetime for wvw as far as builds and gear is concerned.

I&amp;#39;ve noticed that if you don&amp;#39;t move after Blurred Frenzy stops the attack animation, you get about a half second or so of evade frames.  However, if you move right as soon as the attack animation finishes, you don&amp;#39;t get those evade frames.  I think the overall skill gets &amp;quot;cancelled&amp;quot; by moving after the sword swinging animation is done.

Mussels are currently very low on price therefore it is very hard to find people still gathering them that often, which leads me to my point here: there is not enough people farming mussels and the price for the perls is slowly increasing.\n\nYou can take f.e. /u/Mightyteapot 's minstrel chrono guide that he released 14th February. You can see how the market and people responded with completely crushing the market and people trying to farm them.
