This was Sam&amp;#39;s idea and a surprise to me, though in loose role-play one of her characters had been pursuing one of mine romantically for months and had even announced a wedding date, much to his chagrin. He wasn&amp;#39;t too keen on the idea, being too Asuranly interested in his experiments to even consider such a ridiculous distraction. He often met her advances with a cry of, &amp;quot;SLICK SHOES!&amp;quot;, which he&amp;#39;d engage, then hastily retreat after deploying his sneak gyro, but she persisted...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come the wedding day my character and I were lured to the guild hall on some flimsy premise which I suspected was some wedding related thing. I went along with it, though my character had to be drugged into complacency. Sam and I were both delighted to the lengths our guildmates went to to decorate for the event, as we are not a very wealthy group. It was a cute and funny ceremony and a good time was had by all, but that was not the end of it. We were even more blown away when they ushered us from capitol to capitol to reenact the ceremony for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you turned out for our celebration, and some followed us from city to city. Sam was well pleased with all that the guildies did for us and the response from the player community. I received quite a few messages of congratulations from other players, all of which I shared with Sam and the guild. Some included gifts, which I donated to the guild that Sam started, for improvements to the guild hall. I was brought to tears over it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What wasn&amp;#39;t said, but a few guildies knew, was that Sam was dying from cancer. No one at all knew how much time she had left. Only a bit over 3 months later, on November 6, Samantha passed away at the age of 33. Her life was a hard one, having been born with a rare and painful genetic skin disorder called recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Still, she was incredibly upbeat and had a great sense of humor, love for life, and excelled in everything she did. Despite taking two days to complete her first jumping puzzle (as she had no functioning fingers), Sam discovered a way to control her character movements beautifully and became a master at JPs and a mean PvP competitor. She was not one to give up! But, when the cancer that took her life came, she decided not to fight it. Severe EB pretty much inevitably leads to a particularly aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma. Even if completely removed, with the tremendous amount of skin damage from the effects of EB, it eventually develops again and is essentially always a losing battle. Sam didn&amp;#39;t want to be in hospital all the time, having parts of her body cut away, drugged up and not living a life with some quality. Sam, who could not walk very far anyway, became even less mobile than she already was as the tumor on her leg grew larger and larger, but she was able to stay alert and enjoy what was within her grasp. Guild Wars 2 became her main world, and we spent as much time as we could where she was free to run and jump and glide without Earthly limits. Until the last couple of weeks of her life, when she was taking high enough levels of painkillers that she was mostly too sleepy to play, she lived freely in Tyria, laughing and playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - I want to thank all of you who made Sam&amp;#39;s Guild Wars 2 life so fantastic. Almost none of you knew it, or even suspected, but you brought someone who suffered unimaginably a great deal of joy. If you&amp;#39;re interested, I&amp;#39;d like to share the wonder that was Sam through the documentary the BBC aired about her in 2011 called, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3b0aieMT-8\"&gt;&amp;quot;Stormchaser: The Butterfly and the Tornado&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not Guild Wars related at all, but it is incredibly inspirational and you never know, maybe you and Sam did an event together, or she kicked your butt in PvP, or she gave you some item you needed. Sam was in Tyria loads and if you play on an EU server you may have bumped into quite a remarkable person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To any developers who come across this, a very special thank you to you for creating such a rich and beautiful world with so many places to go and things to do. Sam loved everything about Tyria and it took her mind off some pretty terrible times. I wish you could have heard her laughing at the Asura animations, seen her wide-eyed while gliding over her guild hall in Lost Precipice, or listened to her praise of, &amp;quot;Fear Not This Night&amp;quot;. Because of your work she was able to go longer between doses of painkillers. I know this is a lot to ask, but if there&amp;#39;s any chance I must - Is there any possibility of memorializing her in the game? I mean, beyond what we&amp;#39;ve done in our guild hall. She was a massive fan and an Asura called &amp;quot;Stormchaser Samm&amp;quot; eyeing the sky in some remote area or peering at a tornado in a tube would be a lovely tribute to an incredible lady.

Her name is Sam, she was the leader of a friendly guild known as Creators Of Destiny Awakening (CDA). Personally, I met Sam whilst I was looking for raiding experience in the LFG tool, her guild were inexperienced but had an amazing attitude. I'll never forget how they got VG to phase once and were delighted with that progress, it really stuck with me. Once they had finished raiding for the night they had managed to get VG to 50%, not amazing but they were all still very happy and very positive. I remember chatting with a couple of their members after and saying something to the effect of \"Add me in game and let me know when you raid again, I'd like to come and help.\" And they did, in fact they accidently invited me into their guild and that begun a friendship between our two guilds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the luck she had, Sam had every right to be sad or angry with life. But from what I saw, she saw everything as a fun challenge, Sam had the most positive outlook on everything whenever I had a conversation with her. In a world online and offline so caught up in mistrust and  frustration her presence was refreshing and enlightening. I will never forget the time myself, Rugi and Aly were able to help CDA get their first Vale Guardian kill, everyone was learning and progressing together, we pushed Vale Guardian to 2% and we wiped. Sam was the first to say, \"Let's go again! We were so close!\" A couple of attempts later we succeeded. I'll never forget that moment of pure joy and elation in the group, they had all worked so hard to improve and they had been rewarded for all that work. After we completed VG I distinctly remember Sam mentioning that was something she could cross off her bucket list. And whilst I am very upset over this news, I can be happy and proud that Rugi, Aly and myself were able to help Sam have that moment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Raiding with CDA is an amazing experience for me, it allowed me to learn how to lead a raid. CDA could have pushed me down when I started giving raid commands to their guild during raids but they let me continue and learn with them. I became a better player and raider because of this, because Sam and CDA gave me a chance to gain confidence. Sam was always asking how she could improve and was looking for tips and I spent much time discussing raids with her. You could just tell it was something that interested her and infused her because it was a challenge.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know a few other Gankers took part in other CDA raids and everyone will agree what an amazing influence Sam was in the raid environment. Sam was able to complete the Escort for the first time in her final raid. In memorial, Chris with the help of Rugi and myself have setup a memorial in the Guild Hall. We have a small garden and memorial area to the south of the tavern. Chris has done a really nice job of this area and it's a good place to take a minute in game. \n&gt; \n&gt; Our guild is very much more than a group of people online. Whilst we move to and from different activities as a core we have stuck together, not because we are bound by a single thing we enjoy but instead because we enjoy each others company. We have our differences at times but we usually overcome them. We have become more than just people we know online via a game, we have become friends. Some CDA members have joined our Discord and our PvE raiding groups in the past few months and have been guests in Gank, I'd like to think in this difficult time for their members we can be there for them as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you Sam The Stormchaser.

CDA could have pushed me down when I started giving raid commands to their guild during raids but they let me continue and learn with them. I became a better player and raider because of this, because Sam and CDA gave me a chance to gain confidence. Sam was always asking how she could improve and was looking for tips and I spent much time discussing raids with her. You could just tell it was something that interested her and infused her because it was a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know a few other Gankers took part in other CDA raids and everyone will agree what an amazing influence Sam was in the raid environment. Sam was able to complete the Escort for the first time in her final raid. In memorial, Chris with the help of Rugi and myself have setup a memorial in the Guild Hall. We have a small garden and memorial area to the south of the tavern. Chris has done a really nice job of this area and it&amp;#39;s a good place to take a minute in game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our guild is very much more than a group of people online. Whilst we move to and from different activities as a core we have stuck together, not because we are bound by a single thing we enjoy but instead because we enjoy each others company. We have our differences at times but we usually overcome them. We have become more than just people we know online via a game, we have become friends. Some CDA members have joined our Discord and our PvE raiding groups in the past few months and have been guests in Gank, I&amp;#39;d like to think in this difficult time for their members we can be there for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you Sam The Stormchaser. You will be missed and you won&amp;#39;t be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgbta3r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492356029.0, "created_utc": 1492327229.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8ql", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8ql", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8ql", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8ql", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8ql", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc50rr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tzucon", "parent_id": "t1_dgc3fqs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're right that many people are assholes simply to make other people miserable, but that sort of behaviour should be challenged, not shied away from.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right that many people are assholes simply to make other people miserable, but that sort of behaviour should be challenged, not shied away from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgc50rr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384789.0, "created_utc": 1492355989.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc3fqs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ben-Z-S", "parent_id": "t1_dgbt1en", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Its a touchy subject to bring up, many people who play the game pass and each one's story is important to different players.
