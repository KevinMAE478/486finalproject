Well, while I still see both of those things as positive additions to the festival, I can savely say that the journey to get the cat was probably the least enjoyable time I have ever had in this gamemode. It might be my computer, or my internet connection, but whenever I drop a fish and pick it up again, for about 2-4 seconds the speed my character runs with is essentially randomized. This isn&amp;#39;t really noticable in normal runs, but when you have to make the long way between the pyranha ponds and the the cat, with several long and precise jumps it not only becomes noticable, it becomes extremely infuriating.

One way this could have been done better is giving Moto another sale tab with &amp;quot;once per day&amp;quot; options, or something along the lines of the Pact Provisioner Tokens, but for SAB weapons. (1 Crimson Token for a green weapon, 2 for a yellow one, etc).
