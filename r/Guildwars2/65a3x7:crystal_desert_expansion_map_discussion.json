I'm not opposed to it having non-desert areas, and of course it'll have some branded areas, but I find it weird that only half of these maps are desert.\n* I find it unlikely that the stone dwarves--changed not just in body but also in mind--still have settlements that they stick around in. I always imagined them to completely devote themselves to their purpose (fighting the destroyers, keeping the Fire Islands from exploding, sharing and preserving knowledge in the case of Ogden) without any concern for downtime or communities. These are people that don't sleep, don't eat or drink, don't mind the weather, don't grow old, and don't raise children. They don't need villages. (Also there aren't supposed to be a lot left--the ones on the Fire Islands work just fine because that's far away from civilization but this isn't that far from Mt. Maelstrom and Timberline Falls.)\n* I find it unlikely that the Amnoon Oasis is a trade hub of lots of different races. Palawa's undead probably don't trade much, and neither do the ghosts of ascension seekers that used to haunt the desert. It's probably not the Elonian people who (presumably) suffer in poverty under Palawa's rule (though it would be cool if Palawa actually turned out to be a decent ruler), and it's not the forgotten either. It's not us, unless that's some kind of new trade agreement that gets established in this story. As far as I know, it could only be Zephyrites or completely new people, and I'm not sure how I feel about constantly getting new intelligent races that we then immediately put aside and forget about because they have no relevance beyond their one map (Itzel, Nuhoch, even the Exalted though those at least still have a tiny bit of story relevance).\n* Why do you think we'd find the last living giants in the desert? Assuming you mean something larger than norn/jotun/ogres, perhaps something like the true giants (gigantici lupici), there's no reason to believe there are any of those still around. If you just mean regular giants like the few we have in Krytan areas and the one from Dry Top, I don't think there's much they could teach us, even if we find some that haven't been turned into an unded minion of Palawa.\n* Speaking of, you don't mention Palawa Joko at all! These once desert areas are green specifically because Palawa wanted to live there and thought it'd look nicer if he had some water and plants around so naturally we'll encounter him in these areas. Not just that, the devs have been implying some conflict between Palawa and Kralkatorrik for more than 4 years now so I expect we'll actually get that.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This looks and sounds pretty cool but I have a few issues with some of the details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is supposedly a desert themed expansion. I&amp;#39;m not opposed to it having non-desert areas, and of course it&amp;#39;ll have some branded areas, but I find it weird that only half of these maps are desert.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I find it unlikely that the stone dwarves--changed not just in body but also in mind--still have settlements that they stick around in. I always imagined them to completely devote themselves to their purpose (fighting the destroyers, keeping the Fire Islands from exploding, sharing and preserving knowledge in the case of Ogden) without any concern for downtime or communities. These are people that don&amp;#39;t sleep, don&amp;#39;t eat or drink, don&amp;#39;t mind the weather, don&amp;#39;t grow old, and don&amp;#39;t raise children. They don&amp;#39;t need villages. (Also there aren&amp;#39;t supposed to be a lot left--the ones on the Fire Islands work just fine because that&amp;#39;s far away from civilization but this isn&amp;#39;t that far from Mt. Maelstrom and Timberline Falls.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I find it unlikely that the Amnoon Oasis is a trade hub of lots of different races. Palawa&amp;#39;s undead probably don&amp;#39;t trade much, and neither do the ghosts of ascension seekers that used to haunt the desert. It&amp;#39;s probably not the Elonian people who (presumably) suffer in poverty under Palawa&amp;#39;s rule (though it would be cool if Palawa actually turned out to be a decent ruler), and it&amp;#39;s not the forgotten either. It&amp;#39;s not us, unless that&amp;#39;s some kind of new trade agreement that gets established in this story. As far as I know, it could only be Zephyrites or completely new people, and I&amp;#39;m not sure how I feel about constantly getting new intelligent races that we then immediately put aside and forget about because they have no relevance beyond their one map (Itzel, Nuhoch, even the Exalted though those at least still have a tiny bit of story relevance).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why do you think we&amp;#39;d find the last living giants in the desert? Assuming you mean something larger than norn/jotun/ogres, perhaps something like the true giants (gigantici lupici), there&amp;#39;s no reason to believe there are any of those still around.
