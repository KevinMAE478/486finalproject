Reminder: This isn&amp;#39;t about our beloved snake people named the Forgotten. It&amp;#39;s the Personal Story experienced by 15 different heroes. Since only one of them became the Commander, I just tell you the tale of these potential heroes who could have existed at the same time and who all had the chance to become the hero we all know. (And this post isn&amp;#39;t a question.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greetings Bookah. Meaning that you could be anything that isn\u2019t an Asura, if you\u2019re Asura you would have stopped reading at the human part because I previously mentioned that the floating Grizwhirl is Uzolan\u2019s invention. Therefore, let\u2019s move south to the Maguuma Jungle or more precisely to the Tarnished Coast where the Asuran city Rata Sum floats in the air. Rata Sum might be the first and only city of its kind because the Asura originally lived under the earth. They\u2019re the smartest of the five major races and never let a chance go by, to remind everyone this fact. Their arch nemesis being the Elder Dragon Primordus or rather his Destroyers who invaded the Depths of Tyria and attacked their original cities. The Asura believe in the Eternal Alchemy, meaning that the universe works like a giant mechanism. Their current civilization is overseen by the Arcane Council and most Asura are members of one of the colleges present in Rata Sum. These colleges are the College of Statics, College of Dynamics, College of Synergetics and then there is the Inquest. An organization not even knowing that the words ethic or moral exist. In other words, their researchers don\u2019t care about other living beings. To briefly summarize the three colleges, you can say that Statics are cautious and love doing things right, Dynamics are spontaneous and experimental and Synergetics are exploring the Eternal Alchemy and its aspects. All of them are proud inventors, especially our three heroes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the starting points of their stories is the golem problem caused by the Inquest in Metrica Province at the Hinterlabs and the other being the Snaff Prize. Our three heroes dealt with the golems and one of them helped Zojja directly defeat the Prototype X Golem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heroes would then compete for the Snaff Prize with their krewes. One hero for each one of the Colleges. The competitors being: Pokka the leader of the Statics krewe together with Kozzak and one of our heroes presenting the V.O.E.D. (Very Old Energy Detector); Hronk the leader of the Dynamics krewe accompanied by Doxa, Kazz and one of our heroes presenting the M.I.G. (Massively Impressive Golem); Varkk leader of the Synergetics krewe alongside our last hero and Pol presenting their teleportation device; and for last Teyo and her Inquest krewe presenting her Grizwhirl. I\u2019m not sure who won the Snaff Prize but it can\u2019t be the Inquest since Teyo tried to steal the winner\u2019s invention. Zojja and the hero who won, called Snaff Savant afterwards, stopped Teyo and put an end to her evil plans and to her life. Long before these events Teyo was also one of Ceara\u2019s, also known as Scarlet Briar, krewmates in the Inquest, meaning that even her past actions were questionable. What our other two heroes did in the meanwhile is undocumented. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following the events of the Snaff Prize our three heroes would encounter trouble caused by their first inventions.  The VAL-A Golem, the Transatmospheric Converter and the Infinity Ball are these inventions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The owner of the VAL-A Golem got contacted by Zojja because his golem was on a rampage. The hero started his investigation after defeating his own golem, at the archive. He found out that Mink, Keppa and Councillor Haia accessed the plans of his invention. He decided to check out Mink and Keppa first because he never heard of them. But he only found out that both aren\u2019t talented enough to transform the golem into a real threat. Returned at Zojja\u2019s Lab they test one golem with Haia\u2019s specs who immediately tries to kill the two Asura. Arrived at the Arcane Council to confront Haia she just leaves and wishes the duo a great death since she erased all proofs. The hero and Zojja had no other choice than to stay and defend the other members of the council against the golems. After the attack the council wasn\u2019t even surprised by Haia\u2019s action and just said that they would keep an eye on her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zojja seemed to have also called the owner of the Transatmospheric Converter informing him that Kudu, her rival, has his own plans with the hero\u2019s invention. Like the other hero our hero tries to recuperate the plans of his inventions. Without success because they vanished from the archive and the physical copy was burned by members of the Inquest. Plunka one of Kudu\u2019s lackeys was the next target, however Plunka or rather Kudu himself was aware of this move in advance and let Plunka set up a trap. The Sylvari Peredur helped Zojja and the hero escape and they could finally interrogate Plunka. Together with Peredur they infiltrated the Inquest and found Kudu, but he escaped with his personal teleporter. Now they had to pay the Council a visit to save them from Kudu\u2019s \u201cpresentation\u201d. Once the modified Converter was destroyed they warned the Council about Kudu, but they pretty much ignored it. It seems like the Council gets attacked at least once a week to cause extra vacations\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, our third hero gets contacted by Zojja because she wants to experiment with his invention, the Infinity Ball. The Asuran inventor Shodd encourages the hero to do the same and to improve the invention. Unfortunately, the first test creates a portal which summons Steam creatures which had to be defeated. To continue the experiments, they needed more energy and following that comes a story where even I\u2019m not sure if it can be believed. During the last experiment, which Zojja tries to cancel, another portal spawns. Two Asura came through the portal, Grand Vice Admiral Shodd and the alternate version of our hero entitled Grand High Sovereign. They conquered their reality with the Steam Creatures invented by the alternative version of our hero and now wanted to take over our reality. The hero killed himself and the alternative Shodd died aswell, maybe they even saved the other reality by doing so. Our hero explains that he wouldn\u2019t end up like himself, but Zojja would be on her guard for now on and ready to stop the Grand High Sovereign if needed. At this point I want to correct the alternative version of our hero. He says that his technology wasn\u2019t invented yet in our world, I suppose that he spoke about the Steam creatures which were already invented by Scarlet Briar at the time. Suspiciously he speaks about a battle in Divinity\u2019s Reach which was also attacked in our reality by Scarlet during Queen Jennah\u2019s Jubilee. Hypocrites could now call the Asura servants of one the Elder Dragons, personally I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Savant got contacted by Zojja after these events. And once again I don\u2019t know what happened to the other two.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excelsior, traveler.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/64h35x/spoilers_the_tale_of_forgotten_and_lesser_known/ \nPart 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/64v52o/spoilers_the_tale_of_forgotten_and_lesser_known/\nPart 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/658mnv/spoilers_the_tale_of_forgotten_and_lesser_known/\n\nWarning: Spoilers and Wall of text incoming.
