This post will describe the concept then discuss the effectiveness in the context of each available boss fight. It&amp;#39;s going to be a vomit of words, so I have included videos at the start and tl;dr&amp;#39;s at the end of each analysis section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Introduction - Two Twenty-two:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This entire thing would not have happened without the Feb 22nd patch, both good and bad. The Good: Time Warp was changed to affect 10 people. This couldn&amp;#39;t have come at a better time for my static raid group, as our 2nd Chrono was stepping away and we were having trouble filling the position (i.e. we&amp;#39;re not some competitive speedclear meta-topping group, just a bunch of raiders trying to get by). We could do well enough with one-chrono comps and still have fun with minimal forcing of people to play what they don&amp;#39;t want to play, but it was getting rougher as the weeks went by. The increased limit on Druid&amp;#39;s GotL and Warrior banners also opened a small crack in the door to alternative raid comps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course The Bad: I knew nerfs were coming to Tempest, but I didn&amp;#39;t think they would be that bad. I survived and adapted to the July 2016 and October 2016 changes, but this was too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My days of exclusively playing Elementalist were over. All hail the condi meta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tangent - Condi Viper Tempest:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t go down without a fight, of course. As a last-ditch effort I debuted the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNvF6ap4gw\"&gt;Condi Tempest&lt;/a&gt; build that I had been working on for 8 months (yes, that&amp;#39;s right, &lt;strong&gt;8 months&lt;/strong&gt;. Spreadsheets, calculations, simulations, optimizations, the works.) and lo-and-behold, it was actually not as garbage as I thought. I brought it to some fights, had minor success (notably: inspiring &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXeQTGG0YW8\"&gt;Particlar&lt;/a&gt; to try it out and raid more extensively with the build), but ultimately it just wasn&amp;#39;t ready for primetime. If you&amp;#39;re interested in seeing those results, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_X69G9GF-KeNS7FGS6c72SIUWFMEjhge\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s a playlist of the DPS Benchmark and select fight videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Betrayal - Condi Mesmer:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reluctantly gravitated towards condi Mesmer due to already having most of the gear for it (see the above condi Tempest experimentation) and seeing the value it provided on fights where Tempest struggled. Also at this time the &amp;quot;is Necro in fact garbage?&amp;quot; investigations weren&amp;#39;t finished, so I didn&amp;#39;t know Light Armor Viper with Berserker runes would have another use. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After spending half a pizza &amp;#39;n crystal learning the rotation, I spent the remaining 15 minutes sitting in disbelief that all those hours, weeks, months I poured into playing and perfecting Tempest could be matched and surpassed so easily by these few button presses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was broken. I mentally prepared myself for the worst: if I could no longer be of value to my raid team, I&amp;#39;d simply retire from raiding altogether and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Rope-a-dope - Condi Chrono:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fellow guildmate and static raid group member Knox saw me toiling away in the Special Forces Training Area on a not-Tempest character, and offered to be my AFK Engi buff for the benchmarks. He listened with care and empathy as I plowed through the five stages of grief. And just when I was at my weakest, my most desperate and vulnerable, he found an opening to strike:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about a condi chrono?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both knew the situation: Knox was carrying our raid group HARD as the only one dedicated enough to play Chronomancer. Everyone knew Tempest was my thing, whether it was DPS or healing. Knox began by outlining some spreadsheet numbers of what a complimentary Chrono would look like side-by-side with his carry, and what the quickness, alacrity, and DPS numbers would be like. And I was the only one with the gear and the mentality (i.e. stupidity mixed with depression backed by scientific inquisitiveness) to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I somehow agreed to this nonsense, and to this day I still don&amp;#39;t know or remember how it happened. Knox adds &amp;quot;oh btw, you&amp;#39;ll need a Viper&amp;#39;s Shield with a Sigil of Concentration&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m already completely numb at this point, as I pick up 40g worth of Freshwater Pearls off the Trading Post...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...hero point train... Blink, Portal, well of something for toxic bacon...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...a few days later I load into Bastion of the Penitent with my teammates, having 0 experience playing condi Mesmer and 0 experience playing any kind of Chronomancer in any raid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Experimentation - Preface:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a fun trailer video for my upcoming adventures, to keep my mind off the idea that this could potentially be my last go at raiding in Guild Wars 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYzNu648ys\"&gt;Condi Chronomancer - Official Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YSXezDxCXQ\"&gt;requisite DPS Benchmark video with build information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key thing to keep in mind with this build: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea is to replace the role of a condi Mesmer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You just happen to provide Quickness and Alacrity (hence why I often call this build the Condi Chrono Hybrid) in situations where your group may not have full coverage. This is typically because 1) you only have 1 chronomancer and 2) your 2 chronos can&amp;#39;t provide 100% uptime due to skill, mistakes, or fight mechanics. A repeated critique of this build is glancing at our group&amp;#39;s Quickness/Alacrity data, or my personal Quickness/Alacrity uptime and concluding this build is garbage. And my response is the same: I&amp;#39;m not a Chrono, I&amp;#39;m a Tempest. I played this condi Chrono with the mindset of a hybrid build: where I still require support from the main Chrono, but I also just happen to provide some nice utility to support the group. A relevant comparison would be the Might stacks generated while playing Tempest, either with Overload Fire or Scepter blasts in Fire Fields. Sure the uptime is ok, and it&amp;#39;s nice to provide additional support for the team, but I&amp;#39;m still going in relying on support from the Warriors. So my general conclusions are framed like this: would it have been better if I just played Tempest and we rolled with just 1 chrono?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most common variation from the base build is to sacrifice Quickness for more utility, whether swapping shield for focus, or dropping Well of Action for something else. The heal skill is a function of the fight mechanics: for a short fight or one with lots of short phases, choose the Heal Signet like a condi Mesmer. If not, choose the Well. Traits were rarely changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A note on DPS meters: Confusion and Torment are under-reported in arcdps Area Stats, but are effectively accurate in Personal Stats and bgdm. bgdm stops the DPS timer during phases and invulnerability, arcdps treats the entire time in combat as part of DPS calculations, making numbers look lower and more normalized. Padls come from arcdps logs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A note on music: Yes, I know I have bad taste in music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following sections are ordered by the 11 raid bosses, not chronologically, so I put a date on when the fight happened to reflect this. Play quality in the videos varies from &amp;quot;utter garbage&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;hey, doing better kid&amp;quot; which also correlates with the date of the fight, so I try to be as transparent as possible about pointing out my mistakes. I also often make two conclusions based on context and will try to distinguish between the two: raiding in general and speedkill theorycraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Vale Guardian - Not Bad:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcICGnzCu10\"&gt;3/26 VG - with Focus+Heal Signet (no green circle team)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was super skeptical that this would work. Additionally, this is one of the few decent fights left for Tempest, so my baises were set. As it turns out, with the Heal Signet and Focus, and with standard tanking strategies, you can pull your weight and provide pretty good support and DPS. First things first, you&amp;#39;re a prime candidate for green circle team. As such, you can offer a touch of Quickness and Alacrity to the others on the green circle team with some good timing, something they wouldn&amp;#39;t have had anyways. Second, you&amp;#39;re a natural fit for the Red Guardian for split phases. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously since the first video is a PUG run you can&amp;#39;t pull too many conclusions from it, but I mean, look at it: Chronomancer top DPS. There&amp;#39;s a lot of room for exploration. I&amp;#39;ve got two weeks worth of green circle team experience now, but the videos are kinda bleh (aside from the fun &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYnj60LHyIg\"&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo0-Qo6bDY\"&gt;alternate clip&lt;/a&gt; I made from one of them). But the concept is straightforward: summon duelists, go to green circle, and use Focus pull to keep seekers off you as your lazyass teammates don&amp;#39;t knock them back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience, I don&amp;#39;t think this build is applicable to speedkills of this boss. Phases change too fast and Distortion-share squeezes tons of value out of the traditional Chronomancer build.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr VG: Surprisingly playable, and a fun challenge!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Gorseval - Least Surprising Conclusion:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://padl.tk/u/johusbbAxdaf\"&gt;3/20 Gorseval (padl)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://padl.tk/u/tZdCaxllkipE\"&gt;4/10 Gorseval (padl)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are curious I can post a video, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s worth it. We all know condi Mesmers get crushed on this fight, and it happens to be more of the same for condi chrono. I can&amp;#39;t pull the DPS and can&amp;#39;t offer enough utility to justify using this build on this fight, and can&amp;#39;t in good faith recommend it in any way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Gors: NOPE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sabetha - Challenge and Potential:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikc_hdYEynE\"&gt;4/03 Sabetha - with Heal Signet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhewWDZwTww\"&gt;4/10 Sabetha - with Focus+Heal Signet - flak kiter + sapper bomber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The build both shines and faces tough challenges in this fight. Shines in that the utility you provide stands out as cannoners and kiters are out and about, as supporting 8.5 or 9 players is easier than 10. But the numerous phase changes and random deaths of your duelists in the last phase make your DPS impact rather challenging. This fight really showcases the strength of the meta 2-chrono comp, notably getting cannoners back up to speed with boons when they return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there is a bright side: this build can kite the flak with a minimal negative impact on DPS, compared to other DPS classes and arguably even Druids. And because of this, there may be an opportunity for a speedkill theorycraft. Consider a 5-5, where you replace a chrono and a ranger with two condi chronos so that your druids can stay in with the group. Couldn&amp;#39;t that be enough? It&amp;#39;s tough to say, but for the theorycrafters out there, I&amp;#39;d say there are some nice ideas here to noodle on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Sab: Lots of potential, lots of opportunity to support, but it&amp;#39;s a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Slothasor - Not recommended:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgeSyKCmx8I\"&gt;3/22 Slothasor - with Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first fights where I started to feel the difference between just a raw condi Mesmer DPS and the hybrid support role of condi Chrono, as the condi Mesmer is just miserable at this fight. In typical groups with the standard tanking strategy it&amp;#39;s no surprise that 2 dedicated Chronos can&amp;#39;t keep up the quickness and alacrity uptime. Well placement is super tactical, and the adds and boon strip and desire for projectile hate and focus pulls really puts a strain on what a pair of Chronos can do. But is there room for a 3rd Chrono as a condi hybrid? Probably not on this particular fight. On other fights though...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I ultimately feel like I could offer more utility and support and DPS as Tempest on this fight, so experimentation here has mostly concluded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Sloth: Playable, but not recommended.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Matthias - DOMINATION:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOwcEp95yII\"&gt;Matthias Video Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpWL_lJ5BLY\"&gt;4/03 Matthias - with Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is well documented that condi Mesmer is great on this fight. Aside from being sacrificed, everything works in your favor: little DPS variation due to distance from boss or dealing with mechanics, bonus DPS due to Confusion and Torment, and a free utility to bring reflect with no loss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I have to paraphrase to describe this condi Chrono build to people, a common phrase I throw around for simplicity is &amp;quot;10-15% less DPS than condi Mesmer&amp;quot;, which is of course in ideal DPS golem situations. In practical application, there are times when it&amp;#39;s worse and sometimes it&amp;#39;s better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here, I truly believe it is better. There is so much movement and individual accountability in this fight that it&amp;#39;s too rough to expect the 2 chrono meta comp to provide 100% quickness and alacrity, and there are plenty of videos and padls out there that show this. How about just dropping them and running a handful of condi Chronos instead? Having multiple sources of spot quickness/alacrity turns out to be pretty good opposed to shoving all the support responsibility onto 2 Chronos, and you can simultaneously DPS carry. Doesn&amp;#39;t that sound... absurd?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A baseline theorycraft for a new speedkill record would be as follows: 5-5 comp, 2 condi Druids, 2 condi Warriors, 2 condi Rangers, 4 condi Chronos. With some RNG (i.e. non-chronos getting sacrificed) and everyone paying attention to the mechanics (i.e. not needing a full healer), this seems pretty good on paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alas, that all goes beyond the scope of my testing here. However, even in pug runs, if I see a 5-5 or 8-1-1 comp with 2 Chronos, I&amp;#39;m still playing condi Chrono on this fight. Warriors and Ranger/Druids are too strong to not support, and if anything I&amp;#39;m still doing more than whatever the hell I think I can do on Tempest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Matty: Obviously good, arguably better than condi Mesmer, and potentially world record-breaking-ly good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Keep Construct - Barf:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://padl.tk/u/D6z6WRFhz5FR\"&gt;3/22 KC (padl)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much to say here. I provide tremendous value as a Tempest on this fight, and condi Chrono utility and DPS both suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr KC: Obviously bad, but good to check just to make sure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Xera - So close:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLN5iJlrmjI\"&gt;4/05 Xera - with Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Sabetha, this is a fight where the mechanics can randomly kill your duelists. Like Matthias, this fight can also arbitrarily punish your DPS by sending you to the platform at 40% and 20%, evaporating your duelists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said, this actually is an ok fight for condi Chrono. With the heal signet and Focus, you can absorb the phase changes and keep up duelists through moderate nonsense, all while offering Focus pull utility. And as shown in the video, standing on the button is a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve done enough to eliminate all possibility, but theorycraft on this fight goes way deeper than my scope and ability, if anything is even there to find. As for pugging and general raiding, due to the 5-5 comp feeling very natural for this fight, and how it&amp;#39;s one of the few fights remaining where I can feel useful playing FA Staff Tempest, I&amp;#39;m unlikely to dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Xera: Almost playable, can&amp;#39;t recommend, but an interesting option.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Cairn - Superstar:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oPc9GhqXAs\"&gt;3/22 Cairn (9-man) - Standard build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8EUpoRjPKc\"&gt;4/05 Cairn -  Standard build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Matthias, Cairn is one of the theoretically best fights for condi Mesmer, and the same certainly holds true for this build. No reason to beat around the bush: I&amp;#39;m positive a speedkill record for this fight can be achieved using this build, starting with the aforementioned 5-5 comp with 4 condi chronos. Or possibly even 6. Everyone moves around so much for the mechanics (i.e. out of your wells), that the meta 2 chronos have a tough time supplying everyone with 100% Alacrity uptime and to a lesser extent, Quickness. Why not just have &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; supply their own? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anything, playing this build on this fight is great just for the hilarity of seeing that &amp;quot;Chr&amp;quot; at #1 on the DPS meter, lol. In pug groups I&amp;#39;d bring the build even if we were setup 5-5 with 2 full chronos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Cairn: Extraordinary results, and world-record-breaking potential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mursaat Overseer - DPS Golem:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8McUbqhl68\"&gt;3/20 MO - Standard build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://padl.tk/u/qqYvpMU5jLdr\"&gt;4/10 MO (padl) - with Heal Signet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note on the 4/10 padl: Again due to Confusion/Torment my DPS is under-reported, but I actually ranked #2 right behind the DH and tied with the Engi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This fight was used as a baseline for testing lots of our spreadsheet assumptions in practical application. As it turns out, due to how stationary everyone is the distribution of Might and Alacrity in an 8-1-1 comp can really screw over 2 people. The fight is also so short it&amp;#39;s hard to justify a Duelist-based DPS build. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, there is room to theorycraft a potential speedkill comp using the 5-5 with 4 condi chronos. You can generate the 3 illusions quickly via the signet or scepter auto attack, and if each chrono starts their rotation slightly off-sync from the previous chrono that should cover the 90 or so seconds needed to finish the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr MO: Who cares, it&amp;#39;s MO. Possible speedkill potential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Samarog - Surprisingly yes:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZSOKMvinU\"&gt;3/20 Samarog - Standard build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2bx2yiAz3g\"&gt;3/29 Samarog - with Focus+Heal Signet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some interesting things happened with me on this fight since the raid was released. I of course tested Tempest Staff, FA Staff, and Sc/Wh as Samarog&amp;#39;s gigantic hitbox should make any Ele salivate like a dog in front of a pot roast. Needless to say, I was skeptical and biased in terms of thinking this condi Chrono build would offer anything remotely good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is why we perform science: as it turns out the build does pull its weight both in DPS and in utility. You definitely need to stick close to the hitbox so you aren&amp;#39;t fixated as the tank, but I&amp;#39;ve been impressed by the results, enough to not be sure whether me playing Tempest or this brings more to the team. Heal Signet and Focus pulls once again provide great utility to deal with the fight mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets more interesting in Challenge Mote, which I have now several hours of runtime both as a Tempest and condi Chrono: The Chrono can bring the mantra and trait for mantras to help give stability to the players chosen with Inevitable Betrayal. And while on Tempest I can certainly offer burst damage and match/exceed the DPS of the Rangers, it&amp;#39;s only of moderate benefit: sometimes phasing too fast leads to the bug where all the Spears remain on the field for the split phase, basically ensuring a wipe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These Challenge Mote runs were also the only time I got to compare this build directly against condi Mesmer, and the results were incredible. In our comp, which was 8-1-1 with 2 Druids, 2 Warriors, 1 Minstrel Chrono, 1 condi Chrono, 2 condi Mesmers, and 2 condi Rangers, I was very often battling for the top spot on the DPS meter, if not, holding onto it. And trust me, I&amp;#39;ve got tons and tons of runs under my belt to show it wasn&amp;#39;t just a fluke. Only under the most ideal circumstances did the charts align sort-of as expected, with the Rangers on top, Mesmers slightly below, and me slightly below, but here&amp;#39;s the thing: I was nowhere close to being 10-15% less DPS than the condi Mesmers at any time. My assumption, and everyone&amp;#39;s assumption, was wrong: the personal DPS tradeoff for team support is worth it far more than expected. In this case, it would have been better for at least two of us to go Condi Chrono, and possibly even all 3. I was so stunned as this was happening that I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say, but it was a clear conclusion: this was a situation where condi Chrono was effectively better than condi Mesmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for speedkill strats, there is potential yet again. Don&amp;#39;t all the shield phantasms get screwed as the chronos get eaten for the breakbars? (edit: upon video review, they don&amp;#39;t, so that point doesn&amp;#39;t matter, but the concept is the same). Why not distribute the buff responsibility across 4 chronos? Not to mention that is 4 Focus pulls to cover any situation in the split phase.

Results range from complete trash to record-breaking potential. In general, I believe I&amp;#39;ve shown enough for any condi Mesmers out there to consider swapping to condi Chrono to test it out. You might offer more for your team than being a one-trick pony on 2 fights! If a complete beginner to Mesmer and Chronomancer like me can produce these kinds of results, I&amp;#39;m positive others out there with more experience can push things even further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The build itself can move in a few different directions, notably for those actual chronomancers that scoff at the notion of playing chrono without boon duration. There are a few variations that sacrifice DPS for more, involving some Seraph gear and 4 Travelers + 2 Trapper runes, or full Seraph gear with Krait runes. My stopping point arrives well before all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exploring this build has certainly kept raiding interesting over the past month, with lots more to come. So no, I&amp;#39;m nowhere close to being finished with raiding in Guild Wars 2. And I learned a lot of other things too. The support I got for sharing my adventures publicly was an unexpected but pleasant surprise, and the haters trying to knock me down a peg were amusing to deal with as well. I never would have had this opportunity or experience without you all, so thanks for following along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, thanks to my raid group in Renegatus [Ren] for putting up with my experimentation (i.e. my garbage Chrono play) and providing an environment to explore (i.e. carrying as I &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo0-Qo6bDY\"&gt;dodge away from heals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOwcEp95yII\"&gt;CS into instant death&lt;/a&gt;), couldn&amp;#39;t have done this without you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for me, what&amp;#39;s next? Well aside from the never-ending research on Elementalist, and reminding myself to never let Knox talk me into doing anything ever again, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgdlVuZE00\"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve still got DPS opportunities to explore....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Higgs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi, I'm Higgs.\n\nFor the past month I tested and played a condi Chronomancer build for raiding. This post will describe the concept then discuss the effectiveness in the context of each available boss fight. It's going to be a vomit of words, so I have included videos at the start and tl;dr's at the end of each analysis section.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Introduction - Two Twenty-two: #\n\nThis entire thing would not have happened without the Feb 22nd patch, both good and bad. The Good: Time Warp was changed to affect 10 people. This couldn't have come at a better time for my static raid group, as our 2nd Chrono was stepping away and we were having trouble filling the position (i.e. we're not some competitive speedclear meta-topping group, just a bunch of raiders trying to get by). We could do well enough with one-chrono comps and still have fun with minimal forcing of people to play what they don't want to play, but it was getting rougher as the weeks went by. The increased limit on Druid's GotL and Warrior banners also opened a small crack in the door to alternative raid comps.\n\nAnd of course The Bad: I knew nerfs were coming to Tempest, but I didn't think they would be that bad. I survived and adapted to the July 2016 and October 2016 changes, but this was too much. \n\nMy days of exclusively playing Elementalist were over. All hail the condi meta.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Tangent - Condi Viper Tempest: #\n\nI didn't go down without a fight, of course. As a last-ditch effort I debuted the [Condi Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNvF6ap4gw) build that I had been working on for 8 months (yes, that's right, **8 months**. Spreadsheets, calculations, simulations, optimizations, the works.) and lo-and-behold, it was actually not as garbage as I thought. I brought it to some fights, had minor success (notably: inspiring [Particlar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXeQTGG0YW8) to try it out and raid more extensively with the build), but ultimately it just wasn't ready for primetime. If you're interested in seeing those results, [here's a playlist of the DPS Benchmark and select fight videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_X69G9GF-KeNS7FGS6c72SIUWFMEjhge).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Betrayal - Condi Mesmer: #\n\nI reluctantly gravitated towards condi Mesmer due to already having most of the gear for it (see the above condi Tempest experimentation) and seeing the value it provided on fights where Tempest struggled. Also at this time the \"is Necro in fact garbage?\" investigations weren't finished, so I didn't know Light Armor Viper with Berserker runes would have another use. \n\nAfter spending half a pizza 'n crystal learning the rotation, I spent the remaining 15 minutes sitting in disbelief that all those hours, weeks, months I poured into playing and perfecting Tempest could be matched and surpassed so easily by these few button presses.\n\nI was broken. I mentally prepared myself for the worst: if I could no longer be of value to my raid team, I'd simply retire from raiding altogether and move on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Rope-a-dope - Condi Chrono: #\n\nFellow guildmate and static raid group member Knox saw me toiling away in the Special Forces Training Area on a not-Tempest character, and offered to be my AFK Engi buff for the benchmarks. He listened with care and empathy as I plowed through the five stages of grief. And just when I was at my weakest, my most desperate and vulnerable, he found an opening to strike:  \n\n\"How about a condi chrono?\"  \n\nWe both knew the situation: Knox was carrying our raid group HARD as the only one dedicated enough to play Chronomancer. Everyone knew Tempest was my thing, whether it was DPS or healing. Knox began by outlining some spreadsheet numbers of what a complimentary Chrono would look like side-by-side with his carry, and what the quickness, alacrity, and DPS numbers would be like. And I was the only one with the gear and the mentality (i.e. stupidity mixed with depression backed by scientific inquisitiveness) to pull this off.\n\nI somehow agreed to this nonsense, and to this day I still don't know or remember how it happened. Knox adds \"oh btw, you'll need a Viper's Shield with a Sigil of Concentration\". I'm already completely numb at this point, as I pick up 40g worth of Freshwater Pearls off the Trading Post...\n\n...hero point train... Blink, Portal, well of something for toxic bacon...\n\n...a few days later I load into Bastion of the Penitent with my teammates, having 0 experience playing condi Mesmer and 0 experience playing any kind of Chronomancer in any raid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Experimentation - Preface: #\n\nI made a fun trailer video for my upcoming adventures, to keep my mind off the idea that this could potentially be my last go at raiding in Guild Wars 2:\n\n[Condi Chronomancer - Official Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYzNu648ys)\n\nAnd of course, the [requisite DPS Benchmark video with build information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YSXezDxCXQ).\n\nThe key thing to keep in mind with this build: ***The idea is to replace the role of a condi Mesmer***. You just happen to provide Quickness and Alacrity (hence why I often call this build the Condi Chrono Hybrid) in situations where your group may not have full coverage. This is typically because 1) you only have 1 chronomancer and 2) your 2 chronos can't provide 100% uptime due to skill, mistakes, or fight mechanics. A repeated critique of this build is glancing at our group's Quickness/Alacrity data, or my personal Quickness/Alacrity uptime and concluding this build is garbage. And my response is the same: I'm not a Chrono, I'm a Tempest. I played this condi Chrono with the mindset of a hybrid build: where I still require support from the main Chrono, but I also just happen to provide some nice utility to support the group. A relevant comparison would be the Might stacks generated while playing Tempest, either with Overload Fire or Scepter blasts in Fire Fields. Sure the uptime is ok, and it's nice to provide additional support for the team, but I'm still going in relying on support from the Warriors. So my general conclusions are framed like this: would it have been better if I just played Tempest and we rolled with just 1 chrono?\n\nThe most common variation from the base build is to sacrifice Quickness for more utility, whether swapping shield for focus, or dropping Well of Action for something else. The heal skill is a function of the fight mechanics: for a short fight or one with lots of short phases, choose the Heal Signet like a condi Mesmer. If not, choose the Well. Traits were rarely changed.\n\nA note on DPS meters: Confusion and Torment are under-reported in arcdps Area Stats, but are effectively accurate in Personal Stats and bgdm. bgdm stops the DPS timer during phases and invulnerability, arcdps treats the entire time in combat as part of DPS calculations, making numbers look lower and more normalized. Padls come from arcdps logs.\n\nA note on music: Yes, I know I have bad taste in music.\n\nThe following sections are ordered by the 11 raid bosses, not chronologically, so I put a date on when the fight happened to reflect this. Play quality in the videos varies from \"utter garbage\" to \"hey, doing better kid\" which also correlates with the date of the fight, so I try to be as transparent as possible about pointing out my mistakes. I also often make two conclusions based on context and will try to distinguish between the two: raiding in general and speedkill theorycraft.\n\nOk, here we go:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Vale Guardian - Not Bad: #\n\n[3/26 VG - with Focus+Heal Signet (no green circle team)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcICGnzCu10)\n\nI was super skeptical that this would work. Additionally, this is one of the few decent fights left for Tempest, so my baises were set. As it turns out, with the Heal Signet and Focus, and with standard tanking strategies, you can pull your weight and provide pretty good support and DPS. First things first, you're a prime candidate for green circle team. As such, you can offer a touch of Quickness and Alacrity to the others on the green circle team with some good timing, something they wouldn't have had anyways. Second, you're a natural fit for the Red Guardian for split phases. \n\nObviously since the first video is a PUG run you can't pull too many conclusions from it, but I mean, look at it: Chronomancer top DPS. There's a lot of room for exploration. I've got two weeks worth of green circle team experience now, but the videos are kinda bleh (aside from the fun [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYnj60LHyIg) and the [alternate clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo0-Qo6bDY) I made from one of them). But the concept is straightforward: summon duelists, go to green circle, and use Focus pull to keep seekers off you as your lazyass teammates don't knock them back.\n\nBased on my experience, I don't think this build is applicable to speedkills of this boss. Phases change too fast and Distortion-share squeezes tons of value out of the traditional Chronomancer build.\n\n**tl;dr VG: Surprisingly playable, and a fun challenge!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Gorseval - Least Surprising Conclusion: #\n\n[3/20 Gorseval (padl)](https://padl.tk/u/johusbbAxdaf)\n\n[4/10 Gorseval (padl)](https://padl.tk/u/tZdCaxllkipE)\n\nIf you are curious I can post a video, but I don't think it's worth it. We all know condi Mesmers get crushed on this fight, and it happens to be more of the same for condi chrono. I can't pull the DPS and can't offer enough utility to justify using this build on this fight, and can't in good faith recommend it in any way.\n\n**tl;dr Gors: NOPE.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Sabetha - Challenge and Potential: #\n\n[4/03 Sabetha - with Heal Signet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikc_hdYEynE)\n\n[4/10 Sabetha - with Focus+Heal Signet - flak kiter + sapper bomber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhewWDZwTww)\n\nThe build both shines and faces tough challenges in this fight. Shines in that the utility you provide stands out as cannoners and kiters are out and about, as supporting 8.5 or 9 players is easier than 10. But the numerous phase changes and random deaths of your duelists in the last phase make your DPS impact rather challenging. This fight really showcases the strength of the meta 2-chrono comp, notably getting cannoners back up to speed with boons when they return.\n\nHowever, there is a bright side: this build can kite the flak with a minimal negative impact on DPS, compared to other DPS classes and arguably even Druids. And because of this, there may be an opportunity for a speedkill theorycraft. Consider a 5-5, where you replace a chrono and a ranger with two condi chronos so that your druids can stay in with the group. Couldn't that be enough? It's tough to say, but for the theorycrafters out there, I'd say there are some nice ideas here to noodle on.\n\n**tl;dr Sab: Lots of potential, lots of opportunity to support, but it's a challenge.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Slothasor - Not recommended: #\n\n[3/22 Slothasor - with Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgeSyKCmx8I)\n\nThis is one of the first fights where I started to feel the difference between just a raw condi Mesmer DPS and the hybrid support role of condi Chrono, as the condi Mesmer is just miserable at this fight. In typical groups with the standard tanking strategy it's no surprise that 2 dedicated Chronos can't keep up the quickness and alacrity uptime. Well placement is super tactical, and the adds and boon strip and desire for projectile hate and focus pulls really puts a strain on what a pair of Chronos can do. But is there room for a 3rd Chrono as a condi hybrid? Probably not on this particular fight. On other fights though...\n\nAnyways, I ultimately feel like I could offer more utility and support and DPS as Tempest on this fight, so experimentation here has mostly concluded.\n\n**tl;dr Sloth: Playable, but not recommended.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Matthias - DOMINATION: #\n\n[Matthias Video Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOwcEp95yII)\n\n[4/03 Matthias - with Feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpWL_lJ5BLY)\n\nIt is well documented that condi Mesmer is great on this fight. Aside from being sacrificed, everything works in your favor: little DPS variation due to distance from boss or dealing with mechanics, bonus DPS due to Confusion and Torment, and a free utility to bring reflect with no loss. \n\nWhen I have to paraphrase to describe this condi Chrono build to people, a common phrase I throw around for simplicity is \"10-15% less DPS than condi Mesmer\", which is of course in ideal DPS golem situations. In practical application, there are times when it's worse and sometimes it's better. \n\nHere, I truly believe it is better. There is so much movement and individual accountability in this fight that it's too rough to expect the 2 chrono meta comp to provide 100% quickness and alacrity, and there are plenty of videos and padls out there that show this. How about just dropping them and running a handful of condi Chronos instead? Having multiple sources of spot quickness/alacrity turns out to be pretty good opposed to shoving all the support responsibility onto 2 Chronos, and you can simultaneously DPS carry. Doesn't that sound... absurd?\n\nA baseline theorycraft for a new speedkill record would be as follows: 5-5 comp, 2 condi Druids, 2 condi Warriors, 2 condi Rangers, 4 condi Chronos. With some RNG (i.e. non-chronos getting sacrificed) and everyone paying attention to the mechanics (i.e. not needing a full healer), this seems pretty good on paper.\n\nAlas, that all goes beyond the scope of my testing here. However, even in pug runs, if I see a 5-5 or 8-1-1 comp with 2 Chronos, I'm still playing condi Chrono on this fight. Warriors and Ranger/Druids are too strong to not support, and if anything I'm still doing more than whatever the hell I think I can do on Tempest.\n\n**tl;dr Matty: Obviously good, arguably better than condi Mesmer, and potentially world record-breaking-ly good.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Keep Construct - Barf: #\n\n[3/22 KC (padl)](https://padl.tk/u/D6z6WRFhz5FR)\n\nNot much to say here. I provide tremendous value as a Tempest on this fight, and condi Chrono utility and DPS both suffer.\n\n**tl;dr KC: Obviously bad, but good to check just to make sure.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Xera - So close: #\n\n[4/05 Xera - with Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLN5iJlrmjI)\n\nLike Sabetha, this is a fight where the mechanics can randomly kill your duelists. Like Matthias, this fight can also arbitrarily punish your DPS by sending you to the platform at 40% and 20%, evaporating your duelists.\n\nAll that said, this actually is an ok fight for condi Chrono. With the heal signet and Focus, you can absorb the phase changes and keep up duelists through moderate nonsense, all while offering Focus pull utility. And as shown in the video, standing on the button is a breeze.\n\nI don't think I've done enough to eliminate all possibility, but theorycraft on this fight goes way deeper than my scope and ability, if anything is even there to find. As for pugging and general raiding, due to the 5-5 comp feeling very natural for this fight, and how it's one of the few fights remaining where I can feel useful playing FA Staff Tempest, I'm unlikely to dive deeper.\n\n**tl;dr Xera: Almost playable, can't recommend, but an interesting option.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Cairn - Superstar: #\n\n[3/22 Cairn (9-man) - Standard build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oPc9GhqXAs)\n\n[4/05 Cairn -  Standard build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8EUpoRjPKc)\n\nLike Matthias, Cairn is one of the theoretically best fights for condi Mesmer, and the same certainly holds true for this build. No reason to beat around the bush: I'm positive a speedkill record for this fight can be achieved using this build, starting with the aforementioned 5-5 comp with 4 condi chronos. Or possibly even 6. Everyone moves around so much for the mechanics (i.e. out of your wells), that the meta 2 chronos have a tough time supplying everyone with 100% Alacrity uptime and to a lesser extent, Quickness. Why not just have \"everyone\" supply their own? \n\nIf anything, playing this build on this fight is great just for the hilarity of seeing that \"Chr\" at #1 on the DPS meter, lol. In pug groups I'd bring the build even if we were setup 5-5 with 2 full chronos.\n\n**tl;dr Cairn: Extraordinary results, and world-record-breaking potential.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Mursaat Overseer - DPS Golem: #\n\n[3/20 MO - Standard build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8McUbqhl68)\n\n[4/10 MO (padl) - with Heal Signet](https://padl.tk/u/qqYvpMU5jLdr)\n\nNote on the 4/10 padl: Again due to Confusion/Torment my DPS is under-reported, but I actually ranked #2 right behind the DH and tied with the Engi.\n\nThis fight was used as a baseline for testing lots of our spreadsheet assumptions in practical application. As it turns out, due to how stationary everyone is the distribution of Might and Alacrity in an 8-1-1 comp can really screw over 2 people. The fight is also so short it's hard to justify a Duelist-based DPS build. \n\nThat said, there is room to theorycraft a potential speedkill comp using the 5-5 with 4 condi chronos. You can generate the 3 illusions quickly via the signet or scepter auto attack, and if each chrono starts their rotation slightly off-sync from the previous chrono that should cover the 90 or so seconds needed to finish the encounter.\n\n**tl;dr MO: Who cares, it's MO. Possible speedkill potential.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Samarog - Surprisingly yes: #\n\n[3/20 Samarog - Standard build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZSOKMvinU)\n\n[3/29 Samarog - with Focus+Heal Signet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2bx2yiAz3g)\n\nSome interesting things happened with me on this fight since the raid was released. I of course tested Tempest Staff, FA Staff, and Sc/Wh as Samarog's gigantic hitbox should make any Ele salivate like a dog in front of a pot roast. Needless to say, I was skeptical and biased in terms of thinking this condi Chrono build would offer anything remotely good. \n\nBut this is why we perform science: as it turns out the build does pull its weight both in DPS and in utility. You definitely need to stick close to the hitbox so you aren't fixated as the tank, but I've been impressed by the results, enough to not be sure whether me playing Tempest or this brings more to the team. Heal Signet and Focus pulls once again provide great utility to deal with the fight mechanics.\n\nIt gets more interesting in Challenge Mote, which I have now several hours of runtime both as a Tempest and condi Chrono: The Chrono can bring the mantra and trait for mantras to help give stability to the players chosen with Inevitable Betrayal. And while on Tempest I can certainly offer burst damage and match/exceed the DPS of the Rangers, it's only of moderate benefit: sometimes phasing too fast leads to the bug where all the Spears remain on the field for the split phase, basically ensuring a wipe.\n\nThese Challenge Mote runs were also the only time I got to compare this build directly against condi Mesmer, and the results were incredible. In our comp, which was 8-1-1 with 2 Druids, 2 Warriors, 1 Minstrel Chrono, 1 condi Chrono, 2 condi Mesmers, and 2 condi Rangers, I was very often battling for the top spot on the DPS meter, if not, holding onto it. And trust me, I've got tons and tons of runs under my belt to show it wasn't just a fluke. Only under the most ideal circumstances did the charts align sort-of as expected, with the Rangers on top, Mesmers slightly below, and me slightly below, but here's the thing: I was nowhere close to being 10-15% less DPS than the condi Mesmers at any time. My assumption, and everyone's assumption, was wrong: the personal DPS tradeoff for team support is worth it far more than expected. In this case, it would have been better for at least two of us to go Condi Chrono, and possibly even all 3. I was so stunned as this was happening that I didn't know what to say, but it was a clear conclusion: this was a situation where condi Chrono was effectively better than condi Mesmer.\n\nAs for speedkill strats, there is potential yet again. Don't all the shield phantasms get screwed as the chronos get eaten for the breakbars? (edit: upon video review, they don't, so that point doesn't matter, but the concept is the same). Why not distribute the buff responsibility across 4 chronos? Not to mention that is 4 Focus pulls to cover any situation in the split phase. The theorycraft is wide open.\n\n**tl;dr Samarog: Actually playable, and has potential as part of a speedkill strategy.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Deimos - Insufficient Data: #\n\nWhile I have a few attempts at this boss with this build, I don't have good examples of kills. I tried both being the chrono that got teleported thus sacrificing all my duelists, and being the puddle kiter with Well of Precognition, but can't really claim any conclusion. I'm one of the weirdos that really loves doing the hand kiting, and boy do I have some videos on being all sorts of Tempest on this fight!\n\n[Deimos - No One Saw That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgzFlQYcpOQ)\n\n[Deimos - Heal Tempest kiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbb4egTZYg4)\n\n[Deimos - The Keybinding Wipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uJyImZlAwk)\n\n[Deimos - The Role Switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHO_HLeu5-k)\n\n[Deimos Bug Report - Floating Saul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Q9eR-GgTQ)\n\n[Deimos - D/Wh Auramancer puddle kiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ2YVrEuF6k)\n\n**tl;dr Deimos: Not enough data. Doesn't feel promising for theorycraft though.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Conclusion - Many Thanks:#\n\n*\"Don\u2019t be a class nazi. Every class can do the job if played correctly. You don\u2019t need the highest possible damage to kill a boss.\"* - [qT] Benchmarks Disclaimer\n\nThere you have it. Results range from complete trash to record-breaking potential. In general, I believe I've shown enough for any condi Mesmers out there to consider swapping to condi Chrono to test it out. You might offer more for your team than being a one-trick pony on 2 fights! If a complete beginner to Mesmer and Chronomancer like me can produce these kinds of results, I'm positive others out there with more experience can push things even further.\n\nThe build itself can move in a few different directions, notably for those actual chronomancers that scoff at the notion of playing chrono without boon duration. There are a few variations that sacrifice DPS for more, involving some Seraph gear and 4 Travelers + 2 Trapper runes, or full Seraph gear with Krait runes. My stopping point arrives well before all that.\n\nExploring this build has certainly kept raiding interesting over the past month, with lots more to come. So no, I'm nowhere close to being finished with raiding in Guild Wars 2. And I learned a lot of other things too. The support I got for sharing my adventures publicly was an unexpected but pleasant surprise, and the haters trying to knock me down a peg were amusing to deal with as well. I never would have had this opportunity or experience without you all, so thanks for following along.\n\nAnd of course, thanks to my raid group in Renegatus [Ren] for putting up with my experimentation (i.e. my garbage Chrono play) and providing an environment to explore (i.e. carrying as I [dodge away from heals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo0-Qo6bDY) and [CS into instant death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOwcEp95yII)), couldn't have done this without you all.\n\nAs for me, what's next? Well aside from the never-ending research on Elementalist, and reminding myself to never let Knox talk me into doing anything ever again, [I've still got DPS opportunities to explore....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgdlVuZE00)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n-Higgs", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "[Build]", "id": "65q3m9", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 192, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HiggsBosonHL", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65q3m9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Guildwars2", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IN2xZIR-CRpQSkpSYJAPWfSf_Dc7PYFVpJ11rMWIFis.jpg?s=7d358999176232fb2ede9743893e8348", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IN2xZIR-CRpQSkpSYJAPWfSf_Dc7PYFVpJ11rMWIFis.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=023ec1ae9a390f21174ab0b36206248b", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IN2xZIR-CRpQSkpSYJAPWfSf_Dc7PYFVpJ11rMWIFis.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=3972d03132dd478f49437f94a31cf7f3", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IN2xZIR-CRpQSkpSYJAPWfSf_Dc7PYFVpJ11rMWIFis.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=2f4314c75d89168a784f858ac1fccf09", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "eYGPwL-VpNN4iOc6qp68OY5GiMA8uhXlPRX79JYURyY"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "edited": 1492410366.0, "link_flair_css_class": "bui", "author_flair_css_class": "Tempest", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Guildwars2/comments/65q3m9/raiding_as_a_condi_chronomancer_for_a_month/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390666.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/65q3m9/raiding_as_a_condi_chronomancer_for_a_month/", "author_flair_text": "Higgs", "quarantine": false, "title": "Raiding as a Condi Chronomancer for a month: \"Stupidity mixed with Depression backed by Scientific Inquisitiveness\"", "created_utc": 1492361866.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 73, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 192}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q3m9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q3m9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcf8yj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "W2T", "parent_id": "t1_dgcch82", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How will you know it's sub-optimal if you don't optimize it :P.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you know it&amp;#39;s sub-optimal if you don&amp;#39;t optimize it :P.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgcf8yj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492398427.0, "created_utc": 1492369627.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q3m9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q3m9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcf6sk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "W2T", "parent_id": "t1_dgcdim3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like your videos too.

This has dropped to 4, arguably 5, of the 11 bosses.\n\nNot being optimal doesn't mean ineffective. Despite what qT say on their website, I still see them running Tempest on bosses they've deemed \"non-effective\". Their guides are intended to give you an idea of what to expect, but it doesn't mean you can't make it work for those bosses. You certainly can.\n\nYou also should remember that guilds like qT are aiming for optimal speed strategies. Tempests will still get you the kill on Xera, etc. if you're comfortable with the class and mechanics.\n\n&gt; Why bother putting in all those hours and months of training, only to be punished later for succeeding?
