Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m not saying dying is the end of the world. I&amp;#39;m just saying that if you don&amp;#39;t want to die constantly, you&amp;#39;ll need to be very aware of where that line between &amp;quot;oh shit, I&amp;#39;m fucked&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I should probably back off a bit&amp;quot; is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: Necromancer main for 3 years, 3.7k hours and a lot of solo roaming in WvW.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgdy61c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484901.0, "created_utc": 1492456101.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz3f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdqs89", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HealyUnit", "parent_id": "t3_65vz3f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Gonna echo /u/Gberg888 : Use your Shroud.
