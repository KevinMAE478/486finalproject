I&amp;#39;ve met so many wonderful people, experienced so many enjoyable events. From the first time the Mad King burst from the fountain in Lion&amp;#39;s Arch, to the shocking realization of Mordremoth&amp;#39;s awakening after the tense climactic Battle on the Breachmaker (which in my opinion was the best world boss in the game) to the latest thrilling raids, Guild Wars 2 has been something special to me. Powering through to 30,000 Achievement Points certainly had its challenges.

For all its ups and downs though, this game has offered me so much, and the time I&amp;#39;ve spent in it is time well spent.
