After reading Reddit forums for long i wanted to give my opinion about GW2. Not rant, nor praising just wanted to express my current feeling and attitude towards the game. Read it like a short and i hope interesting story about experienced player journey. And dont judge my English, its not my first language, so be kind\uf04a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My history&lt;/strong&gt;. I started playing GW2 at launch. Was watching promotional videos and i was so hyped for the game. Prior to that only multiplayer games i was playing were WoW on private servers (BC and WotLK) and DOTA, since then i was teenager and couldn&amp;#39;t afford sub. So i knew GW2 was my go to game and will be my first MMORPG i will dedicate myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And i was right, &lt;strong&gt;i fell in love with GW2&lt;/strong&gt;. Best experience in MMORPG is when you know nothing about it, danger is on every corner, and you know nothing on where to go and what to do. I had fun, went to max level, played dungeons, world bosses, story etc. But i soon got bored and stopped, because i didn&amp;#39;t get deep into the game at that time yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2014. I met real life friend, who mentioned GW2 and that he is playing, with &lt;strong&gt;new updates and LS2&lt;/strong&gt;. So i decide to reinstall and started playing again. I actualy got so addicted to game, more than the first time. I went from 1800AP to 13500ap in like 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game has a lot to offer to new players. I started doing achievements, had fun doing Jumping puzzles and doing exploration. Sometimes just going around with no purpose, listening to music, listening to various dialogues in  a world around me, finding great scenery,making screenshots or climbing highest peak. I remember first time i saw Priory base, up in mountains. It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into dungeon runs. First learning CoF, CoE etc. Then going for Arah. And Arah is where i had most fun. It was so challenging for a noob like me back then. Slowly i started speed running them, with pugs usually. I mained thief so soon i knew every skip, every shortcut. Was swaping weapons on the go dagger/dagger, sword pistol,dagger pistol, same with utility skills and traits. I crafted my first legendry then also \u2013 Incinerator. I really learned my class, knew every trait and how to swap it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was one of the &lt;strong&gt;great points of the game&lt;/strong&gt;. Simple at start, but there is a lot to learn and become efficient as you learn your surroundings, class and hidden secrets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After i got bored with dungeons i started doing PvP. It was end of 2014 i think. I somehow managed to get into top 100 on old Leaderboards. I didn&amp;#39;t use metabattle, crafted my own build(which was meta battle d/p build anyway).  I really got into it, first time i found guild, made friends with whom i PvPed,\nPvEed etc... It was first time i started making alts also. I learned so much and most of all i made a lot of great memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere at that time &lt;em&gt;Bio-luminescent armor&lt;/em&gt; was released, and &lt;strong&gt;Silverwastes&lt;/strong&gt; map introduced. I spend more time than i am willing to admit in SW. I farmed that set really fast. But most of all, I remember the times, running around getting killed by  those mobs, defending fortress, running to help abandoned ones, killing bosses and praying to RNGJesus to drop required body part for armor set. It was IMO best map ANET did. Also i was so hyped for new LS2, couldn&amp;#39;t wait to the patch day, and was devouring story and achievements in 2 days after release. I still remember frustration around centaur achievements, and shadow dragon arena. It was challenging, but most of all i had fun. It was first time in GW2 that i made closer ties to the GW2 community, during SW and story achievements. There was a lot of joking in SW chat, cries in achievement mission etc... I was online moment the patch that &lt;strong&gt;introduced Jumping puzzle in SW&lt;/strong&gt; dropped. First, whole map was searching for entrance, then 3 hours of pure pain in the tunnels:) Then after i already finished the jumping puzzle, some player announced in chat that you can use scritt tunnels to port to checkpoints /facepalm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a small hiatus and HOT release. No lifing again. Except for Dragon stand, which is so boring and uninspirative, &lt;strong&gt;i liked all 3 maps&lt;/strong&gt;. Exploring, getting lost, learning meta boss battles, learning events and doing achievements. Skill points were also great fights...and did them while SPtrains were still not a thing. Not popular oppinion, but i actually liked adventures . This was great addition to the game, and since i didn&amp;#39;t rush masteries i didn&amp;#39;t feel the urge to do them. I just did it for fun, especially with friends and on Team speak, laughing at failures and frustration, and enjoying cheers when one of us finally gets gold.First 3 HoT maps had a depth to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only thing that was lacking was story, in my opinion&lt;/strong&gt;. Honestly, WTF was that. After the hype i got from the last trailer of LS2 i was expecting a best story ever. Rytlock was so bad-ass in that trailer, story just got a great twist, and just got serious and dark. I couldn&amp;#39;t wait to continue it. And what i got was SOAP OPERA.  What a missed opportunity. What a fiasco. I am into GW2 lore, books were great (also had a bit of dark and mysterious nature), GW1 was great...but what we got in HoT and even worse LS3. Dont try to white knight it. There is voice acting and all. But it is so freaking bad and boring, made for 13 years old children. There are no epic characters, there are no epic enemies. I honestly do not carre about another dragon, without back story, who will devour all magic, and we just go from one to other killing them like simple rabbits. Even the Eir death, who i liked from books, was meh (compared to Tybald). I didnt even play LS3 episode 3 except for the first mission. Honestly dont know why. Its bland and boring i think. Shallow. Predictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even bought WoW Legion and subbed (and dam it ripped of so much GW2 features). It is not better than GW2, but made me realise some things i really like and felt gw2 is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok now to the point of the post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Voice acting isnt enough. Step up your game ANET. Go into depth a bit. &lt;strong&gt;I want those chills i got when i first watched HOT announcement&lt;/strong&gt;. I want dubious moral choises,deep characters, feeling of real threat (not meh another dragon woke up and whining Braham who feels like spoiled child). I reccomend everyone to watch the sequence on Youtube from WoW Legion, when Greymane encounters Sylvanas. 1 minute sequence, which made me read WoW lore for whole week. I was in awe after watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel that this was great addition to game. I do not get why are people complaining (legendary armor?). If it is not your style do not play it. No one forces you. It is one of the thing i like about the GW2, you can do whatever you like.  For me it was a challenge to see how well i know the game and my class. And most of all i had a lot of fun and met a lot of new people. Note however, i pugged all 3 wings of first raid and got around 70 LI. It was not that hard, and honestly i do not understand complaints about comunity. I didnt have any problems finding groups (thought i made a good deal of research of builds, boss mechanics, and different POI videos of boss kills. I had to gear elementalist and viper engi for this). It was my first time raiding in MMO, and  i really felt a sence of acomplishment when i downed 1st boss...and afterwards each one. There were a lot of failures, not great groups...but you  raise up and after a month i did it. It really reignited my interest in gw2. I repeat, you do this for fun, and you will do it. Not because of shiny pixels you get for reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HoT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As i mentioned i liked first 3 of HoT maps. Sence of new, exploration was present.  A lot of great screenshots. Sence of danger. And then we got LS3 maps(Ember Bay best of them). Which are bad. I barely spend 2 hours in them all together. Really, returning and repeatable hearths...that got me bored after 2 repetitions. Hop in, press 1 at various creeps or f to pick up object, win and get reward. Sorry, not for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love gw2 gear system. You make gear and you are relevant whenever you jump to play. But sometimes you need a bit of that incentive, small, but one that keep you going. Maybe add new gear slot.... I liked trinkets in WoW (jewelcrafting 500?). They give you various bonuses like haste, damage absorption, summon pet or just press trinket to shock target for some dmg once in a 60 seconds cooldown. And they can impact your build a lot or change the way you play it. Make them obtainable from world bosses, fractals or something so we can hunt them around Tyria or craft. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the casual nature of GW2. But it is becoming too casual, esspecialy with new maps.  I know there has to be balance to it and that casual is trend in global gaming. But i am not going to play a game where i run around flat fields (looking at EB and Lake Doric,), pressing one button and clutering my inventory with rewards. There is no cooperation between players, no communication like they were on HoT maps on release.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was the point then of learning my character, getting gear if nothing new is going to challenge me. &lt;strong&gt;New expansion need to have both of maps like Tangled depth and Ember bay&lt;/strong&gt;. It is core of GW2. A little bit of everything for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World PvP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to see some of it in GW2. Not WvWvW zerg party. A few areas in new expansion, where players can chose faction and do events. Something like SW but imagine people &lt;strong&gt;chosing to defend or attack&lt;/strong&gt;. A real living world. Maybe allow players to &lt;strong&gt;play as white mantle,centaur&lt;/strong&gt; (chance missed with mordremoth sylvary) give them &lt;strong&gt;preset abilities&lt;/strong&gt; if needed for balance, and allow them to participate on different side of same event. Not ranked pvp, or competitive, just for fun with rewards for both sides (2 blue 1 green).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not mean it to be competitor to WvW. Something in line of one or two Silverwastes sized maps, where players could compete for events, ressources and waypoints all across the map, or play on different factions. It doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be balanced, just fun. Add some armor or weapon sets in order/chaos variant, or reputation and titles as rewards for both sides. Just those 2 maps, which would serve to the liking of players who like that. &lt;strong&gt;People who do not like it, do not need to play it and can play other normal PvE maps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeons and quests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legendary weapon collection and dungeons. Those were  fun part of the game for me. I still do not get why it isnt developed more.At least make some more collections to make you travel around Tyria, toss some story or background characters. It was great way to experience lore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WoW ripped current events form GW2. It is called world quests and legion invasions. I would like something similar implemented. A few events per zone for some kind of reward, rotating daily. It makes zones feel so alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the only game i feel like rewards are chore. 140 inventory slots and i am always full. Restructure economy...honestly i would rather get 50-60 silver drop once in a while than 10 greens every few minutes. Not to mention &lt;strong&gt;sigils and salvaging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NExt thing currencies. Now that HoT launch is long behind us, i suggest merging HoT currencies and keys in one or at least putting them in valet, so people have freedom to play any of the 4 original maps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;strong&gt;the best implemented rewards in game&lt;/strong&gt; was Bioluminescence armor set. It was released piece by piece over a period of 1-3 months. There was a great collections behind it. It made SW content relevant and maps alive. One set made me play a lot, and made content realy replayable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards and housing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One set of rewards could be redirected to housing. Currently scribbing and decoration potential is not fully used on Guild Halls. I would like to collect trophies from bosses i kill . Memories of adventures and battles. Instead of dropping greens and blues all the way, some more challenging bosses, dungeon bosses, including world bosses could drop shards used for special decorations in my new Personal Area or &lt;strong&gt;Home instance&lt;/strong&gt;. Or add Rare Collections for some trophies. This would revive a lot of old content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Ok guys.

Yeah, it does feel like blog post, i had a lot more to write, maybe i ll do in near future. I just wanted to toss some ideas and highlight some of things that worked for me in Gw2.\n\nAbout your reply.\n\n**Dungeons** I know they are still there. but after getting *Dungeoneer* title and doing each one of them for at least 50+ times, i am looking forward to the new dungeons, with new achievements and titles.\n\n**Raids** I just mentioned them as a content i like. I know its niche content, and some people do not like them. But i consider that they should be further development and fit GW2 content well.\n\n**PvP mode** I explained that one badly, because it seems lot of people misunderstood me. I am not looking for new PvP mode. Thing which is am looking forward is new PvE maps (one or two maps for example, in the new expansion), with a bit of open world PvP. I consider than no scripted NPC can match real persons. So some events like Silverwastes or Verdant Brink, scattered around map, with 2 opposing factions. Nothing requring competitive play, meta builds etc. IF you cant take fortress from faction 2, you can go hunt NPC bosses, do escort events etc...Both faction get karma, normal event rewards etc. So people who want a bit of different PvE experience can play it and spice it up. Who doesn't want- he isnt forced into it. I think this kind of map would add to community building, making of meaningfull parties etc...\n\n**Salvaging** Only problem i see - is that reward system that toss bunch of items at you, feels like a chore. I dont consider it game breaking to spent 5 min salvaging and sorting inventory...but still IMO reward system needs revision. About sigils, is there anyone in this game that loves them? Just remove them completly or something, and add them to karma, HoT or LS3 currency specialized merchant or something...\n\n**Story** Everyone has different attitudes. I respect your opinion. Mine is that story is becoming shallow and bland after HoT, especially compared to Gw1. But lets see how it ends:)\n\n**Story**  I see sour point. Yep there is contradiction here. Might not bee good idea. \n\n**Gear** Thing i am utterly against is power creep. This would need a bit of balance of player stats or PvE.

Open world and guild content is plain boring. World bosses are mostly stand and press one. WoW Legion had interesting idea for open world. Legion is invading one zone and players are building three structures, by gathering resources around the map. It took few days to build and provides some buffs and new content when built. Building lasts for 3 days and gets destroyed, and then you have to start building again. Meanwhile there are lot of different mini quests around the map for players to play together. It would be great to have in GW2...in the end it could lead to challenging world boss or something.\n\nReleased content is not really replayable, people get bored fast. Yep. Cause rewards are boring. Most armor sets are outfits now in gemstore. Where is bio-luminescence, at least on one new HoT map, where every piece of gear had it collection.

Open world and guild content is plain boring. World bosses are mostly stand and press one. WoW Legion had interesting idea for open world. Legion is invading one zone and players are building three structures, by gathering resources around the map. It took few days to build and provides some buffs and new content when built. Building lasts for 3 days and gets destroyed, and then you have to start building again. Meanwhile there are lot of different mini quests around the map for players to play together. It would be great to have in GW2...in the end it could lead to challenging world boss or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Released content is not really replayable, people get bored fast. Yep.
