This thread will start with the general issues, and narrow down to the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Class Origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The engineer class is perhaps the only class I know of unique to Guild Wars 2 -- with revenant and mesmer coming in a close second. Most MMOs do not have an analogue to the engineer. This is a good thing. Hell, this is a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a problem. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR2Esy83MQ0\"&gt;The class started partly as a joke.&lt;/a&gt; The commando, while not responsible for the origin of the engineer (the idea started earlier than that) did play a large role in some of the skills we see today -- in particular grenade kit, mortar kit, and orbital strike. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The class was also an afterthought -- it was the last of the original 8 to be made, as documented in &lt;a href=\"http://tap-repeatedly.com/2011/06/exclusive-interview-arenanets-jon-peters-and-jonathan-sharp/\"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jon P&lt;/em&gt;: I wouldn\u2019t say they were assured, but some were more likely. The ranger was on the fence as we split it into two things, and those merged back together.  When we had twelve professions there was actually no ranger, but when we went back down to seven, the ranger came back. The reason I keep referring to seven professions is because for a while we thought that was going to be the final number. The reason why we went to eight was because &lt;strong&gt;the engineer was not part of the final seven.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_\n&lt;strong&gt;Armor&lt;/strong&gt;\n_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Engineer was originally slated to be a heavy armor class, and was later changed to a medium armor class. This noticeably affected the armor styles available to the engineer in the early game, and even to this day. In fact, there was very little armor that was clearly designed for an engineer before it was added later via the gem store. Most of the medium armor present in the game is clearly designed for rangers and thieves, with little thought given to engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we still don&amp;#39;t see much in the way of armor design for engineer. The new outfits and gemstore armors don&amp;#39;t fit an engineer&amp;#39;s aesthetic. Minor nods have been given to us, such as Magitech armor and the Gas Mask, but by and large we don&amp;#39;t see much armor design given to engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this shows. The new &amp;quot;legendary&amp;quot; armor precursors hint at what the finished product will look like. While the Envoy armor doesn&amp;#39;t really fit any of the three medium classes (looks more fit for a necro), it &lt;em&gt;REALLY&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t fit an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_\n&lt;strong&gt;Weapons&lt;/strong&gt;\n_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also didn&amp;#39;t see weapons designed with engineers in mind. Notably, the first rifle and pistol legendaries were clearly designed for warriors and thieves respectively. The Predator is a sniper rifle -- but the engineer&amp;#39;s attacks fire from the hip. Quip is a troll/joke weapon and clearly fits the thief&amp;#39;s aesthetic more than the engineer&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout Guild Wars&amp;#39; Living Stories, when new weapon skins were added, they typically didn&amp;#39;t include pistol or rifle, the engineer&amp;#39;s only weapons pre-HoT. The notable exceptions are the Aetherblade weapons and arguably HOPE. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which! Our weapon kits don&amp;#39;t display legendary weapon effects and aren&amp;#39;t visually customizable. Every engineer has the same flamethrower, the same bomb kit, etc. Why are we the only class that gets screwed visually?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most classes are represented throughout the storyline of the game -- both in personal story and the larger living world. But engineer has almost no representation showing. The only major representation engineer had was killed off pretty early, and there are none that spring to mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heavy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warrior: Rytlock Brimstone, Canach, Warmaster Forgal Kernsson, the Vigil membership, and many smaller examples&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardian: Braham Eirsson, Logan Thackeray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenant: Rytlock Brimstone. There is a story reason that revenant does not have more representation, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranger: Eir Stegalkin, Rox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thief: Caithe, the Order of Whispers membership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;: Tybalt Leftpaw and Scarlet Briar, both of whom are dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesmer: Kasmeer, Queen Jennah, Lady Wi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necromancer: Trahearne, Marjory Delaqua&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elementalist: Snaff, Zojja, Magister Sieran, The Durmand Priory membership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Misc: Taimi (We never observe her directly in combat, it&amp;#39;s only Scruffy. It&amp;#39;s implied she&amp;#39;s a golemancer, which is typically an elementalist)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Engineer is possibly one of the most complicated classes to play and learn, next to elementalist in terms of complexity. Previously, there were simple engineer builds that were viable, but they have gotten nerfed into oblivion, or power creeped into obscurity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also notable is the fact that the Scrapper, the Engineer&amp;#39;s current elite specialization, is the only elite specialization that seems entirely designed for PvP. All the other elite specializations commonly see use in PvE and are viable outside of PvP. The scrapper, however, is underwhelming in raids, fractals, and solo play. Most PvE builds of the engineer use exclusively core traits and skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Engineer has only 2 mainhand weapons available to it, and one offhand weapon: Rifle, pistol, and shield. Scrapper adds the hammer to bring the total to 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, we only see viable play out of pistol and scrapper (in PvE and PvP respectively). The other two weapons languish in obscurity, as kits outstrip their damage and utility. Projectile hate plays a large part of the problem as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Engineer, of all the classes, actually has some of the most engaging potential play. We&amp;#39;ve got silly gadgets like the portable battering ram and rocket boots. We&amp;#39;ve got fun toys like flamethrowers and turrets. We can even switch &amp;quot;weapons&amp;quot; rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality, however, is that many of these &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; skills are useless or underwhelming. For a class that has a lot of fun stuff, many of the fun skills and utilities we could use are underwhelming when compared to their practical counterparts. They have either been nerfed to oblivion or power creeped out of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s two examples: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal battering ram, a completely silly but somewhat interesting gadget that does knockback. It does moderate to weak damage and sends enemies flying. The problem is that its damage was weak when Guild Wars launched, and has only gotten weaker since. On top of that, the Flamethrower 3 skill (air blast) has the same effect, a lower cooldown, and more potential DPS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turrets were, for a time, the meta engineer build. They became as ubiquitous as the tank eles we see today for their ability to bunker. Because the vocal opposition became loud enough, both turret damage and health were nerfed into oblivion. They became even weaker with HoT&amp;#39;s release, which saw more AoE skills introduced. Turrets were &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC8udpVox3I\"&gt;literally a selling point of the engineer&lt;/a&gt;, and are pointless now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Wooden Potatoes recently documented, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0OWwwqPxDI&amp;amp;t=21s\"&gt;our traits are a mess&lt;/a&gt;. Many are designed for a meta that doesn&amp;#39;t exist any more, or has never existed at all. They have not been revisited in a very long time, and are in desperate need of reworking.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArenaNet&amp;#39;s Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compounding the aforementioned issues is the fact that ArenaNet doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have a main engineer player on their balance team. Almost every balance patch we see a nerf or some sort of tradeoff. The latest patch, which saw a slight buff to engineer&amp;#39;s condition damage has possibly been the only good news we&amp;#39;ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to this lack of representation from the Dev team, we also see a lack of representation from the moderating team that visits the GW2 forum. Excluding the most recent cleanup of our forum by Gaile Gray, we haven&amp;#39;t seen a developer or ArenaNet employee on the engineer subforum since the beta of Heart of Thorns, well over a year and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ArenaNet, I know you don&amp;#39;t have unlimited resources to devote. You almost always seem to focus on the warrior and design everything else from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems like engineer is always an afterthought. We keep getting relegated to the sidelines and ignored. The class is quickly becoming irrelevant, and if major changes aren&amp;#39;t observed with the next few balance patches or next expansion, I may not have a reason to continue playing Guild Wars other than loyalty to the brand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread was also posted on the GW2 forums: &lt;a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/engineer/The-Engineer-Injustice/first#post6553864\"&gt;https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/engineer/The-Engineer-Injustice/first#post6553864&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everybody!\n\nI wanted to start a post documenting the longstanding issues with the class.

The class is quickly becoming irrelevant, and if major changes aren't observed with the next few balance patches or next expansion, I may not have a reason to continue playing Guild Wars other than loyalty to the brand. \n\nThis thread was also posted on the GW2 forums: https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/engineer/The-Engineer-Injustice/first#post6553864", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "[Discussion]", "id": "65a8u3", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 136, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Vagrant123", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65a8u3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Guildwars2", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?s=be2d61919052f3e162cee12ef9497e87", "width": 2048, "height": 1152}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=ac7aa28a8facb6a2bc09301db4bb4a10", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=06d6d7a90d072e02770b302e54c88792", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=0db72f6545e8fdd90eede1933d157264", "width": 320, "height": 180}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=a64ff75656fbb103b520c1dbbf2b77c8", "width": 640, "height": 360}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=39dd16ebdf7f52b458c2a399a0337b6a", "width": 960, "height": 540}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ZxMzWl_y78jmQNLRKqNgGElvVyitrIVdo4AfSc8PvF4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=a4575e32f65eb359f93574b060963b2c", "width": 1080, "height": 607}], "variants": {}, "id": "2IFODq0l1W1hcywMGlakGtk76tGWk0IQqzK_Dg_7BYY"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "edited": 1492186221.0, "link_flair_css_class": "dis", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Guildwars2/comments/65a8u3/the_engineer_injustice/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492168757.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/65a8u3/the_engineer_injustice/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "The Engineer Injustice", "created_utc": 1492139957.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 153, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 136}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yxnc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Akunii", "parent_id": "t1_dg8v95v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nah, those were intended to be power-neutral to the core classes - At least that's what Anet stated, since they didn't want to force players into buying the expansion.

Could they add a legendary effect to every kit? Perhaps, but that's like 5 times the work unless you take the easy way out and add a unique aura or effect while in the kit with a legendary.    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**REPRESENTATION**    \nYou are the representation. The burden and responsibility and power of the engineer in 100% on the engineer players which is way cooler than having some dumb NPC spokesperson.    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**CORE GAMEPLAY**    \nFirst of all, power engineer is viable by almost anyone's standards. Not only that, it is one of the best specs in the game when it comes to synergies and design. Almost every trait in the build plays off of another, the gameplay is forgiving and effective, its basically an all around good build which is completely representative of the core of the engineer. I certainly hope you aren't saying this has been power creeped into obscurity, because it hasn't.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5x9ku5/the_casual_power_engineer/    \n\nCondition engineer is difficult only in comparison to other builds in Guild Wars 2 and even then, we (engineer community i guess you could call it) are coming up with more simple and still effective rotations regularly. From a gameplay perspective, being able to reach the mechanical level of those rotations and the complete knowledge of what your entire kit is capable of is incredibly satisfying and that is a satisfaction you cannot get from most other professions/builds which is extraordinarily appealing for the class.    \n\nAs for Scrapper, just like everything else, it has its place and since you can swap traitlines and skills and weapons and everything freely out of combat, thinking of it in terms of another tool I have in my box, its a fine addition to the box.    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**WEAPONS**    \nAlready basically covered this but, again, they all have situations where they are useful. Some will get more use because you won't constantly encounter those situations. I'm pretty happy with pistols and rifles being the stars of the show.    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**UTILITIES**    \nOf all the points I would say Turrets being useless is the most valid, however, even if they were to be buffed, their gameplay is incredibly boring. Its a passive pet that cannot move and the most interaction you have with them is overcharging or \"repairing\" them.    \n\nAs for your other utilities, again, they almost all have a place. Even your example, Personal Battering Ram, is a fine choice to take on a Power Engineer where you won't be taking flamethrower because its toolbelt skill interacts nicely with Static Discharge due to its short cooldown and it gives you access to extra CC.    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**TRAITS**    \nYes, some of the traits and lines could be changed up, but WoodenPotatoes missed the mark so hard with so many contradictions in that video. Power Engineer is one of the best designed trait builds in the game. Everything is synergistic. Its beautiful and simple. The complaint that Condi and Power use many of the same traits and thus it feels like you're playing the same thing is so absurd that I feel like the only way you could think that is if you viewed the different customization options as compartmentalized (rotation, stats, weapons, skills, traits, food, etc.) and not viewing the entire package as a full build which is completely the opposite of the engineer way!    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**ANETS BEHAVIOR**    \nThey added a profession specific buff to your entire team and had many small increases to push Power Engineer even stronger.. I don't know what else you'd hope for in a minor balance update.    \n\nI can't really comment on the forums as I don't visit them often, ANet seems to have largely abandoned them for Reddit anyway which is its own issue.    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**IN CONCLUSION**    \nIt seems like you don't appreciate the insane amount of options and V A L U E packed into one class and the awesomeness that is the flexibility and great toolkit of the engineer. Of course we all like it when something fits our view of what it \"should\" be, but I feel like you're missing out on a lot of what engineer can offer in this case.", "edited": 1492182831.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also played thousands of hours on engineer starting from beta and disagree on so many of your points.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nFor the origin, first of all afterthought or not, we&amp;#39;re still the coolest class.

Not only that, it is one of the best specs in the game when it comes to synergies and design. Almost every trait in the build plays off of another, the gameplay is forgiving and effective, its basically an all around good build which is completely representative of the core of the engineer. I certainly hope you aren&amp;#39;t saying this has been power creeped into obscurity, because it hasn&amp;#39;t.\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5x9ku5/the_casual_power_engineer/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5x9ku5/the_casual_power_engineer/&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Condition engineer is difficult only in comparison to other builds in Guild Wars 2 and even then, we (engineer community i guess you could call it) are coming up with more simple and still effective rotations regularly. From a gameplay perspective, being able to reach the mechanical level of those rotations and the complete knowledge of what your entire kit is capable of is incredibly satisfying and that is a satisfaction you cannot get from most other professions/builds which is extraordinarily appealing for the class.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for Scrapper, just like everything else, it has its place and since you can swap traitlines and skills and weapons and everything freely out of combat, thinking of it in terms of another tool I have in my box, its a fine addition to the box.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEAPONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAlready basically covered this but, again, they all have situations where they are useful. Some will get more use because you won&amp;#39;t constantly encounter those situations. I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with pistols and rifles being the stars of the show.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILITIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nOf all the points I would say Turrets being useless is the most valid, however, even if they were to be buffed, their gameplay is incredibly boring. Its a passive pet that cannot move and the most interaction you have with them is overcharging or &amp;quot;repairing&amp;quot; them.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your other utilities, again, they almost all have a place. Even your example, Personal Battering Ram, is a fine choice to take on a Power Engineer where you won&amp;#39;t be taking flamethrower because its toolbelt skill interacts nicely with Static Discharge due to its short cooldown and it gives you access to extra CC.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAITS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nYes, some of the traits and lines could be changed up, but WoodenPotatoes missed the mark so hard with so many contradictions in that video. Power Engineer is one of the best designed trait builds in the game. Everything is synergistic. Its beautiful and simple. The complaint that Condi and Power use many of the same traits and thus it feels like you&amp;#39;re playing the same thing is so absurd that I feel like the only way you could think that is if you viewed the different customization options as compartmentalized (rotation, stats, weapons, skills, traits, food, etc.) and not viewing the entire package as a full build which is completely the opposite of the engineer way!    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANETS BEHAVIOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThey added a profession specific buff to your entire team and had many small increases to push Power Engineer even stronger.. I don&amp;#39;t know what else you&amp;#39;d hope for in a minor balance update.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t really comment on the forums as I don&amp;#39;t visit them often, ANet seems to have largely abandoned them for Reddit anyway which is its own issue.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIt seems like you don&amp;#39;t appreciate the insane amount of options and V A L U E packed into one class and the awesomeness that is the flexibility and great toolkit of the engineer. Of course we all like it when something fits our view of what it &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; be, but I feel like you&amp;#39;re missing out on a lot of what engineer can offer in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg98x45", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492211347.0, "created_utc": 1492182547.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0sy7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Vagrant123", "parent_id": "t1_dg97p4b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good point on the golemancer.

Nothing like the sweeping changes made to ranger signets and shouts.  Engi&amp;#39;s non kit utilities need a lot more utility to keep up with the strength of kits, turrets, and gyros. Alchemy is almost there but still pretty RNG and what you take when you don&amp;#39;t want to triple kit. Engineer is still very much due.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: and I have always agreed on Baseline engi&amp;#39;s lack of weapons. What happens next expansion? Another two hander? Two one handers? Pistol pistol rifle shield is not enough. There is no comparison. Ele has five baseline weapons but 20 attacks whatever is chosen. Engi gets 5 no matter what they pick, and kits is not enough of the remedy for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgamnc4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492290907.0, "created_utc": 1492262107.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd1vmp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "coglin", "parent_id": "t1_dgd19tr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Each armor set has its own theme.

Other studios that try to promote competitiveness in an MMO setting either have substantially fewer skills to balance [see, warframe], or they have huge, sweeping, comprehensive updates every few months, and all sorts of tiny, bi-monthly adjustments and tweaks, and they&amp;#39;re not afraid to say &amp;#39;hey, this is bad, we need to fix it now&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Anet wasn&amp;#39;t so sluggish on that, Season 1, the grand entry into competative PvP for GW2, wouldn&amp;#39;t have been such an overwhelming disaster that they had to interrupt the competition to push out fixes for the immovable bunker mesmer issue, which utilized combos that genuinely felt untested [a well that grants AOE distortion on an elite that allows it to cast twice..]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgaepjp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492268819.0, "created_utc": 1492240019.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a8u3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgar6y0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Vagrant123", "parent_id": "t1_dgae8b3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Any time somebody complains, there's always always someone who calls them a whiner. ;) Thanks for being that someone.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time somebody complains, there&amp;#39;s always always someone who calls them a whiner. ;) Thanks for being that someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgar6y0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492298419.0, "created_utc": 1492269619.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgae8b3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrFatsas", "parent_id": "t1_dg9cwve", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Saying 'inb4' something doesnt mean you cant be criticized for it mate", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying &amp;#39;inb4&amp;#39; something doesnt mean you cant be criticized for it mate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dgae8b3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492267616.0, "created_utc": 1492238816.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cwve", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Vagrant123", "parent_id": "t1_dg9309f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; inb4 cry moar\n\nggwp", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;inb4 cry moar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ggwp&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg9cwve", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215943.0, "created_utc": 1492187143.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9309f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrFatsas", "parent_id": "t3_65a8u3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree engi needs some love but you're being extremely whiny about this, and two thirds of the things you complain about have absolutely no importance.
