Back in the day, there was always something exciting to do in large groups, in the open world. Where hundreds of players gathered together, and fought against a huge raid-like boss, sometimes even failing! It was a challenging fight, maybe too hard in some cases, and it had cool rewards as well, with maybe a bit too low drop chance, but still, they were pretty darn cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These rare events were once called hardcore world bosses, and there\u2019s only two of them in the game:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tequatl_the_Sunless\"&gt;Tequatl the Sunless&lt;/a&gt; (September 17, 2013)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triple_Trouble\"&gt;Triple Trouble&lt;/a&gt; (January 21, 2014)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I miss the experiences around them badly, so let\u2019s talk about how to make them work:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they failed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is, why haven\u2019t we gotten more hardcore world bosses? We can assume that, somehow, they failed as content, and ArenaNet stopped production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we\u2019ve gotten new world bosses since then, but they weren\u2019t hardcore. They were easy, or moderate at most. Which doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t fun, I love them too, and I think they have their own defined space, which is working fine, and shouldn\u2019t be touched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, why do I think hardcore world bosses failed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Problems gathering the hardcore world boss players together in the same map instance. Maybe let commanders create empty map instances, giving priority to squad members, at least when they activate the boss with their own guild consumable? You should be fighting the boss, not other players.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High difficulty. Yeah, that\u2019s the point, they\u2019re hardcore, but in some cases, they\u2019re too hard. Specially, because they are very punishing, and small mistakes can ruin the whole thing. There\u2019s no middle term, you either fail spectacularly, or beat it with no problems. They need to be balanced so that you can comeback after a big mistake. Each hardcore world boss should allow a fixed number of wipes without failing, let\u2019s say four. Veterans should kill them with no wipes, and normal players should get a wipe or two.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rewards. Yeah, they have some unique stuff (which could be better), but the RNG is awful. The best alternative is to assign tokens to them, like dungeons and raids. Raid rewards can be really bad, but you get magnetites so you can buy cool stuff once in a while. That\u2019s the right model, and hardcore world bosses should follow it too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Individuals ruining the event for everyone. Either new players or trolls, the bosses need to be designed to minimize chances of this happening.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think these small changes would make hardcore world bosses much more accessible and attractive for all players. A good population is necessary if we want them to be viable game content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional hardcore world bosses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if we are to bring hardcore world bosses back, we need some new bosses as well, at least one, and not just updates for the existing two. Few of the classic world bosses would be good material for a revamp into hardcore world bosses, specially if they\u2019re large and have a good location for the fight:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Claw of Jormag&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Shatterer (It made me sad its revamp didn\u2019t turn him into hardcore)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Megadestroyer (Could be updated with a new destroyer model, maybe similar to the Great Destroyer from GW1)\nShadow Behemoth (I don\u2019t like he\u2019s in a low level zone, but he\u2019s still a good candidate)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The raid team has done a fantastic job, and I\u2019m sure some of their magic could be applied into hardcore world bosses as well, making the new ones much more exciting than the two we have now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of guilds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guilds need to be involved much more with hardcore world bosses, and be rewarded accordingly. Some ideas:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reward guilds for completing hardcore world bosses each week.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow the usage of certain WvW guild elements in PvE as well, during hardcore world boss fights, or introduce new guild upgrades specifically designed to be used in PvE fights.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make it easier for guilds to gather together in the same map instance before a hardcore world boss fight. Already stated above, but worth repeating. Could use something like guild mission instances if the open world solutions aren&amp;#39;t viable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Let activating guilds control all elements of the fight easily, like siege weapons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus: Living World season 1 world bosses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first season of the Living World had some pretty good world bosses as well. They were kinda hard, not as hard as hardcore world bosses, but still challenging on their own way. This could be a great opportunity to bring them back. But, how? Their zones no longer exist, and putting them back into their original locations would be a mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: Portals. Either at Lion\u2019s Arch by the memorial, or nearby their original spawning locations. These portals would transport you to a new zone, a copy of how it was back when the boss still roamed it. These special zones would only be open during the boss schedule, and have no waypoints.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Karka\"&gt;Ancient Karka&lt;/a&gt;, at Southsun Cove before it was colonized.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tower_of_Nightmares_(zone%29\"&gt;Ascent of the Tower of Nightmares&lt;/a&gt;, at Toxic Kessex Hills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twisted_Marionette\"&gt;Twisted Marionette&lt;/a&gt;, at the invaded Lornar\u2019s Pass.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wreckage_of_the_Breachmaker\"&gt;Battle on the Breachmaker&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lion&amp;#x27;s_Arch_(Enemy_Controlled%29\"&gt;Battle for Lion\u2019s Arch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, some of these are part of long meta-events, and could feel better as normal world bosses, but I still think it could be interesting to experiment with them.

HoT as an expansion in terms of open world is an example of that.\n\n&gt; It adds defeatism. In a raid, when you wipe, you can respawn and get back there quickly to try again. You can't do that with 100 players. Said respawning needs to happen in the middle of the fight, as to encourage players to keep fighting.\n\nIt already happens in open world. In raids if you wipe you are locked out of the attempt period. In open world you just waypoint and run back into the fight. No world boss, not even TT is going to fail because a few people wiped and are running back from the waypoint.\n\n&gt;  If the players make a mistake, they should be able to notice it, get worried, and try to fix it as soon as possible. Not just \"wew crap, gg, cya in 3h\". \n\nMaybe if you gave an example of how this happens I might understand better. But players mess up dps rotations, die to boss mechanics and even lose things like turrets on Teq and still recover. With the protect cannons in teq, there's plenty of time to protect them. They don;t just go 100 to 0 in 10s. The whole group must have messed up for a good few minutes.\n\n&gt; Make boss fights last 1 hour\n\nThat is not GW2's audience. I remember fighting bosses in FF XI, some which could last many many hours, it was boring and the main difficulty was concentration. There's a reason why raid bosses are 10 minutes or less.\n\n&gt; Things like \"Oh no, Tequatl ate the cannon, gg\" are lame. Let players repair it, if they can, and give the hardcore world boss a final objective, with secondary objectives it must destroy first. That should mark progress, and not a timer. \n\nThen why care about the cannons at all? You're basically giving players a \"I win\" button but the button can be pressed faster for those who can clear it faster? There is virtually no I lose button meaning no challenge. \n\n&gt; Defeat shouldn't be instantaneous, it should be a slow process that you can turn back if you focus.\n\nIn raids or open world, defeat is rarely instantaneous. In your Teq example, the cannons don't just die in one hit, you have to not defend them for a few minutes.

Very few people ever get invested in a dynamic event, the most you learn about what happens if things fail is if you are hunting a legendary and need X event line to fail.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chak Gerent example was just to show that when content is deemed to hard by the community it often gets nerfed. HoT as an expansion in terms of open world is an example of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It adds defeatism. In a raid, when you wipe, you can respawn and get back there quickly to try again. You can&amp;#39;t do that with 100 players. Said respawning needs to happen in the middle of the fight, as to encourage players to keep fighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It already happens in open world. In raids if you wipe you are locked out of the attempt period. In open world you just waypoint and run back into the fight. No world boss, not even TT is going to fail because a few people wiped and are running back from the waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the players make a mistake, they should be able to notice it, get worried, and try to fix it as soon as possible. Not just &amp;quot;wew crap, gg, cya in 3h&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you gave an example of how this happens I might understand better. But players mess up dps rotations, die to boss mechanics and even lose things like turrets on Teq and still recover. With the protect cannons in teq, there&amp;#39;s plenty of time to protect them. They don;t just go 100 to 0 in 10s. The whole group must have messed up for a good few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make boss fights last 1 hour&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is not GW2&amp;#39;s audience. I remember fighting bosses in FF XI, some which could last many many hours, it was boring and the main difficulty was concentration. There&amp;#39;s a reason why raid bosses are 10 minutes or less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things like &amp;quot;Oh no, Tequatl ate the cannon, gg&amp;quot; are lame. Let players repair it, if they can, and give the hardcore world boss a final objective, with secondary objectives it must destroy first. That should mark progress, and not a timer. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then why care about the cannons at all? You&amp;#39;re basically giving players a &amp;quot;I win&amp;quot; button but the button can be pressed faster for those who can clear it faster? There is virtually no I lose button meaning no challenge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Defeat shouldn&amp;#39;t be instantaneous, it should be a slow process that you can turn back if you focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In raids or open world, defeat is rarely instantaneous. In your Teq example, the cannons don&amp;#39;t just die in one hit, you have to not defend them for a few minutes. There is plenty of time to stop the abomination exploding or krait wreaking havoc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Giving the boss a &amp;quot;win button&amp;quot; is counterproductive when you factor large groups and open world content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand this, so the boss can only win if time runs out?
