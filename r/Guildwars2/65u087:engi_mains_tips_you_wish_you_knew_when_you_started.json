Pistol #5 (or Rifle #2), Bomb Kit #5, and Net Turret in conjunction with each other is pretty high immobilise uptime.\n\n6. Thumper Turret is three blast finishers in one utility skill.\n\n7. You can use the toolbelt skill of any utility without putting it on a cooldown, allowing you to easily swap a utility, use its toolbelt skill, and swap back for the fight. My favourite applications of this are Elixir S's stealth, Elixir R's reviving, Thumper Turret's and Bomb Kit's blast finisher, Slick Shoes' superspeed, Supply Crate's medical kits, and Flamethrower Kit's Incendiary Ammo. This of course can only happen if you don't go in combat after you cast the toolbelt skill.\n\n8. The above also applies to kit skills, though apart from some Elixir Kit skills, there aren't really any kit skills I've found that have much use in this regard.\n\n9. The Tools trait line has an invaluable trait called Streamlined Kits, which triggers a special, kit-specific skill and 20 seconds of swiftness when you swap into a kit, on a 20-second internal cooldown (when it's up it'll show up on your buff bar). This is essentially perma swiftness, and some of the kit abilities are actually useful:\n\n \\- Flamethrower Kit gives you flame aura, which is among the most reliable ways of getting swiftness without accidentally going in combat, since it doesn't actually attack anything.\n\n \\- Bomb Kit gives you a magnetic bomb that pulls nearby enemies into its centre, which is decent for grouping up mobs.\n\n \\- Mortar Kit gives you your best condi DPS option for Streamlined Kits: it places gunk underneath you that applies random conditions to enemies that step in it.\n\n10. Flamethrower #3 reflects projectiles.\n\n11. Flamethrower #5 can be cast even when knocked down or in animations like stomping.\n\n12. The Juggernaut trait in Firearms is permanent stability uptime. Useful for a number of things. My most recent use for it is to complete hearts where you need to pick things up or destroy things that can knock you back (such as unexploded mortar shots), but another application includes walking past the windy bit in the Cliffside fractal without needing to worry about getting knocked back.\n\n13. Automated Medical Response, in conjunction with proper use of A.E.D., can allow you to survive high and constant damage application quite effectively.\n\n14. You can throw down Elixir R's toolbelt skill on yourself right before you go down to revive yourself back up.\n\n15. Tip #13 and #14 are used in conjunction to solo the heat room in the Thaumanova Fractal (but I'm not sure if this is possible anymore ever since the changes they made to the room).\n\n16. Utility Goggles are amazing for fighting dust mites in Dry Top / Silverwastes or capping the towers in the Escort raid.\n\n17. Elixir S can be used to guarantee that long animations will fully cast without getting interrupted, such as stomping foes or interacting with consoles.\n\n18. Healing Turret is an extremely versatile skill. Some things you can do with it:\n\n \\- Drop it down, overcharge straight away (just spam the #6 skill), and then instantly explode it for an additional water blast finisher.\n\n \\- Drop it down, overcharge, and pick it up again with F for less healing on a lower cooldown.\n\n \\- Drop it down, overcharge it, use a blast finisher (Flamethrower #2 is great for this), and then pick it up again for the same level of healing as the first bullet point but with the same cooldown reduction of the second. NOTE: if you pick up your turret before blasting, the water field won't be active anymore.\n\n \\- Drop it down, overcharge it, explode it, and cast a blast finisher on the lingering water field for a super mega burst heal.\n\n \\- Drop it down and leave it there, casting the overcharge off cooldown, for fairly decent healing over time and permanent regeneration.\n\n \\- Use the toolbelt skill for more water blasts.\n\n19. You can drop turrets to body-block certain projectiles that stop after the first target hit. Ever since the minion change that came bundled with HoT, turrets will almost never die if they're not targeted, so in fights where you have enemies that are shooting at you, you can make an impenetrable fortress out of turrets. Supply Crate is great for this.\n\n20. Engineer has the best blinds in the game, hands down. Condition Engineer has two great pulsing blinds on low cooldowns: Mortar Kit #4 and Bomb Kit #4. It also has AoE blinds on Pistol #3, Flamethrower Kit #5, and Grenade Kit #3.\n\n21. Mortar Kit's auto-attack is not only extremely high range (1500), but it's also one of the game's few auto-attacks that is a 100% chance projectile finisher (along with Revenant hammer auto-attack and Elementalist earth staff auto-attack), so if you have a field that you need reliable projectile finishers on, grab that mortar.\n\n22. If you're a condi Engineer in the Molten Duo fractal, replace Flamethrower with Elixir U for the first fight. Flamethrower only offers burning as a damaging condition, and the effigy is immune to burning. However, the elixir's toolbelt reflect is great for the effigy, and the quickness is an added bonus.\n\n23. Retaliation absolutely murders Engineer in PvE. With every grenade skill giving you 3 ticks of retaliation, multiple long-duration AoEs you'll be casting on the ground, and fast auto-attacks, you're going to want to take it easy if you see enemies use that boon.\n\n24. Rocket Turret's toolbelt skill has a high enough arc in its trajectory to go over tower/keep walls in WvW (haven't tested this in a while though).\n\n25. Rifle #5 is a long-distance (800-range) leap that can be used to leap over gaps that you would otherwise not be able to jump over. Not many skills in the game can do this.\n\n26. Flamethrower #2 can hit enemies twice if you time it correctly (wait for it to hit, and then detonate it again at the enemy's position for a second hit).\n\n27. Rocket Boots and Rifle #4 will cure movement-disabling conditions.\n\n28. You can combo Heal Gyro's water field with Hammer #3 for significant extra healing. Hammer #3 can do this with any water field, but Heal Gyro's is the best because its water field moves with you.\n\n29. Bulwark Gyro's toolbelt skill in conjunction with Elixir U's toolbelt skill is pretty good reflect uptime.\n\n30. If you want Sneak Gyro to follow you, don't wait for it. If you stop, it stops, and then it takes a while to start flying after you again. Also, don't go on complicated terrain like rocks, elevated platforms, terrain with gaps, hilly grounds, etc.\n\n31. You can use your Function Gyro's stomps and revivals in conjunction with your own to double up on their effects. For example, if you want to revive someone quickly, you can start reviving them with Function Gyro, and continue with your own reviving to double the speed. Against Mesmers, you can also start stomping with your Function Gyro and continue yourself, out of sync with your gyro by a few seconds. This means that if the Mesmer uses its downed skill to go in stealth before the gyro's stomp finishes, you'll be there to finish your stomp right after the Mesmer goes out of stealth, guaranteeing your stomp.\n\n32. The Target Nearest/Next Ally controls in the controls menu are invaluable for using Function Gyro.\n\n33. Boon duration scales exceptionally well on Scrapper, since if you can keep over 10 stacks of might on you perpetually, the Applied Force trait in Scrapper will give you 6 seconds of quickness (with 100% boon duration) on a 10-second internal cooldown. That's 60% quickness uptime without even needing to think about it. A great build that utilises this is Bootts' [One Man Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGwwbRUGhEo) build, where he takes 100% boon duration, and, through clever synergy of traits, can keep 60% quickness uptime on himself while literally standing AFK.", "edited": 1492435312.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, my chance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elixir Kit #4&amp;#39;s backwards jump can be cancelled if you stow the kit in  mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Elixir Kit #4 in conjunction with About Face (check the controls menu) or even just manually turning your camera 180 degrees to leap forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For condi Engineer, Rocket Boots is a great alternative to Flamethrower on mobile fights (Matthias being a prime example). You get potentially life-saving mobility, a blast finisher, and an easy-to-use, low-cooldown, long-duration burn skill on your toolbelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stability, or the auto-stunbreak trait in Tools, will make you resistant to the knockback from Rifle #4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistol #5 (or Rifle #2), Bomb Kit #5, and Net Turret in conjunction with each other is pretty high immobilise uptime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thumper Turret is three blast finishers in one utility skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the toolbelt skill of any utility without putting it on a cooldown, allowing you to easily swap a utility, use its toolbelt skill, and swap back for the fight.
