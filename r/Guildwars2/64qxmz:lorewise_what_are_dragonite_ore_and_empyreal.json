That bloodstone dust all came from &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; bloodstone: the Maguuma Bloodstone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg4swyo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968674.0, "created_utc": 1491939874.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qxmz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg576ac", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Xavoid", "parent_id": "t3_64qxmz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A thing used in a mechanic for a crafting.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thing used in a mechanic for a crafting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg576ac", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491986320.0, "created_utc": 1491957520.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qxmz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5hfdl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ohoni", "parent_id": "t3_64qxmz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're different types of rocks.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re different types of rocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg5hfdl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492001043.0, "created_utc": 1491972243.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qxmz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qxmz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9po", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qxmz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg51rer", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Frusen1", "parent_id": "t1_dg4x3je", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "asc weapon is pretty important, asc amor is not", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;asc weapon is pretty important, asc amor is not&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg51rer", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491979083.0, "created_utc": 1491950283.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4x3je", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "El_Barto_227", "parent_id": "t1_dg4oq4n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If by gear treadmill you mean one tier that is only nessecary for t4 fractals and raids (and in the case of raids, onky trinkets aregsnerslly accepted to be required, weapons and armour optional)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If by gear treadmill you mean one tier that is only nessecary for t4 fractals and raids (and in the case of raids, onky trinkets aregsnerslly accepted to be required, weapons and armour optional)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg4x3je", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973339.0, "created_utc": 1491944539.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4oq4n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PlayerOwnage", "parent_id": "t3_64qxmz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Names inspired from the rush by Anet to make a new gear treadmill: nonsense", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Names inspired from the rush by Anet to make a new gear treadmill: nonsense&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "name": "t1_dg4oq4n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491964196.0, "created_utc": 1491935396.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
