What happened was said family member decided to use her own grocery shopping bag instead of the ones provided and put some fruits in first. She then circled round, bought and &lt;strong&gt;paid&lt;/strong&gt; for some vegetables which she was holding in her hand. She forgot about the fruits in her bag and walked out. As it was one of the older stores there were no sensors/beeps to remind her and she was promptly stopped and accused of shoplifting by the store manager. She said that &amp;quot;she didn&amp;#39;t try to run obviously, but the manager didn&amp;#39;t give her a chance to explain herself initially and accused her of committing a crime, telling her that the &amp;#39;more excuses she makes the worse it is for her&amp;#39;.

I genuinely felt that it was an honest mistake, given that she had paid for the other vegetables and that there was no need for such escalation, and even if it indeed had been escalated to the police, they would be reasonable enough to see it as the genuine mistake that it is.
