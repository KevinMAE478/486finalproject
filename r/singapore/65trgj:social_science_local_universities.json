Yes, definitely for econ. NTU and NUS have greater range of courses available for unrestricted electives, which is especially important if you want to take specialised classes not offered by a business school (e.g. advanced math and stats). While NUS also has the strongest faculty, that only matters when getting good letters of recommendation for grad school, but that's only if you're planning to go into academia. On the other hand, it may be easier to build good relationships and work with professors at SMU, where the class size is smaller. Any SG degree is probably inferior to a decent US or a good UK degree if you plan to enter a good grad school, particularly in the US. \n\n2. I majored in econ and took some math and business classes. I was sort of an econ nerd and didn't use many of my unrestricted electives for classes outside of econ. I like that economists can study many topics that are traditionally seen as the domain of some other social science. For example, development economists can study topics in political science like political institutions. Labour economists also study topics in sociology like gender, family, and race.  In retrospect, I probably would have gotten better grades if I didn't try out econ classes that I knew I wouldn't do well in.  In terms of class participation, economics classes are quite sad. It's perfectly possible for a certain type of student to do well enough (or even excel) by restricting their classes to those that focus on teaching the theory and applying it by solving problem sets. They'd never have to write an essay or say anything in class beyond presenting the solution for a problem set. It's hard to get much practice at discussing ideas and making arguments when the professor has bigger problems walking other people through the math. Of course, professors do try to talk about the bigger picture and principles but that doesn't change the usual modes of assessment and thus how to get good grades. It doesn't help that essay-like assignments are almost always group projects. I also think the teaching requirements of the SG institutions make professors less willing to tweak the syllabus and modes of assessments in ways that may make the student population unhappy.\n\n3. It's easy to fall into the trap of putting little work into econ classes. In most core classes, there's typically only one lecture a week, little reading required beyond the textbook, and tutorials are about solving problem sets. In contrast, math classes have two lectures a week, and classes in other social sciences may require more reading and critical discussion in tutorials.

NTU and NUS have greater range of courses available for unrestricted electives, which is especially important if you want to take specialised classes not offered by a business school (e.g. advanced math and stats). While NUS also has the strongest faculty, that only matters when getting good letters of recommendation for grad school, but that&amp;#39;s only if you&amp;#39;re planning to go into academia. On the other hand, it may be easier to build good relationships and work with professors at SMU, where the class size is smaller. Any SG degree is probably inferior to a decent US or a good UK degree if you plan to enter a good grad school, particularly in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I majored in econ and took some math and business classes. I was sort of an econ nerd and didn&amp;#39;t use many of my unrestricted electives for classes outside of econ. I like that economists can study many topics that are traditionally seen as the domain of some other social science. For example, development economists can study topics in political science like political institutions. Labour economists also study topics in sociology like gender, family, and race.  In retrospect, I probably would have gotten better grades if I didn&amp;#39;t try out econ classes that I knew I wouldn&amp;#39;t do well in.  In terms of class participation, economics classes are quite sad. It&amp;#39;s perfectly possible for a certain type of student to do well enough (or even excel) by restricting their classes to those that focus on teaching the theory and applying it by solving problem sets. They&amp;#39;d never have to write an essay or say anything in class beyond presenting the solution for a problem set. It&amp;#39;s hard to get much practice at discussing ideas and making arguments when the professor has bigger problems walking other people through the math. Of course, professors do try to talk about the bigger picture and principles but that doesn&amp;#39;t change the usual modes of assessment and thus how to get good grades. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that essay-like assignments are almost always group projects. I also think the teaching requirements of the SG institutions make professors less willing to tweak the syllabus and modes of assessments in ways that may make the student population unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to fall into the trap of putting little work into econ classes. In most core classes, there&amp;#39;s typically only one lecture a week, little reading required beyond the textbook, and tutorials are about solving problem sets. In contrast, math classes have two lectures a week, and classes in other social sciences may require more reading and critical discussion in tutorials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgdr7u6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492477141.0, "created_utc": 1492448341.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
