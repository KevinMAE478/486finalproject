Eventually, 18 prisoners were executed, while others were jailed or acquitted after a 64-day trial for murder and rioting.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 1993, Mr Suppiah defended Dutch woman Marial Krol, 60, charged with capital drug trafficking.

He also credits his wife, Juliana, a retired nurse and self-taught nutritionist, with prescribing the right meals. They have three grandchildren.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking to The Straits Times, he said: \"I was fortunate to have a little talent in football. The secret of long life is to take pride in your talent, which forces you to live up to it. That requires personal discipline in regular workouts and good food to maintain your pace.

He studied law in London and was called to the English Bar in 1959.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 1942, just after the Japanese occupied Singapore, he attended the Japanese trade school near the old Kallang Airport, and graduated with a Japanese-scripted trade certificate in aviation engineering in September 1943.\n&gt; \n&gt; He shared one vivid memory related to the Japanese Occupation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I remember, just after the war, when my mother took me to the market, she met this woman who had lived in our neighbourhood in the Scotts Road area in the war years.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"The woman said, 'You are lucky, you still have your son.
