This time around, however, the bulk of the decline was in relatively small landed property segment, while non-landed prices were steady.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The city-state&amp;#39;s housing prices surged more than 60 per cent from 2009 through 2013, propelled by rock-bottom global interest rates and quantitative easing in developed economies, even as the government enacted a series of cooling measures from 2011 to prevent a bubble from forming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Read also:&lt;a href=\"http://news.asiaone.com/news/business/singapores-property-market-headed-quick-upswing\"&gt;[LINK:  Is Singapore&amp;#39;s property market headed for a quick upswing]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;358053&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2016-05-06 21:09:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.asiaone.com/sites/all/themes/digital2016/images/images.png\"&gt;[IMAGE]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Photo Gallery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What type of property in Singapore should you buy&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in early March, the government scaled back some of the curbs, including lowering the seller&amp;#39;s stamp duty and shortening the minimum holding period to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said that was a signal the property market was closer to the bottom, which should improve buyer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were signs buyer sentiment has already picked up: One recent launch, Park Place Residences, sold its entire phase one, initially set at 40 per cent of the 429-unit total before being raised to 50 per cent, within a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bank expected sales volume would surge this year, with the increases in transaction volumes to spur prices higher next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supply was also set to decline, the bank noted. From 2014-16, private residential supply added around 20,000 units a year, twice the historical average since 1990, it noted. But in 2017-18, supply levels were set to fall 40 per cent each year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The property market in Singapore can be closely watched for economic and investment implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley noted that around 91 per cent of Singapore&amp;#39;s resident households own their homes, with residential property around 45 per cent of total household gross assets last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Asian investors tend to have large allocations to property in their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Read also: &lt;a href=\"http://news.asiaone.com/news/business/how-much-will-it-cost-live-singapore-2050\"&gt;[LINK: How much will it cost to live in Singapore in 2050]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;357996&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2016-03-07 18:35:46&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.asiaone.com/sites/all/themes/digital2016/images/images.png\"&gt;[IMAGE]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Photo Gallery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Most expensive real estate markets worldwide&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While property bears were pointing to an aging population, Morgan Stanley noted a rising household formation rate driven by singles, and a shift toward higher-skilled foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It estimated that by 2030, one in five Singapore households would be occupied by just one person, up from one in eight in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it expected &amp;quot;a combination of bequest motives, lease buyback schemes, and shifting manpower trends assuage property market selling pressures that come as the population ages.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also expected that Singapore&amp;#39;s medium-term economic growth potential of around 3 per cent over 2016-2030 meant it would outperform other developed economies and support income growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Singapore reported first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.5 per cent on-year, down from 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Singapore economy is likely to see a cyclical recovery from better-than-expected external demand,&amp;quot; the note said. &amp;quot;Given that changes in economic conditions have a direct bearing on the property market, the improving macroeconomic outlook would be supportive of a property market recovery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/\"&gt;[LINK: [&lt;a href=\"http://www.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/cnbc.jpg\"&gt;IMAGE&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Created&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u//LFlare\"&gt;LFlare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/61xl9z\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[About&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Me]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;amp;subject=%5BRedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/65geuc%5D%20\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Feedback]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Source&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Code]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dga1n1e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246638.0, "created_utc": 1492217838.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65geuc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65geuc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaiqy3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "doc-tom", "parent_id": "t1_dgadgt3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "These projections are kind of useless since they do not account for supply-side factors which are more or less dependent on government intervention.
