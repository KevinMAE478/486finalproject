The original yellow colour had been painted over in white and the company&amp;#39;s lock had been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ofo Singapore, the Chinese company which owns that bicycle, said that it has experienced a &amp;quot;very low&amp;quot; rate of such cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its spokesman said that the company contacts errant users, who often apologise and say they were under the mistaken impression that they could hold on to a bicycle if they still had future travel planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Elgin Ee, general manager of home-grown bicycle-sharing company oBike, said errant users who attempt to co-opt bikes for personal use make up less than 1 per cent of its user base.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He added that bicycles that end up locked with personal devices account for a few dozen in his company&amp;#39;s fleet of several thousand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#39;s back-end system will flag those that do not appear to move for an extended time. &amp;quot;Users know that we have GPS (Global Positioning System) and their account details, so they will think twice before they do this,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He added, however, that the difficulty is in pinpointing where some of these bicycles are as the GPS used by its app cannot indicate their specific locations within buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One way that companies penalise errant users is to charge higher rental rates for those with a poor track record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Ee said that at the moment, oBike is managing such situations itself. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think we have to report it to the authorities, unless people steal our bikes,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mobike said it has not encountered such problems, and added that its GPS and use of credit card as a payment mode act as a deterrent against misuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Amolat Singh told The Straits Times that the legal situation is akin to that of supermarket trolleys which are removed from the store premises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that misuse of shared bikes, depending on the user agreements with the companies, could constitute a breach of contract - but it might be hard to pursue the case as one of theft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;From a criminal viewpoint, that is a bit dicey, because they are merely holding on to the bike,&amp;quot; he said. And &amp;quot;normally, the police will say this is a commercial matter, you can go sort it out yourselves&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the firms consider such abuse rare, the errant users&amp;#39; actions are causing frustration to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Muhammad Imran Hassan, 37, a secondary school teacher, said: &amp;quot;They are inconsiderate and selfish, and no different from those who take supermarket trolleys home. They are depriving others of a service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have used bicycle-sharing services in France and Germany before, where there was a sense that the bicycles were shared goods, and people who used the bikes took care of them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Created&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u//LFlare\"&gt;LFlare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/61xl9z\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[About&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Me]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;amp;subject=%5BRedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/65h82s%5D%20\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Feedback]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Source&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Code]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dga97fb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257713.0, "created_utc": 1492228913.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h82s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgal25h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zjyo", "parent_id": "t3_65h82s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is why we can't have nice things", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why we can&amp;#39;t have nice things&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgal25h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492287448.0, "created_utc": 1492258648.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h82s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h82s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgael5b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chiotkk", "parent_id": "t1_dgadepv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dude also says they have a fleet of a few thousand bikes so..", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dude also says they have a fleet of a few thousand bikes so..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgael5b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492268501.0, "created_utc": 1492239701.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h82s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaho06", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Speedz007", "parent_id": "t1_dgadepv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do you think is the bike to user ratio?\n\nIf it's 1 bike for every 10 users, that is 10% of the bikes hogged.
