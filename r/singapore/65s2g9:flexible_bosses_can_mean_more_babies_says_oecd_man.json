It is not always at the expense of employers,\" said Dr Thevenon, who was invited recently to Singapore by the Prime Minister's Office to advise civil servants on family and fertility policies.\n&gt; \n&gt; He noted that Britain found a way to make flexi-work arrangements work, by granting carers or those looking after children the right to ask for it in 2003.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Mr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (Asme), was not convinced of the need for such a law as businesses are already constrained by manpower shortages and high costs.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We understand the value of work-life balance, but there are realities that businesses face in Singapore. The economy is very demanding,\" he told The Straits Times.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; HAPPIER WORKERS\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **When people are working from home, they are often more likely to work a little bit more.**\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **It is not always at the expense of employers.**\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; DR OLIVIER THEVENON, who was invited recently to Singapore by the Prime Minister's Office to advise civil servants on family and fertility policies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flexible work practices were championed by almost all the 18 MPs who debated in Parliament last week on how to support women's family and work aspirations.\n&gt; \n&gt; These practices include part-time work, working from home and flexible working hours like taking an hour off in the middle of the day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Singapore has rolled out a series of measures to support young couples who want to have children, including doubling government- paid paternity leave to two weeks since the start of the year.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Singapore has workplace practices that are much less flexible than in Britain, the Nordic countries and Germany, said Dr Thevenon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Childcare services help mothers, who are typically the primary carers of children, return to work after they give birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; But once parents are back at work, they also need workplace flexibility to manage their work and family duties, he added.\n&gt; \n&gt; Singapore can look at adopting a legal right to ask for flexible working arrangements, which Dr Thevenon described as a \"soft law\".\n&gt; \n&gt; While employers may not be so keen on the idea, having such a law can help change norms, he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The British government states on its website that an employer can refuse an application if it has a good business reason. Employers, however, must deal with requests in a \"reasonable manner\", like discussing it with their employees.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It forces employers and employees to discuss the issue, and it is from this discussion that minds start to change,\" said Dr Thevenon.\n&gt; \n&gt; He noted that Britain extended the right to ask for flexi-work arrangements to all employees in 2014.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Asme's Mr Wee said that even without this formal arrangement, employees already get some flexibility in scheduling their work.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Employers are aware that you cannot expect working styles to be like in the old days, with workers strapped to their desks from 9 to 5,\" he added.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Tampines GRC MP Desmond Choo said legislation may be the push society needs to change minds about flexi-work.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It is fairly tough for professional women who have been away for a while to ask their boss for flexi- work arrangements.\n&gt; \n&gt; The boss may think they are not so committed to their work,\" said the unionist. \"But nearly everyone we meet would like it.

The economy is very demanding,&amp;quot; he told The Straits Times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HAPPIER WORKERS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people are working from home, they are often more likely to work a little bit more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not always at the expense of employers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DR OLIVIER THEVENON, who was invited recently to Singapore by the Prime Minister&amp;#39;s Office to advise civil servants on family and fertility policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flexible work practices were championed by almost all the 18 MPs who debated in Parliament last week on how to support women&amp;#39;s family and work aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These practices include part-time work, working from home and flexible working hours like taking an hour off in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Singapore has rolled out a series of measures to support young couples who want to have children, including doubling government- paid paternity leave to two weeks since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Singapore has workplace practices that are much less flexible than in Britain, the Nordic countries and Germany, said Dr Thevenon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Childcare services help mothers, who are typically the primary carers of children, return to work after they give birth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once parents are back at work, they also need workplace flexibility to manage their work and family duties, he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Singapore can look at adopting a legal right to ask for flexible working arrangements, which Dr Thevenon described as a &amp;quot;soft law&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While employers may not be so keen on the idea, having such a law can help change norms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The British government states on its website that an employer can refuse an application if it has a good business reason. Employers, however, must deal with requests in a &amp;quot;reasonable manner&amp;quot;, like discussing it with their employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It forces employers and employees to discuss the issue, and it is from this discussion that minds start to change,&amp;quot; said Dr Thevenon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He noted that Britain extended the right to ask for flexi-work arrangements to all employees in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Asme&amp;#39;s Mr Wee said that even without this formal arrangement, employees already get some flexibility in scheduling their work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Employers are aware that you cannot expect working styles to be like in the old days, with workers strapped to their desks from 9 to 5,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Tampines GRC MP Desmond Choo said legislation may be the push society needs to change minds about flexi-work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is fairly tough for professional women who have been away for a while to ask their boss for flexi- work arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boss may think they are not so committed to their work,&amp;quot; said the unionist. &amp;quot;But nearly everyone we meet would like it. Why not make it easier?&amp;quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Choo noted that the workforce adapted after maternity leave was raised from 12 to 16 weeks in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Real change will happen only when companies need to abide by certain standards,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Created&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u//LFlare\"&gt;LFlare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/61xl9z\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[About&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Me]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;amp;subject=%5BRedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/65s2g9%5D%20\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Feedback]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Source&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Code]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgcqiel", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492413320.0, "created_utc": 1492384520.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgczx04", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Viinen", "parent_id": "t1_dgczn70", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think he (I presume) is salty that people are getting laid?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think he (I presume) is salty that people are getting laid?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgczx04", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426037.0, "created_utc": 1492397237.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s2g9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdc2gb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chiotkk", "parent_id": "t1_dgdbwx7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Precisely why we need to keep having new policies, you never know till you try.
