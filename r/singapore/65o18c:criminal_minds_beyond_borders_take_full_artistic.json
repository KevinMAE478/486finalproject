Were a TV production company to pilot such a show anytime before 9/11, they&amp;#39;d have been laughed out of the room long before any episode were broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manipulating fear and demonisation of otherhood aren&amp;#39;t unique to any single country; they are, however, depressingly indicative of Governments&amp;#39; slide into a certain &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the original Criminal Minds, even as I saw the manipulation; they still often told good stories. Beyond Borders, however, is beyond bad; shrill and manipulative on &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many levels. Sociology and political-science grad students proposing to study CM:BB and its motivations aren&amp;#39;t going to get approved/funded; not because their proposals aren&amp;#39;t interesting, but because of the sheer shoot-fish-in-a-barrel-with-a-machine-gun laziness indicated by not aiming higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgd3q0f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492431804.0, "created_utc": 1492403004.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o18c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbv105", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ponnifer", "parent_id": "t3_65o18c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "LOL, there isn't any budget to fly to Singapore to film.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOL, there isn&amp;#39;t any budget to fly to Singapore to film.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgbv105", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492361335.0, "created_utc": 1492332535.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o18c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrozk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "helzinki", "parent_id": "t3_65o18c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Some american tv show making up bullshit about other parts of the world?
