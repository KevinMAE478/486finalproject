said Mrs Au-Yong of the incident two years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I didn't ask the staff too many questions, in case they changed their mind (about the offer),\" she added. \"They were very polite about it.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The airline agreed to check in the pair's two pieces of luggage first, so they did not have to carry them home and back to the airport the next day.\n&gt; \n&gt; The postponement also did not disrupt their accommodation plans as they were staying in her daughter's boarding school.\n&gt; \n&gt; In some happy cases, passengers are bumped up, instead of bumped off. Business development executive Ryan Kuan, 29, and his girlfriend were upgraded from economy to premium economy on a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Osaka in 2015.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It was our connecting flight from Singapore to Osaka,\" he recalled. \"The flight was overbooked as there was an overflow (of passengers) from another flight. So we were upgraded to premium economy.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It was a good start to our trip,\" he added.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transport and travel experts say that while overbooking is common, passengers should know what their rights are.\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, said Singapore Management University's transport specialist Terence Fan, passengers should not take up crew seats as Mrs Kwek Rocha did.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"In the event of an accident, it is not clear whose responsibility it is if that particular passenger is hurt,\" he said.

They may also give more on top of the mandatory cash amount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in Singapore, there are no rules and the incentives are negotiated between the airline and the passenger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs Lilian Au-Yong, 57, did not bother to bargain for more when Qantas Airlines offered her and her daughter $400 in cash each and a free upgrade from economy to business class for giving up their seats, if they take a flight the next day instead. The offer was made at the check-in counter at Changi Airport, where the pair had arrived 11/2 hours before their Perth-bound flight was due to depart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Created&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u//LFlare\"&gt;LFlare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/61xl9z\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[About&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Me]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;amp;subject=%5BRedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/65oocz%5D%20\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Feedback]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Source&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Code]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgbxuyw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492370892.0, "created_utc": 1492342092.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
