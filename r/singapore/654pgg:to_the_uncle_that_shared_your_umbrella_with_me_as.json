It was an at pedestrian crossing near my building. We were waiting for the green man to come on, and she was just getting drenched. I asked which building she is heading to; turns out it&amp;#39;s the same building. So I walk her back. Once we arrived, she offered her name, asked for my name, and which company/floor I worked at. I panicked. Because I have a girlfriend. So I gave a fake name and a fake floor level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went home and told my girlfriend. She was half angry/half laughing. She told me I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done that. I told her I didn&amp;#39;t mean anything, and that I shelter guys like this too. But she told me I still shouldn&amp;#39;t do such things, especially if it&amp;#39;s a girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the next day it rained again during lunch time. Fuck. So I brought my umbrella again. On my way to the same pedestrian crossing, I was praying hard to my ancestors and whatever deity that happened to be in CBD during lunchtime that everyone has an umbrella. Lo and behold, it&amp;#39;s another OL without an umbrella, waiting for the green man, getting drenched. Fuck. And I&amp;#39;m the only person with space under his umbrella. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time, I didn&amp;#39;t do anything. And of course I got dirty looks from all the other OLs safely under their umbrellas. Look at this typical crass singaporean man. No wonder singaporean women prefer gentlemanly foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went home and told my girlfriend. This time she was full-on laughing. But she said I did the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I really don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dg8t3xw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492176293.0, "created_utc": 1492147493.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
