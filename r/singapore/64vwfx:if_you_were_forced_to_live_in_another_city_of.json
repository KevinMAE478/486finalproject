Restaurant asked for a medium rare steak, came a rare steak. When I ask for the waitress, she said it&amp;#39;s medium rare if I want it more done do medium well. Give me a pissed off face and came back the steak was still rare as f. Can&amp;#39;t bring myself to finish it. Alot more encounters but I&amp;#39;m lazy to even elaborate on it &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dg5w6h9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034416.0, "created_utc": 1492005616.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5v9jv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cheesoonjuan", "parent_id": "t1_dg5kofg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You muslim ah? if yes then I understand their sentiments.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You muslim ah? if yes then I understand their sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dg5v9jv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033206.0, "created_utc": 1492004406.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vwfx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5p04t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kissmycheek", "parent_id": "t1_dg5kofg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You must be joking", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must be joking&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dg5p04t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492020719.0, "created_utc": 1491991919.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5kofg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "joncnobody", "parent_id": "t3_64vwfx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "europe is a no go, the discrimination against Asians there ...
