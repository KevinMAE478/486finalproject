People come here on a journey of self-discovery, eager for exotic experiences. Sometimes, I want to ask them: what makes you think that this kind of behaviour is normal in Asia? Why don\u2019t you do the same thing at home?\n\nUnfortunately, there is still discrimination and racism directed at people who aren't white, while white people are worshipped.
