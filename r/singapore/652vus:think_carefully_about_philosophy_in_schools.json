However, the Logic branch of philosophy, which discusses things like &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning\"&gt;deductive reasoning&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, there is a need to be discussing about things that have mixed or no empirical evidence for the best answer; otherwise we&amp;#39;ll just rely on data science all the time and there&amp;#39;ll be no action and initiative, just a resigned following of the established pathways that&amp;#39;s being laid out for you. I believe that philosophy helps with that somewhat. There is a difference in being able to give a non-fearful answer to questions like &amp;quot;Why do I serve NS&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Why do I do this crap that I do not like&amp;quot;. Don&amp;#39;t settle for answers like &amp;quot;Because suck thumb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Because some authority says so&amp;quot;, etc. Being able to give a better answer in one&amp;#39;s thoughts provides another source of strength that keeps people going and striving on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dg76bcb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088455.0, "created_utc": 1492059655.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652vus", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7b6a2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kronograf", "parent_id": "t3_652vus", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What a STEMlord.
