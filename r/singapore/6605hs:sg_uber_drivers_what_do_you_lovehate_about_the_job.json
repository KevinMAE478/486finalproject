You can calculate from your first couple days how much you'll need to drive to cover your rental fees and petrol and still make a decent amount and decide how much you want to drive from there. Granted it isn't as good as it was a few years ago, it's still pretty decent! \n\nYou meet all sorts of characters. The truth is, you can choose how much you want to interact with your passengers. If you're tired, you can just zone out a little and the passenger will usually get the message and do their own thing. If you wanna talk, just ask them how they're doing and go from there! Foreigners do tend to be more chatty than locals but I did meet some amazingly wonderful people from both groups during my short 5 weeks! I personally love the fact that you have these unusual interactions that last just the duration of your trip and will probably never see them again but you'll always have that nice memory. It's almost like meeting the character/personality rather than the person! Like reading a short biography!\n\nCons:\nNow here is the part that ruined my experience. I rented a car from Lion City Rentals. Fuck them. I'd heard bad reviews online, people complaining that they try to cheat you and rip you off but I thought it was the minority who got fucked over and they were just bitter. So let me be clear, every single uber driver I've spoken to in the last 5 months who rented from them, got fucked in the same two ways that I did.\n1. When I went to pick up my car from their lot, the cars were all parked very close together and there was very minimal lighting (by choice as there are lights that were off). My car in particular was parked so tightly up against a corner that there was no space to walk between the car and the wall on the back and left side. Before you sign for the car they ask you to inspect it for scratches or any damages. I looked closely on the front and right and found a couple small ones but I couldn't reach the other two sides. I thought I was already being quite extreme to try and use my phone light to shine along those sides and try to peer in and see it but couldn't see anything. So I signed off and took the car. Naturally when I got out of there I took a better look and found a big scratch on the left rear door, hidden quite impressively by parking it that way. (I was kinda impressed to be honest! Well played, LCR!) so I figured I was ready gonna get fucked when I return it with a scratch that \"wasn't there\" when I picked it up.\n2. The Uber Fuel Card. They constantly tell you about his amazing partnership with uber; if you sign up with lcr you can get an uber fuel card that gets you discounts on your petrol based on the number of rides you make in a week, the maximum being 18% off your petrol. It all seems great and relatively easy to achieve if you put in the work. What I only found out on the day I picked up my car was that only then was I able to apply for my card online since that was when my uber account was officially activated. Problem is the APPLICATION for the card takes about 2 weeks to process, after which it takes another 2-3 weeks for them to send you the card. So with my 5 week contract, I'm fucked la. Sucks to be me. I have my own petrol discounts at SPC for 15% so I just used that. Granted the uber fuel card is worth it if you have it, so if you're driving long term on the 6-month contract or longer, you should absolutely go for it. It's just a cheeky way to fuck over the 5-week guys like me. \n\nSo those are the two ways they get almost everyone with and as I said, by day one with my car, I realised both of them and figured, fuck it. I'm kinda screwed, not much I can do about those, might as well enjoy my time driving. I did. I loved it, I love driving, talking to strangers (most of the time, sometimes I'm just exhausted) and just being out on the road all day was pretty fun! It's kinda like a grinding game; you've gotta hit you're quota and see how much you can make, there are incentives that really help out, you learn the best times and areas to go to. All in all it's pretty fun but HEY THEY MANAGED TO TRY AND FUCK ME OVER AGAIN.\n\nWhen I wanted to return my car, I went online to book my return date - remember to book it MORE than a week before. If you book it within your last week they'll make you return it the following week and charge you extra rental fees for the extra days. The day I was returning the car, I still had that scratch on the back door so I took the car for a wax and polish and the scratch was actually very hard to see so I figured I had a chance to get away with it! So I brought it back to their place, shining black car, walked round it and checked that it was pristine and that scratch couldn't be seen, then walked into their office about 10 metres away. I was in the office for just 2 minutes before we went back out for the inspection. We walked out and I felt pretty confident, my mom came along cause she's a lawyer and I figured I might need some back up against these fuckers. Also she's fierce as fuck and I've seen her crush the souls of many ass holes over the years who try to fuck with her! It's awesome. So we walked back out and the guy looks around and then calls us to the back corner of the car where there is suddenly a huge 3cm long RED scratch in the side of the car. Now I just waxed and polished the car and its glistening black, I walked all around and inspected it and there was absolutely nothing 2 minutes ago. I was fucking amazed. I knew they would try to fuck me over somehow but this was just bold af. They fucking scratched it right there while I was in the office with the car still in sight. I knew right then that I had no proof so accusing them of this wouldn't amount to anything so my mum immediately started rubbing it and insisted that it's nothing, not even a scratch and that polish would take it right out. We gave them so much shit that it was nothing and got them to bring some polish and clean it and eventually get agreed that it wasn't a scratch and we signed off on no damage to the car! (Even got away with the original one too!) I was just speechless. I couldn't believe how far they would go to fuck people over. It was amazing. When it came to finalising the payment and refund of my initial deposit, my mum went into lawyer mode and questioned every single thing they tried. They said they would get back to me within a few days if any additional charges came up (which is fucking bullshit) so she called them out on it, saying if there's no charges no why he fuck would there suddenly be charges in a few days unless they do something to it. So she insisted that if we sign off on it now, it's done and there are no charges. So they said it's just standard protocol, that's just how hey do it, so she said, \"good, if there are any charges beyond this, let me know immediately so I can start preparing my case to take legal action against you guys, thank you\". They never called back, I got my full refund.\n\nThat last bit might seem harsh and unnecessary but let me tell you, we saw the guy finishing up his return just before us and instead of his refund, he had to pay a total of 1.4k in \"damages\". A friend of mine paid 1.8 and a passenger I met who also drove paid 800+ so they do this all the time.\n\nSo to sum this all up, I don't have much against Uber, except for the fact that they have partnered up with these cunts to take advantage of people. My real issue is with how blatantly these cunts are abusing their power and cheating so many people with deceit and little tricks. They are such a well-oiled machine in their games that they know how to get away with it so if you're gonna go rent from them.
