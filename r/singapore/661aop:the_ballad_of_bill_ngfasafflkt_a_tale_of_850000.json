Nothing has come of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$500,000 is a huge amount of money, given that grassroots football were only allocated $70,000 last year. So naturally the press asked the FAS why it was used for a foreign entity instead. &lt;strong&gt;The FAS further claimed that the donor (Bill) made the decision to donate to the AFF. And this was not a case of FAS accepting a donation and thereafter channelling the amount to AFF instead of using it for local football.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The press then turned to Zainudin, who blanked everyone out and refused to answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bill Ng&amp;#39;s team then released a statement on Monday, refuting the FAS statements. They basically accused Winston Lee of flip-flopping their statements, and &lt;strong&gt;1) the donations were made to FAS, not AFF 2) Winston, not Zainudin, solicited the donations 3) Bill agreed to the donation strictly on the basis that the money was to be used to benefit Singapore football, especially our local clubs 4) Tiong Bahru FC did not receive any acknowledgement or receipt from the FAS or AFF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;FAS claimed that the donation did not qualify for tax purposes as it was made by Tiong Bahru to AFF directly, hence they were not required to issue a tax-deductible receipt.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AFF then added another conflicting statement, &lt;strong&gt;claiming that the donation came from FAS, and not Bill Ng.&lt;/strong&gt; They also explained the FMS, and said that it will be launched in the next 9-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while all these is going on, the other FAS election team led by former FAS vice-president Lim Kia Tong, claimed they had no idea of what was going on.
