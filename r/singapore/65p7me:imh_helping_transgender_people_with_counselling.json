Said LGBT advocate Bryan Choong: &amp;quot;It helps to reduce barriers in seeking help.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before IMH offered such services, many would have sought help at private clinics, which are substantially more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are no official figures on the number of transgender people in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on international studies estimating that 1 per cent of any population identify themselves as transgender, there could be about 34,000 transgender Singaporeans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMH&amp;#39;s move comes amid growing ground-up efforts to offer greater support for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last Monday, six transgender men and women launched the first public information portal for the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The site, transgendersg.com, has a range of information from how to change a person&amp;#39;s sex on legal documents here, to national service policies for transgender women, and how to safely start on hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Joe Wong, who helped to launch the website, said they wanted to &amp;quot;address the severe lack of information on navigating life and transition as a transgender person in Singapore&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Information online tends to be Western-centric, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Wong, who transitioned 15 years ago and is also an activist with the Asia-Pacific Transgender Network, said: &amp;quot;Trans people here have thus had to rely on word of mouth for a long time, which often means that accessing safe, quality transition-related healthcare might depend on who you know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another recent development is the creation of an informal support group for transgender men called Kopitiam Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group meets twice a month at a secret location disclosed only when interested parties send a private Facebook message to the organiser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We try to keep it as secretive as possible to safeguard the identities of people who are attending, so they feel safer about coming,&amp;quot; said organiser Deveshwar Sham, 32, a transgender man who works in animal welfare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started it to create a space where transgender Singaporeans can ask questions and share experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group&amp;#39;s first meeting in December drew four participants, a number he said was &amp;quot;pretty good&amp;quot;. Kopitiam Brothers has since met five times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Leow Yangfa, 42, executive director of LGBT counselling group Oogachaga, said it was heartening to see these developments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Created&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u//LFlare\"&gt;LFlare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/61xl9z\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[About&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Me]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;amp;subject=%5BRedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/65p7me%5D%20\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Feedback]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Source&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Code]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "singapore", "name": "t1_dgc1see", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492379788.0, "created_utc": 1492350988.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p7me", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3t4e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tastetherainbowzz", "parent_id": "t3_65p7me", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/singapore", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am really glad that healthcare here does not buy into pseudoscientific bullshit like conversion therapy, or worse, trying to \"treat\" homosexuality by changing their sex (it's a thing in Iran).\n\nPretty sure your typical foreigner would be surprised when reading the article, given how we're often seen as a country with limited rights, especially for minority groups like LGBTs.
