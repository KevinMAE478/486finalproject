She runs a shop with her father at the junction of Albert Street and Short Street near Little India.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThey (the suppliers) are exporting to China, so we get less supply and it\u2019s more expensive,\u201d she said.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, the Musang King, or Mao Shan Wang durian, was selling for S$8 per kg five years ago. Last year, that almost doubled to S$15 per kg, she said. Currently, fruit shops here are selling their supplies from Pahang at about S$28 per kg at the tail end of the current season. The Musang King durians are the most popular, given their creamy texture and small seeds, sellers said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr Shui Poh Sing, 58, owner of Ah Seng Durian in Ghim Moh, said that while durians are not new to Chinese nationals, they were previously getting supplies from Thailand.

The higher prices have hurt her business too, with a 20 per cent fall in demand at her Balestier Road stall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other factors will also contribute to a smaller local supply this year. The crop is unlikely to be big which will keep prices high, said Mr Shui. This is because harvest cycles in durian plantations in states like Johor Bahru, Penang and Malacca have changed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWhen we have durians from different plantations at the same time, the prices can go down to as low as about S$12 per kg, but I don\u2019t think that will be happening this year,\u201d he said. The peak durian season is typically from May to August, but it is \u201cchaotic\u201d this year, he added. Durians from Johor Bahru were available from February, which is uncommon.
