Second, go to your local gas station and buy a Vuse Vibe. The battery and a cartridge are $20. Then you&amp;#39;ll want to go home and smoke your last cigarette. Take it out of the pack and then run the pack under the faucet until the rest of your cigarettes are nice and moist. This is the hardest part. Congratulations. You just washed $6.00 (depending on location) down the drain. Finally, enjoy your last cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next couple days will test your willpower but your new pen will keep the cravings away. It&amp;#39;s not the same as a cigarette but as long as you stay strong, you&amp;#39;ll survive. You can&amp;#39;t buy another pack because you just threw one away. Why would you waste your money again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be easy but you can do it. I did.

Vaping has no combustion, and thus no tar, thus no cancer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of biology and chemistry is sophisticated enough that we know vaping is much, much safer than cigarettes despite the relatively short time they&amp;#39;ve been on the market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is vaping harmless? Absolutely not. If you don&amp;#39;t smoke, you shouldn&amp;#39;t vape either. But in the interest of harm reduction, switching from cigarettes to vaping is the smarter choice, without question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "standupshots", "name": "t1_dgdv9ek", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481617.0, "created_utc": 1492452817.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uxtj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vqz1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge7qzi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wordhurdles", "parent_id": "t1_dgdugol", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/standupshots", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There is evidence that nicotine is present in some foods.  \n\nSource:  [The Nicotine Content of Common Vegetables - New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.google.com/search?q=nicotine+in+vegetables&amp;oq=nicotine+in+vege&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3767j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that nicotine is present in some foods.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=nicotine+in+vegetables&amp;amp;oq=nicotine+in+vege&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3767j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8\"&gt;The Nicotine Content of Common Vegetables - New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "standupshots", "name": "t1_dge7qzi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496029.0, "created_utc": 1492467229.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdugol", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "livingcode", "parent_id": "t1_dgdrjax", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/standupshots", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well isn't nicotine carcinogenic?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well isn&amp;#39;t nicotine carcinogenic?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "standupshots", "name": "t1_dgdugol", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480729.0, "created_utc": 1492451929.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdrjax", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 60, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wolfanini", "parent_id": "t3_65vqz1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/standupshots", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a comedy fan, I love this bit!\n\nAs a former vaper, I'd like to point out that there are zero links between vaping and cancer.
