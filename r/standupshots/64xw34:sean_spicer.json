In the Quaran there is the story of Joseph and his brothers selling him into slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised Catholic, and read most of the Bible, and taken a lot of biblical study classes, and we were always taught that the stories in the bible are stories, and we shouldn&amp;#39;t take them literally.  It was even suggested that Jews didn&amp;#39;t take the stories completely literally either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historically, it seems pretty clear that the Passover story didn&amp;#39;t happen (at least not as presented in the bible), and likewise, I know Gensis is full of stories that don&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense if taken literally.
