TNT is a decent substitute for a cratering charge, but dynamite is great for smaller projects like drainage ditches. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the time I was in actually doing explosive ditching &amp;amp; cratering was actually pretty rare (especially on a large scale) because there are shot poundage limitations depending on what range you&amp;#39;re using which also varies on the base you&amp;#39;re training on. Onboard Camp Lejeune we couldn&amp;#39;t get away with large shots like we could out in the middle of nowhere aboard 29 Palms or while deployed to the middle east.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the things I used to do as an instructor was to use 1/4lbs sticks of TNT to demonstrate to students the concept of finding the sweet spot for charge depths. Burying 4 shots about 2ft apart at 6&amp;quot;, 12&amp;quot;, 18&amp;quot; and 24&amp;quot; of depth usually illustrated it very clearly. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Military", "name": "t1_dga3l7b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249327.0, "created_utc": 1492220527.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0i5j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EichmannsCat", "parent_id": "t1_dg9sj4q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Military", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How common is using charges to do this kinda stuff?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How common is using charges to do this kinda stuff?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Military", "name": "t1_dga0i5j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245117.0, "created_utc": 1492216317.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9sj4q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wordstrappedinmyhead", "parent_id": "t1_dg9pl0k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Military", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The nuke that created [the Sedan Crater at the Nevada Test Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_Crater) was buried 635ft below ground.\n\nWith underground shots using conventional demo, there's a sweet spot for depth to bury the charges.\n\nToo shallow and the blast energy gets wasted. \n\nToo deep and it won't fully evacuate the crater.
