Anyone who can pass the requisites can join regardless of nationality. I was in the army with Chinese people, Mexicans, Peruvians, UK citizens, and even residents of Jordan and Palestine. All had joined the US Army by visiting an embassy or a recruiting station. One of them-the Peruvian- was an officer (commissioned). He spoke no English and had no residency prior to switching from Army of Peru to US Army. He lost rank in the transition, but I'm sure it didn't matter as the money for a butter bar in the US was better than a Capt in Peru. The rest were enlisted. The most interesting case was the Chinese soldier. We were trained in a highly technical field together. There were sections of our training that he was omitted from because he could not get clearance. What was funny is that some of what he missed was honestly vital to the MOS. We used to joke about how useless he was, and even he knew it. He learned enough to be dangerous, though, and graduated on time. Somehow the Jordanian and Palestinian were cleared. Go figure. Finally, all of these folks applied for citizenship and it was granted by the time their first enlistment was up (even the Peruvian officer). One exception: one of my battle buddies was a Mexican illegal who grew up in Houston. Upon end of his first enlistment, he was told he would have to be deported after out processing cause he was too lazy to \"get legal\" during his service. Needless to say, he re-enlisted and got legal before his second enlistment was up.
