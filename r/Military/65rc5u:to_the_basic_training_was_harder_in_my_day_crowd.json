Joined up on 17 April 1972. Did BCT at Fort Ord. It was challenging and difficult but certainly not impossible. A great adventure. I was 18 years old at the time. \nI don&amp;#39;t think Basic was about how fast you could run or how many push-ups you could do. For me it was how much stress a guy could endure and how much guy was willing to put up with to be a part of something.\nSure, it&amp;#39;s not all that difficult but how many people in your life or that you grew up with could do it or would be willing to try? Not many. \nThere may be more accommodation in Basic these days but I think it&amp;#39;s just as challenging as it was 45 years ago.\nNo doubt today&amp;#39;s soldiers look a lot snazzier in their fancy camo BDUs. But their hearts and enthusiasm at the end of BCT remains constant throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Military", "name": "t1_dgcw0d5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492420694.0, "created_utc": 1492391894.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rc5u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rc5u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvfz2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chewbacca2hot", "parent_id": "t1_dgcmk5y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Military", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I could max APFT as a high school athlete.
