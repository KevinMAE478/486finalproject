However, operational units tend to award coins more, and volunteering for thing definitely helps as someone might want to give you an award for volunteering by giving you a coin.\n\nBeing coined is being presented with a coin by somebody else for you to keep. Usually people get coined when they interact with high rank NCOs or officers who tend to carry them around and give them to younger guys, or by attending a school or a tour in a certain unit where you are given one as a parting gift, or by serving in a certain operation or mission, or going to a joint unit overseas, etc. \n\nThe reason the challenge coin name came around is because apparently military members would go for a drink and each one would place their most special or cool coin on the table for others to see, and whoever lost the \"challenge\" by having the less interesting coin would have to buy the other a drink. As an example, if one guy were to show off a coin he get got for attending a special school, and the other presented a coin he personally got from Gen. Mattis for showing him around, the guy with the Mattis coin is probably going to get a free drink.\n", "edited": 1492284395.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s basically a way for military members to give each other a little gift for either a special event, completing a special project, etc etc. There is no &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; way to get a challenge coin from someone else, as it is basically a gift that someone gives to you out of their own desire.

People collect their coins and place them on their desk in a similar fashion as people who collect souvenirs from travel or special edition whatever from attending events of something they like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AS far as I know its thought the tradition started because officers from the many different nations in the wars of the 20th century would trade cool stuff with each other, including coins from their homeland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today anyone can get a coin made online and you can find coins of units, in this case of a MOH recipient, of events, of missions, of bases etc. It comes down to luck mostly as to who gets coined. I know some coasties with like 50 coins simply because they were in the right place at the right time and stumbled upon some important person. However, operational units tend to award coins more, and volunteering for thing definitely helps as someone might want to give you an award for volunteering by giving you a coin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being coined is being presented with a coin by somebody else for you to keep. Usually people get coined when they interact with high rank NCOs or officers who tend to carry them around and give them to younger guys, or by attending a school or a tour in a certain unit where you are given one as a parting gift, or by serving in a certain operation or mission, or going to a joint unit overseas, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason the challenge coin name came around is because apparently military members would go for a drink and each one would place their most special or cool coin on the table for others to see, and whoever lost the &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot; by having the less interesting coin would have to buy the other a drink. As an example, if one guy were to show off a coin he get got for attending a special school, and the other presented a coin he personally got from Gen. Mattis for showing him around, the guy with the Mattis coin is probably going to get a free drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Military", "name": "t1_dgb1s30", "score_hidden": false,
