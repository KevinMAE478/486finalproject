The scene with him actually biting it might be in a Star Wars special or something. But what you can see is Jabba sleeping and Salacious Crumb watching his tail like it's food. Later on you see a wound on Jabba's tail close to Salacious Crumb. Some where is a scene of Salacious Crumb actually biting Jabba's tail and waking him up. I've always thought it was actually in Jedi and that Lucas cut it out when he did the special editions.
