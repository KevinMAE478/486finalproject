Over time, some of the new stuff added made for some fun gameplay, but you have to have all of the DLC to experience that, and a lot of people couldn't afford to pay $120+ to get the good stuff.  Even with some variety of objectives, there was still an issue that you could only really change up weaponry, and scoring was weighed much more heavily toward K/D ratio than bothering with the objective, which meant matches devolved into people trying to boost their K/D and not caring about winning.\n\nIt's best to compare Battlefront to modern games of its type.  Titanfall 2 and Battlefield 1 are obvious choices, especially as both are published by EA.  In both cases, you saw a single player campaign, and with TF2 it was something panned in TF1 that there was no such campaign (and the season pass broke up players... basically, TF1 was the case study that should have shown EABF1 wouldn't go over well).  TF2 responded with what many people call one of the best single player campaigns in a game.  But they went further.  They not only ditched the season pass, they offered DLC without pay, so you can drop $60 and get the whole game.  Battlefield 1 still has a season pass, but is now having to introduce ways around it, as even that amazing game is suffering because, well, people are sick of paying $120 for a game.  But beyond that, it also has different classes, like Medic and Support, that allow you to score from helping your team in various ways, and has scoring based off of actually completing the objectives.  This lets people like me, who aren't the best at twitch shooting, still contribute and actually feel like we're being rewarded for it.\n\nBut let's look at another game:  Overwatch.  Overwatch released as just an online-only shooter.  Relatively light on number of game modes, admittedly.  But it was only $40 on PC (I think more on console), and all DLC is free.  It makes money through selling loot boxes with cosmetic stuff (which you can also earn just through playing, and you always get a free box whenever an in-game event happens).  So you can play what's become a pretty rich experience with just one payment of $40 or $60.  That's it.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that the characters you play have varying roles and abilities, and you earn XP for using them, so you're not locked into just figuring out which gun is best to use.\n\nBattlefront 2 lists some solid points on the website, which seem to address some concerns, like the singleplayer campaign and space battles.  The big question is what they replace season passes with.  Will it be PTW boxes that replace obnoxious grinds so you can get top gear/abilities without playing for months?  Will it be some kind of subscription service?  Or will it be cosmetic boxes, or even just boxes to bypass grind but the grind isn't terribly obnoxious?\n\nI want to know that answer before I can cheer too much.  I'm somewhat optimistic, but I was burned before, and that leaves a person feeling pretty cautious... especially at nearly midnight, when they're making a quick post before getting back to other stuff.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is that it was an online-only game with no classes, no customization outside of grinding for some cosmetic changes, and very few maps and game modes, especially outside of the season pass.  Over time, some of the new stuff added made for some fun gameplay, but you have to have all of the DLC to experience that, and a lot of people couldn&amp;#39;t afford to pay $120+ to get the good stuff.  Even with some variety of objectives, there was still an issue that you could only really change up weaponry, and scoring was weighed much more heavily toward K/D ratio than bothering with the objective, which meant matches devolved into people trying to boost their K/D and not caring about winning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s best to compare Battlefront to modern games of its type.  Titanfall 2 and Battlefield 1 are obvious choices, especially as both are published by EA.  In both cases, you saw a single player campaign, and with TF2 it was something panned in TF1 that there was no such campaign (and the season pass broke up players... basically, TF1 was the case study that should have shown EABF1 wouldn&amp;#39;t go over well).  TF2 responded with what many people call one of the best single player campaigns in a game.  But they went further.  They not only ditched the season pass, they offered DLC without pay, so you can drop $60 and get the whole game.  Battlefield 1 still has a season pass, but is now having to introduce ways around it, as even that amazing game is suffering because, well, people are sick of paying $120 for a game.  But beyond that, it also has different classes, like Medic and Support, that allow you to score from helping your team in various ways, and has scoring based off of actually completing the objectives.  This lets people like me, who aren&amp;#39;t the best at twitch shooting, still contribute and actually feel like we&amp;#39;re being rewarded for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s look at another game:  Overwatch.  Overwatch released as just an online-only shooter.  Relatively light on number of game modes, admittedly.  But it was only $40 on PC (I think more on console), and all DLC is free.  It makes money through selling loot boxes with cosmetic stuff (which you can also earn just through playing, and you always get a free box whenever an in-game event happens).  So you can play what&amp;#39;s become a pretty rich experience with just one payment of $40 or $60.  That&amp;#39;s it.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that the characters you play have varying roles and abilities, and you earn XP for using them, so you&amp;#39;re not locked into just figuring out which gun is best to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Battlefront 2 lists some solid points on the website, which seem to address some concerns, like the singleplayer campaign and space battles.  The big question is what they replace season passes with.  Will it be PTW boxes that replace obnoxious grinds so you can get top gear/abilities without playing for months?  Will it be some kind of subscription service?  Or will it be cosmetic boxes, or even just boxes to bypass grind but the grind isn&amp;#39;t terribly obnoxious?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to know that answer before I can cheer too much.  I&amp;#39;m somewhat optimistic, but I was burned before, and that leaves a person feeling pretty cautious... especially at nearly midnight, when they&amp;#39;re making a quick post before getting back to other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "StarWars", "name": "t1_dgc1i8f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492379285.0, "created_utc": 1492350485.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbstev", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "megatom0", "parent_id": "t1_dgbmepn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StarWars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean Battlefront the original 2 games aren't incredibly deep games.
