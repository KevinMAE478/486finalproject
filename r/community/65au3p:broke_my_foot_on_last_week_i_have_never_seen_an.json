About 2 months ago, I rewatched the entire series.\n\n* Jeff - I like his character development.  He was a pompous ass at first, and he was still a pompous ass at the end, but he cared about others besides himself.  He put on a tough appearance, but did have his friends and Greendale's interests in mind in the end.\n\n* Britta - I never liked her character, but she was meant to be annoying.  I think Gillian Jacobs played her well.\n\n* Annie - She was adorable and I think her character developed a bit, but she still was Annie.  She was basically a caricature, but not too far off from people that I have known.  I do have a huge crush on Allison Brie though.  Damn, that woman and her....eyes.\n\n* Shirley - I didn't connect with Shirley because she was too real.  I'm a devout Agnostic so I have problems with Christians judging others from that perspective.  It's the same reason why I can't stand Steve Carrel's character in The Office: it's just too real for me and I can't stand it.\n\n* Pierce - He was tolerable in the 1st season, kind of like my racist grandparents that just have not adapted as times have changed, but he became completely despicable in Season 2 and couldn't stand him.  I almost stopped watching because of his character.\n\n* Dean Pelton - I couldn't stand him in the first few seasons and although he was in dire need of affirmation from everyone around him, he did love Greendale.  I think Jim Rash's acting ability was amazing throughout the entire series and loved some of the absolutely insane shit that he did and pulled it off well.\n\n* Troy - He grew up a lot in the 4.5 seasons.  He was the typical self centered jock in the 1st season, but came to accept who he was and not give a fuck with Abed helping him along the way.  He became who he truly was.  I literally cried in his last episode.\n\n* Abed - The show was his show although Jeff was the frontman.  I think he really, really developed over time, especially with the empathy episode with Annie and him.  He was still Abed, but he learned to connect with others and to think of others the entire series.  He definitely had Asperger Syndrome, but I couldn't stand it the few times that they made him moan and rock back and forth like he had extreme autism.  That was just too much for me.\n\n* Other Characters - They filled in holes, but weren't that memorable to me.  They had their moments for sure.  I think Frankie was the best followed by Professor Hickey.  Elroy Patashnik was the worst of the 3 in my opinion.\n\n* Season 7 - With the series finale, it was clear that Annie and Abed had decided to leave the show no matter what.  Without Abed, the show is over.  I'm fine that there was not a Season 7.\n\n* And A Movie - I think there will be a movie at some point.  It may not live up to the hype, but I'll watch it.  It think that Firefly:Serenity::Community:Community The Movie.

Pierce and Shirley were missed, the raw humor from Pierce, working with the Christian-ness of Shirley was working really well for the show&amp;#39;s overall good v. evil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite season was most likely season 2, I have many reasons for this but really I just felt like everyone was finally comfortable, I was really enjoying the show here, finishing Season 2 in a marathon style in one day. It was intense but am more excited for a rewatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think trying to keep up with who everyone wanted to hook up with was difficult, but any College can be just as similar, I liked that aspect. I would not have a season 7 personally, but if you had to, I would be more interested in the alternate timelines, as it would give us a chance to come back without having to change too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could do an entire post on the relationship between Troy and Abed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if I had one wish, it would be that we lived in a vacuum world where they could create, shoot, produce, and release, all six seasons and a movie without worrying about pilots, pickups, cancellations, network censors, and more. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "community", "name": "t1_dgaekp6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492268472.0, "created_utc": 1492239672.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tnbw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Diablo_swing", "parent_id": "t3_65au3p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/community", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How did you feel about the casting changes while watching it that fast?\nWhat did you think about everyone's character development?\nDo you have a favourite season?\nWhat would be your pitch for season 7?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did you feel about the casting changes while watching it that fast?\nWhat did you think about everyone&amp;#39;s character development?\nDo you have a favourite season?\nWhat would be your pitch for season 7?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "community", "name": "t1_dg9tnbw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492235993.0, "created_utc": 1492207193.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qu49", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65au3p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqtzk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShutUpTodd", "parent_id": "t3_65au3p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/community", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Another joins the club](http://i.imgur.com/M6yFbzR.png)\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/M6yFbzR.png\"&gt;Another joins the club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "community", "name": "t1_dgaqtzk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492297907.0, "created_utc": 1492269107.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
