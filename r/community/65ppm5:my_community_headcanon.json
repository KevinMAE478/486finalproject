Anyway - &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One. By the end of S6, if Jeff\u2019s not already an alcoholic he\u2019s headed that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logic - I\u2019m pretty confident this is so close to being confirmed on the show that it barely counts as headcanon.  But anyway - the drinking in class, in his office, the large quantities of ice in his Scotch (a common alcoholic\u2019s trick apparently, to disguise how much they\u2019re drinking - this from a guy who as of \u201cMixology Certification\u201d knew ice and Scotch don\u2019t mix), etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two.

Also despite this she\u2019s shown as not having any money for rent or to pay for courses and her friends are constantly referring to how high she is, obviously her money is going somewhere that\u2019s more important to her than classes and accommodation. Frankly too it also helps to explain how somebody who in S1 could match Jeff for smarts and cynicism had degenerated into somebody who, by S6, couldn\u2019t cross a room without fouling herself. This may have something to do with -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three. Britta loves Jeff, but keeps it to herself because she knows he doesn\u2019t love her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logic - she\u2019s constantly bringing up the fact that she and Jeff used to sleep together (in unflattering terms granted, but that could be a defence mechanism), implying that she\u2019s not over it. Also in \u201cIntro to Knots\u201d she describes the year of secret sex as when she and Jeff used to date and looks genuinely hurt when he shoots it down with \u201cwhat we did was not dating\u201d. And finally, she immediately accepts his proposal of marriage in \u201cBasic Story\u201d, which I have difficulty imagining she would do if she didn\u2019t still harbour feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four. Frankie is basically asexual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logic - although the show provides hints that would support her being attracted to either Jeff or Annie (or indeed both) they\u2019re only very faint hints and the fact she appears to be both single and very strongly of a neither confirm or deny mindset when it comes to questions about her sexuality could be seeing as supporting asexuality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Five.

With the exception of Troy, Abed does not regard these people as friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logic - don\u2019t get me wrong he doesn\u2019t actively dislike them, but friends don\u2019t do things like - catfish Annie; hijack Jeff\u2019s Netflix account; sabotage Jeff\u2019s commercial (for \u201cartistic\u201d reasons) when he\u2019s depending on it to relaunch his career or spend months goofing around, failing to pay his share of the rent and basically forcing Annie to work like a dog at a job she hates to keep a roof over Trobed\u2019s heads when we find out in \u201cGeothermal Escapism\u201d he owns at least one asset worth tens of thousands of dollars (these example all feature Jeff and Annie because he barely even seems to acknowledge Pierce and Shirley\u2019s existence). No, they\u2019re characters in a story to him who exist to meet a narrative goal (\u201cbond with a group of lovable misfits\u201d) not a part of his life.

The obvious objection to this is her feminism, but \u201cTummy Tuesdays\u201d and the revelation in Heroic origins that her foot modelling is actually at least in part fetish work (Britta, take pictures of your feet, post them on the Internet for money?\u201d Abed asks, followed by Troy showing him something on his phone) shows she\u2019s willing to exploit her body for cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;? - Annie and Britta had an affair in the second semester of the fourth year, following Jeff\u2019s graduation (i.e. Between the end of S4 and the start of S5).

Add to this Jeff no longer being around to suck the oxygen out of Annie\u2019s love life and Annie\u2019s well established preference for older but still hot emotionally unavailable hipsters (Jeff, Rich, Vaughn, Abed\u2019s Han Solo and Don Draper impersonations but not Abed himself\u2026) and it seems obvious she would gravitate towards the other member of the group to fit this description. I\u2019m not sure how long it lasts (by 5x03 they\u2019re still close enough that in the round of hugs following the news of Pierce\u2019s death the hug the girls share is longer and more intense than any they share with anybody else), but I am pretty sure it ends badly, explaining some of the bitterness between the girls in late S5/S6 (\u201cpay your rent Britta!\u201d). As to why it ends, a combination of Annie getting a job as a promotions girl for a drugs company offending both Britta\u2019s feminist and anti-capitalist principles, Annie starting an online relationship with \u201cBrent Underjaw\u201d and drifting back into Jeff\u2019s orbit when he re-emerges would probably do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - thoughts?
