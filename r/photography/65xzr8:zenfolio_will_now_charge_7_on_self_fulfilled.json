The Sales Tax charged for any order is not part of the service fee calculation.\n\nFor examples on how the service fee is calculated, see this article in our Support Center.\n\nWhy is Zenfolio still a great value for me?\nZenfolio has one of the most robust platforms in the industry for self-fulfilled products. It allows photographers to offer any type of product or service imaginable to their clients and offer them for sale seamlessly alongside vendor products and digital downloads.\n\nThe service fee change will allow us to continue to provide this highly requested service for our customers to run their business in the easiest way possible.\n\nWhen will the prices change?\nThe service fee change goes into effect for any orders placed on or after May 26, 2017. Existing orders placed before midnight PST on May 25, 2017 will not be affected.\n\nWhy do you charge a service fee on products that I am responsible for fulfilling?\nThere are various infrastructure, support, and systems costs associated with developing and maintaining the self-fulfilled feature-set. These include the use of an integrated shopping cart and selling features, sales reporting, and on-going interface development and maintenance.\n\nWhy should I stay with Zenfolio after the service fee change?\nWe would strongly encourage you to take a look at others in the industry and assess their fees for both their service and any fees they may charge for orders and credit card processing. We think you\u2019ll find that despite the service fee change, our rates are still very competitive.\n\nCan I cancel my Zenfolio account and get a refund?\nPlease connect with our Customer Support team and they\u2019ll be happy to look into this with you.\n\nIs there a way I can more cost effectively run my business on Zenfolio?\nThere could very well be. Please reach out to our Support team to see what options are available.\n\nHow will this impact my self-fulfilled product pricing?\nWhen and if you sell self-fulfilled products, a charge in the amount of 7% of the selling price will be deducted from your Zenfolio account balance. If your Zenfolio account balance reaches -$50.00, the credit card on file will be charged to restore the account balance to $0. Because of this change in margins, you may wish to update the prices on your self-fulfilled products.
