There was not enough photos for Sony / Fuji from 500px so I started gathering images from Flickr. Also I felt it was unfair that we did not credit the photos to their rightful owners so I&amp;#39;ve included the artists names and the direct link to the photo for now, so you can peek at their portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also tied up some other things on my end the images should be loading a little faster. And lucky for you guys I&amp;#39;ve included a prototype section oh the joy :). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prototype section basically combines two cameras and shows images from two different camera brands. We can finally compare Fujis luscious greens to Canons beautiful skin tones. The feature is currently hidden on the site but I wanted you guys to test this out, let me know what you think and yes I&amp;#39;m aware it does match Nikon lenses and Canon bodies at times!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To access this section simply type ?camera2=nikon at the end of your current url page. For example If i were on the canon page and I would like to compare it to nikons I would type:\n&lt;a href=\"http://whatthelens.com/canon/?camera2=nikon\"&gt;http://whatthelens.com/canon/?camera2=nikon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again yes its a little buggy but I would love to see what you guys think!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to limit the amount of NSFW images on the site but its close to impossible I can only go through about 1000 in a week... currently theres 100k+ images. I was looking into googles image search api for it was 20k images for 400$ a pop so I don&amp;#39;t think I can afford that route at the moment haha... So if anyone has some spare time on their hands and would to help out with flagging the NSFW images? Let me know in a PM and I&amp;#39;ll set you up...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly... Olympus/Panasonic/Pentax I have not forgotten you, I&amp;#39;ve been working on the camera lists for a while now, and well its been... well a lot more difficult than I thought, to say the least. The M43 lenses line can be shared interchangeably and I have not found a proper solution yet. And Pentax... well its Pentax. ( Joking! )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again I just want to thank everyone for their encouraging words and for the constant pms and emails I get its really awesome!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!\nWillie C.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys its been a while I've been trying to keep up with all the requests!\n\nhttp://whatthelens.com\n\n\nSo here's what I've done so far... for you Sony fans like me I've launched the Sony camera section along with the Fuji.

This was especially noticeable in the landscape and city categories\n- I noticed (at least with flickr links) that the lens that shows when you hover over the photo on your site often doesn't match with lens shown in the EXIF on the flickr page.\n- It would be nice to see some sort of summary page that shows the photos I selected and which lens they were shot with. In some cases I may have selected more photos taken with lens X (and therefore was recommended lens X), but maybe the photo I liked the most was taken with lens Y. This would be nice to know.\n- When being recommended a zoom lens, it would be nice to see the focal lengths used on the photos I selected. For example, if I'm being recommended a 35mm prime and a 18-55mm zoom, and most of the 18-55mm photos I selected were also ~35mm, maybe I just need the 35mm prime. Similarly, seeing the apertures used could also be useful. Using the same example, if the 35mm prime photos I selected mostly were shot with narrower apertures that are also available on the zoom, maybe I don't need the prime. The focal length &amp; aperture data could show on the summary page mentioned in the previous bullet.\n- Some lenses seem to be very underrepresented. For example, I saw a ton of photos for the 35mm f/1.4, but almost none for the 35mm f/2. I'm sure there are more examples as well.\n- In the same vein, some categories seems to be dominated by photos from a few lenses, making it very likely that you'll be recommended one of those lenses. For example, in the people category, 4 of the first 6 photos I was shown are from the 56mm f/1.2. 5 of the first 9. 6 of the first 12. 8 of 15, 9 of 18, 10 of 21. That is a great lens for people photos, but I think the site would be more useful with a more balanced lens representation. It is more meaningful if I select the 56mm when it was only used in 10% of the photos shown verses 40%+ of the photos.\n- Finally, the left click to select right click to zoom makes for a simple, easy to use interface. However, it is generally frowned upon to override right click unless you are implementing a custom context menu for a web app (e.g. Google Docs). Some people rely on right click for navigation or access to extension functionality. Not saying you should definitely change this, just that it is something to consider. Also, the right click area seems a bit inconsistent (at least on Chrome). In the horizontal space between photos there is a sliver where right click functions as normal, but in the vertical space right click always zooms (even if you're between 2 photos). Having the space between the photos contain the right-click zoom functionality isn't very intuitive, plus if you had all that empty space retain normal right click functionality that would drastically lessen the impact of overriding right click when on top of a photo.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things I noticed while looking at Fuji pictures:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some categories kept showing the same pictures multiple times.
