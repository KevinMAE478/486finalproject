When you print it at 16x24, you&amp;#39;re getting 228 ppi. I would expect both of these to look fine. I wonder if your printer driver hits a problem somewhere in between. You could try making test prints of small areas gradually reducing the ppi to see if the artifacts appear at a certain resolution. What resolution is your printer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be some settings in the print driver that will affect this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dg7omv8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125268.0, "created_utc": 1492096468.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7o8g3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lunaprospect", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nxpb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes 12x18 looks 100% accurate.  \n\nI've seen websites tell me that 20mp is not going to print well at 16x24 no matter what I do.
