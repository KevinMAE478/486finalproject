To get level panoramas (horizontal or vertical) use the ballhead to provide a level surface to rotate the camera on.  The problem here is that 99% of the ballheads, 3D heads, geared heads and everything else has their panning on the base.  So, if your tripod is not perfectly level, then you again get the problem.  The secret is to have the panning base on top of the ballhead - so that when you use the ballhead to level everything, you will be leveling the part that will provide the horizontal movement.  There are several heads that provide this - the Arcatech GP and the Acra Swiss P0 and a couple more.
