Sony has a huge marketshare among videographers and cinematographers with their pro FS series, and it was the a7s with low light performance that first began making huge inroads with many indie films and some larger video/film projects, with crossover to photography.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many companies/organizations/people in general are trying to save costs on equipment. At my work we use Sony because they serve the dual purpose of video and photo. The codecs are standard, the bodies are lighter for gimbals/tripods, and there are lots of video-oriented features and video-specific lenses which are optimized and parfocal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E-mount is also shared between all the Sony FF, APSC and Super35mm cams that are mirrorless, from $1k to over $10k.
