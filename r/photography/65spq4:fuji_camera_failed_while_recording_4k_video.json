The first that my son is old enough to walk around and get his own eggs. My nephews and other family toddlers were there. I own a 5DIV but I had a family member use it to take photos, while I was recording 4K video with a Fuji X-T20 as I&amp;#39;ve been trying to make more video memories. Earlier that day I managed to record a bunch of establishing shots that I was planning to use with the easter egg hunt clip to put together the final video for the family, those recorded just fine but were short clips of a few seconds each. The easter egg hung starts, and I&amp;#39;m recording away. Getting great quality video (for family stuff anyways). Sometime after 5 minutes, I notice I can no longer change the focus point. I try to stop the recording with the shutter, no response. I change the camera to Off mode...no response. Camera is still recording (LCD displays what I&amp;#39;m aiming the lens at, timer is still counting, etc). I can&amp;#39;t stop the video or turn off the camera. So I pulled the battery. Right away I knew that was a bad idea, but I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to do.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nTurn camera back on - the 5 min+ video is not there. Put SD card in computer - nothing. Pay for Recuva and scan. Nothing. Do Deep Scan with Recuva - jackpot? I recovered about 7.5GB worth of .mov files. Seems about right for the 5 minutes of recording with this camera&amp;#39;s codec.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve tried with VLC and Vegas - no luck. I&amp;#39;ve tried Remo&amp;#39;s MOV Repair - no luck. I tried Grau&amp;#39;s HD Video Repair tool, and it says video content 0 but entropy is nearly 1.0 (0.9xxxxx for most blocks, which it says after 0.6 it&amp;#39;s probably video).&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nSo I can&amp;#39;t quite recover it so far. The other thing I&amp;#39;m thinking is that all these .mov files are chunks of the final video, which would have been formatted and split into 4GB files each. So perhaps they need to be joined or something before attempting to recover? I&amp;#39;m really out of my depth here. Is there ANY way to turn this 7.5GB worth of data into a working video file, somehow?&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nLooking at the files in HxD tells me there&amp;#39;s a ton of data there, it&amp;#39;s not just zeroes or an empty .mov file.
