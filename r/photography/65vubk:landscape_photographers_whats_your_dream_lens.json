For wildlife, these lenses tend to be on the shorter end, so a longer / wider lens would be a better option than my trio, although they have the tendency to destroy bank accounts and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For portraits however, these glasses, at least for me, are more than enough. Since I shoot with artificial light, it limits the need for a very wide aperture or a lot of creamy bokeh. I do have an 85mm 1.8, but knowing that the L glass produces better sharpness, it gets less use than the trio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are two portrait examples shot with the glass above: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/fHPff\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/fHPff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Also, the min aperture of f/22 for those lenses is something that I&amp;#39;ve never touched as diffraction starts to degrade image quality above f/16. So I normally stick to the lenses&amp;#39; sweet spot between f/8 and f/11.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dgdklad", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469494.0, "created_utc": 1492440694.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vubk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge05fu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brocahantas", "parent_id": "t1_dgdk1vh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Personally I think zoom on an ultra wide lens (like a 16-35mm) is super important as every millimeter counts in that range.

On paper, other lenses might stack up better-- it has a maximum aperture of f/4, and there&amp;#39;s some edge softness-- but in action it is AMAZING.  It&amp;#39;s not much larger than a pancake lens, so you can take it anywhere, and you&amp;#39;re not worried that an over-large, over-heavy lens will swing around and hit things.  The lens cap screws on, so you never have to worry that it&amp;#39;ll fall off, you won&amp;#39;t notice, and you&amp;#39;ll damage the front lens element.  There&amp;#39;s a pull-out lens hood.  Distortion is minimal, and flare resistance is AMAZING.  Point it straight into the sun; that lens doesn&amp;#39;t care.  On the extremely rare occasions where you do see flare, I can shade the lens with my hand.  No more flare!
