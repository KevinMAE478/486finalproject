But now on a canon system, I&amp;#39;m using mostly a 5Dm3 with a 24-105 f/4. It&amp;#39;s just such a good all around lens and prevents me on most occasions from having to lug around 2 bodies and lenses. Many PJs I know still have two/two but others use lens belts and one body, or a DSLR body and a mirrorless to cut weight but stay versatile &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For sports (depends on the sport), I mostly use a 400m f/4 on the 5d3 or the 70-200. I also have a 7D body that I only use when I need two lenses on two bodies. The 5D3 is just much better quality; I find the colors on the 7D washed out. I also that I have a 16-35 that I&amp;#39;ll use when I need a wider aperture or know I&amp;#39;ll be shooting a large group or an interior or something that requires it. I keep all of this in my car at all times in case the situation changes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dg55rht", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984450.0, "created_utc": 1491955650.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4saah", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DashSatan", "parent_id": "t1_dg4qm6w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for all the info, I really appreciate it!\n\nCurious, what's your main camera/lens you use for shooting for work?
