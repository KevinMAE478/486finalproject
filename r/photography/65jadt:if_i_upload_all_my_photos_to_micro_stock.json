The key is understanding what sells, and being able to deliver it. It seems to me many photographers don't understand what good stock is. Making good stock is not a hobby, it's a job, and requires the same dedication, time, and professionalism as any photo job.\n\nYou won't be successful by walking around your town taking photos of random things you enjoy photographing. Things like sunsets, flowers, electric power lines, ducks, squirrels, crumbling buildings and old cars. The kind of things that most amateurs photograph ... these do not sell at all. Don't even bother wasting your time.\n\nAlso, the cliched stuff that many amateurs seem to imagine when they think of stock -- people dressed in business clothes shaking hands, or a businessman using a laptop on top of a mountain or women eating salad -- that stuff is in oversupply, and guess what: nobody really buys that.\n\nGood stock will convey a concept or tell a story. It can be a simple concept; a holiday cookie illustrates the holiday. A scale on a white background illustrates the concept of \"balance\". A piggy bank illustrates thrift. These aren't things you're shooting for pleasure, you're shooting them to illustrate a story or layout. Simple can sell, but then again, realize that anybody can do a simple object on a white background; you will wind up competing with a sea of piggy banks on any stock site. The more sophisticated and elaborate you can be, the better your competitive advantage.\n\nIf you want to really succeed with stock -- and a lot of amateur photographers don't seem to understand this -- shoot called *lifestyle*. Photos with *people* doing things that people do, without distractions, and with superb technical execution. Everything in the frame should contribute to the story. Having access to a good location helps tremendously.\n\nExamples: A group of friends having a cookout. An old person buying medicine from a pharmacy. A group of kids getting on a schoolbus. This is the kind of work that buyers want. It requires hiring models, and getting signed releases from them. It requires scouting realistic locations. It requires top-notch technical skills in terms of composition, sharpness and lighting. And above all, it requires telling a story in a single frame.\n\nFor a good example, I point people to several photographers who I know are very successful with lifestyle (more successful than me!):\n\n* [Sean Locke](http://www.seanlockephotography.com/)\n* [Lise Gagne](http://www.lisegagne.com/)\n* [Sharon Dominick](http://www.sharondominickphotography.com/)\n\nAlso, good stock shooter will be aware of trends; when \"evil clowns\" were in the news in the US, guess what Sharon held a shoot of; [you guessed it](http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/creepy-clowns-hiding-in-woods-gm613667534-105957955?st=94eb446). This took booking costumes, models, and coming up with scenarios. It was creative, yet not too elaborate or expensive. And guess what, [news articles used her images](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/10/clowns-are-scary-because-people-cant-handle-uncertainty.html).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my standard post about stock photography:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few threads here on stock images; here&amp;#39;s my standard reply:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do think you can be successful selling stock, even in today&amp;#39;s very saturated marketplace. The key is understanding what sells, and being able to deliver it. It seems to me many photographers don&amp;#39;t understand what good stock is. Making good stock is not a hobby, it&amp;#39;s a job, and requires the same dedication, time, and professionalism as any photo job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t be successful by walking around your town taking photos of random things you enjoy photographing. Things like sunsets, flowers, electric power lines, ducks, squirrels, crumbling buildings and old cars. The kind of things that most amateurs photograph ... these do not sell at all. Don&amp;#39;t even bother wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the cliched stuff that many amateurs seem to imagine when they think of stock -- people dressed in business clothes shaking hands, or a businessman using a laptop on top of a mountain or women eating salad -- that stuff is in oversupply, and guess what: nobody really buys that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good stock will convey a concept or tell a story. It can be a simple concept; a holiday cookie illustrates the holiday. A scale on a white background illustrates the concept of &amp;quot;balance&amp;quot;. A piggy bank illustrates thrift. These aren&amp;#39;t things you&amp;#39;re shooting for pleasure, you&amp;#39;re shooting them to illustrate a story or layout. Simple can sell, but then again, realize that anybody can do a simple object on a white background; you will wind up competing with a sea of piggy banks on any stock site. The more sophisticated and elaborate you can be, the better your competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to really succeed with stock -- and a lot of amateur photographers don&amp;#39;t seem to understand this -- shoot called &lt;em&gt;lifestyle&lt;/em&gt;. Photos with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; doing things that people do, without distractions, and with superb technical execution. Everything in the frame should contribute to the story. Having access to a good location helps tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Examples: A group of friends having a cookout. An old person buying medicine from a pharmacy. A group of kids getting on a schoolbus. This is the kind of work that buyers want. It requires hiring models, and getting signed releases from them. It requires scouting realistic locations. It requires top-notch technical skills in terms of composition, sharpness and lighting. And above all, it requires telling a story in a single frame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a good example, I point people to several photographers who I know are very successful with lifestyle (more successful than me!):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.seanlockephotography.com/\"&gt;Sean Locke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.lisegagne.com/\"&gt;Lise Gagne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sharondominickphotography.com/\"&gt;Sharon Dominick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, good stock shooter will be aware of trends; when &amp;quot;evil clowns&amp;quot; were in the news in the US, guess what Sharon held a shoot of; &lt;a href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/creepy-clowns-hiding-in-woods-gm613667534-105957955?st=94eb446\"&gt;you guessed it&lt;/a&gt;.
