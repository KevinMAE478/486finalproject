I have also set up a synology nas in tandem with carbon copy cloner that will automatically copy anything in the pending jobs folder to the synology, the synology will automatically upload all the raws to an amazon cloud drive accounts. This is essential the cold storage as it is unlimited space to archive out all our original files. We create something like 16-24 tbs of raws per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once a job is edited and processed they go on to a server that managed by managed service provider. This is a bit of topic of contention at my job as that server wasn&amp;#39;t designed for large file transfers and constant read writes so it slows down significantly when one or two people write or read from the same shares. But it does work and it as also replicated via veeam offsite as well. We only keep 3 years worth of finished jobs on our server, after 3 years they will get migrated to an external drive and also get uploaded to the same amazon cloud drive mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I happen to enjoy the DAM side of my job. If you want help coming up with a smaller scale version, I&amp;#39;m more then happy to help &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dgbzf13", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492375049.0, "created_utc": 1492346249.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nu7m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbt403", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rainio", "parent_id": "t3_65nu7m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 1, "body": "These questions have been asked numerous times.
