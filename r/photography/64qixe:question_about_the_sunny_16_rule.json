If you want to be better with using color. You take a painting class. If you want to be better at using light, you take a black and white film class. You can try to learn everything yourself, but the traditional teaching techniques have a lot of merit to them. They help teach fundamentals through process. If he just takes everyones advice here he skips the process. /end rant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dg4zkst", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976317.0, "created_utc": 1491947517.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4xh7x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lorenzojc", "parent_id": "t1_dg4tktn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think you're mixing up technical skills and creativity.\n\nI know *what* result I want in my photograph, that's the creative part.\n\nA modern camera just makes the technique (*how* to achieve that result, e.g. auto exposure and focus) much easier.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re mixing up technical skills and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; result I want in my photograph, that&amp;#39;s the creative part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A modern camera just makes the technique (&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to achieve that result, e.g. auto exposure and focus) much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dg4xh7x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973789.0, "created_utc": 1491944989.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4tktn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "franzandrei", "parent_id": "t1_dg4pel8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Getting a correct exposure does not mean you know how to use light.\n\nIt just means you are getting a correct exposure.\n\nUsing light in photos is a skill itself.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a correct exposure does not mean you know how to use light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just means you are getting a correct exposure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using light in photos is a skill itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dg4tktn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969387.0, "created_utc": 1491940587.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4pel8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "unsuscribe", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lvzp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "dude, its 2017 we have real time histograms in cameras", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;dude, its 2017 we have real time histograms in cameras&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dg4pel8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491964937.0, "created_utc": 1491936137.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4lvzp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "franzandrei", "parent_id": "t3_64qixe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Everyone here is giving you crap advice.\n\nPeople keep telling you to use your meter, use aperture priority, blah blah blah.
