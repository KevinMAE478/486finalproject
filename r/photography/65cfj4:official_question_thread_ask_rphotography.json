I plan to buy lenses and accesories as I go. I would prefer new but don't mind second hand if necessary to get something better for the money.\n\n**Purpose**\nI will be using the camera for videos only, I make videos of myself tricking which is like martial arts mixed with gymnastics, I also make Vlogs and plan to make acrobatic tutorials with the camera I buy. I need something that can keep a reasonably fast moving object (me!) in focus. In winter I will be training mostly inside in a gymnastics gym (not sure whether this is considered low light) and in the summer I will be mostly training outside in the sunshine! I will be filming using either a tripod or someone will be filming for me by moving alongside me as I do my moves. They are unlikely to have much camera knowledge and I will probably get a steadicam or gimbal for them to move with. The most similar sport I can think of is skateboarding so good cameras for that will likely serve my purpose also. Here is a link to one of my videos (currently using a canon legria camcorder, first clips in this video were not with my camera) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VSsrugVlfY\n\nI would like a fully articulating screen for Vlogs but it is not an absolute necessity. The camera must be able to shoot at least 100fps for smooth slow motion and 4k would also be a big bonus, I normally render in 1080p but would like to be able to crop and retain that resolution, I don't want to have to carry an external recorder around to be able to shoot in 4k so need a camera that can do it internally. I will be travelling with the camera from time to time so a mirrorless seems like a good choice.\n\n**Lenses and accessories**\nI think a wide lense could make the tricks and kicks look bigger and more exaggerated which is good to a certain extent so please recommend some lenses also. Bear in mind that someone may be following me with a camera and I can go wildly off course if things go wrong so I need a lens that can capture what I want without the camera being too close to me. I will likely use a rode mic for tutorials so will need a camera with a mic socket.\n\n**Editing**\nI currently edit in sony vegas but may switch to adobe premier, I am also planing on getting a new PC to be able to quickly handle 4k footage. I understand that mp4 is the best format for youtube so I assume a camera filming in that format already would give the best quality, if that is correct then something that can hit the specs I need in mp4 format would be a good start.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSo far I have been looking at the sony a6300/6500, and panasonic GH4. I hear the sony a7s ii is also good but may be a little out of my budget unless I go second hand. The more money I save on the camera the faster I can start gathering accessories but am in no rush if it's worth saving more for a better body.

So my Nikon D7100 had a tragic end to its life (not my fault) and as a result I need a new body. Currently heavily invested into the Nikon ecosystem (4 rather expensive lenses).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest I&amp;#39;ve been using my Sony RX100 in the mean time and it&amp;#39;s been okay but there are times when I do miss my DSLR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;m impressed by the Nikon D500, I just don&amp;#39;t feel that enthused to buy a camera body. Also was thinking of selling all my kit (lenses) and just going mirrorless or just getting a smaller camera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use my DSLR lately mainly for personal reasons with the odd / annual fashion week or real actual need for an DSLR in terms of fast shutter, high ISO, dynamic range, sensor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "photography", "name": "t1_dgc6gjf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492386765.0, "created_utc": 1492357965.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfj4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfj4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfj4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfj4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdu4st", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lime1993", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfng1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/photography", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I found the same thing, that a used Tamron is not actually cheaper where I live.
