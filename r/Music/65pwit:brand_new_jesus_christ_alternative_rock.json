The lyrics on this album are second to none, you just have to read/listen because the songs speak for themselves literally.

They incorporate it in a way that humanizes the root of religion, which is this struggle of good versus evil, which is just my opinion. And to learn about the other various stories, both literary and real, behind some of these songs are fascinating. \n\nI think this album is deep in a way that isn't alienating of the listener, it is entirely relatable. Also, I have a mental illness that a lot of these lyrics speak to. This album makes me feel like my inner workings and shit aren't unique to just me, and so I feel less alone, more understood, and my feelings about myself and the world are sometimes justified.
