Great conceptual records.  \n\n\nGood Kid Maad City is like a cinematic experience, throughout the album he tells the story of his adolescence and one particular night which changed his life forever. \n\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly (my personal fav) was a departure from his usual sound and it features more jazzy/funky production and it is a very political album and it also details his struggles as an artist in an industry and world which is trying to metaphorically pimp him and exploit the beauty within him.  It's tied together with this awesome spoken word poem that he gets further into before each song, and every new line of the poem that he reveals is the subject of the subsequent song, which was a super creative touch imo.  My favorite album of all time.  \n\n\nAs far as other hip hop, Kanye West's albums are amazing.  He's generally lauded as one of the greatest, most interesting, and most innovative artists of Hip Hop and music in general tbh.  If you can look past some of his PR issues, his music and artistry is fantastic.  He reinvents his entire sound and basically the sound of the genre every album.  Albums such as: The College Dropout (classic hip hop) or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy(his opus, super amazing conceptual album) or even Yeezus (industrial experimental minimalist album) are some of my favorites.  You can't go wrong with his discog though.  Possibly the deepest, most consistent, greatest discog of any hip hop artist.  Tbh if anybody surpasses it I think it will be Kendrick lol.  \n\n\nCheck out Atrocity Exhibition by Danny Brown, he's a super wacky, rock influenced rapper, and although his music is a bit of an acquired taste, since you enjoy metal, it may be easier for you to get into him, because you're probably accustomed to abrasive sounding music. (Sorry if that's an ignorant statement about metal, I don't know much about the genre tbh.)\n\n\nDeath Grips is also a group that might do it for you.  Experimental, industrial sound.  \n\n\nHead on over to /r/hiphopheads for other suggestions :). Lots of information and discussion (and shitposting lol).\n\n\nHip Hop is an amazing genre and I truly hope you find other albums and artists within the genre that you enjoy.  Trust me you're in store for some amazing stuff.  I wish I could listen to my favorite albums for the first time haha.\n\n\n**Edit:** I compiled a list of some of my favorite and IMO most essential hip hop albums.  Anyone from this sub can message me if they want more info or suggestions.  I love hip hop and introducing more people to the genre would be an honour.  Fellow hip hop heads can add to this list.  \n\n\n**Some modern classics you can listen to are:**\n\n\n- Summertime 06 by Vince Staples\n- Pinata by Freddie Gibbs and Madlib\n- I Don't Like Shit I Don't Go Outside by Earl Sweatshirt\n- Tetsuo &amp;  Youth by Lupe Fiasco\n- Run The Jewels 1, 2, and 3 by Run the Jewels\n- Section .80 by Kendrick Lamar,  \n- Acid Rap by Chance the Rapper\n- XXX by Danny Brown\n- If You're Reading This It's Too Late by Drake\n- 1999 by Joey Bada$$\n- We Got It From Here...

Great conceptual records.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good Kid Maad City is like a cinematic experience, throughout the album he tells the story of his adolescence and one particular night which changed his life forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly (my personal fav) was a departure from his usual sound and it features more jazzy/funky production and it is a very political album and it also details his struggles as an artist in an industry and world which is trying to metaphorically pimp him and exploit the beauty within him.  It&amp;#39;s tied together with this awesome spoken word poem that he gets further into before each song, and every new line of the poem that he reveals is the subject of the subsequent song, which was a super creative touch imo.  My favorite album of all time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as other hip hop, Kanye West&amp;#39;s albums are amazing.  He&amp;#39;s generally lauded as one of the greatest, most interesting, and most innovative artists of Hip Hop and music in general tbh.  If you can look past some of his PR issues, his music and artistry is fantastic.  He reinvents his entire sound and basically the sound of the genre every album.  Albums such as: The College Dropout (classic hip hop) or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy(his opus, super amazing conceptual album) or even Yeezus (industrial experimental minimalist album) are some of my favorites.  You can&amp;#39;t go wrong with his discog though.  Possibly the deepest, most consistent, greatest discog of any hip hop artist.  Tbh if anybody surpasses it I think it will be Kendrick lol.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out Atrocity Exhibition by Danny Brown, he&amp;#39;s a super wacky, rock influenced rapper, and although his music is a bit of an acquired taste, since you enjoy metal, it may be easier for you to get into him, because you&amp;#39;re probably accustomed to abrasive sounding music. (Sorry if that&amp;#39;s an ignorant statement about metal, I don&amp;#39;t know much about the genre tbh.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Death Grips is also a group that might do it for you.  Experimental, industrial sound.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Head on over to &lt;a href=\"/r/hiphopheads\"&gt;/r/hiphopheads&lt;/a&gt; for other suggestions :). Lots of information and discussion (and shitposting lol).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hip Hop is an amazing genre and I truly hope you find other albums and artists within the genre that you enjoy.  Trust me you&amp;#39;re in store for some amazing stuff.  I wish I could listen to my favorite albums for the first time haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I compiled a list of some of my favorite and IMO most essential hip hop albums.  Anyone from this sub can message me if they want more info or suggestions.  I love hip hop and introducing more people to the genre would be an honour.
