His guitar sang, it pushed musical boundaries, and it rocked.\nHis brilliant approach to harmony is completely original, beautiful and spellbinding. His technique and improvisational skills make him a true guitar god, the jaw dropping kind, and the kind that influences many a player in all styles of music.\nOn the issue of legato playing, he is the king, and anyone interested in going down that path has to hear what Allan has accomplished.\nTo witness him playing with Tony Williams\u2019 band, a Gibson SG around his neck, Small Stone Phaser and Marshall stack in tow, at the intimate club My Father\u2019s Place in Roslyn, NY, was something I\u2019ll never forget. He ripped a hole in the guitarist\u2019s-space-time-continuum that night! And we\u2019ve never been the same.\" \u2014Joe Satriani\n\n\n\u201cAllan plays legato parts like a violinist. His right hand might as well be a bow, because his left hand is like Paganini\u2019s. You can call his playing whatever you want to, but it will still fry your brain if you try to figure it out. John McLaughlin, Michael Stern, John Scofield\u2014all of us just scratch our heads and go, \u2018Damn!\u2019\u201d \u2014Carlos Santana\n\n\u201cAllan wanted to sound like John Coltrane. Problem was he\u2019s playing guitar, not saxophone, so he had to figure out a way to get a similar \u2018sheets of sound\u2019 equivalent on guitar. The scales and intervals he chose were also all unusual, and he didn\u2019t become just one of the great scalar improvisers overnight. He worked like a dog on Nicolas Slonimsky\u2019s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns. Then, when he\u2019d run out of notes he\u2019d reach for the whammy bar and send shivers down your spine.\u201d \u2014Bill Bruford\n\n\n\u201cAllan really changed guitar playing. The legato techniques and \u2018sheets-of-sound\u2019 approach influenced not only jazz guitarists, but also a whole generation of metal players. And aside from all the technical stuff, he\u2019s a master jazz guitarist. Check out his version of \u2018How Deep Is the Ocean.\u2019\u201d \u2014John Scofield\n\n\n\u201cI put Holdsworth up there with Paganini and Liszt. Terrifying.\u201d \u2014David Lindley\n\n\u201cAllan has the touch. Maybe it\u2019s those extra- long fingers of his. No one can listen to him without being affected by his tone and fluidity. A superb player who is a joy to hear.\u201d\n\u2014Adrian Belew\n\n\n\n\u201cHoldsworth is so damned good that I can\u2019t cop anything. I can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve got to do this [does two-hand tapping], whereas he\u2019ll do it with one hand.\u201d \u2014Eddie Van Halen\n\n\n\u201cAllan\u2019s beautiful and unique chord voicings have always had an impact on me. His approach to guitar is one of a kind. He pushes the limits of the boundaries of electric guitar, and his lead phrasing would make Charlie Parker smile. His playing is essential listening for any guitarist, of any style, so they can see that the only limits we have are the ones we put on ourselves.\u201d \u2014Eric Johnson\n\n\"When I listen to a guitar player I listen for different things. The first is just the level of stimulation I get as a lover of the instrument and the way it sounds to my ears and soul. I first take it in emotionally. The intention of the player, their dynamics and articulation etc, are usually the things that make up the piece\u2019s emotional impact. But there is a side of me that enjoys analyzing the performance on different levels too. My ears can identify tone colors, shapes, chord structures, fingerings etc. I can immediately see in my mind\u2019s eye what virtually every guitarist I have ever heard is doing and how they are doing it on the instrument, even though much of the time it falls outside of my own ability to stylize. Besides being emotionally swept away by Allan\u2019s use of melodic color, most of the time I am utterly stunned and confused as to how he is playing what I am hearing. His chops and inner ear completely defy my own inner musical eye and reasoning and I\u2019m left in a blissful state of humility and surrender.\u201d \u2014Steve Vai", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hearing Allan\u2019s guitar playing for the first time was a cathartic experience for me. His guitar sang, it pushed musical boundaries, and it rocked.\nHis brilliant approach to harmony is completely original, beautiful and spellbinding. His technique and improvisational skills make him a true guitar god, the jaw dropping kind, and the kind that influences many a player in all styles of music.\nOn the issue of legato playing, he is the king, and anyone interested in going down that path has to hear what Allan has accomplished.\nTo witness him playing with Tony Williams\u2019 band, a Gibson SG around his neck, Small Stone Phaser and Marshall stack in tow, at the intimate club My Father\u2019s Place in Roslyn, NY, was something I\u2019ll never forget. He ripped a hole in the guitarist\u2019s-space-time-continuum that night! And we\u2019ve never been the same.&amp;quot; \u2014Joe Satriani&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAllan plays legato parts like a violinist. His right hand might as well be a bow, because his left hand is like Paganini\u2019s. You can call his playing whatever you want to, but it will still fry your brain if you try to figure it out. John McLaughlin, Michael Stern, John Scofield\u2014all of us just scratch our heads and go, \u2018Damn!\u2019\u201d \u2014Carlos Santana&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAllan wanted to sound like John Coltrane. Problem was he\u2019s playing guitar, not saxophone, so he had to figure out a way to get a similar \u2018sheets of sound\u2019 equivalent on guitar. The scales and intervals he chose were also all unusual, and he didn\u2019t become just one of the great scalar improvisers overnight. He worked like a dog on Nicolas Slonimsky\u2019s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns. Then, when he\u2019d run out of notes he\u2019d reach for the whammy bar and send shivers down your spine.\u201d \u2014Bill Bruford&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAllan really changed guitar playing. The legato techniques and \u2018sheets-of-sound\u2019 approach influenced not only jazz guitarists, but also a whole generation of metal players. And aside from all the technical stuff, he\u2019s a master jazz guitarist. Check out his version of \u2018How Deep Is the Ocean.\u2019\u201d \u2014John Scofield&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI put Holdsworth up there with Paganini and Liszt. Terrifying.\u201d \u2014David Lindley&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAllan has the touch. Maybe it\u2019s those extra- long fingers of his. No one can listen to him without being affected by his tone and fluidity. A superb player who is a joy to hear.\u201d\n\u2014Adrian Belew&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoldsworth is so damned good that I can\u2019t cop anything. I can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve got to do this [does two-hand tapping], whereas he\u2019ll do it with one hand.\u201d \u2014Eddie Van Halen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAllan\u2019s beautiful and unique chord voicings have always had an impact on me.
