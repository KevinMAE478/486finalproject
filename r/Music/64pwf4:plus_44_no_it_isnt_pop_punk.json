In both songs lines such as \"Your cry for inspiration won't be heard on distant stars\" or \"you swore you wouldn't lose then lost your brain, you make a sound that feels like pain\" can be seen to be related to Angels and Airwaves, DeLonges new project. \n\n&gt; In several interviews Hoppus has claimed Tom quit the band through his agent and didn't even bother to call Hoppus or Barker.\n\n&gt; While shooting the video for the first Single \"When your Heart stops beating\" Travis Barker broke his arm. Not noticing it was broken he played an entire European tour with the arm broken.\n\n&gt; In an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, Hoppus was asked if +44 will continue again, where he stated \"I think so, yes.
