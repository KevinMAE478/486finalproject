Other than being a great bassist, he also is known for having a rather gravely singing voice, and I didn't know much about his personality, so I was a bit timid about approaching him. My fiancee led the way, broke the ice, and introduced me to Matt. I was of course starstruck, but he was the sweetest, nicest guy in the world. He signed my record, joking about how it was yellowed since it had been hanging in my room for ages. He then told me that Lars was probably out front. \n\nWe then went out front and there was Lars Frederiksen himself. I've seen Lars before walking around San Francisco, but I've never approached him before and again I was starstruck and timid. Again, my fiancee led the way, and Lars was more than happy to sign my record, and told me that Tim would be coming soon. \n\nSo my fiancee and I head towards the backyard, again passing Matt, who sees us and asks if I was able to find Lars and happily offers to help us find Tim. I didn't want to be a bother, but it was the nicest thing for him to do. \n\nAn hour or so passes, and finally Tim Armstrong shows up fashionably late. Tim is one of my heroes growing up, and I was just sweating bullets trying to find the right time to go and talk to him while he's mingling about. Finally my fiancee and I go up to him, and again he was just the greatest. He signed my record and talked to us for a bit, asking us where we're from. We tell him Oakland, and Tim's like, \"Oh yeah? I'm from that area!\" Of course in my head I'm thinking, \"I know Tim, I know everything about you, I love you\" but I didn't want to be too weird. \n\nSo the day goes on, other acts perform (No Age, acoustic X set, Fishbone), and as I head to me car to put away the record before Rancid, I again bump into Matt, who makes sure that I got all of my signatures. Sigh, now I have a crush on Matt. \n\nRancid takes the stage (patio), and plays my favorite album of all time start to finish. Greatest show of my life.
