Dupieux also directed the ad, which featured a yellow puppet named Flat Eric nodding his head to the sound of the track while riding in a pickup truck. Flat Eric later appeared in the music video for \"Flat Beat\".\n\n&gt; Dupieux released his first EP's \"#1\" and \"M-Seq\" on F Communications in 1997. After \"Flat Beat\", Oizo released his first album in 1999, Analog Worms Attack, featuring a single of the same name.\n\n&gt; In 2005, Oizo released his second album entitled Moustache (Half a Scissor).\n\n&gt; In 2006 and 2007, Oizo produced remixes for Kavinsky, Jamelia, Cassius, Scissor Sisters and, most recently, Calvin Harris.\n\n&gt; Dupieux's first feature film, Steak, was released in France on June 20th, 2007. He also made the soundtrack in cooperation with Gaspard Aug\u00e9 from Justice.\n\n&gt; In 2007, Mr. Oizo's Transexual EP was released on Ed Banger Records. The EP features a re-working of the 1979 disco track \"Do It At The Disco\" by Gary's Gang. The track appeared on Oizo's MySpace page in 2006 under the title Patrick122.\n\n&gt; In 2008 Mr. Oizo released his third album, Lambs Anger, containing solid, hard, over-compressed, in-your-face dance tracks. The Positif EP was released in November, which featured remixes from Mr. Flash and LFO (Low Frequency Oscillation) \n\n&gt; In March of 2009 Mr. Oizo released the Pourriture EP, featuring a remix of Erreur Jean by Arveene and Misk as well as some \"radical reworks\" by Oizo himself. A remix of the track \"Z\" was released as a Beatport exclusive. Also included in the download was a short film by Oizo, titled \"Making Lamb's Anger\".\n\n&gt; In November of 2011, Mr. Oizo followed up Lambs Anger with Stade 2, a new release for Ed Banger Records. Slowly releasing the album through club nights and Twitter, Stade 2 further refines the style that he displayed on Lambs Anger, providing tracks for headphones and the dance floor.\n\n&gt; In January of 2012 he started a music project with Boys Noize called Handbraekes.\n\n&gt; In April of 2012 Mr. Oizo released an EP called Stade 3, which is available for free on the Internet. He also directed the Stade 3 Teaser where Flat Eric is starring again.
