Younique, LuLaRoe, Origami Owl, Stella &amp; Dot, etc are considered \"MLM,\" or multi-level marketing. The difference between them and a full on pyramid scheme is that MLMs sell directly to consumers as first as well as recruitment like the pyramid scheme. This makes it slightly more stable. Although some might make profits as big as $100,000 a year from these things, it's very unlikely. The median earning is around $2,400 I think. So it could be a source of income theoretically, but not nearly as much as people think and nothing worth flipping out and quitting your job for-- because it's really not a viable source of income and there is also a high possibility of you LOOSING money, due to high numbers of sellers and increased competition. I'd say the biggest scam of it all is how they claim you can actually make a living off of this and you will get rich quick. This will only happen to like 0.01% of the people, and they have to already be well versed in sales and marketing and be seriously committed. However, it's not as unstable as a pyramid scheme because there is some selling directly to consumers involved.
