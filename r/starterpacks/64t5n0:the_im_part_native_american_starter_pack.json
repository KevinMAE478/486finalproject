A random person claiming to be Native American is not stealing away government funding from someone who is legally a registered Native American.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people, through blundering of the governments in the past, MAY have a lot of Native American blood, but don&amp;#39;t have legal status as a Native American. This happened in Canada when Native American women were stripped of their legal status when they married a non-Native man. So how is it my place to judge someone not to be Native American-appearing? Genetics is funny. They may not appear NA but may have grown up on a reserve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My SO is Native American (ie grew up on a reserve, has 100% NA ancestry). We ran into someone at a party, the host said this other guest was Native American and he was learning Anishnaabe (Ojibway, same tribe as my SO) and that we should have stuff in common. The person MAYBE looked half, 1/4 Native American but definitely not full, and he wore a 4 colours medicine wheel necklace. I have never seen a full blooded NA person wearing anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My SO&amp;#39;s reaction: pretty much nothing.
