Enone has 2 electrons in pi and 0 electrons in in pi*\n2. UV excites an electron into pi* and its now a singlet.\n3. Intersystem crossing (nonradiative) occurs to form a triplet. \n1. **Triplet interacts with ground state of the alkene, so that two radicals form a c-c bond and two radicals form a triplet diradical.** \n5. Intersystem crossing (nonradiative) to form a singlet diradical which then forms the other c-c bond.  \n\nCan someone explain how step 4 occurs? Specifically:\n\n1. How does a triplet interact with the ground state of the alkene - Are they close enough in energy to interact? \n3. How does the radical form in the alkene, wouldn't some energy be needed first?\n4. Does the new homo of the enone donate into the pi* of the alkene to destabilize the c=c bond and that's how the radicals in the alkene form?\n\nPretty confused with what's going on.
