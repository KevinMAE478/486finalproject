That's why you make a chili oil (and not chili water) and you drink milk if you eat too spicy instead of water, since the milk has a lot of fat in it and can dissolve the capsaicin and wash it away.\n\nMy best guess is that the mild salsa wasn't very fatty but there were parts of chili in there. If the capsaicin is still in the chili and not dissolved then you cannot taste it.
