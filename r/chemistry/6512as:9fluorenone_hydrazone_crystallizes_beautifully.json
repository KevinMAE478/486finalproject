I just laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "chemistry", "name": "t1_dg83h80", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141138.0, "created_utc": 1492112338.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhf9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6512as", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhf9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6512as", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg82il2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "negrocucklord", "parent_id": "t1_dg8132y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/chemistry", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I took it out immediately after I stopped reflux, using my magnetic \"fishing rod\" (a magnet on a stick).
