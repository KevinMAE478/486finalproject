It also teaches the harsh reality of forgetting to tare your weigh boat at the start of the lab, which is probably one of the most frequent mistakes I see in this lab. I also constantly remind people that the blue or black solutions they are forgetting to transfer to the next reaction container is their copper, enforcing the importance of quantitative transfer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as educational, it offers a bit more than the two already mentioned. You get a bunch of practice describing different solutions and products, is the product soluble or insoluble, which is the filtrate and precipitate, is it colorless or transparent or both (people seem to struggle with this), etc. The student also gets to use a buchner funnel, for the first time in our lab.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "chemistry", "name": "t1_dg8munn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492165982.0, "created_utc": 1492137182.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ln8x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "day_kid_older_sister", "parent_id": "t1_dg8c5cd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/chemistry", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What amounts are you using?
