Like you, I also contemplated the idea of leaving with my masters during the third year. I was tired of feeling like working 55-60 hours wasn't good enough or was just barely cutting it. I was tired of feeling like a failure every single day, so I never felt motivated to get work done. The research wasn't that interesting to me, I barely did anything outside of the department, and I just wanted to feel like I could actually live comfortably on what I made.\n\nOver time, I've realized that a good chunk of the reason that I rarely had motivation to work was because I was severely depressed. I had lost almost any shred of confidence in myself as a chemist and as a human being. I dreaded going to work every day because I felt like I knew I was going to fuck things up, and people were just going to get mad at me for not running more reactions, or checking into X, Y, and Z, or not knowing about a certain paper or idea.\n\nThe two things that have helped me stick with grad school have been the following: seeing a counselor fairly consistently, and switching research groups. Seeing a counselor was critical for me as it forced me to address a lot of inherent self-loathing that I had built up and was, honestly, unaware of. It has taken a lot of time and effort (I've been consistently seeing a counselor for over a year straight now), but I'm in a way better spot mentally now. I'm confident in my ability to publish good chemistry and push research forward on my own, and it has helped significantly with my enjoyment of lab work (even though I'm still not super crazy about it). I don't always feel that way, but I would definitely say I do a lot of the time.\n\nThe other thing I did was switch lab groups, as I mentioned. Looking back on things, the group was not a good fit for me. While I thought the people were ok, the specific projects I worked on didn't really excite me and I never clicked with my boss (partially because he could never tell how I felt or what I thought). I was initially scared to switch groups because I kept telling myself that doing so would be burning a bridge, would be a step down in terms of the prestige of lab I'd be leaving, and that things would surely turn a corner soon if I just stuck things out. I eventually had to trust my gut though, and switched into a different group in a field that I had little to no knowledge of (went from organic catalysis to gold nanoclusters). My main reasoning is that if I was leaving with my masters, why not just try out another group? If I found out that I still didn't like things 6-12 months after switching, I could still leave with my masters and I wouldn't be out much. I'm fortunate enough that second group I joined is a better fit for me overall. I was able to eventually figure out a project that I'm actually somewhat excited about (though I'm still not ecstatic with it tbh), my boss is a MUCH better fit for me and is willing to help with some of the mental health issue I have atm, and the atmosphere is much more conducive to feeling like I can try and fail at things.\n\nBasically, it's ok to not know if you want to stay. Hell, I still wonder if I want to stay at times, and I'm getting close to the point where graduation is looming on the near-ish horizon and I need to start applying for jobs. From what I can tell, there are a LOT of people that wonder if this is the right path for them that end up sticking with it in the long run. Doesn't mean you have to stick with doing bench chemistry either (try looking into alternative PhD careers for instance). What I would say though is try to utilize some of the resources available to you right now before making the plunge to leave with the masters. If you think seeing a counselor for a little while might help you to enjoy the work more by improving your mindset, then give it a shot for a couple of months. If you don't like a lot of stuff about the group you're working with (co-workers, boss, research, etc.), see if you can switch to another group for several months. If you hate how much you're having to work and want to do stuff outside of grad school, talk to your boss and see if they're willing to let you just work 40 hours/week or less in exchange for being a TA or some other compromise. In these scenarios, probably the worst outcome will be that you find out it doesn't work for you and you leave with your masters, which is what your alternative option is in the first place. But by going this route, you at least tried to make things work, and you can have more certainty that you're making the right decision for yourself.\n\nAnyways, those are my thoughts. If you need to talk anything over, let me know. I'm here for you. I've probably been through some similar shit, and might be able help parse through things.\n\nEdit: Damn, I wasn't expecting any kind of response to this, but apparently this seemed to resonate with people.
