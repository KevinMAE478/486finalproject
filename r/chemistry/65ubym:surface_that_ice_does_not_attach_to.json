Though as others have pointed out, the usual resistance to ice releasing from containers is pressure from lateral expansion, not actual adhesion. You can mitigate this by using a shallow container. This encourages the ice to expand mainly vertically as it forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "chemistry", "name": "t1_dgdpen7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475134.0, "created_utc": 1492446334.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhf9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubym", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdo8cq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brokenearth03", "parent_id": "t3_65ubym", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/chemistry", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just heat the outside surface of the container when its time to remove the ice?
