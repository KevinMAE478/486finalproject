I see papers on depositing dissolved Pt and Pd ions onto magnetite particles and then separate magnetically, or impregnate into SiO2 or TiO2, but my method needs preservation of organic ligands after the nanoparticles are formed and most of these involve heat treatments. I&amp;#39;ve seen papers where nanoparticles are immobilized in a dendrimer matrix for aqueous hydrogenations.
