I can see why people wouldn&amp;#39;t be motivated to provide 5-star service in that kind of gig.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ScottishPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dg5a50o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491990151.0, "created_utc": 1491961351.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg55zvz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RMelaragni", "parent_id": "t1_dg50v5l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ScottishPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": " You're in the service industry...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in the service industry...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ScottishPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dg55zvz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984748.0, "created_utc": 1491955948.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg50v5l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PokeyBumBoy", "parent_id": "t3_64ruh3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ScottishPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a waiter, I can honestly say that we wait until your mouth is full.
