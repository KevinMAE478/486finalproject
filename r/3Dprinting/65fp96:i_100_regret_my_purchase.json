Depending on the material I may also use a combination of tape, hairspray, and/or heated bed to assist. To start, I&amp;#39;d find one of those bed-level-assist files off thingiverse or make one yourself- the more print area the better as it will give you more time to move things around and observe the results. Start the print, then adjust the bed level while the machine is actively printing, keep going until you see the adhesion and squish that you want, then end the print, clean the bed, and re-start it to check that it&amp;#39;s level all the way across. Once that&amp;#39;s done, stop fiddling with the bed level except when things start getting out of whack, maybe keeping an eye on your first layer on prints and making tiny adjustments if it looks to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "3Dprinting", "name": "t1_dgahklu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492277142.0, "created_utc": 1492248342.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahfzv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FriendKiller96", "parent_id": "t1_dgah6lm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/3Dprinting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I honestly don't see how a new head is going to make the print stick to the bed.\nThe method I was using was working and then suddenly stopped for no apparent reason.
