The lowest price I saw it listed at was $33. I ordered two of them for something like $86 total with shipping. It didn't look like a legit item for sale, but Wish is pretty good with refunding if such a thing occurs. \n\nI think we can all agree that $33 for even a small 3D printer is far below even the cost of materials. Factor in the extruder, casing, rods and electronics I'm not sure many would be able to even build it on the cheap even as a clone for that going price. \n\n**Observations during the last 48 hours:**\n\n* It looks like that Wish product had sold over 5,000 units from what I remember. \n\n* Many who did buy practically know it's all too good to be true, but know that Wish is reputable in that refunds are issued when something sketchy happens.\n\n* Here is the merchant in question: [SOVTE](https://www.wish.com/m/merchant/sovte). This is the account used to sell the Createbot.\n\n* The company that actually makes the Createbot brand has come out to say they have no connection with the sale, and has even considered legal action against Wish (probably why the next bullet point happened). \n\n* Since the makers of Createbot has stated the sale of their products was not licensed by them, IF something were to ship would be a clone. I think the people over at Createbot would notice a huge bulk order of 5000 units IF it were legit. \n\n* Sometime last night (4/17/17) the listing for the Createbox was removed. You get a 404 Not Found message when viewing. This isn't the norm as items that are sold out still pop up when you visit the pages. Wish users can check this on any recent order status that has since been sold out. \n\n* My own order hasn't been canceled or refunded by Wish... yet. I haven't seen anyone as of now that has had their order canceled or refunded. \n\n**Claims of shipping:**\n\nA lot of buyers are pointing to the order status moving to either \"shipping\" or being \"shipped\" as means of hope something is on the way.

The lowest price I saw it listed at was $33. I ordered two of them for something like $86 total with shipping. It didn&amp;#39;t look like a legit item for sale, but Wish is pretty good with refunding if such a thing occurs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we can all agree that $33 for even a small 3D printer is far below even the cost of materials. Factor in the extruder, casing, rods and electronics I&amp;#39;m not sure many would be able to even build it on the cheap even as a clone for that going price. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations during the last 48 hours:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like that Wish product had sold over 5,000 units from what I remember. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many who did buy practically know it&amp;#39;s all too good to be true, but know that Wish is reputable in that refunds are issued when something sketchy happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the merchant in question: &lt;a href=\"https://www.wish.com/m/merchant/sovte\"&gt;SOVTE&lt;/a&gt;. This is the account used to sell the Createbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company that actually makes the Createbot brand has come out to say they have no connection with the sale, and has even considered legal action against Wish (probably why the next bullet point happened). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the makers of Createbot has stated the sale of their products was not licensed by them, IF something were to ship would be a clone. I think the people over at Createbot would notice a huge bulk order of 5000 units IF it were legit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime last night (4/17/17) the listing for the Createbox was removed. You get a 404 Not Found message when viewing. This isn&amp;#39;t the norm as items that are sold out still pop up when you visit the pages.
