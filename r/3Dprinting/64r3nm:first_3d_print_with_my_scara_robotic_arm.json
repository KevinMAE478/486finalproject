So after thinking some more about 3D printing a house, then shipping containers, then learning about insulating shipping containers using polyurethane closed cell spray foam and then learning about mobile homes and then about how boats are build spraying fiber glass on the same kind of foam (because why not have an mobile or floating home?! ;)\n\nSo printing with spray foam could be an alternative approach to 3D printing houses. This PU foam is great because it has incredibly high insulation, stops water / vapor, adds structural integrity in itself, increases stiffness for composite sandwich building in boats. And you basically have to have insulation anyways no matter what building method you use. So apparently you can build almost any boat by shaping the form out of malleable foam blocks, cutting and sanding them into the right shape and then laminating it. Painting the foam it with subsequent layers of epoxy primer, chopped fiberglass, fiberglass mats and cloth and using a roller to infuse the resin into the fiber glass and get the air out, then adding a gelcoat. I could imagine automating all that with a cable robot. Of course as the foam rises it's going to be a bit messy and you'll have to lightly mill / sand the hardened foam back into the right shape.\n\nNow theoretically instead of fiberglass you could also print a house using PET or PC or Nylon, just printing a thin \"shell\" and then injecting that with foam. Instead of building the core first with foam spray and then smoothing and laminating that, you would print the surface first. Of course you are still going to need a smooth surface finish and an UV and weatherproof coat of paint.\n\nSo instead of using heavy concrete, you would have reduced a house to the max - great insulation with a very thin but strong shell. Being so light they could be transported easily and even float.\n\nEDIT: Of this has been done and [patented already...](http://patents.justia.com/patent/9566742)", "edited": 1492282589.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know of any resources about spraying, sanding and polishing using robots?

So you could build larger, less rigid and cheaper 6DOF robots that can still be accurate through closed loop control (Alternatively you could use the Vive VR tracker for accurate sub millimeter tracking).\n\nBasically plaster a workshop with cameras and have different robots cooperate to build and assemble complex objects. What do you think?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow awesome project! The number of things you already done with the arm is great research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait, do you have photogrammetry integrated into the robot? You hint at that in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzCZOORP1Sw\"&gt;pick and place video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe realtime photogrammetry and the ability to accurately see the positions of parameterized 3D models will be the basis for a new revolution in robotics. It would allow robots to work in &amp;quot;messy&amp;quot; environments and for example compensate for things like droop or inaccurate positions.
