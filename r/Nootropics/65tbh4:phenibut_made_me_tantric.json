I read about its ability to improve social functions so i tried it before a party/friendly gathering. It helped me feel completely at ease about life in general. Everything just felt really upbeat and carefree. I felt like i was drunk but without the sloppy numbness of drinking. Instead i felt my mental functioning was slightly enhanced. Ideas and conversation flowed effortlessly. Relating to people felt easier than normal and talking to the people i didn&amp;#39;t know so well came with ease.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyway the main point of this post is to tell you that phenibut made me extremely horny. I would like to hear if anybody else had similar effects. I didn&amp;#39;t even plan on masturbating or feeling extremely horny for no apparent reason but i started watching a movie when i got home called  Before Midnight. This movie didn&amp;#39;t even display to me anything sensual but looking at the female actors and hearing their voices just made me have sexual thoughts for no particular reason. So i decided to pull up some porn and masturbate half way through the movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sooo uhhh this was the most intense jack off session i have ever experienced in my 23 years. When i pulled up some solo masturbation videos my jaw dropped and all i could do was sit there and breath as my heart was racing with that rush you get when you see a women naked for the first time in a long time. I almost never look at porn but the phenibut made the experience completely worth it. \nI was rock hard instantly just rushing with pleasure like id never felt before and i hadn&amp;#39;t even touched anything yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I proceeded to masturbate for atleast 3 hours straight. This shit was insane, I was full on tantric. I had complete control over my ejaculation and i could finish whenever i wanted to. I was amazed at just how fucking good everything felt. I masturbated for at least an hour having orgasm after orgasm without going over the edge. I realized i could have as many orgasms as i wanted right on the edge of cumming. I could have continued indefinitely if it wasn&amp;#39;t for my concern that i would rub my self raw. When I eventually busted it was fucking phenomenal i must have came buckets. The orgasm was felt throughout my entire body and it felt so fucking good.  I would say that words fail to describe this level of pleasure. God fucking damn. If your looking for a drug to help you last longer in bed or you just want to have a masturbation festival, take some phenibut first. I can only imagine what it would have been like if id have smoked some weed with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I took about 2 grams of phenibut i got from liftmode and if its your first time i would recommend starting the dose low and working your way up. I definitely felt like if id have dosed any higher it would have been uncomfortable. Also phenibut takes several hours to kick in so its best to wait until its in full effect before starting.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to share similar experiences feel free.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I tried phenibut for the first time last night.
