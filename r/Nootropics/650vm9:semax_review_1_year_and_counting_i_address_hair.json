I was in a terrible place in my life and I needed out. I started dosing 200-300mcg daily with breaks for two days every week. The results were amazing. My memory recall improved and so did, my happiness, fitness, etc. I remember my first day going into work on Semax and my coworkers asking why I was smiling so much and that was because of the huge change I felt. During this time I made huge strides in my social life as well, everything seemed super positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 (July - September 2016)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to continue but I started mixing other nootropics into my life at this point. I tried Phenibut, Theanine,  and Rhodiola during my break. I came back to Semax because most of the positive effects were leaving me and I wanted them back. I started dosing 600mcg-1200mcg daily. This again gave me a huge boost. This time around I started partying more often and it gave very interesting effects. I could drink tons and not feel drunk at all I would still be alert. I starting mixing Semax with Phenibut, and enter God mode. Wow! Be careful though\u2026 Anyways, it was a fun summer overall and Semax helped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3 (November 2016 - January 2017)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life started getting really really rough around this time so I thought I\u2019ll give Semax another try. I dosed 600mcg-1200mcg. One thing that I noticed is that I couldn\u2019t get upset when on Semax. This changed in this stage though and was messy. I\u2019d have huge mood swings and noticed that my hair was thinning, etc. I think overall Semax helped but it made my mood less stable because if I became very sad I\u2019d want to rebound quickly and my friends/family started noticing. The last few days of the year I decided to mix Phenibut and Semax which led to a fun time and in the new year I immediately stopped all Nootropics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened after was bizarre, my mind went completely clear but my body went on the fritz, my hair though started getting thicker and growing back and my skin got more clear and so on. My improved memory didn\u2019t go away and other benefits didn\u2019t either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4 (March - April 2017)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was feeling much better this time around without Semax but decided to give it another round which I\u2019m currently on. I dosed 1200mcg and ouch! I had an instant headache, I needed to turn all the lights off etc. The effects were amplified and felt like a 3000mcg dose. I think I started experiencing reverse tolerance! I tried 900mcg and 600mcg and both doses were still too much. I started noticing hair thinning/loss so I stopped altogether. Then my hair got better again. This next part is for all of you who are worried about this\u2026 Too much BDNF/NGF will cause hair to cycle quicker than normal. This also meant I had hair growth on my beard at faster rates. It didn\u2019t cause actual hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I\u2019m at an interesting plateau in my life. My depression is basically completely gone, my memory is improved, I can process more information at once. These are what I believe long terms effects of BDNF/NGF\u2026 but there is perhaps some limit to this where the body just says nope too much you\u2019re good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still dose 300mcg once in awhile now for an added boost which I can handle but I don\u2019t think I need Semax to perform well anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt;\nSemax changed my life, effects decreased over time but only to my benefit. When off Semax I still feel all of its benefits. Hair thinning/ loss can happen but is attributed to anything BDNF/NGF so not unique to Semax, and just requires lower dosing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S This of course, is all from my personal experience and I may be wrong but hope you enjoy the read!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Edit: In all stages I used the amidated version!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI\u2019ll divide my review into four stages:\n\n**Stage 1 (March - May 2016)**\n\nThis was my entrance into Nootropics.
