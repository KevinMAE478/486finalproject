Although therapy does not sound like a \"brain thing\", therapy does most certainly causes positive changes in the brain. Without therapy, MDMA is vastly LESS efficient in treating mental health issues, and this speaks to the pharmacology of the brain and how it changes following therapy with MDMA and without MDMA. If therapy wasn't effective or it didn't alter the experience, why would NOT having it in conjunction with MDMA, result in lesser positive changes?

However, a lack of cortisol causes depression, anxiety related to the depressive symptoms, and it makes it more difficult to learn or &amp;quot;unlearn&amp;quot; behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would argue that it&amp;#39;s something else that may be affecting your cortisol levels, but I&amp;#39;m not in a position to diagnose a stranger, lol. Here is a nice list of drugs that affect cortisol levels. &lt;a href=\"http://www.goodhormonehealth.com/articles/Drugs_and_cortisol.pdf\"&gt;http://www.goodhormonehealth.com/articles/Drugs_and_cortisol.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MDMA is known to acutely increase cortisol levels to facilitate learning, with other pharmacological effects that alleviate the negative symptoms associated with an increase in cortisol levels, but it is vastly more effective when coupled with therapy. Although therapy does not sound like a &amp;quot;brain thing&amp;quot;, therapy does most certainly causes positive changes in the brain. Without therapy, MDMA is vastly LESS efficient in treating mental health issues, and this speaks to the pharmacology of the brain and how it changes following therapy with MDMA and without MDMA. If therapy wasn&amp;#39;t effective or it didn&amp;#39;t alter the experience, why would NOT having it in conjunction with MDMA, result in lesser positive changes?
