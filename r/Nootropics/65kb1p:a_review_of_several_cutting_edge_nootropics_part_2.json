[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Nootropics", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several months have passed since my last &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5jqfwd/a_review_of_several_cutting_edge_nootropics/\"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; and I have had the chance to try some new substances, some nootropic, others not so much. I have also included a couple substances that I tried a 1-2+ years ago, but have not had the chance to review yet. Remember, these experiences are an n=1 situation, with an individual that tends to be sensitive to most substances, has ADHD-PI, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and dealt with depression for ~8 years. So, while these have been my experiences, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afobazole&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 A fascinating and complex substance. It had powerful anxiolytic effects at times, while seeming to not be effective at others. I had several panic attacks on the recommended 3x10mg dose (I was under significant stress at the time) it did normalize my sleep within the first day or two which had been out of what for several weeks. There are three things it did reliably: improve memory/recall, make me super sensitive to all GABAergics (including alcohol) and gave me a grumpy disposition, which went away about a week after stopping it. At higher doses, especially combined with longvida and polygala it was inhibiting MAO-A, which gave me negative side effects, just like Pirlindole. When I eliminated the longvida and cut down on my dosage to 2x10mg, those negative effects dissipated.  There were no withdrawals when stopping, just a slow but steady return to baseline. Appears to increase GABA sensitivity much more than Fasoracetam, which appears to be unique to Sigma agonists like &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15786959\"&gt;Afobazole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15383182\"&gt;Captodiamine&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely that other Sigma agonists would have a similar effect. Definitely worth trying out, as axiolytics that are true nootropics are quite rare. Length of trial: 1 month (supposed to be cycled).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MK-677&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Pretty relaxing stuff that significantly increased sleep quality and duration. It also decreased my back pain from a herniated and degenerated disc. Appetite was increased, but not to unmanageable levels. Unfortunately, it also cause significant water retention, even at only a 12.5mg/day dose. I gained almost 10 pounds within the first week, felt extremely bloated, and begun to have pain from the water retention in my feel and legs so I stopped. The extra water weight went away within a week or so. FYI, the reason why MK-677 causes water retention is because by increasing HGH and IGF-1, they in turn increase the amount of anti-duretic hormone, which causes water retention and electrolyte imbalances. Water pills did not help in my experience. Length of Trial: 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BPC-157&lt;/strong&gt; (Updates with injections) \u2013 With my previous review I had assessed oral usage of BPC-157, however, it did not seem to help much with my back injury, so I decided to inject ~250mcg a day (in the AM), subcutaneously right above the herniated disc. While it did reduce pain and inflammation, I still had significant issues. Those benefits were gone within a week of stopping the injections. I did get similar psychological benefits as when I oral dosed, so the ROA does not seem to matter for that benefit. Length of trial: 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thymosin Beta 4&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 No notable effects other than making me drowsy. It is possible that I did not dose long enough or frequently enough. Dose: 1.5mg/week. Length of trial: 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenoten&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Very mild anxiolitic, I had to take more than the recommended does of 2 tablets at a time to have an effect. Seems pretty inert and does not alter mood in an appreciable way. Not really worth the money in my experience. Length of trial: Occasionally over 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microdosed Fluoxetine&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 This one piqued my interest after reading several studies &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8270588\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670606/\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/93/22/12599.abstract\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; which outlined significant improvements in anxiety reduction and PTSD symptoms with very low doses of this popular antidepressant. These doses are 1/50th to 1/20th below the dose needed to inhibit the serotonin transporter appreciably. While PTSD is not really an issue for me, I figured that this would be a pretty good option for anxiety. I ended up dissolving (for the most part, there was still some particulate matter, probably binding agents) the contents of a 20mg pill volumetrically. I dosed ~200 mcg a day, which seemed to increase my emotional liability and caused mood swings. After a week, these effects seemed to be building, so I stopped. It was a bit disappointing, as the science behind it seemed to be pretty solid and intriguing, especial because the cost of this approach was effectively zero. based Length of trial: 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D Phenylalanine&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Provided surprising mood boosing properties and decreased back pain. It also made me feel uncomfortable/wierd, and I could tell when it was wearing off. My back pain has since improved, so I no longer need to take it. Length of trial: 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palmitoylethanolamide&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 A very intriguing substance, as it is a nuclear receptor agonist (that just sounds awesome) and inhibits the breakdown of anandamide and AG-2, endogenous cannabinoids by blocking the FAAH enzyme. While it takes 4-8 weeks to be fully working, it does appreciably decrease pain and inflammation. Two effects that seem to be less known are its ability to potentate cannabis/oleamide and decrease allergies, which happen after about a week of consistent dosing. Great for chronic pain, nephropathy and allergies if you can afford it. Length of Trial: 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P21&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Arguably the most disappointing substance on this round of trials. P21 was a strange combination of unpleasant stimulation and lethargy, which had a pretty negative impact on my sleep. I had trouble with sleep onset and early waking, which abated when I stopped taking it. I was wired but tired the whole time I tried it. The stimulation and boost in focus was not a useful one, it was bizarre, unpredictable and seemed to help me focus on peripheral unimportant details instead of the main item.  Length of trial: 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NA-Semax Amidate&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 A very potent substance in my experience, it pretty much guarantees a productive, happy day. Boosts in concentration, mood, wakefulness, resilience under stress and potentiation of all stimulants including coffee, polygala and bromantane. The only issue is that I have issues with insomnia on the days I dose, even if it is only 100mcg when I first wake up. I also seem to have a day below baseline after the days that I dose. I have gone as long as 3 weeks in a row of daily dosing, and I crashed pretty hard after that. I suspect it has to do with its effects on cortisol, as I have had issues with that. I have some interest in trying regular Semax, as it is supposed to be pretty different in its effects and may avoid these drawbacks. Length of trial: 3 weeks continuous, intermittent days here and there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NA- Selank&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 a weak but effective anxolytic. It provides reliable effects and even helps level out moods a bit. Its solid, but unspectacular. That being said, I have significant year-round environmental allergies, and it definitely made them worse, which is why I don\u2019t take this anymore. Length of trial: 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perika (St. John\u2019s Wort)&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Very potent antidepressant that has great effects on peripheral inflammation. It takes about 3 weeks to get going, but it helped significantly with mood, brain fog, workout recovery, anxiety and even some with adhd symptomology. It my moods were very even and it was my favorite antidepressant/supplement until I tried polygala. The only reason why I stopped is that when the days started getting longer and the sun got brighter as summer approached, my eyes became very light sensitive. It got so bad that even after the sun would set (but still have light out), I would need sunglasses, and they did not seem to be enough during the midday sun. There were withdrawals when I stopped relatively abruptly, but they were tolerable. One thing that was a bit of a hassle were all the interactions with medications and herbs, it really only makes sense to take by itself (outside of fish oil/vitamins). Length of trial: 5 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tianeptine&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 My first foray into taking my mental health into my own hands. After the first 4-5 days (which were weird and anxiety provoking) it went very well, doing things that prescribed medications hadn\u2019t done, like relieve my depression, improve my mood and adhd symptomology (concentration/focus) and provide some relief from anxiety. I primarily stuck to the standard Tianeptine Sodium 3x12.5 dosage, but did also try 2x25mg of Tianeptine Free Acid for several weeks. In my experience the Tianeptine Sodium was more effective. It worked well for 8 months, when all of a sudden it \u201cpooped out\u201d and started causing mood swings, anxiety and a return of depression. After trying agmatine unsuccessfully to \u201cbring back the magic\u201d, I decided to stop taking it. My mood swings went away quickly, but the anxiety and depression lingered. Length of trial: 9 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan to try the following substances in the coming months: Pycogenol/Pine Tree Bark, Cal/Mag Butyrate, VSL#3, Hi-Maize/Resistant Starch, Gastrodin, Etifoxine, Mildronate, RGPU-95, ALA, possibly Epitalon or Niagen, Captodiamine (if I can get my hands on some, I may be getting traction here). There will also be a vendor review coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Note - Possible Contradictions: During these trials I was taking 3x 100mg Polygala Tenuifolia extract for anti-depressive/adhd purposes, fish oil, a b vitamin complex, Vitamin K, Epicor, 10,000IU\u2019s of vitamin d, Zinc/Copper and Magnesium Glycinate. I have taken this stack daily for a lengthy period of time, so my baseline using the substances above were clearly defined prior to attempting these trials. I also partook with cannabis a few times a month and meditated for 30-40 minutes daily during this time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Several months have passed since my last [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5jqfwd/a_review_of_several_cutting_edge_nootropics/) and I have had the chance to try some new substances, some nootropic, others not so much.
