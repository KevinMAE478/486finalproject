Since an avergage stoner plays video games and gets munchies, it less likely to trigger the reaction. Further more, cannabis triggers the dopamine pathway, which would be the exact opposite of NGF, as it strengthens existing behavior.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo, lower NGF level is not caused by toxicity of cannabis, but by what people do after they smoke it. It would be interesting to repeat the study with stoners that play sports and control their munchies and compare results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Nootropics", "name": "t1_dgdc2xj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492453242.0, "created_utc": 1492424442.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r81c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65puoa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r81c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65puoa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgxbm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kaczuszencja", "parent_id": "t1_dgc7p1c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Nootropics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "TrKB agonism decreases BDNF", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TrKB agonism decreases BDNF&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Nootropics", "name": "t1_dgcgxbm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400632.0, "created_utc": 1492371832.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r81c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65puoa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc82sx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CL20", "parent_id": "t1_dgc7p1c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Nootropics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, I realized that study too, I posted this one because the one European study had a twice as big \nsample group, and the NGF level reduced by almost 10 folds in long term cannabis users vs controls.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I realized that study too, I posted this one because the one European study had a twice as big \nsample group, and the NGF level reduced by almost 10 folds in long term cannabis users vs controls.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Nootropics", "name": "t1_dgc82sx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388946.0, "created_utc": 1492360146.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7p1c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ocelottr", "parent_id": "t3_65puoa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Nootropics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This seems conflicting with these results: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791800/\n\nCannabis results in TrkB agonism which probably does affect BDNF in some way.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems conflicting with these results: &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791800/\"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791800/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cannabis results in TrkB agonism which probably does affect BDNF in some way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Nootropics", "name": "t1_dgc7p1c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388437.0, "created_utc": 1492359637.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r81c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65puoa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r81c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65puoa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdsahm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jacknous", "parent_id": "t1_dgdaj9c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Nootropics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Nootropics", "name": "t1_dgdsahm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478337.0, "created_utc": 1492449537.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdaj9c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lokzo55", "parent_id": "t3_65puoa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Nootropics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you want to raise NGF, Dopamine and sexual energy, look into Cistanche.
