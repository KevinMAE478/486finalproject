TCC, TCWM,\nand TCP were significantly related with cottage cheese and total\nprotein intake from milk and dairy also when controlled for age,\ngender, and height in the multivariate model.

Accordingly, breast-feeding has\nrepeatedly been shown to confer health and cognitive benefits in\nlater life. For example, a study by Isaacs et al. (2010) reported a\npositive association between early breast milk intake and brain\nvolume as well as intelligence quotient at adolescence. Contrary\nto the usual belief, consumption of milk beyond breast-feeding\nperiod is associated with negative health effects too. These\ninclude iron deficiency, higher prevalence of upper respiratory\ntract infections, allergies, constipation, and type 1 diabetes\nmellitus (Thorsdottir &amp; Thorisdottir, 2011). Epidemiological\nand ecological data also link cow\u2019s milk consumption to higher\nprevalence of certain cancers (Melnik et al., 2012) and cardiovascular\ndisease (Laugesen &amp; Elliott, 2003). A few studies also\nrelated cow\u2019s milk to neurological conditions such as epilepsy,\nautism, and sudden infant death (Lucarelli et al., 2012; Thorsdottir\n&amp; Thorisdottir, 2011).\nNegative effects are thought to be mediated by the bioactive\nsubstances in cow\u2019s milk. Casein which makes up 80% of the\nprotein in cow\u2019s milk breaks down in the gastrointestinal tract into\ncasomorphins such as beta casomorphin-7 (BCM-7). BCM-7 is\nprone to passing through the blood\u2013brain barrier and has been\nsuggested to exert an opioid-like effect in the central nervous\nsystem (Scientific Report of EFSA, 2009). Although this effect\nwas described as being weak continuous exposure may represent a\ncumulative effect.\nCow\u2019s milk contains IGF-1 and consumption of cow\u2019s milk is\nknown to elevate concentration of both IGF-1 and insulin which\nare regarded as key regulators of tissue growth (Melnik et al.,\n2012). The two latter factors together with leucine, an amino acid\nfrom milk and dairy, are known as main activating factors of the\nmTORC1 (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex\n1)-signaling system which promote cell growth and proliferation\nbut inhibit apoptosis (Melnik et al., 2012).\nIn the present study, we used a questionnaire which focused on\nrecent dietary habits related to milk and dairy. Given that dietary\nhabits seem to be relatively invariable across life span (Bjelland\net al., 2013; Ozasa et al., 1994) we put forward that the\nassociations found in our study refer to either a childhood or a\nlong-term cumulative effect on brain structure rather than an\nacute effect from recent consumption of milk and dairy.\nThe link between accelerated growth and cow\u2019s milk consumption\nis well established in children (Hoppe et al., 2006;\nThorsdottir &amp; Thorisdottir, 2011). Here we report that volumes of\nthe cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter are proportionally\nrelated to milk and dairy consumption in healthy young adults.\nGiven that the associations were strongest for milk-dairy protein,\nwhich is a summated measure of milk-dairy consumption, we\nsuggest that the effects coming from different types of dairy are\nsummated. Among the investigated dairy types cheese and cottage\ncheese were found to exhibit highest correlation measures with\nthe brain subvolumes. This may be due to the fact that cheese and\ncottage cheese have the highest dry matter content and thus\ncontains most protein with a potential biological effect. When\ninvestigating males and females separately associations were\nstronger for males than females, despite the smaller group size of\nmales than females. Such a gender difference is in line with results\nfrom previous studies indicating stronger associations for males\nthan females between milk consumption and height in children\n(Rogers et al., 2006) as well as breast milk intake at infancy and\nbrain volume at adolescence (Isaacs et al., 2010).\nGenerally, larger brain is regarded as a positive rather than\nnegative feature (e.g. Witelson et al., 2006). At the same time,\nautistic children (Hazlett et al., 2011) and patients with schizophrenia\n(Bassett et al., 1996) have been reported to have larger\nhead circumference than age-matched controls and brain overgrowth\nhas been implicated in the pathology of these conditions\n(Hazlett et al., 2011). It is of importance too, that dietary\ninterventions in autism rely on eliminating milk and dairy besides\ngluten containing foods (Elder, 2008).\nIn our previous study, intracranial volume was inversely\nrelated with vitamin D (Plo\u00b4zer et al., 2014), the low serum level of\nwhich is a correlate or predictor of a wide variety of neurological\nand psychiatric conditions (Balion et al., 2012; Evatt et al., 2008;\nHollo\u00b4 et al., 2014). Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to\npromote cellular proliferation in the nervous system (Ko et al.,\n2004). Vitamin D is also implicated in the mTOR signaling by\nsuppressing its activity (Lisse &amp; Hewison, 2011). It seems that\nhigher milk consumption and low level of vitamin D, converge in\nactivating a common signaling pathway, and both are associated\nwith tissue growth (Ko et al., 2004; Melnik et al., 2012) and larger\nbrain volume as indicated by our previous (Plo\u00b4zer et al., 2014) and\npresent data.\nOur results indicate that dietary habits related with milk and\ndairy are proportionally associated with volumes of both cerebral\ncortex and cerebral white matter.

Vitamin D is also implicated in the mTOR signaling by\nsuppressing its activity (Lisse &amp;amp; Hewison, 2011). It seems that\nhigher milk consumption and low level of vitamin D, converge in\nactivating a common signaling pathway, and both are associated\nwith tissue growth (Ko et al., 2004; Melnik et al., 2012) and larger\nbrain volume as indicated by our previous (Plo\u00b4zer et al., 2014) and\npresent data.\nOur results indicate that dietary habits related with milk and\ndairy are proportionally associated with volumes of both cerebral\ncortex and cerebral white matter. Functional consequence of milkand\ndairy-associated growth in brain parenchyma remains to be\nelucidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Nootropics", "name": "t1_dgefuw4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492506402.0, "created_utc": 1492477602.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r81c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65zarr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeci4k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "catntree", "parent_id": "t3_65zarr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Nootropics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So, more milk and dairy related to more cerebral cortical volume?
