I sleep on my back. Not only does it allow me to wake up feeling super refreshed and far less groggy than when I was sleeping on a queen size cushy mattress (high quality IKEA one for reference), but I now wake up naturally around 5:30-6 in the morning without an alarm. Usually go to bed around 8 or 9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What inspired me to do this was obviously shitty sleep but more so doing research into biomechanics and what people in different cultures sleep on. In Japan, for instance, the traditional bed consists of a tatami mat for the base, a shikibuton for the padding (kind of like a sleeping bag but more comfortable and you don&amp;#39;t get in it), a very soft cotton or silk blanket to cover and a buckwheat pillow (you can take out as much buckwheat as you want for desired thickness). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also came across quite a few articles touting the benefits of sleeping on a firm surface with minimal cushion. Mainly these articles claim that the reason you feel so much more refreshed when you wake up is that your body gets better circulation and your breathing is enhanced. Supposedly the natural force of gravity not being counter-acted by a ridiculously soft mattress straightens out your body as well as shifting the organs and vessels inside to their natural place, whatever that may be. It also improves posture for that same reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it was hard to go to sleep and I would wake up with my lower back aching, since I had slight anterior pelvic tilt my lumbar spine was more curved and my tail bone was sticking out, putting more pressure when I laid on my back. However after the first few days I was sleeping like a baby and after couple of weeks the aching went away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trick behind it is that you want to make sure the pallet or makeshift bed has just enough cushion to provide support for the three pressure points on your back: the lower back (tail bone area), upper back (mostly on your shoulder blades), and obviously the back of your head. Sleeping with absolutely no cushion is very uncomfortable and can actually degrade your sleep and make back problems worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I thoroughly understand that there are really no studies comparing firm surface back sleepers with soft surface back sleepers but I think that&amp;#39;s largely because the idea has never been challenged and no problem is perceived&lt;/strong&gt;. Sleeping on a mattress has just become the cultural norm even though most of human history we didn&amp;#39;t have big cushy mattresses to sleep on. I honestly think the human body was meant to sleep this way and I also firmly believe that if there ever are any studies done on the quality of sleep regarding sleeping medium the results would be the same as with my case (given that the subjects do not have arthritis or anything of that nature, i.e., healthy adults). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do try it it might be easier to start off with a very soft pallet with several layers, then strip away a layer every few days and decrease the thickness of your pillow until you are at the minimal support point that I have talked about. You will probably be tempted to lay on your side out of habit but I highly encourage you not to, I&amp;#39;ve noticed shoulder pain and lesser quality of sleep as a result.
