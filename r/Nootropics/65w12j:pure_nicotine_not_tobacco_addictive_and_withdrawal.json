Do not take anything that I have stated here or elsewhere as legal or medical advice. Nothing stated here or elsewhere should be considered privileged information (e.g. I am not legally protected from revealing the information to others in court). Take everything said with a grain of salt.\n\n**Yes, nicotine can help with ADHD**, and it can absolutely be life changing if you use it responsibly. The big problem is that it can be really hard to use it in a responsible fashion.\nOccasional use would probably give you the greatest benefit, but also bring a lot of the negatives up just as strongly. \nNicotine works similar to caffeine regarding withdrawal and dependence. You can probably use your body's reaction to caffeine to give you a very general idea of what your tolerance will be, but you're going to have to compare them in an apples to apples sense. Day 1 to Day 1, not 5 years to day 1. \n\n**No, nicotine is not a replacement for Ritelin, Adderall, and other medications in this class** These particular medications work by changing the activity of the dopamine and norepinephrine receptors of the brain and mimicking phenethylamine. \nNicotine functions by stimulating nicotinic receptors in the brain which then lead to changes in serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and a ton of other hormone levels in the brain. While both are similar in certain aspects, the mechanism is very different. It's like comparing a block of plastic explosives to a shape charge. One is highly focused, and makes huge changes to a small area, while the other effects a large area, but not as much as if it was focused (This is the best analogy that I can think of).\n\n\n**Yes, nicotine is highly studied, and there is tons of credible information available.** However, there is also a lot of \"pseudoscience\" out there and tons of false data. Be careful of where you get your information. There are tons of reasons why nicotine is no longer used for treating ADHD except in rare circumstances. Having a low fatal dosage, being highly addictive, and being difficult to maintain dosing are only a few of the many reasons that it was stopped.\n\n**Being worried by the risk of dependence and addiction is not irrational, but it isn't as bad as you may think.** Having a bit of self control can help you mitigate these risks, but being addicted to nicotine is not in itself extremely detriment to your health. Many people are addicted to caffeine and cannot function throughout the day without having coffee. So long as you get your intake of nicotine through low risk mechanism (Note: the delivery mechanism is the biggest health hazard. Smoking and Vaping are both not smart), you are looking at the same type of situation. You're going to have to find your own way to maintain self-control, but I would personally recommend sticking to taking it at a very specific time during the day and not changing that time regardless of the circumstances. In doing this, you can at least help mitigate forming a psychological reliance on it, and prevent you from using it as a coping mechanism.\nDo your own research, think about it, know yourself, and be safe with it.\n\n**If you cannot get other ADHD medications in your country, consult with your doctor about all of your options** (I do not know the laws in every country, and I don't have the time to learn them) Seriously, don't self medicate and/or self diagnose.

If you have talked with your doctor to discuss other options, and have found nothing else to be a viable option; then I (if it was me in your situation) would at least try it to see what happens. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I still don&amp;#39;t have tons of time to give you a super detailed description of everything, but I&amp;#39;ll take a stab at it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, doctor, or any other medical professional. Do not take anything that I have stated here or elsewhere as legal or medical advice. Nothing stated here or elsewhere should be considered privileged information (e.g. I am not legally protected from revealing the information to others in court). Take everything said with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, nicotine can help with ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;, and it can absolutely be life changing if you use it responsibly. The big problem is that it can be really hard to use it in a responsible fashion.\nOccasional use would probably give you the greatest benefit, but also bring a lot of the negatives up just as strongly. \nNicotine works similar to caffeine regarding withdrawal and dependence. You can probably use your body&amp;#39;s reaction to caffeine to give you a very general idea of what your tolerance will be, but you&amp;#39;re going to have to compare them in an apples to apples sense. Day 1 to Day 1, not 5 years to day 1. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, nicotine is not a replacement for Ritelin, Adderall, and other medications in this class&lt;/strong&gt; These particular medications work by changing the activity of the dopamine and norepinephrine receptors of the brain and mimicking phenethylamine. \nNicotine functions by stimulating nicotinic receptors in the brain which then lead to changes in serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and a ton of other hormone levels in the brain. While both are similar in certain aspects, the mechanism is very different. It&amp;#39;s like comparing a block of plastic explosives to a shape charge. One is highly focused, and makes huge changes to a small area, while the other effects a large area, but not as much as if it was focused (This is the best analogy that I can think of).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, nicotine is highly studied, and there is tons of credible information available.&lt;/strong&gt; However, there is also a lot of &amp;quot;pseudoscience&amp;quot; out there and tons of false data. Be careful of where you get your information. There are tons of reasons why nicotine is no longer used for treating ADHD except in rare circumstances. Having a low fatal dosage, being highly addictive, and being difficult to maintain dosing are only a few of the many reasons that it was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being worried by the risk of dependence and addiction is not irrational, but it isn&amp;#39;t as bad as you may think.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a bit of self control can help you mitigate these risks, but being addicted to nicotine is not in itself extremely detriment to your health. Many people are addicted to caffeine and cannot function throughout the day without having coffee. So long as you get your intake of nicotine through low risk mechanism (Note: the delivery mechanism is the biggest health hazard. Smoking and Vaping are both not smart), you are looking at the same type of situation. You&amp;#39;re going to have to find your own way to maintain self-control, but I would personally recommend sticking to taking it at a very specific time during the day and not changing that time regardless of the circumstances.

Some people, like myself, have very little trouble with addiction in general, but not everyone is the same way.\n\nIn terms of adverse health effects, you have pretty similar things to other stimulants. In small quantities, the effects are barely noticeable if present at all, but at normal and high doses, you have similar risks as well. Increased heart rate, palpitations, headaches, depression (following the euphoria that sometimes occurs), and a few other things. It is very similar to caffeine, but a typical dosage of nicotine is much closer to the max tolerable dosage than caffeine. \n\nFor numbers sake (and again, I'm recalling all of this from memory, double check the accuracy of these numbers if you can), the fatal dosage of nicotine for your average adult is something like 100mg to 250mg which is actually not that hard to achieve with things like vaping (which is a whole different thing, and is not really studied enough).

It is true that nicotine patches were used at one point in time to help ease the symptoms of ADD/ADHD but that is no longer the case (except in maybe some rare circumstances) because of the health risks that can be associated with it if not used in a very specific way.
