I quit and it took about a year for me to recover most of what I had before, and tbh none of the noots from bacopa monnieri to gingko biloba to fish oil seemed to help me.  It would be worth looking into those as your experience may be different, but the chances are you just might need to wait for it to return to normal.  One thing you ABSOLUTELY need to do to preserve your memory is stop using those GABAergic drugs like alcohol and diazepam, and this needs to be titrated down SLOWLY as the withdrawal can make these issues worse.  I'd suggest replacing the diazepam with something like Buspar, theanine, or ashwaghanda as they won't fuck with your memory like benzos will, and to take up a healthy lifestyle with exercise and mediation to help create new neurons.

Like exactly the same memory and cognitive issues.  I was prescribed 1mg Klonopin daily so thats a roughly equivalent dose to your diazepam and I would frequently drink on it.
