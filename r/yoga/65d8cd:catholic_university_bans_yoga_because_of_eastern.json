What can I say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Francisians are far more lax and closer to people, and are the reason Bosnia even had non-muslims. They are very much pillars of primary education, culture and life in general. They are very people-centric, and quite beloved. They love kids, they have very short mass and love events like church choir festivals, etc. They also can&amp;#39;t be Popes, IIRC.\nThey also founded primary schools and kept young women from being stolen by Ottomans, they fed and helped people, they provided aid to refugees in the Homeland war in the 1990s...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Jesuits they blessed tanks and guns, much like in WW2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Basically, there are a lot of religious orders within RCC, and different &amp;#39;Catholics&amp;#39;, and even the RC is different everywhere, thus reflecting on people differently.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Catholics can do a lot of good stuff, I&amp;#39;m not surprised the man snapped and left, and found a lot of likeminded folk.&lt;br/&gt;\nFrom your description (and a bit of Googleing) I&amp;#39;d say that the ACC are most like Jesuits, so I&amp;#39;m not surprised they feel rigid to you, since USA has a lot of &amp;quot;laxer&amp;quot; alternate christian religious institutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just bear in mind the world isn&amp;#39;t really as small as internet makes it seem, and one term can mean a thousand things, especially in religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I sound cold, know-it-all-ish or offended, I&amp;#39;m not, I just love religions :D\nI hope my wall of text was interesting, if nothing else :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "yoga", "name": "t1_dg9rte6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233639.0, "created_utc": 1492204839.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9og91", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "25MikeMike", "parent_id": "t1_dg9nk5x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/yoga", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Whoa I did not know that, I apologize if I came off as insensitive.
