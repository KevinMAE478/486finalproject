I was of the same mindset, and you could say that I\u2019ve fallen into a daily practice almost by accident. I certainly never intended to start doing yoga every day but, in many ways, I have actually found a daily practice easier to keep up than, say, 3 times per week. For me, what has worked is doing yoga in the mornings before work, straight out of bed. We have our TV set up with YouTube (although I\u2019m sure a laptop would suffice), and I have been getting a lot of value of the Yoga with Adriene channel. I\u2019ve been doing a daily practice for about a month now, generally for around 20-25 minutes, rotating the same 10-15 videos that I\u2019ve found I enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some tips that I\u2019ve found to make it super easy on myself to do a morning practice: \n* Laying out my yoga mat the night before so it\u2019s good to go\n* Having an automatic filter coffee machine on a timer so there\u2019s a cup ready for me when I get up (I love coffee and the smell of it brewing is an extra incentive to get out of bed)\n* Going to bed in something that I can get straight up and do yoga in, such as sleep shorts, a soft bra/crop top and a vest top \n* At the moment, while the mornings are chillier in the UK, leaving a sweater out that I can slip on until I warm up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits I\u2019ve noticed from a daily practice is being more aware of my body throughout the day; I suppose you could say I\u2019m more conscious of my posture. Some examples of this: \n* I notice more often when my shoulders are scrunched up around my ears, and release them down\n* I notice when I am \u2018dumping\u2019 my weight into one leg when standing, and correct this\n* When standing and waiting for a train or in a queue, I\u2019m more aware of my body as a whole: the balance of my weight and where this is in my feet; tucking my tailbone under slightly; dropping my shoulders down and back, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m also more aware of my breath, and several times a day remember to take some deep breaths from the belly rather than from the chest. In general, a feel a little calmer and more focused throughout the working day and less easily annoyed by things not going quite to plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work full time, have a busy social life and play a team sport that takes up 10+ hours a week, and I\u2019ve still been able to find time in my schedule for a short but deliberate daily practice. I guess I just wanted to share this to show that it is possible to develop a yoga habit and find time for it each day, even if you think you\u2019re not \u2018the type\u2019, and that even in a short space of time the benefits are subtle but definitely noticeable.
