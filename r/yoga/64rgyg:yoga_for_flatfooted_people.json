A tearing sensation is NOT normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flat feet really don&amp;#39;t much matter where yoga is concerned, and by no means are the only people that have foot issues when they first start or come back to yoga those w/flat feet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is foot strength, and it&amp;#39;s something that needs to be built up over time- how long and what poses are impacted will depend on footwear and current activities. In the meantime, a diagnosis from a doc or podiatrist to rule out injury that would impact what you&amp;#39;re currently doing is in order. With luck you&amp;#39;ll find it&amp;#39;s just plantar fasciitis and needs some strengthening to go with the stretching and frozen bottle rolling already mentioned elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "yoga", "name": "t1_dg4ukax", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491970482.0, "created_utc": 1491941682.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gzc9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GuzzlingHobo", "parent_id": "t1_dg4gtl8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/yoga", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It feels almost like a tearing for me, do you have the same experience?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels almost like a tearing for me, do you have the same experience?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "yoga", "name": "t1_dg4gzc9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491955720.0, "created_utc": 1491926920.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gtl8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lyricalgunplay", "parent_id": "t3_64rgyg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/yoga", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have the same issue but in both of my feet.
