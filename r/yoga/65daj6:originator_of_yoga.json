He was the one who first put this seed into the human mind. According to the yogic lore, over 15,000 years ago, Adi Yogi attained to his full enlightenment and abandoned himself in an intense ecstatic dance upon the Himalayas. When his ecstasy allowed him some movement, he danced wildly. When it became beyond movement, he became utterly still.\nPeople saw that he was experiencing something that nobody had known before, something that they were unable to fathom. Interest developed and people came wanting to know what this was. They came, they waited and they left because the man was oblivious to other people\u2019s presence. He was either in intense dance or absolute stillness, completely uncaring of what was happening around him. Soon, everyone left, except for seven men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These seven people were insistent that they must learn what this man had in him, but Adi Yogi ignored them. They pleaded and begged him, \u201cPlease, we want to know what you know.\u201d Adi Yogi dismissed them and said, \u201cYou fools. The way you are, you are not going to know in a million years. There is a tremendous amount of preparation needed for this. This is not entertainment.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they started preparing. Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, they prepared. Adi Yogi just chose to ignore them. On a full moon day, after eighty-four years of sadhana, when the solstice had shifted from the summer solstice to the winter solstice \u2013 which is known as Dakshinayana \u2013Adi Yogi looked at these seven people and saw that they had become shining receptacles of knowing. They were absolutely ripe to receive. He could not ignore them anymore. They grabbed his attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He watched them closely for the next few days and when the next full moon rose, he decided to become a Guru. The Adi Yogi transformed himself into the Adi Guru. The first Guru was born on that day which is today known as Guru Pournami. On the banks of Kanti Sarovar, a lake that lies a few kilometers above Kedarnath, he turned South to shed his grace upon these seven people and shared the yogic science. The yogic science is not about a yoga class that you go through about how to bend your body \u2013 which every new-born infant knows \u2013 or how to hold your breath \u2013 which every unborn infant knows. This is the science of understanding the mechanics of the entire human system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After many years, when the transmission was complete, it produced seven fully enlightened beings \u2013 the seven celebrated sages who are today known as the Saptarishis. Adi Yogi shared different aspects of yoga with each of these seven people, and these aspects became the seven basic forms of yoga. Even today, yoga has maintained these seven distinct forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Saptarishis were sent in seven different directions to different parts of the world to carry this yoga with which a human being can evolve beyond his present limitations and compulsions.
