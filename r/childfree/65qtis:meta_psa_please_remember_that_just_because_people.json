Sure I roll my eyes at points, especially over the whole \"mombie\" mentality, but I never really experience the actual contempt that some members feel towards.\n\nIdk it just feels like this sub should strive to at least be a little better and more \"adult\" at times, especially when members struggle to understand why non-CF people don't understand us and our mentality.

Some of it is even enlightening. I absolutely hate entitled parents who think they know everything just because they have kids. But finding humor in misguided parents isn't really the same as truly despising \"breeders\" and their lifestyle (the human race technically couldn't exist without them) and their children  (because honestly kids are dumb and annoying, but how can you really hate a kid for being a kid when they truly don't know better?).

Actual hate for all things related to children and parenting? This is especially poignant in light of the fact that one of the rules of the sub is literally that &amp;quot;non CF people are welcome here.&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say this as a future family physician  (not yet board-certified), who must cater to patients of all ages and honestly does not mind children as long as they &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;#39;t mine.&lt;/em&gt; I also feel absolutely no real connection to my recently born nephew, despite the rest of my family fawning over him. Sure I roll my eyes at points, especially over the whole &amp;quot;mombie&amp;quot; mentality, but I never really experience the actual contempt that some members feel towards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk it just feels like this sub should strive to at least be a little better and more &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; at times, especially when members struggle to understand why non-CF people don&amp;#39;t understand us and our mentality. I mean we can honestly come off as pretty hostile and immature, and we should strive to do better in my humble opinion.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit - also I find a lot of the stuff posted on this sub truly funny and entertaining. Some of it is even enlightening. I absolutely hate entitled parents who think they know everything just because they have kids. But finding humor in misguided parents isn&amp;#39;t really the same as truly despising &amp;quot;breeders&amp;quot; and their lifestyle (the human race technically couldn&amp;#39;t exist without them) and their children  (because honestly kids are dumb and annoying, but how can you really hate a kid for being a kid when they truly don&amp;#39;t know better?). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dgenezm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492515873.0, "created_utc": 1492487073.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdrtkz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZingZwang", "parent_id": "t1_dgcx3jf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; less of a forum to talk to other people who are also child free about our lifestyle choice\n\nYou appear to be looking for /r/truechildfree", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;less of a forum to talk to other people who are also child free about our lifestyle choice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You appear to be looking for &lt;a href=\"/r/truechildfree\"&gt;/r/truechildfree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dgdrtkz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492477817.0, "created_utc": 1492449017.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcx3jf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "1speedbike", "parent_id": "t1_dgcsyoq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Judging by some of the comments on this post I am not sure that's true.
