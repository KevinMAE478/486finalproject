Are guys often socially naive and clueless and say the wrong thing? Also yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is, if you have known him for a few years and trust him enough to tell him &amp;quot;all of my deepest darkest stuff&amp;quot;, do you not trust him enough to think he would purposely greviously offend you? Do you really think he meant to hurt you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thing seems more like a miscommunication to me, and I think his response about leaving you alone confirms that. Through the medium of text, neither of you pick up on the subtle intricacies influencing the meanings of what either of you mean to convey, and thus both are misunderstood. Face to face I think this would have played out differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you owe him a response, to at least explain your reaction. Not to apologise though, but to seek resolution and figure out why he said what he said. Something like, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know I physically can&amp;#39;t carry children, nor do I want one. I&amp;#39;ve told you that before in depth. No &amp;#39;right guy&amp;#39; is going to change that. Why would you say that? What you said really hurt, it was insensitive, and I thought I (or you) knew you (or me) better than that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not the time, but he also really needs a lesson on vaginas. There is no right guy with a magic cock that will ever make a woman 1) want children if she didn&amp;#39;t before (or have children if she physically can&amp;#39;t) 2) straight if she wasn&amp;#39;t before or 3) able to orgasm if she never has been able to, just by shoving it her vagina. I don&amp;#39;t know who keeps creating this misinformation, but it needs to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dg78rye", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492093628.0, "created_utc": 1492064828.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zqbz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6daxe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AgentKittyfeets", "parent_id": "t3_64zqbz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Naah, you should have said \"I think if you met the right person, and it was the right time, and your life got more stable.... you could go fuck yourself.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naah, you should have said &amp;quot;I think if you met the right person, and it was the right time, and your life got more stable.... you could go fuck yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dg6daxe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492052743.0, "created_utc": 1492023943.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zqbz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7f8q9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DevelMann", "parent_id": "t3_64zqbz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Of course he doesn't love her.
