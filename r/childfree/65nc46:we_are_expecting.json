That&amp;#39;s awesome :) My SO and I are also moving to our first grown-up-people house in june. It&amp;#39;s the perfect house for us and we got it for a very reasonable price because it&amp;#39;s not suitable for families (not enough bedrooms, but big garage). Yay for being CF and making stuff like this come true! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dgcjhm8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492403941.0, "created_utc": 1492375141.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nc46", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd6clu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "il-lust-ra-tor", "parent_id": "t3_65nc46", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Congrats!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dgd6clu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492436853.0, "created_utc": 1492408053.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
