First I will tell you some of the history of my family or else nothing will make sense. For me Easter is not a happy time because my twin brother went missing on Easter. Today it is 14 years since I know nothing about his whereabouts. He was a free-spirited person who loved nature and hiking. Who knows where he wandered that day but he went out on one of his long walks, like he did every day, and never came back. We looked everywhere \u2013 in the town and outside of the town, we looked through every nearest forest and meadow, lake and river. Me, my parents, the friends of our family, the police, the military forces, the divers, everyone was looking for him but he had completely disappeared. Till this day I still do not understand how can a person just vanish without a trace. I do not know how this works in the USA but where I live, the search for a missing person continues for 10 years. After this time, if there are no new clues, they do not believe that the person can be found and there is no point in continuing. So the police officially stopped looking for my brother 4 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ask my thoughts, I think that he is not with us anymore. We have no proof of his death but I cannot imagine any other reason that would keep a person from coming home for 14 years. I lean to believe the police who think that he either had some kind of an accident that resulted in death or that he was murdered for some reasons. We do not know anything for sure but if someone if gone for that long, then to me this seems the only logical answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have accepted it but my parents have not. And as strange as it might be, they seems to be more worried about the possible children that he might have than about him. My mother is like\n \u201e Oh, what if he had children and they live without even knowing that they have grandparents?\u201d I have always tried to tell her that even if he had children, they are probably doing just fine without her. She then usually starts yelling at me for not showing any interest in whether I have nephews/nieces or not. Why does it matter? Even if I do, we would all be strangers to them anyway. Today we had the biggest argument about it. She was yelling that she is sure he had children because he was a young and healthy male and not a ballless rooster like me, of course he had children because that is what real men do. As I was turning to leave, she said: \u201e And don\u2019t you even think of being childfree like an old mushroom. In our current situation it is your obligation to give me and your father grandchildren whether you like it or not.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounded so evil and so threatening that I seriously started to consider if she has lost her mind because of the grief about her son. My father is not a confrontational person but I know he supports her opinion. My parents are both unemployed because of disabilities so I must pay their bills and cannot just leave them but if things were different I think I would voluntary go missing too just in order not to hear their baby bullshit no more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Happy Easter to everyone who is celebrating!
