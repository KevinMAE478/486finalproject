I can't work because of my health (and can't afford to see a doctor to find out what all is wrong and whether or not I have endometriosis), my husband could only get a minimum wage job (part-time), mom's still stuck in her minimum wage job, and dad's disabled.  Sometimes we struggle regarding food at times, because part-timers like my husband aren't guaranteed a certain amount of hours (if any) each week (luck has struck, he got promoted at his job and a slight pay-raise, so we're thanking our lucky stars and any gods who had a hand in this).  Therefore, my diet hasn't been the greatest and sort of all over the place, contributing to my lack of energy to do much around the house.  Any \"fun\" money we get (if we're not struggling to feed ourselves) goes towards a new video game (used, of course) or a new book (again: used; get them for literally pennies on Amazon) or replenishing a teensy bit of my art supplies (yay discount art supply stores), and \"fun money\" is very rare right now.  Maybe (*maybe*) every few months.  Only non-money-related shit I can do this summer right now is continuing my workout routine (muscle-building, for reasons), working on my art, get my first pumpkin patch planted so I can sell some this autumn, and going fossil-hunting in nearby locations with my husband.\n\nI grew up poor (dad became disabled after getting hurt when working in the steel mill via chemicals in the early 90s.  Semi-long story leading up to currently him getting a settlement *finally*.)  So I know there's no such thing as my parents becoming pretty well-off after raising kids while poor, especially after I got suckered into a for-profit \"art college\" (another long story; it's The Art Institutes if anyone's interested), and therefore I'm not a financial success that can send my parents money when they need some help.  So it baffles me when I hear of people having kids while they can barely afford to make ends meet before getting pregnant.  So on top of a multitude of other reasons, my husband and I being poor right now and my health being shit is another reason why I refuse to have kids.  The only major thing I'm looking forward to this year is the *possibility* of my husband and I going to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History later this summer.  And admissions is like... I *think* still $15 an adult.  We've been there before and love it, but it's been years since we were able to go again.  And as far as a fun highlight of the year is concerned, that's all we *might* be able to afford this year: one day at a museum to check out fossils.  That's also as far as we can plan regarding \"fun\" things to do that would cost money.\n\nSo you're not alone!  There are plenty of people who choose to be CF and are poor.  And it pisses me off how even the impoverished CF individuals are assumed to have all this extra money just because they don't have kids.  If that were the case, there'd be a whole lot less people having kids!\n\n~~I use parentheses a lot in my posts, apparently.

Any &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; money we get (if we&amp;#39;re not struggling to feed ourselves) goes towards a new video game (used, of course) or a new book (again: used; get them for literally pennies on Amazon) or replenishing a teensy bit of my art supplies (yay discount art supply stores), and &amp;quot;fun money&amp;quot; is very rare right now.  Maybe (&lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt;) every few months.  Only non-money-related shit I can do this summer right now is continuing my workout routine (muscle-building, for reasons), working on my art, get my first pumpkin patch planted so I can sell some this autumn, and going fossil-hunting in nearby locations with my husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up poor (dad became disabled after getting hurt when working in the steel mill via chemicals in the early 90s.  Semi-long story leading up to currently him getting a settlement &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;.)  So I know there&amp;#39;s no such thing as my parents becoming pretty well-off after raising kids while poor, especially after I got suckered into a for-profit &amp;quot;art college&amp;quot; (another long story; it&amp;#39;s The Art Institutes if anyone&amp;#39;s interested), and therefore I&amp;#39;m not a financial success that can send my parents money when they need some help.  So it baffles me when I hear of people having kids while they can barely afford to make ends meet before getting pregnant.  So on top of a multitude of other reasons, my husband and I being poor right now and my health being shit is another reason why I refuse to have kids.  The only major thing I&amp;#39;m looking forward to this year is the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of my husband and I going to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History later this summer.  And admissions is like... I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; still $15 an adult.  We&amp;#39;ve been there before and love it, but it&amp;#39;s been years since we were able to go again.  And as far as a fun highlight of the year is concerned, that&amp;#39;s all we &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to afford this year: one day at a museum to check out fossils.  That&amp;#39;s also as far as we can plan regarding &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; things to do that would cost money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re not alone!  There are plenty of people who choose to be CF and are poor.  And it pisses me off how even the impoverished CF individuals are assumed to have all this extra money just because they don&amp;#39;t have kids.  If that were the case, there&amp;#39;d be a whole lot less people having kids!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I use parentheses a lot in my posts, apparently.
