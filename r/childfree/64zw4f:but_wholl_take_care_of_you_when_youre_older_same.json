Your offspring most often will not take care of you. So my response is this, and always this, somebody at a nursing home if I even live that long, same as you. Or possibly nobody. But your kids will not take care of you, you are not guaranteed that, and the more you try to impose that, the less likely it will happen. The only difference is because I don&amp;#39;t have kids I will get to afford a slightly nicer nursing facility or long term care at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dg9tjif", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492235856.0, "created_utc": 1492207056.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zw4f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6q3bs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Oscars_Gone_Wilde", "parent_id": "t3_64zw4f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you want to guarantee that a trustworthy non-stranger is in charge of your care when you're old, why not become close friends with a young person/young relative and set up a fund that pays them and they can use to pay for your expenses? \n\nSound complicated?
