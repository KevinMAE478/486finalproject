I guess I&amp;#39;m overly cautious about possibly upsetting anyone; I was like that before I had a kid (like I would do my best to not cough over a throat tickle cause I didn&amp;#39;t want to disturb people kinda thing). So I do sometimes get the feeling that I can&amp;#39;t take my kid somewhere simply because she&amp;#39;s a kid and might bother someone. If it&amp;#39;s a kid friendly setting then I take her anyway and I&amp;#39;m sure this is what keeps me from taking her places where kids shouldn&amp;#39;t go, but I still have the nagging feeling that I&amp;#39;m constantly bothering someone that might not like kids just by being out somewhere. I don&amp;#39;t attribute that to childfree people being rude or hostile though, it&amp;#39;s entirely because of how I perceive and overthink social situations. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dg4ee2o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491952857.0, "created_utc": 1491924057.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r4po", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vzcs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fucklebutt", "parent_id": "t3_64r4po", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wowww persecution complex much?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wowww persecution complex much?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dg4vzcs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972072.0, "created_utc": 1491943272.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r4po", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54ln7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "heronumberwon", "parent_id": "t3_64r4po", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;childless into fit of rage\n\nThis is a lie as Children of men has shown.
