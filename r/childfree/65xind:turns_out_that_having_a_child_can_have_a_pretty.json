Spend it where it is needed instead of having to cut education because people fucked their way to bigger refunds, and need to be paid first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dgebbgb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492500682.0, "created_utc": 1492471882.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xind", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xind", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xind", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xind", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xind", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xind", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge9yb0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tbessie", "parent_id": "t1_dge99bc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Here here!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here here!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "childfree", "name": "t1_dge9yb0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492498891.0, "created_utc": 1492470091.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge99bc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jaurein", "parent_id": "t1_dge88vy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/childfree", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I could see this working.
