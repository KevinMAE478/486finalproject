There have been points in my life, where I&amp;#39;ve been on the fence, thinking that I might want them someday - it&amp;#39;s gone back and forth. Mostly I&amp;#39;ve been telling myself not to get snipped this young (soon to be 25) because I listen to my elders, when they tell me I might wanna change my mind. Some men do. But I usually land back on the glorious childfree path, because having kids seem to suck hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOW&lt;/strong&gt; though, something horrifying has happened. I was with a girl, whom jumped on top, put my member inside her and started grinding. I yanked it out fairly quickly and told her that I did not wanna do that without a condom. She pouted a bit, but then we went to hand pleasuring. I got her to cum, and then I sort of leaned back for my turn. Handjob, then blowjob and then as I am about to cum - &lt;strong&gt;I SHIT YOU NOT&lt;/strong&gt; - she jumps on top of me, pins me down as best she can, forces it in and I end up cumming inside her. What the fuck?! Rape, much?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that just fucking settled it. I am getting snipped as soon as fucking possible. That experience was, and &lt;strong&gt;IS STILL&lt;/strong&gt;, the most horrifying shit, that has ever happened to me. Just last weekend, actually. But now I am without doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;\nBeen on fence about snipping. Girl physically forced me to cum inside her. Pretty fucking certain now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; - Okay, so this quickly went the lawyer/police route. Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t see what good involving the police will be. She did say she was on birth control and if it turns out not to be true, I might go to the police, but if I do it now, I do not know what the ultimate goal would be. I don&amp;#39;t want anything else, than not see or talk to her again. I am also sure I would not be taken seriously at all, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Yeah, so the gravity of my situation just set in. So in addition to the clearly overdue snipping, I should evidently also get some legal advice and maybe contact the police. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3&lt;/strong&gt; - This got way more traction than I expected, and I am really happy it did. You&amp;#39;ve really helped me put this way more in perspective. The level of consensus (100% so far) really makes me realize that I was right to be upset about this. Crazy as it sounds, I&amp;#39;ve felt a bit stupid, or maybe weak. To those following, here is what I am doing: (1) I am going to the doctor, to get an STD test and a sign off on being snipped. (2) I have contacted an old classmate of mine, who now practices law and asked if she would advise me. I am awaiting a reply. (3) I am also going to the police (with tough female friend, to be taken more seriously) and getting what a commenter called an affidavit. I am not pressing charges; it is only to cover my ass, just in case. (4) I have a woman with a bachelors in psych that I talk to about problems (she is super good) and I&amp;#39;ve already told her what happend, so I think I&amp;#39;ve got counseling covered. (5) I have written a more detailed description of the two encounters I&amp;#39;ve had with her (yes, I&amp;#39;ve had one before where I said no entirely, but when she got on top and took her clothes off, I let it happen - was back in September 2016) and I have also taken screenshots of our textual exchange the day after. The exchange clearly shows that I told her no and she intentionally did it anyway. If at all relevant, this exchange also made me realize that she has an abusive personality. She switched actively between being aggressive/mean to gentle/sweet in a fashion eerily similar to how emotional abusers do in abusive relationships (had to study it for an acting gig once, that is why I recognize it). She first blamed me for what happened and then went splitsies 50%/50% blame. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; - Seeing doctor, police and a friend who is a lawyer. Wrote a detailed statement about our two sexual encounters and took screendumps of our textual conversations, which provide proof of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4&lt;/strong&gt; - I went to see the police, down at the station. Made an &amp;quot;affidavit&amp;quot;. Apparently that is also my only option, as she technically didn&amp;#39;t commit a crime in the eyes of the law. Unless there is physical violence or threats of violence, it isn&amp;#39;t rape and there is no legislation to the scenario/predicament I am in. So that is that. But the report is in their systems, should it ever be needed in a court of law.
