Hysto can cure adenomyosis which is something in the uterus only, and/or hysto can lessen pain if the uterus is a pain generator for any reason, but Endo lesions that aren&amp;#39;t on the uterus will remain the same and just as painful after hysterectomy. Many women have had hysterectomies for almost no reason due to this faulty treatment of Endo. Excision (NOT ablation) of the Endo lesions is the only true treatment, I&amp;#39;ve learned. There might be reasons for hysterectomy, but just Endo isn&amp;#39;t one of them most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just spreading the word, because 10% of women are affected, and you never know when it will come up with a friend, sister, niece, Aunt, etc...
