This &amp;quot;decreases&amp;quot; the wait time to get on the train at high traffic stops by spreading some of it to low traffic stops. The farther you have to go the closer you come to what would have been the original wait time in high traffic stops if people simply stayed on until reaching their destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I could do a diatribe about how this doesn&amp;#39;t actually save 90ish percent of people any time but it makes the stops look more uniform so people are less bitchy about certain areas having giant lines)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) Encourage you to visit all parts of the park because why not you have to get off in that section anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D) Discourage people from riding the transit system arbitrarily.
