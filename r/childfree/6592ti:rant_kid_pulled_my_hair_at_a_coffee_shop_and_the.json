dogs.\n\nMy brother and I were sharing a two-bedroom apartment in college. We rented out mattress space in the living room to save on expenses.\n\nA good friend set up a mattress on the living room floor, hung some curtains around it, and tacked a star chart to the ceiling, and made it his bedroom.\n\nIt was in the Sierra Nevada in California, and one of our friends from the SF Bay Area came to visit us in the mountains. She brought her dog along, a bodacious Red Setter, and slept on the couch on the opposite side of the living room from him for a couple of days. The dog mostly kept by her side, but sometimes would go over to our roommate when he was sleeping and lick his face and wake him up and he hated it.\n\nWhen he complained about it, she would just laugh like, \"Isn't he cute?\" and pretend it wasn't a problem. It irritated him to no end that she didn't even bother to train or reprimand her medium-large, but friendly, dog.\n\nAlso the dog was kind of weird. He loved to nuzzle in our guest's crotch, and nuzzled the crotches of our fellow female friends from college whenever they came over. Being three single college boys, we had various women dropping by all the time. And the dog would immediately greet every girl who showed up by nuzzling her crotch at the door and then, if she sat down in the living room/dining room, which was pretty much the only place a girl could go other than standing in the tiny kitchen or going into one of the bedrooms of my brother and I and sitting on one of the beds, which would have been kind of inappropriate unless it was generally understood that she was there for sex instead of heading out to a class or a party or a bar or wherever, which happened sometimes but nowhere near as often as my brother and I wished... she would sit down on the sofa or a chair and every few minutes would come over and nuzzle and show he wanted to lick her crotch. The dog didn't do this with guys, only with gals.\n\nNeedless to say, this tended to make everybody uncomfortable. Extremely so. Except for his owner, who would just giggle and say something about how cute he was.\nWe lived in a beautiful area with canyons, forests, rocky cliffs, and plenty of creeks. Great place to go hiking and walking. One day our guest went hiking with some newfound friends from the college and, of course, her dog. The went walking across a long bridge spanning a gorgeous canyon with a rocky rapid river at the bottom. One side of the two-lane bridge also had a sidewalk on it overlooking the downstream view and the other side had no sidewalk, but looking upstream was a pretty nice view, too. The river was about 300 feet below.\n\nThe bridge had a waist-high metal barrier on both sides, with the same style and height barrier on the sidewalk side between the roadway and the sidewalk. So three metal fences on the bridge.\n\nMy brother might have been in school or maybe was out walking on the bridge with the guest. The living room resident and I were relaxing at home between or after classes, I don't remember those details. So this other girl arrives and breathlessly tells us what just happened about five miles away down the curvy mountain road and on the bridge above the canyon.\n\nOur friend recounted it pretty much like this: they had driven down to the bridge, hiked down to the river and gone skinny dipping (the norm for hippie kids like us back in the late seventies.) Then they went up high on the mountainside and started walking across the bridge.\n\nThe Red Setter, with boundless energy even though after a good swim in a fast-flowing river, was hopping from the people he was accompanying over the fence onto the road (very little traffic, so that was reasonably safe) and then back over the fence to be with his people. He did this various times and was getting some great exercise, and most of the people hoped that he would later relax and pass out and stop licking everybody and nuzzling all the ladies' crotches, which didn't seem to be awkward for the dog or his owner, but eveybody else felt weird about it.\n\nSo the dog was bouncing back and forth over the fence between the sidewalk and the road exuberantly. Then he ran to the other side of the road and leaped over that *fence*, perhaps expecting a sidewalk to land on or maybe feeling suicidal.  Whatever, he then fell three hundred feet into the rocky rapids far below.\n\nThat's what the girl breathlessly recounted to me and my roommate.\n\nRoomie thought about that dog. Thought about how it would wake him up licking his face. Thought about how his owner never taught that dog a damn bit of discipline, even when the dog displayed a proclivity for licking anybody, but especially human pussy. And how it jumped off a bridge to its death to the horror of his irresponsible owner and, perhaps, lover.\n\nAnd within thirty seconds my roommate started laughing. His laugh turned into a roar of hilarity. Tears of joy and hilarity began streaming down his face. I had to smile and began to laugh, not as wildly as he was, but I have to admit even now that it was pretty funny.\n\nAfter a few moments of watching us laughing, the messenger girl asked us if we were going to call anybody. I asked her who we should call. If we called 911 or any other org for help they'd just laugh at us. We could be 90% sure that the dog died upon impact and 99% sure that it died within two minutes of impact. Nobody was going to go on a fool's mission to rescue an idiot dead dog that had almost certainly already been swept downriver by the strong current.\n\nShe smiled and began to giggle. There we were, the three of us in the living room, laughing together. My roommate was alternating between normal laughter and fits of mad hilarity.\n\nOh, those college days! I don't want to go back, but I kinda miss them.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of people already do this or things like this with their dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother and I were sharing a two-bedroom apartment in college.

Of course, after an hour or two of drinking and chatting with the father in the home, the kid seemed to be quite comfortable with me and snuggled up against me on the couch. It felt good.\n\nSuddenly, out of nowhere; he bit me hard on the arm. My reflex was to immediately react kind of violently by smashing my arm against this sharp-toothed baby and knocking him against the wall.\n\nHe started crying, of course, but both his mother and father assured me that my knee-jerk reaction was appropriate and their kid had to learn one way or another what appropriate behavior was.\n\nAnother time I was hitchhiking in Montana. I got picked up by a guy with waist-length hair in a pick-up truck dressed in buckskin shirt and pants and moccasin boots. He had a couple of old-fashioned rifles on the rack in the back window and at least one pistol on the dash.\n\nHe was all jazzed after a weekend at a \"Rondevous\" where white folks go to  celebrate early frontier life on the prairie and in the mountains back in the old days. They have black powder musket and pistol contests, also contests where they compare homemade clothing made from game you shot and skinned and tanned and stitched yourself, homemade recipes from wild game that you provide samples of, etc. Kind of like they try to re-live the lives of mountain men like Jim Bridger.\n\nI was fascinated by his stories.  I asked him lots of questions about it and he liked that. We arrived at the  small town where he lived and he invited me for a beer. Immediately upon arrival at the bar I learned that his idea of a \"beer\" included a shot of whiskey, too.\n\nSo, we had a few \"beers\" and then he invited me to sleep on the couch. I readily accepted as it was after dark and I was kind of drunk and we went to his very modest home. He introduced me to his wife who didn't seem all that happy to see a homeless dude in her living room, but didn't make a scene. He introduced me to his son, who was about six years old, and the kid seemed like he didn't care who was in the house but glad that daddy  was back home.\n\nSo the guy brings out a fifth, or maybe a quart of whiskey, sets it on the coffee table, a couple of shot glasses, and goes out to start unloading his truck. I offer to help, but he says that most of it can wait until tomorrow but he wants to unload the guns and bring them inside for the night.\n\nI'm certainly not one to argue with anybody who prefers to handle their own guns. Sleeping bags or coolers of beer I want to help with, whatever other than weapon. So I had another shot of whiskey while he brought the guns in.\n\nHe took the guns into the bedroom and came back and pulled up a chair opposite the sofa and we commenced to resume our chatting. It was obvious he wasn't hitting on me sexually but we really connected on our love of mountains and wildlife and whiskey.\n\nSuddenly his little child came in and walked up to me, laughing and smiling and babbling. The baby had a pistol in his hand, barely able to hold it up, but waving the pistol around and sometimes it got pointed at me. My immediate reaction was to smack that firearm out of his hand and it clattered across the wooden floor of the shack.\n\nThe gun didn't fire, fortunately. The child cried, naturally, and his daddy took him upon his lap and consoled him, naturally.\n\nI was kind of nervous. It was too late to hitchhike out of a small town and I had no idea where to find a place to sleep even though I had my sleeping bag.\n\nBut his daddy smiled at me and said, \"You did the right thing!\" He explained that he would put the kid to bed and the guns away in a safe place and be back for one last shot and go to bed.\n\nSo I relaxed, had another shot, then he came back in and we both had another shot together, and then he left the bottle on the table and went off to bed with his wife.\n\nIn the morning, on his way to work, he dropped me off at a decent place to hitch from. Edge of town, easy location to pull over if you want to. Got a ride out pretty quick.\n\nFolks in Montana are real nice.
