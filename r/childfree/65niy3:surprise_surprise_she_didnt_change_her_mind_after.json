She was fairly good looking, I was definitely &amp;quot;dating up&amp;quot;.

More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about 2 weeks of casual dating I brought the topic of kids up.  Like the rest of you, I am team no kids.  I don&amp;#39;t like to ask right away while dating, as it&amp;#39;s fun to just date for the sake of meeting people and having a good time.  But if I see things progressing beyond something casual then I try to slip it into conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, she says something along the lines of &amp;quot;Well sure, of course I want them, doesn&amp;#39;t everyone?&amp;quot;  She asked me the same thing and I say that in fact, no I do not want kids.  I explained how I slowly came to that realization over many years.  She seemed intrigued because I think I short circuited her brain with the knowledge that everybody does not need to bear children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well stupid me didn&amp;#39;t call it off right then and there, we finished our date even though I had checked out of the relationship.  Keep in mind this was still just casual dating, so I sent her a text a little bit afterward saying that I was sorry but I didn&amp;#39;t think it would work out.  Having children is one of the very few things that cannot be compromised on in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She immediately called me, said I had opened her eyes, and that she no longer wanted kids.  I told her that while I believed there was some truth to that, it&amp;#39;s not a decision that should be made spur of the moment.  I said I felt it would be better for her to come to this decision on her own than to change because of what I said.  I told her it was fun, but I was standing my ground.  We ended the conversation (I had to basically just hang up), and she started texting me.  I responded to the first couple but it got weird so I stopped.  For some reason, since I live alone, having an alibi popped into my head so I went to the local 24 hour supermarket and wandered for a few hours leaving my phone in my car.  Did you know that the most calories in a single item was a 2 gallon jar of mayonnaise at over 48,000?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What followed was about 200 text messages and voicemails. \nShe went to my house and wanted me to let her in, yay supermarket idea!  The rest were her professing her love for me and she would do anything to be with me.  Mind you, I am a fat, balding, 30 (at the time) year old, so this has never happened before.  Eventually it tapered off.  I never responded, changed her contact name in my phone to Crazy TextsALot, backed everything up just in case, and went to my parents for the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully she stopped and apparently moved on, but just this past week I got a friend request from her on Facebook.  I had totally forgotten her and accepted without realizing it was her.  Her profile picture was at a weird angle and had a baby in it... guess what it was hers!  I just unfollowed her but left her as a friend to see what drama it would stir up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She eventually messaged me asking if I remembered her, I replied affirmative.  She asked if I wanted to meet up, and I declined.  I said it would be awkward because I don&amp;#39;t want to date someone with a kid.  She said she just wanted to be friends, she doesn&amp;#39;t want to date either because she is engaged to the kid&amp;#39;s father!  At this point I just blocked her because it&amp;#39;s too weird and wrote this post.
