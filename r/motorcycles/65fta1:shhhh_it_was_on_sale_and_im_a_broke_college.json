Hotel was moldy, food sucked, people were zombies, extreme poverty, fucking shitty tourists leaving diapers buried in the fucking sand, barely seen any fish, hotel restaurants were open for weird as hours only and only half open each day which creates more lines of bitchy tourists, hotel staff were also zombified fucking morons...i tried to stay positive and have fun but it was kinda difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But i did have a bunch of fun doing shit alone like hiking and smoking dirt weed w pretty scenic overlooks and exploring the ocean floor. Several times w left the compound and ventured into the surrounding cities. A little disappointing but was still one of those adventure things. Afghanistan had better food, better AC, better people, more shit to do...i dont wanna sound bitchy but Jamaica just waant that fun for the amount of money i spent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgbz5ea", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492374404.0, "created_utc": 1492345604.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dganqow", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TimeToFloat", "parent_id": "t1_dgakzaw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's so bad about Jamaica?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s so bad about Jamaica?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dganqow", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292964.0, "created_utc": 1492264164.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgakzaw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeadDuck32", "parent_id": "t1_dga0sgt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lol i just said i would rather be in Afghanistan again rather than Jamaica.
