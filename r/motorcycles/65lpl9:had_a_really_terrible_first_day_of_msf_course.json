What many inexperienced people do, even with a manual car, is to let the clutch out all the way. If you're learning how to handle a clutch, then you need to slip the clutch. Yes, you've heard that slipping the clutch will wear it out, however, the clutch can take a lot of abuse. Over time, as your skills improved, you'll learn to slip the clutch less.\n\nRegardless, with any clutch vehicles, you need to slip it to get it moving. The other issues that I notice that beginners do is when they work the throttle, what they do is blipping the throttle, when they really shouldn't. What you need to do is to practice how to hold the throttle so that the engine is at a certain RPM.\n\nThat's the first thing. Learn how to control the engine's RPM with just the throttle. You can practice that concept with an automatic car. Go into your car, turn it on, leave it in park, and play with the throttle so that you can precisely get the engine RPM to a certain number and hold it there. Practice with getting the engine to hold the RPM at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, 4000 rpm, down to 2500 rpm, down to 1500 rpm, up to 4000 rpm. Things like that.\n\nThe same concept will apply to a motorcycle. Steady throttle is how you get moving.\n\nNow, for the clutch. Like I said. what you need to do is slip the clutch in order to know what a \"friction zone\" actually is. The friction zone is when the bike actually starts moving.\n\nSo to find the friction zone, what you do is to turn the throttle so that the engine RPM is around 1500 rpm or so. Remember the throttle practice you did early. Hold that engine RPM at 1500. Then, slowly release the clutch until the bike starts moving forward, then hold the clutch exactly there. That is the friction zone, and you are now slipping the clutch. With the throttle still at the same hand position, let the clutch out a little more, and hold it, then a little more, and hold it, keep doing that until it's released all the way.\n\nThat is the concept of slipping the clutch and getting going. This same concept applies to a manual car. Eventually, as your skills improved, you will slip the clutch a lot less and get a perfect roll on every single time.\n\nSo the big picture is: Hold the throttle and slip the clutch to get going.

So with more experience, I had more rigorous training on better equipment.\n\nSo no, I had no problems. Once you get a working bike and some time, neither will you.\n\nIf I were you, I would look for alternative training more along the lines we do it in the EU. Yes it will be more expensive but the goal should be to learn to ride well not just to get a piece of paper. \n\nYou can ride a bike with stalling/idling issues but not if it is your first time. So forget everything about this experience, it isn't (or shouldn't be) the norm and find a school were you are given more time, less pressure and a decent bike.\n\nAs a side note, while we have age restrictions on bike sizes, once you pass the age limit, instructors advice to go for the big bikes. And when you do, you are not allowed to train or test on a lighter bike. Even for beginners. Kawasaki ER-6n is a very common bike I see people taking lessons on. It is hardly a gigantic bike but it has plenty of power and still is used for peoples first lessons. So I wouldn't worry about your size/weight to much. Once you are riding, the weight just disappears.\n\nWhen pushing the bike, getting it going can involve a bit of effort but you should be working with the bike, not against it. \n\nAnd again, some patient 1 on 1 instruction can show you how to do this but with 12 other people there, you will feel to stressed to take it all in and the instructor... well frankly if they can't see that a bike is stalling just idling and fix it or replace it, the instructor isn't that good. \n\nThe MSF really sounds to me like a cheap way to get a piece of paper. Not as a good way to learn to ride from scratch.

So forget everything about this experience, it isn&amp;#39;t (or shouldn&amp;#39;t be) the norm and find a school were you are given more time, less pressure and a decent bike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a side note, while we have age restrictions on bike sizes, once you pass the age limit, instructors advice to go for the big bikes. And when you do, you are not allowed to train or test on a lighter bike. Even for beginners. Kawasaki ER-6n is a very common bike I see people taking lessons on. It is hardly a gigantic bike but it has plenty of power and still is used for peoples first lessons. So I wouldn&amp;#39;t worry about your size/weight to much.
