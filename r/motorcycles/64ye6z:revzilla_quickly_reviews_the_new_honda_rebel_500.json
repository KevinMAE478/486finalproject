In places like Canada, UK, etc, you typically need tens of thousands in liability coverage to cover anything you might do that harms or kills someone, in addition to coverage for loss of income, medical expenses, rehabilitation, etc. Most of this coverage is mandatory. While $18/m sounds great, I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to have your coverage if I got in a serious accident, got sued, and/or lived in a place without universal health care. While rates in Canada are too high in part because of rampant insurance fraud, part of it is also about getting what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dg6fb9m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054811.0, "created_utc": 1492026011.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6axu5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deadpatch", "parent_id": "t1_dg66yzp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a rebel 250 for my lady.
