Yes, you have to remember I am on the public street so I have &lt;em&gt;LOTS&lt;/em&gt; of available traction and braking left during my turn. I am nowhere near sliding or losing it because I have used up all my tire&amp;#39;s ability to keep my bike on the street. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on for a long time and write a chapter on how to turn under all conditions but I think I made my point. Under normal non-racing conditions, you should have plenty of traction left when turning therefore applying brakes in a corner is not a problem and can even be helpful when you find yourself in a situation when you might have to avoid something you didn&amp;#39;t see before. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgdvb7x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481674.0, "created_utc": 1492452874.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voas", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voas", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voas", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1ihy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dwkfym", "parent_id": "t1_dgdxmzs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol hes got stable full of harleys that are excellent at turning and braking ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lol hes got stable full of harleys that are excellent at turning and braking &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dge1ihy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492488686.0, "created_utc": 1492459886.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdxmzs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kylemaoin", "parent_id": "t1_dgdv798", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And yet here you are suggesting it on /r/motorcycles...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet here you are suggesting it on &lt;a href=\"/r/motorcycles\"&gt;/r/motorcycles&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgdxmzs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484301.0, "created_utc": 1492455501.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voas", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1hsw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dwkfym", "parent_id": "t1_dgdv798", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like I said, if you're doing both at the same time you aren't braking as hard as you need to be in a situation like this.
