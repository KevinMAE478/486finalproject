Do you have a track near you? You could probably try MiniGPs if they&amp;#39;re available. I drove 6 hours to do it because I didn&amp;#39;t have my bike with me AND because it&amp;#39;s a rental so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about my bike getting crashed. I got to focus more into just trying to improve my riding. I DID lowside the MiniGP bike during the 4th session. Picked it up, started it and carried on with a few more laps. That made me really glad it wasn&amp;#39;t my R1 that got lowsided. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgdalv4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492448203.0, "created_utc": 1492419403.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdagap", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "navyjoe1987", "parent_id": "t3_65tzl7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Want to get into track stuff one day just need to figure out how to get started.
