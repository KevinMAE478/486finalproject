Before I rode and when I was starting out I watched Walteriffic, C2W, 6ft4, Snowcat etc. thinking I could pick up good tips, learning about riding without being on the bike and so on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more I rode the less I ended up watching and I&amp;#39;ve unsubbed to all of them as it&amp;#39;s all the same exaggerated click bait bullshit. It&amp;#39;s frustrating when they would &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/LsLn3uRSD2k?t=2m15s\"&gt;get cut up&lt;/a&gt; and flip their shit; at first I was like &amp;quot;Fucking cagers&amp;quot; but now I&amp;#39;m like, there were several things you could have done to avoid that, and several other ways you could have handled it better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is people (definitely more inexperienced and impressionable riders) prefer the personality vloggers because it looks cool, feeds the douchebag &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m on a bike so I&amp;#39;m the best road user here&amp;quot; mentality and the hype of OMG CAR DRIVER ALMOST KILLS ME tickles peoples addiction for drama.
