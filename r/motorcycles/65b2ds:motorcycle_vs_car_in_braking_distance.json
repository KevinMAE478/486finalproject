The rear brake stabilizes the bike and adds extra braking power right up until the rear wheel lifts, which is never for the majority of people.  It&amp;#39;s also a much more functional brake on a cruiser, which has a much lower CG and a lot more weight on the rear tire than other bikes.  Also it&amp;#39;s important to use it for slow maneuvers, tightening a line a little bit in a corner, etc.  It&amp;#39;s a control brake more than a stopping brake, and you shouldn&amp;#39;t ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dg9rnic", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233433.0, "created_utc": 1492204633.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b2ds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b2ds", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9p1od", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheDevilLLC", "parent_id": "t1_dg9eopk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Exactly!

So if you are leaned over even slightly and mash those brakes, you are going down, ABS or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So practice, practice, and then when you got panic breaking down, go so some more practice. Empty office park lots on the weekend are great for this &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, when you see grandma pulling into your path after she ran the stop sign... snap that bike up straight and get a death-grip on the front lever while you mash that rear brake pedal. The ABS will do a far better job of generating maximum braking than any of us could ;-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dg9pnv8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230978.0, "created_utc": 1492202178.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b2ds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b2ds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b2ds", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgab3gd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boomerangchampion", "parent_id": "t1_dg9v7e0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Perhaps I wasn't clear, but I meant that you should pull it in as you're coming to a stop rather than immediately.\n\nRegardless, if you're going 100% with the brakes I don't think engine braking is going to add very much", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I wasn&amp;#39;t clear, but I meant that you should pull it in as you&amp;#39;re coming to a stop rather than immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, if you&amp;#39;re going 100% with the brakes I don&amp;#39;t think engine braking is going to add very much&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgab3gd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492260985.0, "created_utc": 1492232185.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9v7e0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "test_test_1_2_3", "parent_id": "t1_dg9nfze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 1, "body": "You absolutely do not pull in the clutch assuming we're talking about an emergency stop.
