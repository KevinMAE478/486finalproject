The police force here has been stretched so thin that motorcycle theft isn&amp;#39;t a high priority, which as annoying and disheartening as it sounds, is true. There are much more violent and worse crimes being committed that demand the polices attention more than a bit of stolen property. &amp;#39;We used to hang horse thieves&amp;#39; etc aside, It&amp;#39;s horrible to think someone can take your pride and joy but in the grand scheme of things, you&amp;#39;ve lost a bit of property that you most likely had theft insurance on, being that insurance is mandatory in the UK. The country isn&amp;#39;t going to grind to a halt because someones bike got stolen. The no chase policy is frustrating and in my opinion a little too PC, but isn&amp;#39;t a direct link to immigration either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should blame the USA. More than enough bikes get stolen here &amp;#39;cos the youth here want to imitate that dumb ass BikeLife shit Americans in the same economic situation do. I guess you guys just blame Mexicans for that though /s&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgcm53l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492407400.0, "created_utc": 1492378600.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 51}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qw3x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qw3x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5mef", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CaptainSirDoctor", "parent_id": "t1_dgcvfmc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In the same vein someone holding their wallet up in the US will get shot because the police assume it's a gun.
