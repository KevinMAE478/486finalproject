I will almost guarantee it's a total loss for a number of reasons that I will get to here in a minute.\n\nBut first; an estimator can only write up a repair for damage that can be seen, so for example if you hit a wall with your car and the hood caved in on the core support I would have to get the hood open to verify the damage to the support and accessory bits like an ac condenser before I can write that up on an estimate. I know that that's what happened under the hood but insurance needs me to verify that, so a lot of times with extensive damage they request a partial dissassembly of the vehicle to make sure it doesn't go over 70% of the value of the vehicle. If the damage is wayyy below the value and we start the repair and notice additional damage, that information gets sent to the insurance for a comp from them, but it has to be verified or the insurance won't pay for it. Also remember that everything costs money; the time it's spent in the shop getting dissembled, the time the pieces are getting prepped and painted, the time the items are curing, the cost of paint and materials, labor to reinstall, that all comes at a price and that ain't cheap. \n\nThere are a multitude of factors that add costs quickly. it will almost certainly have to be new oem as finding used pieces for bikes is difficult depending on location and oem aint cheap. Oem tank, fairings, and accessory bits will cost a lot more than what you think, and then they have to be prepped, decalled, painted, and installed. Shop labor is 45-60 an hour, paint time is 25-50 an hour depending on if it's in the booth or curing, and THEN materials cost a certain amount per hour. They don't bill materials by the job, its a flat hourly rate so even if it only required 8 oz of base compared to a galllon for a car it is still being billed at the same rate per each hour it is in the booth. That's just how the cookie crumbles, there is no other metric that better determines shop cost of materials.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the frame gets a scratch on it it can totally total a bike, regardless of if the frame is actually damaged or not. That because per shop labor rates it generally requires a complete disassembly of the bike to respray the frame. To insurance the vehicle needs to be in \"like new\" condition, so that is factored in according protocol of how to \"properly\" fix the scratch even if you or I could easily mask off the area and fix it for a fraction of the price. That is very very common actually. A lot of people will buy the bike back from insurance and either deal with the salvage title or fix it them selves and get it inspected to get a rebuilt title.\n\nNow onto this case in particular, we are only seeing on photo of half of one side of the bike so it is very hard to judge but a few things to consider. First this is not a new bike, it was new to the owner but the bike is probably an 09 which is now 8 years old with a decent amount of miles, so the value of the bike is what 4-7K ( totally arbitrary number mind you) depending on area and condition? Now realize that insurance has a threshold of 70% of the value, so now we are talking about 2.8-5k allotted for repair. That's not a lot to do what I described earlier for a shop, and that only accounting for what I can see in this single photo, if the triple or forks are fucked ( and they most likely are) then that's a whole new ball of wax that is generally a death sentence for an older bike.\n\nSorry for the long winded response but I felt it necessary to chime in since you weren't understanding. You or I **could** fix this for much much less than a shop if the frame isn't bent, we could source all used parts and then work on it as a project and get it back to it's former glory for less than $1500 depending on price and availability of used components( tank, fairings, triple, forks). But what you and I could do in my garage over a few weeks does not equate to what a shop that is licensed and insured can get done a matter of days.\n\nTL;DR: Specialized trades cost money, a lot of money.
