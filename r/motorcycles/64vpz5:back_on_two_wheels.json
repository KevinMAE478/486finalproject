A week later I woke up again, groggy as hell, starving and with the worst taste in my mouth. And a mullet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had had a subarachnoid brain hemorrhage. It caused me to stroke, which caused my brain to bleed more, which skyrocketed my blood pressure which caused another stroke. Rinse and repeat thru several strokes and the neurosurgeon decided that if I were to live, I needed to be comatose for a hot (actually pretty cold) minute. A week later they brought me out of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had atrophied quite bad. I couldn&amp;#39;t lift my hands to scratch my nose. My awesome hair had been shaved off to crack into my skull. My nose was all scabbed up from breathing via a tube. I had a tube shoved into my dinger to let me pee. I went from a guy who would carry a hundred pounds worth of sandbags while running, to a guy who couldn&amp;#39;t even stand up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I was let out of the hospital, some weeks later, my dad was telling me it was time to give my bike some much needed love. I didn&amp;#39;t think it was worth it. I had already planned on putting it on CL. Those days were done. Everyone in the hospital told me that even at a full recovery, it wasn&amp;#39;t a wise thing to do. Getting back on the horse was considered stupid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we had my follow up with my neurosurgeon. After another battery of CT scans and MRIs and the like, it seemed that I had healed up inside (almost) perfectly. My dad who sat in at the appointment asked him &amp;quot;Does that mean I can ride with my son again?&amp;quot; My doc smiled when he said yes. And that there was no reason why I couldn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we put my beloved and trusty 95 Shadow 1100 ACE on the lift. In six years I had ridden that thing coast to coast and she had seen Mexico and Canada several times each. I got her at 8,000 and she now had 70,000+. She had a particular look that made her recognizable that came from the last owner, now we were rebuilding from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the two months on the lift (mostly spent because my pops was unfortunately out of town and he was in charge of painting) I put new head gaskets on, fixed my oil leak, rebuilt my wiring harness for the back half, retapped all my stripped threads, replaced handlebars and grips, all new blinkers repositioned, had the seat reupholstered, rebuilt and rejetted the carbs, repainted, made her solo and made my throw over bags permanent. Plus a few more cosmetic things. She was ready to ride. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember how I snuck in the (almost) when I referenced healing perfectly? I had two setbacks while doing this. The first is that I could only be on my feet for 3 or so hours a day before I was wore out. I was doing an hour of physical or occupational therapy every day, so by the time I got to the shop, I was already at 50%. And the second was my memory. I had become a goldfish. The past was pretty good but I forgot things in big chunks. Like I can remember my first grade music teacher&amp;#39;s name, but I had forgotten how to play guitar. Ever see Momento? It felt like that. But instead of tattoos, I had 2 complete bricks worth of post it notes all over the shop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the shadow forum and YouTube, I powered through and now my bike screams across the highways running better than she has for years. \nI took my first ride last weekend and was surprised that I was able to ride for over 8 hours. I felt truly alive again for the first time since my brain farted a bit too hard. The first time I&amp;#39;ve been able to feel like me again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve reassembled my camping gear and packed it on my bike to check out the fitting. Everything is perfect and I&amp;#39;m itching to hit the road. I&amp;#39;m almost 40 and have been riding since I was 8. Some people just don&amp;#39;t understand how important it is throwing your knees into the wind. 6 months ago I lost myself and my life. Last weekend I found it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if anyone is in MN and likes to ride, camp, hike and fish, hit me up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my story.
