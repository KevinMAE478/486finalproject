Already motorcycles are an easy target for politicians that want to look like they&amp;#39;re doing something.  A friend works for the CDN federal government and his employer is looking at preventing fed employees from using motorcycles to get to work.  The external messaging is because of employee safety.  Betting internal messaging is cost cutting related to insurance and workman&amp;#39;s comp.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the risk of upsetting some, I think every time one chooses to put loud pipes on a bike or dress up like a hell&amp;#39;s angels, it just erodes public sympathy.

Other new-rider searches like &lt;a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=motorcycle%20cost\"&gt;motorcycle cost&lt;/a&gt; are up, but training queries like &lt;a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=learn%20to%20ride%20a%20motorcycle\"&gt;learn to ride a motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=motorcycle%20training\"&gt;motorcycle training&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=MSF%20class\"&gt;MSF class&lt;/a&gt; are down over the last several years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think electric bikes will start to be much more popular in various segments, especially scooters and midweight bikes.  I think we&amp;#39;ll see the first trials bikes with electric drives too.  We might see a hybrid but I doubt it would be successful- that adds a lot of weight for not as much benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cities will face increasing congestion problems.  It&amp;#39;s possible some cities might start to encourage motorcycle ridership as a result, but this might not happen in America&amp;#39;s current safety-everywhere culture.  Hopefully motorcycle groups step up their advocacy efforts in this regard.&lt;br/&gt;\nI do expect to see a great increase in &amp;#39;electric mobility gadgets&amp;#39;- powered skateboard/hoverboard type gadgets, electric bicycles, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the prototype tech we see shown off (like Honda Riding Assist) will trickle down into the high end segment.  This will be expensive, but a lot of riders will dislike it because it brings the rider farther away from the road.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ABS will start to be a standard thing and not a moment too soon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "name": "t1_dgcf2ws", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492398207.0, "created_utc": 1492369407.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfko", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcdl69", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LordOverThis", "parent_id": "t3_65qfko", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/motorcycles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "On two wheels.
