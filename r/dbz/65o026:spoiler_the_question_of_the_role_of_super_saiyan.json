Blanket term for accelerated healing, enhanced senses and the power to phase. Yeah, he can essentially become incorporeal if you would even be able to somehow land a blow on him; or if he didn't feel like running around an obstacle, he can just go through it. \n\n* Speed Force Aura. Basically means he's immune to the effects of \"gotta go fast.\" Also protects them from kinetic impacts in case they trip or something, ya know\n\n* Superhuman stamina\n\n* Superhuman speed. This one is a given. note: also includes superhuman reflexes and agility in case you missed it.\n\n* Vortex creations. \"Speed Force conduits are able to create vortices of air by running in circles or rotating their extremities at super-speed. These vortices can be used for a number of effects.\"\n\n* Enhanced Mental Process. \"Barry's mental capacities are greatly enhanced by the Speed Force, allowing him to think at the speed of light and perceive events that last less than an attosecond.\" Do you even *know* what an [attosecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attosecond) is? It seems like the writer was just reaching for words but it's there, it's a thing.\n\n*  Flight. This isn't shown often but him and another Speedster can essentially fly.\n\n* Interstellar Travel. \"One of the most advanced ways Speed Force users fly is by directing ones own atomic-molecular motion in the direction one wishes to travel in, e.i. syncing his vibrational frequency with those of ultra-light waves to traverse planetary distances with ease.\" Oh, and they can do this.\n\n* Electrokinesis. They generate lightning when they gotta go fast. They can utilize this lightning in offensive ways as well.\n\n* Negate Anti-Life Equation. \"Barry is capable of negating the effects of Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation, through physical contact of his Speed Force energy.\" For the record, the Anti-Life Equation is essentially the equation for **DEATH,** hence it's name. Yes, Barry is immune to it. Guess why? *He outran death*. No I'm not joking.\n\n* Time Travel. Barry is fast enough to travel through time. And yeah, he can, has, and definitely will again, change/d the time lines. \n\n*  Dimensional Travel. He's fast enough to travel through dimensions as well.\n\n-------------\n\nSo like, how the fuck does he ever lose? Why does it look like he ever breaks a sweat? The dude is *literally* speed incarnate.\n\nHis nephew Wally, in a recent comic ran across the US, border to border (and then some), in less than *3 seconds.* HOW DOES ANYONE DO ANYTHING AGAINST THAT?
