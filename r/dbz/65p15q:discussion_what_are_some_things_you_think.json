Considering all the powerups in the show as strict multipliers that are compounded on top of each other quickly leads to fairly ludicrous numbers, especially comparing across sagas.  I prefer to think of them as adding a somewhat set amount to a character&amp;#39;s base power level rather than being multipliers, although that amount can change with training.  In this view, current Goku is a few hundreds (or being generous thousands) of times stronger than he was the first time he went Super Saiyan, rather than billions or whatever the formal powerscaling math would come up with, and which doesn&amp;#39;t fit visually with anything we&amp;#39;re actually shown.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(The &amp;quot;universe-destroying shockwaves&amp;quot; between Goku and Beerus may have been an attempt to give lip service to the formal power scaling, but it&amp;#39;s an idea that seems to have been pretty quickly abandoned, despite supposedly much higher-powered fights later)         &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dgckhja", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492405236.0, "created_utc": 1492376436.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc8ww2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oldmangonzo", "parent_id": "t3_65p15q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The best and worst part of Super are the same: the creators don't care about power levels any more.\n\nThis is great, because now the focus is on telling the best story possible.
