The cropping.  Dragon Ball Z is a 4:3 show.  It was made to be a 4:3 show.  The shots were composed with 4:3 in mind and, as such, look their best in 4:3.  The Orange Bricks (and the blu-ray seasons) have the picture cropped to 16:9.  So you lose large chunks of the top and bottom of the screen, and the cropping results in awkward framing in several shots because, again, the show was made in 4:3 and composed for 4:3, not 16:9.\n\nTo compound how annoying this artistically-insulting practice was, before the blu-ray seasons were released, FUNimation released a survey that even asked what aspect ratio people would prefer.  4:3 won, FUNimation simply ignored those results, and released the show again in 16:9 anyway.\n\n2.  Grain removal.  Dragon Ball Z is from 1989.  It was stored on film.  As such, the picture has (or should have) film grain; i.e. the physical texture of the film.  The Orange Bricks (and the blu-ray seasons) have an automated noise filter applied to remove the grain to make the picture appear in a pseudo-modern \"clean\" look, which ultimately damages a lot of picture detail.  It's especially problematic during camera shakes (which are very common in a show like Dragon Ball Z) because the filter tends to mistake linework in the drawings as video noise, and starts erasing it.  Example (Dragon Box on the left, Orange Brick on the right): http://i37.tinypic.com/2ecmzcm.png\n\n3.  Blown out colours.  The colours in most of the Orange Bricks are very oversaturated, resulting in crushed whites and blacks (i.e. where anything lightly coloured becomes  white, and anything darkly coloured becomes black).  This also makes a lot of picture detail invisible.  The easiest example of this is probably Vegeta's hair.  In the animation cels, it was coloured a very dark, just off-black, brown (note I am *not* referring to his originally filler appearance, where his hair was a bright, reddish brown).  In the Orange Bricks, you'd never be able to tell, as it just gets crushed out to pure black.  The same thing happens with Raditz, whose hair is actually a very dark blue on the cels.\n\nBackgrounds lose detail due to this too.  Things like clouds that had well-painted shading done in light blue tones get blown out into white mush.  Darkly painted areas with lots of detail become just pure black.\n\nSeason 2 is the absolute worst on this front, largely chalked up to FUNimation's film masters for that chunk of the show apparently being rather poor.  Season 6-9, however, show significant improvement on the colours.\n\n4.  Audio-leveling.  This one doesn't get talked about as much, and probably because it's a very inconsistent issue, but there are times in the US Broadcast track (i.e. the one with Faulconer music) where the music is way louder than the characters.  This makes some of the quieter characters (like Android 17) next to inaudible in some scenes.\n\nAnyway, the blu-ray seasons are...kind of an improvement.  The grain is still filtered out, but it doesn't erase linework.  It does, however, create noticeable boiling on the edges in background paintings.\n\nThe audio tracks are basically the same, but the Japanese mono track has had some digital treatment.\n\nThe colours, however, are kind of all over the place on the blu-rays.  Often better than the Orange Bricks, but sometimes noticeably worse.  There's far too much blue in the picture for a lot of the show (to the point that in episode 95, for example, Gohan's skin is literally a pale blue in several shots).\n\nThe blu-ray seasons also have some technical issues that the Orange Bricks didn't.  In season 1, the ending credits are \"extra-cropped\", so that you're only getting around a quarter of the original picture.  This was fixed in season 2 onwards.  Also, episode 164 is missing the text for its title card.\n\nTL;DR The Orange Bricks were bad.  The blu-ray seasons are better, but still not good.\n\nEDIT: I have no idea what happened to the formatting of this post.  The numbers are correct when I try to edit it (e.g. 4.
