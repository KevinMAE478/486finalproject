Her level of skill was also noted by Muten Roshi who noticed her style resembling his Turtle Hermit style. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Master Mutaito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mutaito was Muten Roshi&amp;#39;s master (now deceased) and he, along with Roshi and Crane Master during their primes, was implied to be even stronger than Goku was during the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.

However, he is clearly a highly-trained master so he can certainly make good gains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Crane Master&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up until his fight with Jackie Chun, Tien was convinced Tsuru-sennin was the strongest fighter out there despite being shown time and time again that the Turtle School fighters weren&amp;#39;t just weak nobodies as well as knowing Goku and Chun definitely put up a better fighter than Yamcha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Grandpa Gohan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though Gohan admitted inferiority to Goku and gave up, he still fought Goku into a stalemate which more than what Tao could do to him in their second match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Tao Pai Pai&lt;/strong&gt; (organic)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the Red Ribbon Army arc, he was known throughout the world as the #1 assassin and with a skill level so frighteningly high, he killed General Blue with just his tongue. He was also the first opponent completely outclass Goku during a fight... so much that even after Goku trained with Korn, he still managed to put up a fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. General Blue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the only member of the RRA that was actually a match for Goku and Krillin, he easily dominated the latter in a fight and went toe-to-toe with the former. He lost in the end, however...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Namu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite his poor life condition in his homeland, Namu proved quite strong as he countered Goku&amp;#39;s Zanzoken and fought almost on par with the boy. In fact, he probably would have won if it wasn&amp;#39;t for his naturally high resilience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Gyumao&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much is known about Gyumao strength-wise other than the fact he was widely-feared across the land, but he was Muten Roshi&amp;#39;s #2 pupil so that must put him above non-superhuman fighters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Bora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, not much is known about Bora strength-wise but he has incredible muscular strength as he bounced bullets with just his body and threw Goku &amp;amp; Yajirobe at incredible heights.

Pamputto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was suggested by Jackie Chun to be the human body at it&amp;#39;s strongest without the assistance of ki control but he seemed like a weakling to Goku and Krillin despite his reputation as he was only someone would seem superhuman to most people and not truly superhuman like the Turtle School or Crane School fighters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. Videl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though her old man is the star, Videl managed to surpass him strength-wise with just self-taught martial arts... at least according to Gohan and she managed to get a hold of ki control/bukujutsu in just 2 weeks showing she could&amp;#39;ve gotten really strong under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. Mr. Satan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Satan and his strength may be a joke in context of the story but still compared to the average fighter, he is quite a beast in his own rights. Claiming the championship of the Tenkaichi Budokai (when no super-strong fighters were participating) and becoming a strong sensation, his ego became increasingly inflated leading to him learning of the secret and very harsh reality that are people stronger than him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.
