When King Piccolo shows up, he &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;, first episode, kills Krillin. He goes on to murder almost every single fighter we&amp;#39;ve come to know, causes the death of Muten Roshi, and &lt;strong&gt;murders&lt;/strong&gt; Shenron, their only real chance at getting the characters we loved back (or so we thought). It&amp;#39;s also made even scarier, and this applies to Freeza as well, when we learn that it&amp;#39;s just his &lt;em&gt;goons&lt;/em&gt;, and that King Piccolo himself dwarfs the enemy that killed Krillin with absolutely no effort. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fights between King Piccolo and Goku actually feel like a threat, and I think that the reason his attacks seem so dangerous is because of how weak Goku is in comparison to how he is in Z and Super. Goku gets debilitated in DB by very fast moving rocks, so an explosive wave that levels an entire city? Probably not gonna survive that. The mayhem King Piccolo causes across the world is also a genuinely scary thing to imagine, because unlike a corrupt God who despises mortals and causes the death of a universe or an evil space tyrant who buys planets to sell them, I can actually somewhat see what King Piccolo did being possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dg7pp64", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126414.0, "created_utc": 1492097614.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6536f4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7yxuf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ElxJ1991", "parent_id": "t3_6536f4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I always thought Imperfect Cell draining the life out of that football team and then that one whole city was pretty horrifying.
