Dokkan Battle artwork likely comes from individual artists, hired by Bandai to make artwork specifically for the game. They likely get paid fairly and have a good relationship with Bandai, as their artwork often appears in other games as well. For example, There is an artist which has done several different Dokkan cards, as well as art for the Xenoverse series, and Dragonball Fusions. He has even done CD covers for Dragonball Music compilations. He has seemingly done artwork for Dokkan Battle from the beginning, and has noticeabley improved a great deal. However, there are some telltale signs that still shine through to prove it's still his artwork.\nHere are some examples.\n\nhttps://dbz.space/cards/1008910-pinich-rival-through-time-and-space\n\nhttps://dbz.space/cards/1003560-majin-buu-ultimate-gohan-eradicator-of-hope\n\nhttps://dbz.space/cards/1004460-krillin-danger-sense\n\nhttps://dbz.space/cards/1002570-super-saiyan-trunks-kid-talented-son\n\nhttps://dbz.space/cards/1002180-krillin-police-officer-protector-of-the-peace\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Tel0OcL.jpg\n\nhttp://pm1.narvii.com/6153/acea20cdd66f3dec1aed5c9c315d23ea2125753e_hq.jpg\n\nhttp://www.kanzenshuu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dbz_20th_century.jpg?x48035\n\nhttp://www.kanzenshuu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chozetsu_dynamic_cover_standard.jpg\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1a/76/7e/1a767e5648e67fa990ae34d689741d4f.jpg\n\nhttp://www.kanzenshuu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fusions_3ds_cover_large.jpg\n\nYou can probably notice that he tends to draw things reasonably close to Yamamuro's character designs, albeit with a more pronounced brow, and a squarer jaw. He tends to keep his shading close together and heavily uses Yamamuro's highlights. In most cases his linework is quite thick but with little variation. He draws hands and muscles quite well, But faces and Hair can seem \"pasted\" together in some examples.\n\nhttp://www.seriesonlinehd.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Banner-Dragon-Ball-Super.jpg\n\nIn this example it's quite easy to see the pronounced brow and jawlines I mentioned earlier. In the case of Goten, his face almost seems square. You can notice that Vegeta and Trunks' hair sits quite high making it look like the character has a much larger forehead than usual. Vegeta's Widow's peak is also slightly off center, resulting in the hair looking a bit more jarring. You can also look at Gohan, Goten, and Goku specifically to see that this artist usually draws rounder ears than Yamamuro would.\n\nAlright so,\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Is it Toyotaro, Toriyama, or Yamamuro? \n\n**No, they have no involvement in Dokkan Battle.**\n\n* Have they ever revealed who creates the art for Dokkan Battle?\n\n**No, not directly.

They likely get paid fairly and have a good relationship with Bandai, as their artwork often appears in other games as well. For example, There is an artist which has done several different Dokkan cards, as well as art for the Xenoverse series, and Dragonball Fusions. He has even done CD covers for Dragonball Music compilations. He has seemingly done artwork for Dokkan Battle from the beginning, and has noticeabley improved a great deal.

He tends to keep his shading close together and heavily uses Yamamuro&amp;#39;s highlights. In most cases his linework is quite thick but with little variation. He draws hands and muscles quite well, But faces and Hair can seem &amp;quot;pasted&amp;quot; together in some examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.seriesonlinehd.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Banner-Dragon-Ball-Super.jpg\"&gt;http://www.seriesonlinehd.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Banner-Dragon-Ball-Super.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this example it&amp;#39;s quite easy to see the pronounced brow and jawlines I mentioned earlier. In the case of Goten, his face almost seems square. You can notice that Vegeta and Trunks&amp;#39; hair sits quite high making it look like the character has a much larger forehead than usual. Vegeta&amp;#39;s Widow&amp;#39;s peak is also slightly off center, resulting in the hair looking a bit more jarring. You can also look at Gohan, Goten, and Goku specifically to see that this artist usually draws rounder ears than Yamamuro would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright so,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is it Toyotaro, Toriyama, or Yamamuro? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, they have no involvement in Dokkan Battle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have they ever revealed who creates the art for Dokkan Battle?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, not directly.

If you would like, feel free to skip it because it will mostly be nitpicky, proportion mumbo-jumbo.\n\n(1)\n\nWell, there are actually several artists who create art for Dokkan Battle, and strangely enough, it seems that they go uncredited for their work. Bandai hires artists to create specific artwork, and the artwork itself is likely bought by Bandai for a predetermined amount so that Bandai owns the rights to the artwork, and not the artist. This may seem shifty, but it's not really uncommon for such contract work to be done in games and animation. So first of all, \n\n-----------------------------------------\n**Artist Style**\n\nNo Dokkan Battle artwork is done by Toyotaro or Toriyama. There are several signature attributes of their penwork which is never present in Dokkan Battle artwork.\n\nMost Dokkan Battle artwork is heavily corrected to represent Tadayoshi Yamamuro's character designs, so I'll compare Yamamuro's artwork to Toriyama and Toyotaro's.\n\n For example, the following artwork is done by Toriyama around the time of Ressurection F's release. \n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/3/3c/Goku_%26_Vegeta_SSGSS_Drawn_By_Toriyama.png/revision/latest?cb=20160625143152\n\nAs you can see, Toriyama prefers drawing characters less muscular than Yamamuro, with rounder trapezoid like eyes, and with very straight eyebrows. Toriyama also uses several small lines for detail which are noticeable around Goku's pants bagging around the knee and below.\n\nHere is a regular example of Yamamuro's artwork.\n\nhttps://sakugabooru.com/post?tags=tadayoshi_yamamuro\n\nYou can notice that Yamamuro usually sharper trapezoids for the eyes, and curves eyebrows towards the ends. He very often shades characters with bright highlights, as opposed to Toriyama's more subdued highlights. Yamamuro makes characters a little bulkier. Yamamuro favors thinner lines than Toriyama, and almost never varies line width. Of course, a lot of people favor Yamamuro's older work, and rightfully so. His recent work is quite different stylistically, but his older work exhibits some much nicer linework, and has proportions which are more accurate to Toriyama's original work.\n\nToyotaro's style is actually pretty unique in comparison to Yamamuro's. While he can closely replicate several facets of Toriyama's style, he also has a great understanding of Yamamuro's older work. \n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3xWzsnUkAEcWFN.jpg\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyhtiYsWIAAcGXO.jpg\n\nExamples like this, show that Toyotaro has an incredible sense of Anatomy, perspective, and composition. Moreso than Yamamuro. However, Toyotaro blends different traits of Toriyama and Yamamuro's styles to create a happy medium.\n\nExamples like this show Toyotaro favoring the rounder softer designs of Toriyama,\n\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/hotlink-crop600x315/herald/35215/dbs01.jpg\n\nWhile an example like this shows a much closer resemblance to Yamamuro's older work.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/600x315/60/df/2f/60df2f92211bc30405952f04b9bff621.jpg\n\nWhen Toyotaro becomes comfortable enough, he stops trying to recreate the styles of Toriyama and Yamamuro and segues into his own noticeable style. He draws characters with smaller torsos similar to Toriyama, but he opts for bulkier muscles similar to Yamamuro. When drawing like this, Yamamuro uses much less small lines for detail and instead uses plenty of effect and motion lines.\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/2/24/Goku_Black_SS_Rosa_Manga_Toyotaro.png/revision/latest?cb=20170123180141&amp;path-prefix=es\n\n-----------------------------------\n**Dokkan Battle Artwork**\n\nAll artwork in Dokkan Battle is not done by the same person. There are many MANY cases of varying quality, which just cannot be done by a single artist.\nHere is a prime example, Super Vegito\n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/9/98/SuperVegito.png/revision/latest?cb=20160906131449\n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/0/01/TURSuperVegito.png/revision/latest?cb=20160906131542\n\nThe first and second art are obviously not by the same person. The second is definitely superior. It has a far better sense of anatomy and body construction, the clothing folds and shading make sense, and the artwork follows Yamamuro's designs to a T. Actually, probably better than Yamamuro himself. The first card art however, has atrocious shading and muscle definition. It's arguable that the artist may not have a great understanding of anatomy, or just doesn't have much understanding of the Dragonball style as a whole. While the facial proportions are, for the most part correct, the eyes aren't drawn well, making the whole thing fall apart. The eyebrows opt for Toriyama's long diagonal style with no curve, and the eyes themselves opt for Yamamuro's sharp trapezoidal shape. The result is a mess. The artist either A) didnt understand the Dragonball style at all, B) Ignored character designs and drew what they pleased, or C) Didn't have the skill or experience to draw it well in the first place.\n\nIt's quite easy to identify different artists among different artwork though. For example,\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/1/19/Artwork_1008540.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161013070244\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/00/42/bc/0042bc914480616b47fe349b8fedf833.jpg\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/0/04/Stained_Rose_Super_Saiyan_Ros%C3%A9_Goku_Black.png/revision/latest?cb=20161117235534\n\nYou can notice that Eyes are drawn with the sharp trapezoidal shape that Yamamuro uses, but are often slanted slightly to resemble Yamamuro's older work and Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru's designs. This artist draws hands particularly well keeping the proportions correct throughout and adding detail in the palms and knuckles.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry but this&amp;#39;ll be a long post with lots of links comparing Dokkan Artwork to freelance artists, and Toriyama, Toyotaro, and Yamamuro&amp;#39;s styles respectively.

This artist draws hands particularly well keeping the proportions correct throughout and adding detail in the palms and knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dg5e0lt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995495.0, "created_utc": 1491966695.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qay6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qay6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qay6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg588nq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CISScum3", "parent_id": "t1_dg4z3ok", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think that's what he meant, it's clear it's all redrawn [Except a few look like shit and seem like they are taken from the show] ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s what he meant, it&amp;#39;s clear it&amp;#39;s all redrawn [Except a few look like shit and seem like they are taken from the show] &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dg588nq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491987725.0, "created_utc": 1491958925.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qay6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5cgd0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "forcebubble", "parent_id": "t1_dg4z3ok", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I love the full art of [SSJ Broly](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/0/0d/SSR_SS_Broly_Dokkaned_PHY_HD.png/revision/latest?cb=20170214223219) - we don't get to see his full person in the film.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the full art of &lt;a href=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/0/0d/SSR_SS_Broly_Dokkaned_PHY_HD.png/revision/latest?cb=20170214223219\"&gt;SSJ Broly&lt;/a&gt; - we don&amp;#39;t get to see his full person in the film.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dg5cgd0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993286.0, "created_utc": 1491964486.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4z3ok", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrMehawk", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ahk2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, they are not.
