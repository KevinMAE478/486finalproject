Any attempts at applying logic above a 5th grade level will always fall apart upon any inspection. That is because, and here comes the really painful part, this show is not made for adults. It is aimed at 13 year olds and younger. I'm sure we're all spoiled by shows like AtlA, FMA, AoT and other shows aimed at capturing the imaginations of adults and kids. DBS is not one of those shows and it doesn't matter if you grew up on the other iterations of the series.\n\nThe reason the Z fighters don't do something is because fuck you that's why. You don't buy their toys and probably pirate the show anyway. No one involved with this series cares what you think. As long as you keep watching, advertisers keep buying ad time, and kids keep buying stuff related to the series everything is kosher. The series has introduced way too many OP mechanics for there ever to not be an OP solution to whatever problem the Z fighters encounter.\n\n**Part 2**\n\nFrieza is not a team player. That's cool, but he's afraid of Buu and Beerus and Whiz can still wreck him with ease. That means there are at least 4 characters in existence to humble Frieza if necessary. Tell him you won't murder him again and you'll let him do his thing as long as he leaves Earth alone. He'll help them win the tournament, because he's selfish and doesn't want to die. He's currently capable of taking on most opponents in the tournament, he's not above a little foul play in order to survive, and he's smart enough not to kill people if it means he dies. Just wish that Frieza can't be immortal and bam you don't have to worry about that. Zeno can also erase him no matter what if you really need him to, and he will because he's BFFs with Goku.\n\nLiterally no part about what anyone has said about Cell makes a lick of sense. Who cares if Cell is evil? He won't want to be erased by Beerus, Whis, or Zeno, and he's an arrogant piece of shit so he'll want to fight all of these strong opponents. If Cell experiments with God Ki his base will still be weaker than SSJ2 Gohan, SSJ2 Goku, SSJ2 Vegeta, SSJ2 Trunks, and SSJ2 Goten and Fat Buu. Using God Ki will still put him below Beers, Whis, Goku, and Vegeta. Farming Zenkai's is impossible. He gets half killed and then someone throws him out of the ring. Why would they half kill him and then let him regenerate constantly? Makes no sense and is purely absurd. How does one think of this and not immediately think of a counter? Being the best fighter doesn't matter if you get eliminated at the halfway point which Cell surely would, because he would be like the 5th strongest fighter on his own team let alone in the tournament. He uses some flashy technique and anyone uses a better version of it to impress Zeno more as well as surviving longer in the tournament.\n\nINB4 it's a discussion forum for the series, and people just want to speculate. I get that, but the amount of pretending like this is well written is absurd. It's not and this sub is worse than /r/FairyTail in it's unwillingness to accept that. Discuss it to your heart's content, but at least be able to admit that a lot of this stuff doesn't make sense. Recognize that this is kind of lazy and happens just cuz.\n\n**TL;DR None of this makes sense, so stop thinking about it so hard.
