I mean, take me for example: I started a links page in 1998. There were already links pages. Everyone already knew what the best sites were. There were, like, five good sites. I added literally *nothing* of value to the Internet for quite some time. (And some would argue I still don\u2019t!)\n\nBUT. It got me started. I learned the ins and outs of content management. I learned what an audience was looking for and what they were expecting. Over the years, I found myself as a writer, a producer, a manager. I learned who I was and what my values were. Twenty years later, I think I'm (one of the guys) in charge of something that\u2019s pretty darn valuable.\n\nBut 2017 isn't the same as 1998. There are a ton more people out there, and it's easier than ever to slap something together. It's easier to disseminate. It's easier to draw attention, and it\u2019s just as easy to lose that attention. As consumers, it\u2019s harder to ignore the obvious nonsense like we were able to do in the 90s.\n\nIf you ask me (and you did!), people need to think real long and hard about who they are, how they present themselves, and what they're adding to the conversation\u2026 *all the meanwhile* having fun.\n\nLuckily(?), most of these folks are just going to burn themselves out and/or lose interest. We know that most people in anime fandom tend to move on after about two years, and per [Daryl Surat](http://www.animeworldorder.com)\u2019s \u201cOtaku Expiration Date\u201d theory, generally are *long* out of the game by the time they hit 30 years old. It's a short-term hobby. For kids and teenagers and immature young adults. They grow out of it. They won't leave much of a lasting influence, and they'll have had fun in the meantime, and maybe will have even learned something about themselves in the process: that's a win-win all around.\n\nSo breaking it down further:\n\n**(1)** The folks who are just producing general content, none of it particularly bad, none of it particularly good, just \"existing\u201d? It's a kinda \"so what?\" situation. They're adding tons of noise, but digital noise is a problem with everything these days. Good luck finding a new game on Steam or the iTunes Store. Good luck finding a favorite new band. Anyone can produce anything at any time, leading to smaller niches of fans of smaller niches of material. If Billy Bob wants to do \"Dragon Ball Super Episode 72 Review #8,465\", so be it. Most people will never see it, bogged down with other/mainstream coverage, while simultaneously heavily engaged with their incredibly specific Snow x Tenshinhan Tumblr community.\n\n**(2)** The folks who are transparently opportunistic... will hopefully learn a hard lesson at some point. The problem is, I don't know that they will. SEO and content platforms these days currently *reward* this kind of behavior, which just exacerbates the situation, right? So as fans of quality material, we can only hope that their audience eventually sees through the mundanity, and/or there's a hivemind turn on content quality. The world we're living in right now, though? Shit, look at the political landscape of the entire planet. We have a president who throws around the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d not at information that is objectively false, but at information *he just doesn\u2019t personally like*. [We live in a \u201cpost-truth\u201d era](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/post-truth/). Worthless content is winning. *Kanzenshuu* is old-school and has no relevance in the social landscape, which continues to hurt us on a daily basis. Part of the reason we were so excited to jump on here for an AMA was to introduce ourselves to new people, and reconnect with folks who may have forgotten about us! We want to be fandom\u2019s rock. We want our existence to be the struggle and resistance against worthless, easy content.\n\nI dunno, man.

We know that most people in anime fandom tend to move on after about two years, and per &lt;a href=\"http://www.animeworldorder.com\"&gt;Daryl Surat&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s \u201cOtaku Expiration Date\u201d theory, generally are &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; out of the game by the time they hit 30 years old. It&amp;#39;s a short-term hobby. For kids and teenagers and immature young adults. They grow out of it. They won&amp;#39;t leave much of a lasting influence, and they&amp;#39;ll have had fun in the meantime, and maybe will have even learned something about themselves in the process: that&amp;#39;s a win-win all around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So breaking it down further:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; The folks who are just producing general content, none of it particularly bad, none of it particularly good, just &amp;quot;existing\u201d? It&amp;#39;s a kinda &amp;quot;so what?&amp;quot; situation. They&amp;#39;re adding tons of noise, but digital noise is a problem with everything these days. Good luck finding a new game on Steam or the iTunes Store. Good luck finding a favorite new band. Anyone can produce anything at any time, leading to smaller niches of fans of smaller niches of material. If Billy Bob wants to do &amp;quot;Dragon Ball Super Episode 72 Review #8,465&amp;quot;, so be it. Most people will never see it, bogged down with other/mainstream coverage, while simultaneously heavily engaged with their incredibly specific Snow x Tenshinhan Tumblr community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; The folks who are transparently opportunistic... will hopefully learn a hard lesson at some point. The problem is, I don&amp;#39;t know that they will. SEO and content platforms these days currently &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; this kind of behavior, which just exacerbates the situation, right? So as fans of quality material, we can only hope that their audience eventually sees through the mundanity, and/or there&amp;#39;s a hivemind turn on content quality. The world we&amp;#39;re living in right now, though? Shit, look at the political landscape of the entire planet. We have a president who throws around the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d not at information that is objectively false, but at information &lt;em&gt;he just doesn\u2019t personally like&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/post-truth/\"&gt;We live in a \u201cpost-truth\u201d era&lt;/a&gt;. Worthless content is winning. &lt;em&gt;Kanzenshuu&lt;/em&gt; is old-school and has no relevance in the social landscape, which continues to hurt us on a daily basis. Part of the reason we were so excited to jump on here for an AMA was to introduce ourselves to new people, and reconnect with folks who may have forgotten about us! We want to be fandom\u2019s rock. We want our existence to be the struggle and resistance against worthless, easy content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno, man.
