Just imagine this, the person you&amp;#39;re married to for &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt; 20 years, suddenly looks at you like you owe him money, and proceeds to carve the flesh from your bones.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis moment was beautifully executed in my opinion. The zoom in shot of Chichi&amp;#39;s eyes drawn in graphite was the icing on the cake. Goku&amp;#39;s reaction was amazing. The whole world trembling when he raged was a sight to behold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;4. &lt;em&gt;Black kills Mai and Bulma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The episode opens with Trunks running around like Jerry when Tom chases him, and you&amp;#39;re thinking &amp;quot;Oh shit! Ma boi &lt;em&gt;Turanksu&lt;/em&gt; is back&amp;quot;, and there&amp;#39;s black stuff flying around like Rayquaza in Pokemon Emerald. Next thing you know, the black apparition, is holding hot so hot Bulma in his hands and proceeds to disintegrate her into dust. You think this is bad enough? Later on, the black apparition proceeds to blast Mai, the girl Trunks wanted to chitty chitty Big Bang, and is presumed to die.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhat makes this moment even more &lt;del&gt;black&lt;/del&gt; dark is that, we had no prior idea, anything like this would happen. It was all fun and games and then all of a sudden, &lt;strong&gt;bam&lt;/strong&gt;, death just fucks shit up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Krillin gets KO&amp;#39;d by Tambourine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This moment holds a special place in my heart. I loved Kuririn as a kid, I mean, we all do. He was one of the strongest fighting with a whopping power level  under a hundred. Also, death wasn&amp;#39;t a very prominent concept in Dragon Ball at the time (&lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt; Upa&amp;#39;s Daddy &lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt;), even though we knew the Dragon Balls could revive him, it was still a shocker. The build up to that moment was also great. Krillin running in slow mo like the entirety of the Baywatch cast during the movie. Goku&amp;#39;s affection for his friend was really touching. The limp body of Krillin was a shocker surely. His eyes were so lifeless (&lt;em&gt;maybe cause he was lifeless&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Trunks turns Super Saiyan for the first time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is really a no brainer. We all know what happened. Gohan knocks Trunks so that he doesn&amp;#39;t fight the Androids, Trunks wakes up, He goes &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Wtf? Nanni?&amp;quot;(Actual quote from the Anime)&lt;/em&gt;, finds Gohan dead, and huffing the wet soil, Trunks proceeds to lose his shit. The end.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhat makes this scene special, is the build up, with the character relationship which is formed between the two was pretty strong. The background score was amazing, giving a fresh sense of despair and horror to the scene. The reaction by Trunks was amazing. Making even grown men cry. This is why this moment comes Number 2 on my list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frieza kills Krillin on Namek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master Roshi uses the Mafuba and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tao Pai Pai defeats Goku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell returns after self destructing himself like an Electrode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell goes after Androids, to make himself perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kid Buu makes the planet go Boom Boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piccolo takes the shot for Gohan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black shish kebabs Vegeta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;9.

Vegeta launches a barrage of attacks at the hot off the press, Final Form Frieza, which Frieza casually takes like its a fun daily routine for him. Vegeta gives in, losing all hope. Frieza then proceeds to give Vegeta the beating his Daddy never gave him. He kicks, punches, and curbstomps Vegeta for the majority of the episode. Vegeta cries, but Frieza doesn&amp;#39;t stop. While all of this was happening, Piccolo,Krillin, and Gohan were on the sidelines unable to do  bkack, Krillin 2.  hoping for some popcorn. Goku too was taking a quick bath in the healing chamber. Friezas face throughout the episode showed the true sadistic nature of the space pirate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR : 5.Black 4. Black 3. Krillin 2. Trunks 1.
