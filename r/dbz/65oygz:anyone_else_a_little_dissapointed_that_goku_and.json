Vegeta on the other hand, I&amp;#39;m quite disappointed that he went back to his android saga outfit. Vegeta&amp;#39;s clothes got less saiyan like the more time he spent on earth in Z, so for him to jump back to that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense imo. Give him back his whis outfit or buu saga outfit please.         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they wanted to give them their EoZ outfits that&amp;#39;d be really cool too imo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dgdvcmy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481719.0, "created_utc": 1492452919.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oygz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdz246", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arched_Thunder", "parent_id": "t3_65oygz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hopefully if/when we get to the end of Z they don't revert to these outfits again.
