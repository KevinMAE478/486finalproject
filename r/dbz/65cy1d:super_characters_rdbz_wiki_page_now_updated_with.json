Also it seems for the most part that the universes are ranked next to their twins (except for Universes 4 and 9, where U9 is the lowest ranked but U4 is placed ninth. Still U4 is in the bottom 4 with its twin, and the two twin universes 6 and 7.) \n\n- Universe 11, where the Pride Troopers are, is ranked fifth. Despite their presence, U11's mortal level is still below Zeno and Daishinkan's cutoff of 7. So even though U11 is actively trying to raise the mortal level, the fact that its representatives failed to get it to 7 in time for the Zen Exhibition Match means they are just in as much danger as the lowest ranked universe. \n\n- U1's Hakaishin Iwen is said to resemble the real-life god Shiva. \n\n- U2 is referred to as the \"kind universe,\" yet its Kaioshin Peru likes to get ripped and the bio even implies that he may be stronger than U7's South Kaioshin. U2's Angel Sour seems to despise macho guys, so it would be really fun to see these two interact. Jerez is also said to dislike ugly things. So again, where is the kindness?\n\n- U3's Kaioshin Ea prefers machine-type mortals, so if he had a choice of where he was assigned this could explain why he ended up in U3. With that said, I want to see Ea's reaction towards Magetta, possible other Metalmen contestants, and other robot-like characters. \n\n- U4 is known as the \"Scheming Universe.\" Quitela seems to like to antagonize Beerus, which was already evident from the fact that he brought up Goku when Beerus wasn't invited. I actually want to see these two have a conflict (even more so since they are cat and mouse). \n\n- Arak is pretty much the most efficient Hakaishin, but the reason why his Universe is ranked third is because he minimizes the amount of destruction he does which could mean some bad mortals are out there. \n\n- Universe 6 is the \"challenging universe.\" \n\n- Shin from U7 is said to be the youngest of the Kaioshin, though it is not really known if Kaioshin means every single Kaioshin out there, or just the ones from U7. \n\n- U8's Kaioshin Iru and U8's Hakaishin Liquir seem to be working together. Iru comes up with plans while Liquir works to fix them. Liquir consciously works to raise his universe's mortal level; he destroys those individuals that threaten this level and refuse to change it. \n\n- U9 is the \"Underhanded Universe.\" Sounds about right. The Hakaishin, Sidra, is said to be wimpy and apparently dislikes his job. Mojito apparently doesn't like that he is stuck with the two loser gods. \n\n- U10 is the \"Macho Universe,\" yet Kuru is in Universe 2... LOL. Rumoosh is pretty lazy so this is why he doesn't destroy planets. It is very interesting how Zamasu wanted to be the literal opposite of Rumoosh. So when Gowasu said that only Hakaishin should destroy planets, he isn't making his case too well when U10's Hakaishin feels that destruction is too much of a bother. The angel Kusu advises the two gods on the balance between good and evil, which could explain why Gowasu was so familiar with these terms. She should have been around to help Zamasu. \n\n- U11 is the Justice Universe. Nobody should be surprised there. The Kaioshin Kai and the Hakaishin Vermoud/Belmod are said to be very strict and want to preserve justice. \n\n- U12 is also very efficient like U5. The Hakaishin Geen is merciless yet efficient, but he gets bored because there are so few things left for him to destroy. (It is interesting that his universe's mortal level is second-highest when there are only a few planets left, unless there are plenty of planets in U2 that are really civilized.)  Matinu, the angel, doesn't really have to do her job all too much since the other two gods are performing well. \n\n- The recurring theme here is that the Hakaishin and Kaioshin that cooperate with one another, perform their respective duties, and/or destroy those planets that are dragging down the mortal level have a higher ranking than the universes whose gods fail to do that. Beerus destroys anything that pisses him off, but he also spares even bad planets as long as their inhabitants please him. Shin is very unreliable.

The angel Kusu advises the two gods on the balance between good and evil, which could explain why Gowasu was so familiar with these terms. She should have been around to help Zamasu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;U11 is the Justice Universe. Nobody should be surprised there. The Kaioshin Kai and the Hakaishin Vermoud/Belmod are said to be very strict and want to preserve justice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;U12 is also very efficient like U5. The Hakaishin Geen is merciless yet efficient, but he gets bored because there are so few things left for him to destroy. (It is interesting that his universe&amp;#39;s mortal level is second-highest when there are only a few planets left, unless there are plenty of planets in U2 that are really civilized.)  Matinu, the angel, doesn&amp;#39;t really have to do her job all too much since the other two gods are performing well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recurring theme here is that the Hakaishin and Kaioshin that cooperate with one another, perform their respective duties, and/or destroy those planets that are dragging down the mortal level have a higher ranking than the universes whose gods fail to do that. Beerus destroys anything that pisses him off, but he also spares even bad planets as long as their inhabitants please him. Shin is very unreliable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dg9i7td", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222027.0, "created_utc": 1492193227.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cy1d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cuqs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Darki200", "parent_id": "t3_65cy1d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Seems like Universe 5 is the most perfect one, Arak is very careful about his job, and even the angel tries to learn from both GoD and Kaioshin lol.  \n\nI feel bad for Mojito though, Universe 9 gods are losers lmao   \n\nEDIT: nvm Didn't know we were given the official ranking.", "edited": 1492193552.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems like Universe 5 is the most perfect one, Arak is very careful about his job, and even the angel tries to learn from both GoD and Kaioshin lol.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for Mojito though, Universe 9 gods are losers lmao   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: nvm Didn&amp;#39;t know we were given the official ranking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dbz", "name": "t1_dg9cuqs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215877.0, "created_utc": 1492187077.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cy1d", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cy1d", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cy1d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga6pft", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Akitu", "parent_id": "t1_dg9p30q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dbz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Consistency appeared to be the point.
