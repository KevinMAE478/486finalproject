It was how he learned the Four Witches technique where he sprouted additional arms, as well as the Kamehameha and Mafuba. After Dragon Ball however, Tien hasn't really witnessed any techniques worth mimicking, so he really hasn't that we know of.  \n  \nNow, something very interesting happened in the Universe 6 vs 7 tournament. For the very first time ever in the continuity of Dragon Ball, Z, and Super, Tien finally saw Goku use Kaioken firsthand. I think it would be incredibly cool if Tien learned how to mimic it from watching Goku use it against Hit. He could even use it creatively, such as using Split Form, having his duplicate yell an insane Kaioken multiplier, and the duplicate then act as an incredibly powerful one-hit suicide attack.  \n  \nNot only that, but he also may have witnessed Hit using Time Skip enough to have mimicked that as well. Think about how awesome that would be! If so, that means Tien could bust out Kaioken AND Time Skip. Imagine Tien crating three duplicates, all four sprouting two additional arms, yelling Kaioken as they dog pile on some powerful opponent, and suddenly time stops for the opponent before they can defend.  \n  \nI want to see Tien throwdown one of the most savage beatdowns in Dragon Ball Super yet.  \n\nEDIT: I've since thought about it and technically speaking, Tien could also know any technique used during the Cell Games too. That includes Instant Tramsmission, Special Beam Cannon, Final Flash, and Death Beam.

It was how he learned the Four Witches technique where he sprouted additional arms, as well as the Kamehameha and Mafuba. After Dragon Ball however, Tien hasn&amp;#39;t really witnessed any techniques worth mimicking, so he really hasn&amp;#39;t that we know of.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, something very interesting happened in the Universe 6 vs 7 tournament. For the very first time ever in the continuity of Dragon Ball, Z, and Super, Tien finally saw Goku use Kaioken firsthand. I think it would be incredibly cool if Tien learned how to mimic it from watching Goku use it against Hit. He could even use it creatively, such as using Split Form, having his duplicate yell an insane Kaioken multiplier, and the duplicate then act as an incredibly powerful one-hit suicide attack.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but he also may have witnessed Hit using Time Skip enough to have mimicked that as well. Think about how awesome that would be! If so, that means Tien could bust out Kaioken AND Time Skip.
