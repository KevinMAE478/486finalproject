With the Universe Survival Arc closing in, Toei needs to bring the hype to the fans, so they are using the transformation that was the main point for the story since the Resurrection of F arc to hype up the side characters. We can agree that Toei wants the side characters that were left out of the main plot of the story for so long to shine again and what better way than to place them against the main character. The fact that Krillin and Android 18 can go against the mighty SSJ Blue Goku, even if Goku is holding back, is very promising for the upcoming fights the battle royal will include.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Goku was holding back.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait. I mean a lot more than what you think. First, some points need to be made in order to &amp;quot;establish&amp;quot; this thought as a theory.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As we know, the Z fighters are beings that can alter their power levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first the numbers were a few hundreds, and as the characters were becoming stronger so power levels were rising, even to a point were in frieza saga we surpassed the 1 million mark. The numbers would have become mind-blowing after that point and the power levels were dropped from the series.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That means there is no numerical indication about the strength of the fighters so we can only compare them directly when they go against each other or we compare the feats each character demonstrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That exactly is the is problem the fandom has with the fights of recent DBS episodes. Since we can only compare the fighters by the feats and the information we gather from the characters themselves it seems wrong that Krillin can even force Goku in a SSJ state when they fight. From all these info, four more points have to be made.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBS is not all about the muscle.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fights were just lessons (for both sides).    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving SSJ Blue is all about perfect ki control.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a SSJ tranformation DOES NOT mean going all out.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the explanation. When Goku was fighting the people he was gathering, he wanted to test them. Also, it was made clear that the fighters taught Goku that the Tournament of Power is not all about being the strongest but the fact you have to force your opponent out of bounds by any means nesessary.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe lesson that Goku tought Krillin and others is the overwhelming power of the fighters they will encounter in the tournament by using the &lt;strong&gt;pressure&lt;/strong&gt; the SSJ Blue thanformation excerts. Fighters that have not got the godly ki cannot sence the power of a Super Saiyan God but can defintely sence the immense pressure of the transformation as stated by both Krillin and Future Trunks when they first fought SSJ Blue Goku and Vegeta. Thats the reason both Goku and Vegeta went SSJ Blue in these fights where they could handle their opponents with lesser forms. And since he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt his friend, Goku &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; going all out as stated clearly in the episode. But how much power does he use? Way less than people think.&lt;br/&gt;\nAs we know from previous episodes achieving the SSJ Blue is all about &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; ki control. That means Goku can alter his own power level as he wants not just raise it but lower it as well.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe saw than when goku was at his ssj grade 4 during the cell saga and was hurt by a rock that Krillin threw at him. Then, he went to Korin&amp;#39;s house to show him &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;about half of his max power&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; all that is the same ssj state. The result of this is that &lt;strong&gt;the ssj transformations&lt;/strong&gt;, even the godly ones, are &lt;strong&gt;a bigger cealing Goku&amp;#39;s power can reach.&lt;/strong&gt; It all depends of how much power he wants to use.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe downside for us fans is that can&amp;#39;t know if he really tries or not unless someone says so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding the fight against Android 17 now, we know only a few things about 17 himself most of which belong to the DBZ era. Back then, he was evenly matched with full-power Piccolo when he fused with Kami.&lt;br/&gt;\nWith DBS, Toei took advantage on the facts that Goku and 17 never got a chance to fight so they were never directly compared to each other and that there was a 13-year timeskip that 17 used to train. With this the gave Android 17 an emmense power boost. Goku stated in their fight that he &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot; didnt intent to go SSJ Blue&amp;quot; .&lt;/strong&gt; That means the SSJ power ceiling was not enough to keep up based on the previous points. Were SSJ2 or 3 enough to defeat 17? I believe not. Goku had no intention to use the SSJ blue transformation the way he used it against krillin as i stated before. That can only mean the ceiling of power ssj3 was not enough for goku. But since goku didn&amp;#39;t showcase the full power of ssj blue as stated in the episode, Android 17 power cannot be stated to be equal or nearly equal to ssj blue goku.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe only &amp;quot;flaw&amp;quot; of this, is the statement goku made that 17 was going full out yet. Since there is a huge gap in power between ssj3 and ssj blue i assume that android 17 showcased power feats to goku stronger than goku&amp;#39;s ssj3 state and his full power is 2-3 times that assuming 17 used less than his 50%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an extraordinary power up by all means. Would he beat ssj3 goku? i strongly believe yes. &lt;strong&gt;Is he &amp;quot;vegeta level&amp;quot;?&lt;/strong&gt; Heck no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: spelling &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "*English is not my native language so please excuse any grammatic errors.*\n\nWhy is Goku even using the Super Saiyan Blue (SSGSS) transformation against lower tier opponents such us Krillin and Android 18.\n\n2 main reasons:\n\n1) Marketing.    \nAs the DBS series progressed, we saw the incredible feats Goku and Vegeta showcased in their battles against powerful opponents.

It&amp;#39;s a version with a ton of interesting potential for power and damage output, but it&amp;#39;s still SSJ. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR SSB is an augmented version of SSJ, that isn&amp;#39;t necessarily leaps and bounds ahead of SSJ3 in a traditional sense, but can work that way in practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Also, I&amp;#39;m aware that the manga treats the SSJ forms as literal progression, SSG comes after SSJ3 and before SSB, with SSB definitely being stronger than SSG. I think this is cool because it&amp;#39;s more traditional to how DBZ worked, and it showcases SSG much more than the anime and movies, but I think the anime definitely disagrees with it.
