The dub recordings are entirely new in Japanese and English, mostly with the same cast in both languages, and the FUNimation version in particular is a major improvement both in terms of translation accuracy and voice acting.

Based on Toei\u2019s fiscal reports, DB\u2019s licensing sales peaked in 2007, reaching an all-time low by the end of FY 2011, and Namco-Bandai reported a similar decrease in merchandising sales. This pattern extended to video games, sealing the fate of Kai. (Merchandise ultimately funds the production of shows in Japan.) &lt;em&gt;Toriko&lt;/em&gt;\u2019s anime adaptation would eventually replace Kai, though it ultimately met the same fate.

While no official reason has ever been given for Kai\u2019s revival, the most likely conclusion is that the demands and sales of overseas rights-holders (particularly FUNimation) were strong enough to warrant continuing.&lt;br/&gt;\nAfter &lt;em&gt;Toriko&lt;/em&gt; failed, the Boo arc of Kai would eventually air in Japan, though slightly altered from the original edit that has now made its way to international shores. For more on the two versions, see &lt;a href=\"http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2014/06/17/multiple-versions-dragon-ball-kai-majin-buu-arc-production/\"&gt;Kanzenshuu\u2019s write-up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"#r\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why is the Boo arc 16:9 and tinted green, while the first iteration had accurate colors and the original aspect ratio?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nKai\u2019s initial run was outsourced by Toei to a company called QTEC, who handled the general remaster of the film (color correction, clean-up, etc.). Though not exactly known for quality remasters, QTEC handled Kai well, producing a solid, if slightly soft remaster. The Boo arc was produced cheaply in-house at Toei Animation, resulting in a substantial difference in quality. It\u2019s unclear exactly how the image ended up green; a popular theory involves improperly calibrated monitors (though professionals &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; also use color histograms). Either way, &lt;a href=\"http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/197151\"&gt;the show is drastically green&lt;/a&gt;, requiring more than simple color balance edits to fix.&lt;br/&gt;\nKai\u2019s first iteration began production prior to Japan\u2019s television standards mandating a 16:9 aspect ratio for new broadcasts. As the series had already been scanned and remastered in its original aspect ratio, a selective crop was done for the TV broadcast, while the original 4:3 version was used on the home release. As the Boo arc was produced after the mandate, it\u2019s likely Toei chose to stick with 16:9 from the start in an attempt to save time and money on producing two versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\n**[Dragon Ball Z Kai \u2014 Episode #(113) \u2014 Discussion Thread!](#r)**\n\n---\n\n[**A Creeping Conspiracy!
