Before getting his own Internet-ready computer in 1997, he spent countless hours and days absorbing everything he could from BBSes and early websites such as Wuken\u2019s Suushinchuu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike started VegettoEX\u2019s Ultimate DBZ Links Page on AOL in January 1998 at the ripe old age of sixteen. The goal at the time was not to reinvent the wheel by duplicating the efforts of other Dragon Ball fans that already shared news, information, and media, but to simply link to the best-of-the-best and act as a sort of jumping-point. He moved into producing original content a few months later, though, and expanded the site into VegettoEX\u2019s Home Page. The site re-launched in 1999 yet again as Daizenshuu EX with a new name and a new focus on great content with a great personality. The site re-launched yet again in 2003 with a greater focus on documentation and engaging content, which included the weekly podcast beginning in November 2005.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike lives in New Jersey with his wife and cats. The name \u201cVegettoEX\u201d came from wanting to choose the strongest character as a representation in crummy AOL chat rooms, combined with some extra letters to at least differentiate the name from the gazillion other terrible screen names \u2014 the \u201cEX\u201d came from a then-current-obsession with Street Fighter EX, which Mike defends to this day as an excellent game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hujio (Heath Cutler)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social Media:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/hujio\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After being turned on to Dragon Ball Z via TV by a childhood friend in mid-1997, Heath quickly ran to his family\u2019s Windows 95 PC with dial-up internet and absorbed as much information about the series as possible (and there really wasn\u2019t much available at the time). Over the next few years he bookmarked every fansite you could find, including Planet Namek, Vegeta Insane, Greg Werner\u2019s Ultimate DBZ Information Site, and of course VegettoEX\u2019s Home Page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inspired by these great fansites of the past, he set out to learn the ways of website development. After teaching himself HTML and JavaScript, he created his own run-of-the-mill Dragon Ball fansite to document the series for his own personal reference, which to this day remains anonymous. He eventually closed the website, but continued to maintain it locally on his personal computer. As the Japanese Dragon Boxes were being released in 2003, Heath (now in college) decided to dust off his old website files and began reworking the site to revolve around these glorious releases. In early May 2005, after the age of large fansites had almost entirely passed, he launched Kanzentai to bring his detailed information to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heath is better known online by the handle, \u201cHujio\u201d, a name he made up too long ago to even remember what it\u2019s based on. But hey, it starts with an \u201cH\u201d.

Wanting to know what happened next, and being annoyed at the incredibly obvious censorship, he eventually turned to the Internet. Once there, he cut his teeth on sites like Chris Psaros\u2019s DBZ Uncensored, Greg Werner\u2019s Ultimate DBZ Information Site, and (of course) Mike\u2019s own Daizenshuu EX.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Becoming a regular poster on the alt.fan.dragonball newsgroup, he wound up writing a petition to reverse the censorship of Viz Comics\u2019s release of the manga, which garnered the attention of the company, as well as the English-speaking online fandom. Soon enough, Julian and Mike (who had taken a break from the site) were corresponding with each other semi-regularly, and he came on board for the relaunch of Daizenshuu EX in 2003. Banking on his enthusiasm for the Japanese language, he became the site\u2019s official translator and fact-checker, and eventually managed to be able to understand and speak Japanese for real. He studied in Japan in 2006 and moved there outright in 2007, becoming the \u201cMan in Japan\u201d who keeps everybody informed about the latest developments in the Land of the Rising Sun\u2014at least when the aforementioned Internet does not beat him to it.
