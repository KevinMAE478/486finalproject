But the worst years for me were in my early twenties. I had dreams but lacked the motivation and confidence to take any steps towards them. I felt like I had no clue about what steps I should even take. I felt like everyone else was on a path in life and were figuring things out, while I was totally floundering. I had always just assumed I would not be a total failure and it was a bit of a shock to fall right out of the gate. So as a fellow lazy slob and student of failure, let's talk about how you can move forward with your life. \n\n\n[Please be aware that I'm not an expert on anything and it's okay if you think I'm overstepping or way off-base. I'm not exactly answering your specific questions here, you didn't ask for a motivational pep talk and this is /r/jobs, not /r/shittylifetipsfromrandomredditors.]\n\n\nSo let's break things down into smaller parts that we can address individually. First off, you have immediate needs and future goals. As you've said, your first concern is finding somewhere to live and a source of income. These would be your immediate goals. Since you won't be able to afford your own place until you've saved up enough to pay your first and last month's rent, your choices for the next little while are to live on the street, stay at the homeless shelter, stay with friends or other family members, or return home to your parents. If you are not currently able to go home, I agree with /u/MysticJAC that you should start asking for help in the form of welfare, food stamps and/or skills training/job placement services. You need help and are motivated to improve your life. You deserve their help and they will want to assist you. There are probably special programs tailored to young people just like you. But the best resource you have in life is family and friends. Life is extra hard when you have nothing and are on your own. You need to rebuild your support network. Everyone needs one, everyone deserves one, not everyone has one. But you have people who love you and want you to have a good life. Prove to them that you want the same thing and you'll rebuild those connection. \n\n\nSo lets talk about the situation with your parents and how you could work with them to move forward with your life. What was the nature of your relationship with them before? Were you just unmotivated or did you frequently fail at keeping promises to take action? Have they ever kicked you out before? Do you feel that things are different this time for you and/or them? Your parents are your greatest resource in life at the moment and it would be helpful for you to earn back their trust and support. You can do that by understanding their perspective and finding where your goals intersect, which will serve as common ground that will hopefully bring you back together. \n\n\nNo parent wants to spend over two decades raising a kid that leaves the nest to live in a homeless shelter. You think you feel like a failure? You just started adulting but they've been doing it your whole life. Unless they are complete monsters, their primary goal was to not fuck you up. It's important that you continue to take personal responsibility, but you should also understand that from their perspective, they have failed you, and have likely concluded that their own permissive parenting has been contributing to the problem. But they haven't lost hope and are desperate to give you the kick in the ass you need to get on with your life. Your parents don't really want you to be homeless! If they really truly didn't believe in you, they would rent you a room somewhere and get you signed up for welfare or disability. They just need you to understand what life is like without their support or self-motivation. You need to be scared into seeing the big picture. \n\n\nSo now that we have acknowledged their perspective, we can find where your goals intersect. You and your parents both want you to move forward with your life and have identified getting a job and living on your own as the first steps. There are immediate barriers to both goals because being homeless makes it harder to find a job and save up money for rent. It would be best if you had somewhere to stay for the next few months while you work on these immediate goals, and the best place for you is back home. But to do that, you'll need to prove to your parents that you are making real efforts towards change. \n\n\nTo do this, you'll need to convince them that you are actively working on both your immediate and future goals. If you went back today, what would your life at home look like until you found a job? And then what? You could start by promising to spend at least eight hours a day either looking for work, upgrading your skills, or getting outside support. Could you volunteer part-time at the library, homeless shelter or somewhere else? It would be a great way to earn valuable work experience while proving to your parents that you are willing to do what it takes. You should offer to start paying rent when you do get a job, while reminding them that you will otherwise be saving up for your own place, and maybe some driving lessons. Tell them what you've learned from this experience and what you intend to do to provide a better life for yourself. Work out a concrete plan of action, with clear goals and an understanding of the steps needed to get there (i.e., \"my own place\" = getting a job, saving money for rent, finding a rental; \"getting a job\" = applying online and in person, upgrading skills, researching training and job placement resources, creating opportunities, etc.). Remember where your goals intersect with theirs, and explain the exact steps you intend to take to reach them. They want to see real results from you. \n\n\nA minimum wage job and your own apartment is just the first step. What about your future goals? You have an AST degree in Math but are applying to McDonalds. Do you intend to do anything with that math degree? What about working at a bank? Or in personal finance, accounting or bookkeeping? You could be learning about these things now and upgrading your skills for the future. Take free online courses, read books, watch YouTube videos, join a bunch of subreddits for fields you might be interested in and volunteer in your industry or community for more experience.  If you don't want to work in finance or math, then pick something else. It doesn't have to be for forever and you can always change careers, but you do have to commit to something that you can work towards now.  Just like your immediate goals, your future goals will require you to break them down into smaller parts that you can take action on. This might seem intimidating at first, since you might not understand how to break down your bigger goals, but the good news is that the more you dive in and start learning about the things that interest you, the more you'll learn about the steps needed to achieve your goals. This is the kind of progress your parents are actually hoping to see from you.\n\n\nTry to make this easier by believing in yourself and your ability to change. You are 22 years old. You can and will change. You can and will become an adult. You can and will figure it all out (as much as any adult does).  There's no secret to life that you're missing out on. Just don't let life overwhelm you into inaction. It might be really helpful for you to find some sort of counselor, therapist or social worker to talk to. Don't let self-doubt get in the way of you living your life. It can be hard, but success is just the sum of many small actions over time.  [And just in case - if you are abusing alcohol or using drugs of any kind, even \"just\" weed, even if it's \"not a problem\", please stop now. If you can't, ask for help. It will be that much harder to move forward if you're also struggling with dependency]\n\n\nI can already tell that you're a self-aware and smart individual but I get the feeling that you might be lacking in self-confidence. Look at how you described your skills to us - you waited until the very end to say that you have completed an AST degree in Math! That's an accomplishment and the best thing on your resume! And wording your time at the library as \"100 hours of community service\" makes is sound like it was court-ordered (it's ok if it was). Try rephrasing it to say that you \"volunteered for x months\". As for the research project, were you a researcher or a participant? If you learned or used any skills in that project, make sure to point them out when describing your experience. If not, maybe skip it. \n\n\nI know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I really want you to succeed. I want you to be excited about the possibilities in your life and understand that your adult life has just begun. You have no kids, spouse or ailing parents who depend on you. You have plenty of time to get out there, make mistakes, grow, learn, fall down, get up and kick ass. You are capable of much more than you realize. If you set goals and take actions towards them, you'll be just fine. Just don't do nothing and don't sell yourself short. I wish you all the best.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey friend, I really struggled to find my way in my twenties and I&amp;#39;m now in my thirties and still trying to figure it out.
