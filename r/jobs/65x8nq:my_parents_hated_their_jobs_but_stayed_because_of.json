That kind of thinking is corrosive.  I understand that perhaps you might stick with a job you hate, because it pays better than any other alternative you might have, and you have dependants to house and feed.  But focusing on how much you hate it and how much time you have until you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;freed from prison&amp;quot; is just punishing yourself. I will second what &lt;a href=\"/u/MysticJAC\"&gt;/u/MysticJAC&lt;/a&gt; wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;#39;m not in a position to offer advice, because I fell into a trade that suits me perfectly and every day I look forward to working.  Sure, I get annoyed with my bosses and petty bureaucracy and stupid HR rules and clients with unrealistic expectations.  But when I&amp;#39;m working, all that fades away and I am totally engaged with what I&amp;#39;m doing.  Programming computers seems to be what my brain was designed for.  I do it for the money of course but I&amp;#39;d do it for free if it didn&amp;#39;t pay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have met a number of programmers who hate their jobs... they got into it because they were told it would pay well, and they work for big bureaucratic companies where they do mind-numbing gruntwork programming.  I have always been very selective about where I will work, I&amp;#39;d much rather work for a risky startup (and I have, 3 so far) than a Fortune 500 company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jobs", "name": "t1_dgdwqlv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492483281.0, "created_utc": 1492454481.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x8nq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge03j9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "econdweeb", "parent_id": "t3_65x8nq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jobs", "controversiality": 0, "body": " Struggle with this myself as a young professional (mid 20s).
