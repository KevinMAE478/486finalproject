I was active duty for almost 10 years, and we spent four years overseas, five years in New Mexico, as well as other short assignments (both military and civilian) in Texas, Nevada, and Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to my post military career (still in the reserves) we ended up moving to PA about three years ago, and live on the outskirts of the Philadelphia suburbs. We have two elementary age children, who have had to switch schools twice in the past three years (we had to move from one location in PA to another due to my job). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as finances we are debt free, except for the mortgage and one car note (no credit card debt, no student loans, etc.) and have a decent amount in savings that could be used to move if needed. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors in Business Admin and plan on having that as a secondary option to open up more opportunities. Unfortunately in my career field (my background is in avionics and aircraft electrical equipment) there are very limited places of employment in any place in the country, usually only one-two companies max that I could work for in any area. I could always try to use my skill set to get a position elsewhere, but I am not sure how that would pan out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love my current job (except for the hours/schedule \u2013 I work 12 hour shifts), and the pay is decent (would be great if we were in a different location). My wife on the other hand hates her job here, she likes what she does but she cannot stand her boss or the people she works with. Yes of course she could try to find another place of employment (this is her fourth employer since we moved to PA, so she has tried and it has not worked). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However that is not the main issue, we both hate being here, and we feel so out of place. This is the first place we have lived in that we don\u2019t feel like we are welcome or that we belong here, we feel like outcast here. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we are not really people-people, we love our privacy and do not really rely on anyone, and our family has been hundreds of miles away for most of our adult lives. We are not city people, and prefer not to live in an urban or suburban area (we really want rural property with privacy, would love to have a ranch or farm even though we have zero experience and it\u2019s not financially feasible) and this place is not a good fit for us. We have never felt so negatively about a place we have lived. We both feel an extreme pull to move back out west (to us that is \u201cHome\u201d) and it gets stronger the longer we are here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing for us is that we are really into doing things outdoors (fishing, camping, hiking, target shooting, off-roading) and while it is possible to do some of that here, the opportunities are limited. We used to live 30 minutes from a national forest, which for lack of better terms was our playground. We could drive up in the mountains (yeah there are no mountains in PA, those are just really big hills) and drive down a fire road, set up the tent, and be all alone and away from people. You just can\u2019t do that here, you cannot drive for more than a mile and not encounter someone, and to get away from people it is a three to four hour drive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day we regret moving here and leaving New Mexico. My wife and I have discussed it at length and have decided that once the kids are out of elementary (the will complete 5th grade at the same time) or if something crazy happens we are going to move back out west (most likely to New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, or Utah). The only thing keeping us from pulling out right now is the kids being in school, that we just bought a house a year ago (yeah that was a dumb idea, but we thought things would get better, they didn\u2019t), as well as my job having good pay and benefits and is stable (at least for now). There is a possibility that my company\u2019s contract will not be renewed at the end of this year, and I will either have to transfer to another location (unknown location) or be on our field service team, which would include a lot of travel (the reason I got off active duty). I have other opportunities I could pursue here should that happen, but we both do not want to stay here. Due to the company I work for having positions in other states (not always open) there is the chance I could ask for a transfer, but there is no way of ensuring that I would get to go where we would like to go. I also have a few contacts at other companies that I could probably have help me get a position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now I don\u2019t know what the best course of action for our family is, my kids don\u2019t really like the school they go to, or their class mates (they have a few friends but nothing that would make them want to stay), and my wife is purely miserable here, I don\u2019t like it much either but I am trying to make the best of it.  I would really like to get people\u2019s opinions, good or bad.
