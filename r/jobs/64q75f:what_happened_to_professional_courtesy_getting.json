It&amp;#39;s the right thing to do... but to notify those other 40-45 candidates every week? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be awesome if we actually had the ability to personally notify each candidate that they were not selected (outside of the automated system which is very impersonal)... but it just isn&amp;#39;t a priority, unfortunately. And to be frank, it&amp;#39;s ridiculous to expect that of a recruiter. We get measured on time to hire and cost to hire. Our entire jobs rely on those two metrics, so if we spend as much time as it would take to personally reject you... we wouldn&amp;#39;t have jobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jobs", "name": "t1_dg4y2tw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491974512.0, "created_utc": 1491945712.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
