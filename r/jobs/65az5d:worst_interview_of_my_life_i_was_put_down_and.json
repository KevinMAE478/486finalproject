Never felt so disrespected and marginalized in an interview, EVER. I interviewed for a District Operations Manager position. I got a call asking me if I could come in for an interview asap, I did my best to make it happen. I initially met with the HR Manager while I was wearing my usual business casual work attire since I was going to work right after, he was nice and very positive and said he liked what he saw and that I was someone they would want to have on their team. I have it in my voicemail box to prove it! (he called later that night to schedule another interview.) After our interview, he called in another operations manager who wasn\u2019t in the building to come meet me, so I had to wait another 20 minutes. That went well too and I got the approval to move on to the next interview.  I was so excited, it felt almost as if I had this in the bag! He was so excited as well.   Later that night, he called and asked me to come back to meet with the CEO/Owner the next day. It was short notice and couldn\u2019t confirm till late that morning, but I made it happen I had to switch schedules to get proper coverage. I drove 90 mins from South Orange County where I work to Downtown LA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is where it gets bad. I show up for the interview, I go with the HR manager to meet the owner/CEO. Right when we sit down, he says \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this now, I wouldn\u2019t hire you based on how you look\u2026\u201d What the hell? His whole demeanor and tone was so rude and condescending. He says he is old fashion. He says he\u2019s not trying to be mean. He then asks me, if this was my first time there. I said no, it was my second time. He asks me if I saw anyone wearing ties that day. I said of the 3 people I met\u2026only Mike the HR manager. The operations manager had a yellow shirt, no tie, the other person was a woman. There were also a couple other men I saw in passing that didn\u2019t have a tie but there were some that did. I was dressed business casual, which is my work dress code where I had just come from. I was in Calvin Klein slacks and a Calvin Klein button down long sleeve shirt\u2026But that wasn\u2019t good enough. Then the HR Manager tries to flip it on me as the owner is staring him down. The HR manager was like, well you saw yesterday I was wearing a tie, you knew you\u2019d be back today right? I\u2019m like no not till 10am when I called to confirm that I\u2019ll try to make it after I switch schedules around. This was last minute, same day notice. I guess this is my fault as well for not keeping a suit and tie in my car for last minute interviews. Given proper notice, I would have dressed the part for a district level manager. I really wish he could have given me a heads up on this\u2026a hey when you meet with the owner, he\u2019s pretty old school so wear your best suit and tie. Oh and BTW JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW, THE OWNER/CEO WAS WEARING FUCKING SANDALS (NO SOCKS) WHILE IN DRESS PANTS, SHIRT AND TIE...pretty funny huh?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The owner looks over my resume and tears me apart. He asks why he should hire me, I have no industry experience. I go on to explain that the position is the next step in my career development, it was worth applying to and reaching out to, I\u2019m a hard worker, quick learner, have a proven track record of success, you know the usual\u2026but no, he interrupts and says, \u201cNo, why should I train you, spend time on you and you when you have no experience!\u201d I\u2019m trying to explain I\u2019m an experienced manager and experienced in policy and procedures, training, developing, holding employees accountable, empowering others to strive for success but new to this industry but have been new to my previous industries and learned quickly. He just goes on to what feels like berating me because of my lack of industry experience. (If that\u2019s the case, the HR manager NEVER should have contacted me for this position).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then he moves on to my work history. I\u2019m 33 years old, I\u2019ve been working since I was 18. First job, spent 2 years there, second job 5 years, third job 4 years, fourth job 3 years, current job 6 months (yes I know not long, but I got an email alert for this position and felt I was capable and thought why not give it a shot since it was the next step for my career.) Every job I left, I left for a new opportunity that was a career step up that took on more responsibilities, it was career progression. I personally thought my history was solid, stable but he says no. He questions me, \u201cwhy should I hire you if you\u2019re only going to stay 1 year, 2 years? See that man walking down the hall way, he\u2019s been here 18 years!\u201d Again, in a rude, negative and condescending manner. He goes on to name different people that have been here 10+ years. He and the HR manager then start calling me a job hopper. The HR manager asks me what I see when someone puts temp agency jobs on the resumes and it\u2019s only a few months here and there, well yeah you ask why didn\u2019t they stick with them? He asks if I would hire someone like that, well I hire a lot of part timers, have a roster of 40-45 people, if they\u2019re qualified, if they have personality for the job, I\u2019d give them a chance, maybe that\u2019s all they needed was someone giving them a chance. (Developing and molding talent is one of my favorite parts of being a manager. To be able to teach someone how to work hard to achieve success is such a great feeling. Watching them grow and move on to bigger and better makes me feel like I just set someone up to have a successful life.) The owner goes on to say they don\u2019t want to hire someone that isn\u2019t going to stay 10+ years. Could I see myself staying somewhere that long? Yes, absolutely but again, I\u2019m 33 with a college degree, not many find that 10+ year job in their 20s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The owner keeps saying he\u2019s not trying to be mean or rude, I understand that but his tone, his demeanor, his attitude says otherwise. I\u2019m very proud of my accomplishments and my work ethic. He goes on to say, all I hear is what you want, what you\u2019re looking for but nothing what you can bring to us or give to us. I tried to do so but he kept shooting me down and throwing it in my face that I have never been at a job for what he considers long term, I have no industry experience and that I\u2019M YOUNG. Over and over, he keeps saying I\u2019m young and smart and a good kid. I felt a little discriminated because of my age. You can\u2019t say I\u2019m inexperienced, not with my back ground, can you say I\u2019m not experienced in this industry, yes, absolutely and unfortunately, they\u2019re not willing to train and develop. There was no point in continuing this, it was clear he wasn\u2019t going to hire me and if they did, he\u2019s not someone I\u2019d want to work for.  I felt so beat up and put down, my heart wasn\u2019t into it anymore but I kept trying. I tried to answer everything he asked me no matter how many times he cut me off and said something negative. I wasn\u2019t going to stand up and leave, I was determined to see it through and show him he can\u2019t scare me off. By the end, he tells the HR manager to take me to meet someone else\u2026I don\u2019t know why but I wasn\u2019t giving up, I wanted to see this through with my head held up high, show them that I\u2019m not going to run away scared off. So I met with one of the other executives, he\u2019s pretty calm, professional and asks me basic questions. He wasn\u2019t negative or condescending; it was just a brief meeting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get sent back to the waiting room then meet with the HR manager again. He basically tells me they\u2019re going to mull it over but he wasn\u2019t holding hope. Then he just caves and said they\u2019re going to move forward without me because of my lack of industry experience and the way I was dressed, not in a tie\u2026even though it was a last minute notice and I had told him I\u2019m coming from my work in south Orange County to get there. He tells me he and they think I\u2019m a good guy, well experienced but not right for them and first impressions are important. I agree, first impressions are important but there\u2019s more to first impressions than physical appearance and attire (and yes I do understand attire and appearance are the first thing you see and judge, but never judge a book by its cover right?). They ignored I\u2019d came in on late notice over 90 minutes away, driving through Downtown LA traffic to accommodate them. No matter how bad the owner put me down, I sat there with a smile and positive attitude and told him I understood what he was saying and how he feels. The HR manager said he liked my attitude and that he felt I have a can do attitude. The owner said he was only giving me advice, fair enough, you can give advice to people without putting them down in a job interview. I thanked him for the opportunity and he told me not to take it personal. I told him I\u2019m taking this as a learning experience and that I try to learn from everything I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, the HR manager NEVER should have called me for the first interview or back for a second interview. He\u2019s only been there a year but he explained they were looking for people with industry experience and long stable work history. He read my resume, he pre-screened me\u2026well DUH, I told him and the Operations Manager that I didin\u2019t have industry experience. They didn\u2019t make it a big deal. He liked me for my management experience. The owner kinda gave off that vibe of \u201cwhy the hell did you bring this guy to me\u2026\u201d I wonder if he got an earful for wasting their time? Either way, this was a horrible experience. Waste of time, condescending. I\u2019m a grown ass man\u2026and I actually felt like I wanted to cry with how bad I was being put down for not being what they wanted me to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it matters much, the Owner/CEO is Bengali and came to the US in the 80s. The HR manager was Hispanic, maybe Caucasian. Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Worst interview experience I\u2019ve ever had in my life.
