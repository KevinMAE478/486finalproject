A Xeon E7 proc can come with 20 cores and 40 threads and support 3TBs of RAM.  For most systems that's overkill and you will have unused resources.  Even if you are using that server for something like hosting Reddit chances are you are going to run into another bottle neck (storage limitations, scaling limitations, network, etc) before you max out those CPUs/RAM. So what is better is to have something like Xen/Hyper-V/VMware running on the system and share those massive resources with a bunch of systems.  So instead of one machine you now have 10 machines running on that one box.  \n\nAnd think about it, if that hardware fails that's fine, you just need one backup piece of hardware and all 10 servers are back up and running. Hell depending on your configuration the end users may not even notice that the first piece of hardware failed as you have HA configured so it was a seamless failover to the backup hardware.  \n\nIt also allows you to control scaling more easily and on the fly.  In the past if marketing was going to start a new email mass-market to announce some new feature on your site, you may have needed a few weeks notice to deploy some new web servers to handle the expected increased traffic.  Now you can automate it so if the load on VM1 gets too high VM2 gets spun up that shares the load and if that doesn't help enough VM3, VM4, and so on and so on.  \n\nIt also gives you a central point to manage everything.  Instead of needing to go to 10 servers and update the firmware, I have a single box that I need to update the firmware.  Need to add a new NIC to one of the VMs? If that was a physical box I would need to drive out to where the box was and physically make the change.  Now I can do it through vsphere while I take a shit.   \n\nAlso virtualization saves a lot of money.  What costs more to power and keep cool, a data center with 100 servers or a single rack with 10? So less space, smaller (aka cheaper) CRAC units to keep the data center cool, so less electricity.  Also simplified hardware backup (which means more money savings).  Instead of buying different sized servers for the different expected loads of the server you can just buy the exact same server with the same specs and then split it up using virtualization.  This means instead of needing to keep in 10 different types of servers for backup you just have 1 type of server or just 1 type of backup RAM, CPU, RAID card, etc. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons virtualization is in high demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hardware these days are generally too strong for their abilities.

I disagree with his point.  I've had a job paying over $15/hr since day 1 of being in IT.  He is spelling doom and gloom and my opinion is it's either his shit skills or his inability to change with the times that is causing him to see those 15/hr job offers while people like me are turning down job offers for over $100K a year for not paying enough. \n\nAre \"traditional\" sysadmin jobs disappearing? Yes but that's because the traditional admin job is disappearing not the head count.   For example a large number of linux admins are finding themselves to be more devops then sysadmins so when you go job hunting for linux admin positions you also need to search for devops positions.  Or instead of managing 100 physical servers a sysadmin manages 1,000 virtual servers in AWS/Azure/Google's piece of shit/whatever so you now need to look for jobs for those technologies.  Or you have guys going security instead of sysadmin and a lot of these security positions didn't fucking exist 10 years ago. Or you have guys who's job is to setup and manage complex NAS storage solutions which again 10-20 years ago didn't exist. \n\nIt's like the mainframe jobs of yesterday,  talk to the admins who were around in the 80s and 90s and they all speak of working on giant mainframes and the greybeards who managed them. Well those jobs are all dead and gone but guess what?  IT is still around and as strong as ever.  Most of those greybeards aren't but that's a different story. \n\nAlso there are more people getting into IT which means you have less jobs specifically named \"sysadmin\" which also does mean companies are being picky about who they pick up.  It's not like the early 00s or even late 00s where companies needed 10 sysadmins.  Now they need 4 sysadmins, 2 devops,  1 security, 1 network, 1 dba, 1 storage. So for those 4 guys who are going to get the title sysadmin they get to be really picky as they are now getting 100 applications for those 4 positions. But remember, those 10 IT jobs are still there, just now they are split up into different categories requiring more specialization.  \n\nAlso models are changing. SaaS offerings are becoming all the rage so you are finding more and more jobs opening up working for SaaS providers managing the same shit you use to for corp A.  \n\nOne of the huge differences I have noticed, American's give a fuck about title way to much.  As an example I and a few co-workers were talking about a job a head hunter had hit the one co-worker up for.  This job's requirements would be meet by a linux sysadmin with 3-5 years experience and the head hunter told him the expected pay would depending on experience, degrees, and certs be in the 80-100K range (which for the area is par the course for someone of that experience level). It was a SaaS offering where the position was managing the servers/VMs/etc.  The title was something like \"&lt;product&gt; Support Engineer\".  A few of my co-workers said they wouldn't take the job unless they were looking at being homeless.  Why? Because the title was Support and not sysadmin.  They didn't care that it was sysadmin work and pay and instead focused purely on the title. \n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is don't focus on the damn title or trying to become a sysadmin.  The days of a generic sysadmin wearing 100 hats is slowly (and thankfully) dying and being replaced with specialized positions. Find a portion of IT that interests you and learn about that.  Like automation?  Then learn how to deploy AWS instances using terraform.  Like networking?  Then start messing around with routers, switches, etc (and probable VIOP tech as well since a lot of the network guys I know deal with that as well).  Like databases?  Then brush up on the differences between an inner join and an outer join.  Oh and for all them, learn at least one good scripting/programming language like python or java/javascript plus a OS scripting language like bash or powershell. \n\nAlso be prepared to roll with the punches.  Chances are the tech you start your first job with you won't be using by year 5 of your career.  Tech that you thought was impossible at year 5 will be common place by year 15.  And by year 30 you will be telling stories to the new guys about what it was like back in the dark ages.  Well that is assuming you keep learning and changing with the times.
