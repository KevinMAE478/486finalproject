It painted really well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then almost ending they told me something that wasn&amp;#39;t planned. By phone they called a worktime from 8:30 to 17:30 hours, Mon-Fri, and that on &amp;quot;heavy times&amp;quot; there was other worktime: 4 days from 6:30 to 18:30, and then 4 free days.

And the cycle repeats. Nothing Mon-Fri and stable hours. And also, there&amp;#39;s a very strict security, you can&amp;#39;t get inside with cellphones, USBs or cameras, and every time you check out, you must be checked by Xrays and like-airport security  stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of 4 free days are tempting TBH, but i&amp;#39;m not sure it compensates that makes a bit of big mess the other 4 days, forcing me to make all personal plans to be made almost with a month in advace.
