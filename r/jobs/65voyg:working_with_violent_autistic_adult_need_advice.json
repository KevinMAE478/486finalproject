(No-eye contact, no verbal reaction etc) he is doubled staffed 24/7 because it is impossible to handle him alone. He is bigger then all staff and stronger then all staff. It is impossible to use any sort of retraint on him because he does not hold back and will hurt himself or staff if out in a restraint. I am only a 5&amp;#39;4 female while the client is at least 6&amp;#39;.\nI recently worked an overnight shift where the client was awake from 12:00 am for the rest of the shift (until 9 am).
