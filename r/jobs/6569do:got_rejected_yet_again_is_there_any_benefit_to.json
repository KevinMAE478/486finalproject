They might even do mock interviews where they could give you feedback on your performance.\n\nThings I've heard but not done personally: \n\nContact the hiring manager directly to ask for a lunch/networking meeting. This makes the first meeting less formal, and gives you a chance to learn more about the position before an official interview. \n\nFigure out the perfect job for you and pitch yourself to the company for which you want to work.
