I was doing Job E before. He then promoted me to do Job C. He was supposed to be doing job A and B, and oversee C and D. However, this is not the case. I was firstly doing Job C, and then the next day, I was doing job A, B, and C. Now today I have taken over EVERYTHING, and Josh works on stuff unrelated to this company all day. (he works on stuff for his side job)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, we have a company meeting where Josh tells us that if we mess up, we are &amp;quot;out the door&amp;quot; and that he has plenty of people in line to take our jobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, he has also been increasingly raising his voice at me in front of all the employees, and yelling at me for work that wasn&amp;#39;t done (which he never asked me to do) which has been upsetting so I don&amp;#39;t talk to him as much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEN, i found out that he has been calling my coworkers into his office and asking them what is wrong with me. So, I thought, why didn&amp;#39;t he just approach me? So i sent him a long email yesterday afternoon explaining that I was not happy with the way I have been treated, and I did not appreciate everyone being threatened to be fired. He then responded saying I was &amp;quot;misunderstanding&amp;quot; and suspended me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went home upset, and called the original boss, who gave me the email of the CEO of the company, Michael. There is no HR department apparently...  I emailed him and he immediately called me, and we spoke for about an hour. I told him everything I had been experiencing and how I do everything Josh is supposed to be doing, and he was blown away.  He thought that Josh was doing job A, B, C, and D. He thought I was doing a different job entirely. He asked me for specific cases and examples of what I do (which I am assuming he was trying to make sure I really do all of this) and was baffled and said &amp;quot;wow, so he is just giving me the numbers and making you do all the work&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I got done telling Michael everything, he said he is going to have the COO, Bob make a stop by the office Monday, and wants me to go in an hour late on Monday, as well, and said that my suspension has been &amp;quot;overridden&amp;quot;. Now, he reassured me that the problem would be &amp;quot;taken care of&amp;quot; and that it sounds like I will be working &amp;quot;directly under him&amp;quot; but I am absolutely TERRIFIED to go to work still. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do... I am scared of what is going to happen, and I am not sure if I should even go to work. This guy is hostile, and I am afraid of what he might do to me.
