I&amp;#39;ve had this position for four years, and in that time, I&amp;#39;ve only received a $5k raise (started at $40k). I&amp;#39;ve also moved with the company to another sales territory in a more expensive part of the country, and that $5k raise has not kept up with cost of living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an M.A. in literature, and prior to this position I was an adjunct instructor teaching as many classes as I could. I couldn&amp;#39;t find full time teaching positions, so I thought educational publishing would get my foot in the door in publishing and would allow me to use my literature and teaching backgrounds in a non-academic setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the problem: I&amp;#39;m not good at sales. It&amp;#39;s been four years in the same position, and I&amp;#39;ve never once posted an increase. That&amp;#39;s, like, the entire point of my job. Because of this, I didn&amp;#39;t receive a raise this year, my bonuses have been paltry, and I&amp;#39;m ineligible for promotions. I&amp;#39;m also falling behind the people who were hired in the same &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; as me -- most of them have received raises far in excess of what I&amp;#39;ve received, and many have been promoted. Not to mention that they&amp;#39;ve earned much larger bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly: I really don&amp;#39;t like sales, at least not how the position operates at my company. I travel all the time to get to my accounts, I easily work ten hours a day, and I&amp;#39;m often seen as a pariah on college campuses. I don&amp;#39;t feel like my prior teaching experience makes me a partner in education, which is what I really wanted to do if I couldn&amp;#39;t teach full time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried moving laterally within the company, but I&amp;#39;ve gotten passed up each time because of poor sales performance. Staying with this company, but in a different role, seems not to be an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the question: what can I do that&amp;#39;s related to education but is not sales? I don&amp;#39;t have a teaching certificate, and full time teaching positions in higher ed are few and far between, so teaching is out of the question. How can I position my four years in sales positively for a non-sales job, especially considering my poor performance to date?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, to make matters more challenging: my husband owns a local business, so I can&amp;#39;t just pick up and move.
