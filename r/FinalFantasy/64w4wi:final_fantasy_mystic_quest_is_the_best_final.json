This is key for an introductory game too, because it means the game can &amp;quot;open up&amp;quot; as players get comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mystic Quest on the other hand has nothing below its surface. As a result once you get used to it on the most basic level it quickly becomes boring, and its attempts to be beginner-friendly start to feel like they&amp;#39;re patronizing the player. And its surface-level appeal isn&amp;#39;t even that strong, considering its story and visuals are pretty lacking compared to other SNES RPGs. Even as a kid who probably could&amp;#39;ve used an entry level RPG, I quickly lost motivation to keep playing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;know, opinions and all, but I always felt like trying to get people into JRPGs with Mystic Quest of all things was misguided at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dg5ogr1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492019054.0, "created_utc": 1491990254.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
