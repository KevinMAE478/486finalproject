I think a more accurate analogy is that Final Fantasy fandom is like politics.  One big party thinks the new games are flashy but empty and soulless and prefers &amp;quot;how things used to be.&amp;quot;  The other big party sees the old games as antiquated, simplistic and naive.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there are some smaller parties that focus on more specific issues -- like having strong combat and leveling systems as in FFV and FFXII International/Zodiac; or allowing lots of open-world exploration and side-quests as in FFVI and FFXV; or having a strong plot as in FFIV, FFVI, FFVII and FFX; etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dg7wp2f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492133858.0, "created_utc": 1492105058.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656kwi", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656kwi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg86mc9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jeredin", "parent_id": "t1_dg7yb9o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FinalFantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Sargnarg the Hardge Harg is deh behst Hardge Harg!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywZt6igT5Dw)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywZt6igT5Dw\"&gt;Sargnarg the Hardge Harg is deh behst Hardge Harg!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dg86mc9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492144596.0, "created_utc": 1492115796.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7yb9o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TOT1990gup", "parent_id": "t3_656kwi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FinalFantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The online FF community is pretty toxic.

But if you say \"I loved the world and characters in FFXV, they were so much better than the characters and world in FFX, I mean HA HA HAAAA! amirite?\" THEN you'll start up some problems.  It's just a sign people strongly identify with these games so they get a bit too heated when someone else insults them.\n\nAlso because the games are all so different, we tend to love our first and carry expectations of that into how we play the other games.  FF is a lot better when you try to enjoy a game on its terms rather than your own.  A lot of movie critics go into a movie asking themselves \"What is this film trying to do?
