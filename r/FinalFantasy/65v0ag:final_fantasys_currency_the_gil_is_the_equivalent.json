In Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII, gil appears as silver coins with a hole through the middle, while in Final Fantasy V gil coins are gold with a hole. In Final Fantasy XII, Penelo can briefly be seen holding a pair of coins presumed to be gil, one silver and one gold, with unclear detailed markings on them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the Wikia suggests,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Gil\"&gt;This suggests that gil is loosely based on the Japanese yen (\u5186) or ancient Chinese coins, with the Final Fantasy X gil coins appearing very similar to yen coins. The yen, along with other Chinese and Japanese currencies, such as the mon, have holes in some of the coins, a trait dating back to feudal times when coins were carried on string.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#39;t the only reason. We can see that nearly every gil you receive is in denominations of one and there aren&amp;#39;t smaller denominations. This would essentially be the equivalent of a penny. Every monster which drops 100 gil has on his person a loonie, a dollar or a pound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But consider the first Final Fantasy. If gil is the equivalent of a penny or pence, then that means a knife would be roughly ten cents. But that doesn&amp;#39;t sound right, does it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, we also might have to justify inflation. &lt;a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl\"&gt;Using this site&lt;/a&gt;, we see that in 1913, 10 cents has roughly the same purchasing power in 2016 as 2.42. That&amp;#39;s the cost of a pocket knife.And that&amp;#39;s just going back as far as 1913. And don&amp;#39;t forget, it seems like monsters contain the gil. So if you want money, you have to be a warrior, do some battling and probably barter their fur/meat for gil.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy VII was originally planned to be set in New York City, right?
