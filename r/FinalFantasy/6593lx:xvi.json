I really wish they&amp;#39;d give it to him though, if for nothing else to see the absolute meltdowns from traditionalist FF fans who&amp;#39;ve never played one of his games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Expected to see the entire thread filled with &amp;#39;go back to medieval turn based&amp;#39; and was right XD  He said unique, nothing about medieval fantasy is unique.  Over half the FF series is medieval fantasy (1-5, 9,11,12, 14). It&amp;#39;s been done to death in JRPGs.  If you want a medieval turn based fantasy game on PS4 DQ 11 is coming out soon play that.  I for one really, really hope they never bring back medieval fantasy because there are like 100 other games I can play to get that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dg90e97", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492196806.0, "created_utc": 1492168006.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6593lx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6593lx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5m2b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GaryGrayII", "parent_id": "t1_dg9brf3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FinalFantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This doesn't seem too long to read, does it?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t seem too long to read, does it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dgc5m2b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385611.0, "created_utc": 1492356811.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9brf3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gliglimp12", "parent_id": "t3_6593lx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FinalFantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "TLDR?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dg9brf3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492214686.0, "created_utc": 1492185886.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6593lx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6593lx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgce65t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Harbinger921", "parent_id": "t1_dgc5myt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FinalFantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah they would have a totally different scheme with obviously less physical attacks.
