The GBA version has low sound quality and framerate slowdown when casting certain spells, but also bonus content and a really fun and energetic script, and being on a cartridge, has no load times. The iOS/Android ports look awful, but they carry over all the new content of the Advance version without the downgraded music and framerate issues.\n\nIf the PS1's version only flaw was its load times, I could tolerate that. I'm sure there are a lot of people who are used to PlayStation load times. But the PS1 port of FFV also has a truly awful localization. Sure, it's less \"sanitized,\" as you said, but the dialogue is also extremely stiff and stilted, and downright incompetent at times -- I'd argue it's even worse than the English translation of FFVII. There are times when the text boxes will have a character say a line that is clearly meant for someone else (i.e. having Bartz say Krile or Faris's line, and *then* say his actual line), not to mention the downright bone-headed name translations (i.e. \"Y Burn\" instead of Wyvern, \"Soccer\" instead of Sucker, \"Salsa\" instead of Sarisa, etc.) The entire PS1 port just seemed like one giant rush job, and at the time it came out, there was little reason to choose it over the original Super Famicom version, other than it being the only way to legally play the game in English. The PS1 version added nothing new (other than a couple of CGI cutscenes, which are nice but nothing spectacular) and actually made a handful of things worse than they were before. Those who weren't above using emulation would just download the fan translation, which suffered from none of the PS1 version's issues and inexplicably had a more professional translation job.\n\nTo this day, I still concede that, short of importing and playing the original Super Famicom release, the GBA port is the ideal way to play FFV -- the downgraded music is unfortunate, but at least that version doesn't look hideous (like the mobile ports) and plays without significant performance issues (like the PS1 port).", "edited": 1492468503.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve honestly never seen anyone defend the PS1 port of FFV; it&amp;#39;s pretty universally considered the worst version. The GBA version has low sound quality and framerate slowdown when casting certain spells, but also bonus content and a really fun and energetic script, and being on a cartridge, has no load times. The iOS/Android ports look awful, but they carry over all the new content of the Advance version without the downgraded music and framerate issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the PS1&amp;#39;s version only flaw was its load times, I could tolerate that. I&amp;#39;m sure there are a lot of people who are used to PlayStation load times. But the PS1 port of FFV also has a truly awful localization. Sure, it&amp;#39;s less &amp;quot;sanitized,&amp;quot; as you said, but the dialogue is also extremely stiff and stilted, and downright incompetent at times -- I&amp;#39;d argue it&amp;#39;s even worse than the English translation of FFVII.
