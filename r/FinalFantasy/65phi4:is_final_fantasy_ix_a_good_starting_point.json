The graphics are better in terms of the use of the PSX&amp;#39;s technology, but the character art style is chibi/super-deformed, with oversized heads for their bodies, and some really goofy looking characters (Brahne, Quina, and Steiner are examples).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The music is really good, though!  It actually took me a while to get into the soundtrack, I think because I don&amp;#39;t really like the overworld theme or main battle theme, and those are what you hear over and over again.  But I keep listening to other tracks from IX like You&amp;#39;re Not Alone, the final battle theme, Hunter&amp;#39;s Chance, Eternal Harvest, Freya&amp;#39;s Theme, Terra, Daguerreo...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FinalFantasy", "name": "t1_dgcfou0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492399006.0, "created_utc": 1492370206.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65phi4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65phi4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65phi4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65phi4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65phi4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp0j5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rare_Parrot", "parent_id": "t1_dgcnvu9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FinalFantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No I haven't played World of Final Fantasy so I can't say much about it.
