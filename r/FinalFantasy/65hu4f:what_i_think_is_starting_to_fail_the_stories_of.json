What you're looking for is world building, which is what fantasy novels like Tolkien specialize in.  It's no wonder fans of 'fantasy' do not like FFXV or FFVIII.

FFXV (and VIII) are both written like movies.  Movies are far shorter than novels, and especially in Japanese cinema character development is prioritized over world building.    Movies are always shorter and more focused on one theme, so they skip  over tying up every narrative element in a neat little package very often.\n\nThe criticisms of XV about things happening 'off screen' or things 'not being explained' can be leveled at a lot of anime and movies.  I use this one all the time, but Evangelion.  The end of the TV series completely ignored the plot about the angels and the end of the world and focused on shinji's final stages of character development.  This is because the giant robots and apocalyptic imagery were just window dressing for a character drama about a boy with deep depression and daddy issues.  Or take FLCL.

Adding too much extraneous side stuff to a movie doesn't make it better, it makes it less focused.\n\nLikewise, the Empire in FFXV literally doesn't matter.  Ravus doesn't matter.  In the end, the Empire is just a tool Ardyn uses to fuck with Noctis's head.  They were a red herring at best.  All that stuff takes a back seat to the story of Noctis's journey to becoming a man, and how his relationships with Luna, his dad and his friends facilitated that.  Ardyn was important as a revenge obsessed rival and a  tragic contrast to show what Noctis could become if he succumbed to despair as Ardyn did.  To use another comparison, Ravus &amp; the empire are about as important as General Tarkus and the stormtroopers are in the OG Star Wars trilogy.
