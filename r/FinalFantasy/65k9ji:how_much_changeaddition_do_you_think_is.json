What I personally want is an HD remaster rather than a remake.  Same story, characters, and gameplay, but updated graphics, sound, and translation.  Keep it as linear as it was originally in order to preserve the story.  And for the love of all that is good and holy, release the whole game at one time.  None of this episodic BS.

I very strongly dislike action-based gameplay and never play action RPGs or open worlds.  They&amp;#39;re just not appealing to me as a turn-based/story-driven JRPG fan.  What I personally want is an HD remaster rather than a remake.  Same story, characters, and gameplay, but updated graphics, sound, and translation.  Keep it as linear as it was originally in order to preserve the story.  And for the love of all that is good and holy, release the whole game at one time.  None of this episodic BS.
