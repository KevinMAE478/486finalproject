I&amp;#39;m building a scrolling device and hit a wall here.\nPart of the project includes a set of spindles that rotate together while connected by rubber bands. The elasticity and the surface of the rubber band against the spindle is essential to the moving parts. I&amp;#39;ve tried many other materials but only rubber bands work for my design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually need to affix paper to the other side of the band in the complete circle so that it creates a continuous scrolling paper surface. However I thought maybe fabric would be easier to attach to rubber so I figured it might work as an intermediary, but it&amp;#39;s not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bands are the moving part of the scrolling mechanism and the paper needs to move with them. The rubber grips the dowels just right that using a motor to turn one dowel turns the other and scrolls the bands in a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glue, staples and tape compromise the elasticity and can get in between the other side of the band and the spindle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?

Paper on the rubber bands will not work, the materials won't work together, rubber is elastic, paper is fibrous and shockingly enough, not elastic.

I would urge not to get too stuck on a particular design especially if it requires impossible things to happen in order to work. Be open to starting over from beginning principles and experiment to see what will work. I don't think there is any way to combine any material to the rubber without changing its properties.
