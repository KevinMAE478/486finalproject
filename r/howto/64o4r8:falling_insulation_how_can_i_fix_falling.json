Put the insulation back into its proper location, place an appropriately sized furring strip over that top edge (basically sandwiching that top edge of the insulation between the furring strip and the existing wood foundation) and nail the furring strips to the foundation.  Instead of being held by a few nails or staples, the insulation is held by the entire strip.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt to have a helper to hold it up while the other nails it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg3x73j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491918156.0, "created_utc": 1491889356.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o4r8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o4r8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o4r8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o4r8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5av9n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Outtacontrol22", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ezqf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did the furring strips and it looks better than it did before it fell, Thank you ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the furring strips and it looks better than it did before it fell, Thank you &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg5av9n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991126.0, "created_utc": 1491962326.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ezqf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gr8balooga", "parent_id": "t1_dg49vt7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If they ripped through then you might consider the furring strips idea above.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they ripped through then you might consider the furring strips idea above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg4ezqf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491953520.0, "created_utc": 1491924720.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49vt7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Outtacontrol22", "parent_id": "t1_dg402wv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's what is in there now it looks like.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what is in there now it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg49vt7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947466.0, "created_utc": 1491918666.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg402wv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gr8balooga", "parent_id": "t1_dg3pp11", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cap nails would work also, they are ribbed nails with plastic washers on the end to stop the insulation from falling off.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cap nails would work also, they are ribbed nails with plastic washers on the end to stop the insulation from falling off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg402wv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491925273.0, "created_utc": 1491896473.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o4r8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3vwkz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Idaho_Ent", "parent_id": "t1_dg3pp11", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Duct tape!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duct tape!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg3vwkz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491915651.0, "created_utc": 1491886851.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3pp11", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Outtacontrol22", "parent_id": "t3_64o4r8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 1, "body": "To start, I'm a new home owner so this kind of stuff is new to me.
