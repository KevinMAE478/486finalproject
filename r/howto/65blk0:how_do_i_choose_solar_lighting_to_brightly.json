For $1, you get an accent light.  Ten of those look nice along a driveway&amp;#39;s edge.  For $10-15, you can get something simple that lights up your front step.  And for $20-40+, you start getting some decent output.  Less than $100 could have you lit up nicely.  We&amp;#39;ve bought many solar lights from walmart over the years with generally good results (though they are not &lt;a href=\"/r/BIFL\"&gt;/r/BIFL&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for more output, you could buy an inexpensive solar panel kit from harbor freight plus a marine battery and some DC/LED lights and wire up a dedicated outdoor light system.  $350-500 probably for everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "howto", "name": "t1_dg99q1y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212316.0, "created_utc": 1492183516.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65blk0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ap7z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sishgupta", "parent_id": "t3_65blk0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/howto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Off the shelf solar lighting isn't going to properly  handle brightly lighting a driveway.\n\n I'm not saying you can't do this...but you're going need to go deep and build a solar system.
