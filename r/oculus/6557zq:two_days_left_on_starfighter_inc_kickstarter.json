I&amp;#39;d also assume that for ships that are mostly used in space, the best ships would be designed with space use first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is a common nitpick but I thought that with them focusing on realism that we would finally have a good space game with interesting ship design rather than yet another planes-in-space game. There&amp;#39;s a massive lost opportunity for some really weird and new ship design that just wouldn&amp;#39;t fly (pun intended) on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example a ship with a central cockpit that the main body, housing the thrusters, rotates around to limit rotational g-force on the pilot. Ships with more spindly extremities that would just break off if atmospheric drag was taken into account, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg80q94", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138152.0, "created_utc": 1492109352.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6557zq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg82zeh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stellarat", "parent_id": "t3_6557zq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Now 144,372 with 46 hours to go!\n\nNeed another 6K... \n\nanyone? ;)\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now 144,372 with 46 hours to go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Need another 6K... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;anyone? ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg82zeh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140597.0, "created_utc": 1492111797.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6557zq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ipw1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "darkcyde_", "parent_id": "t3_6557zq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just checked...\n$149,340 pledged of $150,000 goal \n\nSOO close.  41 hrs left at time of post.\n\nTwitch stream too\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/impellerstudios\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just checked...\n$149,340 pledged of $150,000 goal &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOO close.  41 hrs left at time of post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Twitch stream too\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/impellerstudios\"&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/impellerstudios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg8ipw1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160224.0, "created_utc": 1492131424.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6557zq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6557zq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85n2i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DemandsBattletoads", "parent_id": "t1_dg80aeh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's less than $5,000 away from the goal!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s less than $5,000 away from the goal!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg85n2i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143505.0, "created_utc": 1492114705.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg80aeh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "owenwp", "parent_id": "t3_6557zq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They failed their first kickstarter with over 90% funding.
