Felt like shit even after 15 minutes of play.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s good news, though confused. What titles did you try in first week? Do you get sick in even stationary experiences and do you get sick when stationary in real life?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually it&amp;#39;s just the artificial locomotion titles that cause the motion sickness and there are a lot on the store that do not have artificial locomotion that woupd have been better to start out with, or simply use teleporting in the titles that offer it. Though if you get sick in real life with labrinthitis when stationary the result would be the same in VR. Glad to hear you built up a tolerance to VR locomotion though if that&amp;#39;s what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg88r96", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492147074.0, "created_utc": 1492118274.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655qqa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655qqa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91z3y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Synra_Nightwalker", "parent_id": "t1_dg8d3qo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The VR nausea is largely triggered by moving landscape around you.
