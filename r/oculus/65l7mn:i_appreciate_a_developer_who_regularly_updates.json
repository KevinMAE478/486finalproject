(For example, today we had a GearVR specific issue that we were able to rapidly respond to thanks to these tools.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, for platforms other than Oculus Home PC, we do not get any user feedback asking to stop shipping updates so quickly, because those other distribution channels silently update or aggregate update notifications in a way that they can be ignored. It&amp;#39;s only Oculus Home on PC that causes problems since these notifications end up being surfaced to the user each time we update. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately our entire development process would have to change to treat this one platform specially (for example, we would need to update our automated deployment systems, our product rollout systems, and the way engineers manage changes.) We have been trying to avoid doing this since we expect Oculus Home will eventually collapse or hide update notifications as the number of apps grows, but it&amp;#39;s unclear if/when that will happen. We will continue to talk to Oculus about this issue and hope there is a way we can reduce these notifications soon. I&amp;#39;m really sorry that this is happening and we will see if there is any new functionality in Home that may let us silence or hide these notifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dgbajo0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492325095.0, "created_utc": 1492296295.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l7mn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l7mn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb84v6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "damontoo", "parent_id": "t1_dgb5qa4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But they somehow can't make my hands not look like crap.
