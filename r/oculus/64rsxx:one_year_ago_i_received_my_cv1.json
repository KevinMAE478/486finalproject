I've been on board the Oculus train since the very beginning. \n\nMy advice is: Get a Vive. I recently had to sell my Vive because of money problems, and decided to keep the Rift since it was free (kickstarter). Everytime I use it I miss my Vive even more... Whether its inferior tracking (in my experience), really uncomfortable for a person that uses glasses like me, and I can't help the feeling that the thing feels so much more fragile than the Vive. The fabric really doesn't help... While the Vive felt more like some sort of 80's gadget, it felt much more robust. The Rift on the other hand has electronics on the straps, which adds another point of costly repairs in case of failure, the cable feels weaker and I think is shorter? Plus the whole 3rd sensor thing... 2 sensors is just not enough, and anyone who says it's fine or works well has clearly not used a Vive for the long term. I hate having to worry about always facing forward.\n\nPlus no refunds on the Oculus store... I recently bought Rock Band VR and feel utterly ripped off for paying 50 USD for it. \n\nSpend 100 bucks more, get a Vive, but this is my personal opinion from personal experience. \n\nThe only thing I really like about the Rift is the clean industrial design, however everyone bumped my Vive to death and nothing never happened to it.

I&amp;#39;ve been on board the Oculus train since the very beginning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice is: Get a Vive. I recently had to sell my Vive because of money problems, and decided to keep the Rift since it was free (kickstarter). Everytime I use it I miss my Vive even more... Whether its inferior tracking (in my experience), really uncomfortable for a person that uses glasses like me, and I can&amp;#39;t help the feeling that the thing feels so much more fragile than the Vive. The fabric really doesn&amp;#39;t help... While the Vive felt more like some sort of 80&amp;#39;s gadget, it felt much more robust. The Rift on the other hand has electronics on the straps, which adds another point of costly repairs in case of failure, the cable feels weaker and I think is shorter? Plus the whole 3rd sensor thing... 2 sensors is just not enough, and anyone who says it&amp;#39;s fine or works well has clearly not used a Vive for the long term.
