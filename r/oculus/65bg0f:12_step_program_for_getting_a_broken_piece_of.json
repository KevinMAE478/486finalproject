If it&amp;#39;s clearly an actual fault as it was in both my cases, skip a few steps and get to shipping the customer his replacement hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s not a common fault, sure get some more information from the user. If you really want to weed out user error, do like other companies do and state that if the returned hardware does not have a fault, the customer will be charged a restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond serial number and proof of purchase as well as the basic troubleshooting I don&amp;#39;t see why they need so much information. I&amp;#39;ve never been asked by any other company to provide the serial number that was on the box (it&amp;#39;s always been the device itself, not the packaging) or been asked to create a video of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a seasoned support professional with over 20 years of experience, I&amp;#39;ve never put this much onus on the customer to prove that there is a fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if I come across as salty but I&amp;#39;ve been waiting my whole life for this technology to arrive and to have it fail so completely so quickly is extremely frustrating.
