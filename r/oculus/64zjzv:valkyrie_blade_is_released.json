Why they thought that was a good Idea I have no clue, I could understand if you were using an ability or something but no just regular old sword swings dash you forward, whats worse is that often when you go to parry an attack the game thinks you are making a swing and will dash you right into the enemy causing you to either get hit or clip inside of them, rather disorienting. You can do nothing other than parry and attack with the sword, and I say parry like it was useful; Half the time you think you got a parry and collide with their sword the game just ignores this and you get hit.
