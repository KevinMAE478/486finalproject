And in fact, it is a hiccup / framedrop by the game that triggers this. But then, while those hiccups need to be handled by the devs, the system should properly return to the game instead of completely dropping out.\n\nIt's just a wild guess but one reason this may be happening on Oculus is because Oculus has its own compositor, so there's probably some magic involved to make this work properly. And magic sometimes fails.\n\nIt's really unfortunate that they either missed or ignored [my posting about it](http://steamcommunity.com/app/358720/discussions/0/133259227531546833/) back then.

Then they have time to fix it. I&amp;#39;m actually quite surprised they only have default and beta now because they did have older versions in there in the past. But I guess they wanted to clean things up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having at least the previous version available would go a long ways and it&amp;#39;s actually quite easy to do when publishing through Steam (for Holodance, we have alpha, beta, default and &amp;quot;previous&amp;quot;, so if we publish something that breaks things, people can always revert to the last version that worked). It&amp;#39;s actually kind of a no-brainer to do it this way. Saves everyone sleepless nights and Steam has the infrastructure in place to do it ;-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg5ppo5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492022806.0, "created_utc": 1491994006.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4w6ko", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mordecosta", "parent_id": "t1_dg4w0gh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Already tried that, i was talking with one of the developers of holodance and he said that the beta version of steam vr that was with this problem is one the stable one, dont know if that is true but i already try the beta and the stable and boths are having this problem.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already tried that, i was talking with one of the developers of holodance and he said that the beta version of steam vr that was with this problem is one the stable one, dont know if that is true but i already try the beta and the stable and boths are having this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg4w6ko", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972288.0, "created_utc": 1491943488.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4w0gh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FriendCalledFive", "parent_id": "t3_64tjke", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Try swapping to beta or stable version of SteamVR.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try swapping to beta or stable version of SteamVR.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg4w0gh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972106.0, "created_utc": 1491943306.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tjke", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5575k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrazyFalco", "parent_id": "t3_64tjke", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ty for the info OP, I posted yesterday in Pavlov vr steam forum assuming it was an issue my end.
