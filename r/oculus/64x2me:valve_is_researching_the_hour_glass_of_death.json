Its not like having one other piece of software in the chain will ruin your gaming experience.\n\n&gt; Particularly as the Oculus code updates independently of SteamVR, so SteamVR may work perfectly one day and be broken the next.\n\nOculus updates that break Steam VR would also break normal Oculus games.

Now they have time to come up with a proper fix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would have been better had they solved it when people reported this on the beta-branch (I certainly did) ... but they didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg60p6c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039660.0, "created_utc": 1492010860.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x2me", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x2me", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wgdf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "azazel0821", "parent_id": "t1_dg5vzq9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "that never made every single game I bought unplayable for me", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;that never made every single game I bought unplayable for me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg5wgdf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034763.0, "created_utc": 1492005963.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5vzq9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kendrome", "parent_id": "t1_dg5udo4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you not remember Oculus asking for the same thing when tracking was bad?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you not remember Oculus asking for the same thing when tracking was bad?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "oculus", "name": "t1_dg5vzq9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034171.0, "created_utc": 1492005371.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x2me", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x2me", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6czsp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "azazel0821", "parent_id": "t1_dg639yc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oculus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I certainly don't ***know*** that. and I must consider that I am seeing only what people online are discussing.

There were severe tracking issues even with just that and even while using the recommended PCIe card for many users. The latter problems of the 1.11 patch also affected front facing users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the recommended PCIe card, that piece of shit was hardly usable thanks to the constant disconnects until somebody not working for Oculus came up with the registry mod that turned off the internal power management of the card. The same tweak is now part of Oculus Tray Tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They did not ship a &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot; product. It is true that they released an update that slightly messed up tracking for some people, but every game was playable. However, in Steam we are looking at a black screen with no way to play our games&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t play at all during February because the Guarding shifts while in game made it to dangerous. Other people could play for ten minutes until they needed to restart because of the height shifts. I wouldn&amp;#39;t call that usable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Steam bug was beta only until yesterday, was still not affecting all Rift users and they reverted the stable version back because of it.
