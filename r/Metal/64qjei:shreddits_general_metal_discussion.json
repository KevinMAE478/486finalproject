Rheingold is the goto album for their peak.    \n  \n\nGamma Ray is a heavy speed power mix, they have a similar sound to helloween but its quite their own. Land of the Free and their first 3 albums are the best choices.  \n  \nOrden Ogan is a folk power prog mix that is surprisingly satisfying. They are quite unique and should be a highlight for new power metal bands to come. Ravenhead and To The End are the strongest works with tunes that really give meaning to the name of the genre.  \n  \nHammerfall put out more or less the same level with a decline after crimson thunder, first 3 albums of theirs are pure gold however. Great mix of heavy (drop c tuning iirc) and power choruses.  \n  \nEdguy and Avantadia are fantastic, the thing is Tobias' voice is acquired, like beer. After you get used to it they produce some gems. Their newer stuff leans more toward hard rock, initial releases are much of a traditional power sound.  \n  \nDream Evil play a fast and loose style of power. Typically their music is heavy metal with power choruses. Dont look to hard at their lyrics, its too cheesey.  \n  \nFreedom Call is Bob Ross metal style. Its happy. Thats about it for them.  \n  \nPowerwolf are an unusual mix of spooky church with metal. Lyrics are confusing and random to say the least. Vocally atilla is rather impressive and the guitar work is usually solid. Persoanlly their first 2 albums are their best.  \n  \nPrimal Fear are a wildcard of heavy speed power (this is quite a commom combo in EUPM). Imagine helloween and gamma ray had kids, this is them.  \n  \nSilent Force are an unknown band who has produced some of the greatest power prog metal. DC Cooper as a lead vocalist really takes the cake; they are a german band with american vocalist giving a mix between EUPM and USPM. Walk the Earth is their best record with no fillers and no weakpoints.  \n  \nAnd for more USPM, try Kamelot. Karma to Black Halo is their peak, no weaknesses in quality or production and each album is a helluva ride. Roy Khan delivers a remarkable performance on each and Youngblood showcases his skill at guitar. Ghost Opera is a tad too keyboard driven yet solid nonetheless. Poetry for the Poisoned takes so many listens to for appreciation. Silverthorn is poo imo. Haven is a bit better, too much trying to imitate Khan still. Their earlier works are great musically and vocally hard (sorry Vanderbilt the Queensryche style is not for you). Siege Perilous and Fourth Legacy are great works of power metal with strong prog influences with the addition of Khan (listen to conecption and you will hear it).  \n  \nYikes that was quite a list.
