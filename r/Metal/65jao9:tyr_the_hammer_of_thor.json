Before you get on your high horse, read about the Grind.  It looks violent but is conducted with ethical standards that far surpass ho we treat beef cattle.  The whales (which are phylogenetically dolphins) are drive to the shore and killed swiftly, not hunted far out to sea.  They live their whole lives wild and are then harvested.  The Grind does not affect population dynamics or their ability to maintain a stable, diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The alternative to this is eating factory-farm meat from animals that live their entire lives in captivity, or else restructuring the entire meat industry of Europe.  So don&amp;#39;t be too quick to demonize a small island culture for having a bloody but small ecological footprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Metal", "name": "t1_dgc8cvl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492389319.0, "created_utc": 1492360519.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhud", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jao9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc18p6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GorgorMith", "parent_id": "t1_dgbkkm5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Metal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He supports whaling in the Faroe Islands, which is in fact quite brutal.
