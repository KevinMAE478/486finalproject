Secondly, and more importantly, the mindset of \"I need to prove myself to these people\" gives you a certain subservient predisposition towards your human interactions with the interviewers; this is normal, in fact, they're expecting it.  The mindset of \"I need to make sure this is a company *I* can work ~~for~~ with\" gives you a more judging, evaluating, and **confident** predisposition instead.  Whether that confidence is real or not doesn't matter, because job interviewers decide whether they're going to hire you [very quickly](https://qz.com/406976/heres-how-quickly-interviewers-decide-whether-or-not-to-hire-you/) (tl;dr: 60% of job interviews are decided in 15 minutes; 5% in 5 minutes).  \n\nYou walk in with confidence and an aura of self awareness and make a good human connection.  Then you get the job, because basically everyone never makes a truly rational decisions, they merely rationalize their decision [after their gut tells them what to do](http://www.skepticink.com/tippling/2013/11/14/post-hoc-rationalisation-reasoning-our-intuition-and-changing-our-minds/).

Your actual skillset relevant to the job is probably not even a top 5 most important factor for your hiring.  Based on my experience in a &lt;em&gt;technically meritocratic field known for de-prioritizing social constructs&lt;/em&gt;, my top five would be (in order): prior connections to the company, appearance, self-confidence, relatability/similarity to interviewer (sorry guys, the hard truth is white people prefer to hire white people, and brown people feel the same way about brown people; men prefer to hire men, and women prefer to hire women; and this is all probably completely unconscious to people because of post hoc rationalization), and finally friendliness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, walk in like you&amp;#39;re the cock of the walk and try to make everyone like you, and then convince them that you have the skills for the position.  I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime_irl", "name": "t1_dg6tahj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492071029.0, "created_utc": 1492042229.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61qxt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jeremynow", "parent_id": "t1_dg619b0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime_irl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "good luck fam", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;good luck fam&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime_irl", "name": "t1_dg61qxt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040813.0, "created_utc": 1492012013.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg66mgo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shmameron", "parent_id": "t1_dg619b0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime_irl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ganbatte!

This depends on the job, but office jobs (Formal dress, shirt tie etc.) generally prefer a certain level of outward professionalism that these styles don&amp;#39;t demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This used to be commonly true too for men with long hair and/or beards though I don&amp;#39;t hear it as much anymore. Sometimes it still is depending on the industry/area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is for the same reasons you comb your hair, shower etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The qualities mentioned above are generally seen as childish or messy/lazy. People commonly sporting these styles are also looked down upon for rebellious nature or laziness.

About halfway through, he asks me to &amp;quot;name 5 video games you have played recently.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I could not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat there for like literally 2 minutes saying &amp;quot;uhhhh, well, there was.... shit, what was it called...&amp;quot;. I just could not think of any. The guy even butted in a few times with &amp;quot;what about this popular game?&amp;quot;, none of which I had played at the time. I didn&amp;#39;t even lie and say &amp;quot;oh yeah, I&amp;#39;ve played that one&amp;quot;. I was so fucking set on just thinking of a game I&amp;#39;ve played, or even watched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, what I came up with was Persona 3 and Persona 4, Half Life 2, and this MMO called Pangya. Which is only 4 games. I was so adamant that I played plenty of video games, but looking back on it, being poor and in college and only have an old PS2, all I did was browse 4chan and read manga online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shaken for the rest of the interview, just kinda mumbled through everything else, and never got a call back after I left. Ended up getting a job somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is the story about how I utterly failed the most confident interview I&amp;#39;ve ever taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime_irl", "name": "t1_dg6ch5w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051878.0, "created_utc": 1492023078.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_386zh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqpe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ea8d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "metallicrooster", "parent_id": "t1_dg69paj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime_irl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Having been both\n\nIf you work in the back, you mostly get yelled at by management, sometimes a customer.\n\nWorking up front, you WILL get yelled at by customers, probably by management too.\n\nThey are both bad.
