arrested, or have to support a child which means, you guessed it, more grinding.\n\noh and some of the things they put in this game, man those developers are fucked up, you can actually torture people, kill and even rape children, and all sorts of fucked up shit, and i hear some of the players actually do it. i'm just saying that kind of thing shouldn't be allowed.\n\nanyhow, it's a pretty
