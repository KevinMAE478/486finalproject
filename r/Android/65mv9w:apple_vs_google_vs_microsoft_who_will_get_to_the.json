Some students, especially engineers and some B.S. programs, are going to need a more powerful programs. Same with students studying film or design. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can definitely get away with a Chromebook if they have to, and just use the university&amp;#39;s machines for heavy lifting.  However, being able to do those tasks on your own machine makes life a lot easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liberal arts students have a bit of a stronger case since most of what they need a computer for is word processing and doing online assignments, but even then Google Docs really isn&amp;#39;t as good as the full Office suite. Bibliography management, weird formatting, and lots of other little things like that are infinitely easier on Word. Not to mention that Office is the de facto standard for everything in the academic and professional world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus at the end of the day, most students just prefer MacOS or Windows to ChromeOS. ChromeOS is pretty limited in general, and there are plenty of things I do fairly often that I simply can&amp;#39;t do on a Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgcluqk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492407020.0, "created_utc": 1492378220.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcj68x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Douglerful", "parent_id": "t1_dgcfa0n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd say your the minority, how many of those students only need a document editor vs how many need more advanced programs, that btw would almost certainly be ported over when the demand for them became apparent", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say your the minority, how many of those students only need a document editor vs how many need more advanced programs, that btw would almost certainly be ported over when the demand for them became apparent&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgcj68x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492403533.0, "created_utc": 1492374733.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcfa0n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "teamhoun", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1eo0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Especially when it comes to the PC market.
