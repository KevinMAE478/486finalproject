It was to me what Nokia 3310 was to most people, a durable workhorse with killer features, and radically different compared to what was offered at the time by the competition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used that phone and its variants on and off for about 3 years and I have to say that the audio quality matches that of the S5 and V10, which is something a lot of phones today can&amp;#39;t claim. It supports 64gb sdcards and above, the screen is perfectly usable, the batteries aren&amp;#39;t made for them anymore unfortunately but it regularly gets 3 hours of screentime which is in the ballpark of some phones today (and a lot worse than some other phones today, but given the time gap between them, I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s a good result, not galaxy nexus level abysmal battery tier).\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjpmDjUtJw\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjpmDjUtJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It runs Opera Mini just fine, Shuttle for music, 800x480 is perfect for 4&amp;quot; (S2&amp;#39;s screen was 4.3&amp;quot; and 800x480). Sure, it&amp;#39;s 512mb ram that you can&amp;#39;t do anything with, but it will hold those 2 programs (provided you don&amp;#39;t have more than 3 tabs open in Opera Mini) and one chat client in memory. CM10.2, flashed micro gapps (playstore works perfectly), root, grenify, voodoo audio, custom kernel OC&amp;#39;d to 1.2ghz (live OC at that), fstrim enabled, and you have one mean mother. Yeah, sure, you have to tinker around with it for a day or so, but it&amp;#39;s worth it. Yeah, sure you could get a Moto E on sale for like 20$ and it will run better, but the Moto E doesn&amp;#39;t come close when it comes to audio performance. The best MP3 player hands down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t push it as if you were using a 2016 flagship, it still holds up tremendously today.
