It would help to know the type of glass that is used on the device, so you could have a better understanding of what your phone can handle. Also, if your phone is IP67 or 68 approved, you'll have resistance to sand/dirt/dust. So that might be something to consider when looking for a phone/going case free.\n\nAs to your original question, until recently I've been caseless with most phones. From the HTC G1, Galaxy S1, S3, Note 3, Note 4, Nexus 6, to the V10 I was mostly caseless. I had a flip cover case for the Note 3, but that actually ended up scratching my screen! So it was short lived. I got a case for the Nexus 6 for $4 and it was super minimal and added some much needed grip (phone would fall into the black hole between the seat in the car) but then I got a car mount and away with that one!\n\nThe only phone I felt like I absolutely needed a case for was the Galaxy S7E, because it's glass on front and back. I ordered one for my G6 too. Both are from Spigen, and only add about 1-1.5mm to the front, which is enough to put the phone face down and never touch the screen. \n\nOther than that, yeah I've dropped my phones a couple times, and the edges get scuffed, but at least I get to hold and look at my phone instead of a case that's going to shelter it for what? The next owner? Nah. I'd compare it to a couch cover. If something happens, it happens, but I'm going to enjoy the couch. I can always get it fixed/buy a new one of need be. These new phones are the exception. It doesn't get more slippery than double sided glass. Even a dbrand skin for the S7E wasn't enough.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What phone do you have? It would help to know the type of glass that is used on the device, so you could have a better understanding of what your phone can handle. Also, if your phone is IP67 or 68 approved, you&amp;#39;ll have resistance to sand/dirt/dust. So that might be something to consider when looking for a phone/going case free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to your original question, until recently I&amp;#39;ve been caseless with most phones. From the HTC G1, Galaxy S1, S3, Note 3, Note 4, Nexus 6, to the V10 I was mostly caseless. I had a flip cover case for the Note 3, but that actually ended up scratching my screen! So it was short lived. I got a case for the Nexus 6 for $4 and it was super minimal and added some much needed grip (phone would fall into the black hole between the seat in the car) but then I got a car mount and away with that one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only phone I felt like I absolutely needed a case for was the Galaxy S7E, because it&amp;#39;s glass on front and back. I ordered one for my G6 too. Both are from Spigen, and only add about 1-1.5mm to the front, which is enough to put the phone face down and never touch the screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, yeah I&amp;#39;ve dropped my phones a couple times, and the edges get scuffed, but at least I get to hold and look at my phone instead of a case that&amp;#39;s going to shelter it for what? The next owner? Nah. I&amp;#39;d compare it to a couch cover. If something happens, it happens, but I&amp;#39;m going to enjoy the couch. I can always get it fixed/buy a new one of need be. These new phones are the exception. It doesn&amp;#39;t get more slippery than double sided glass. Even a dbrand skin for the S7E wasn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgc7it7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388204.0, "created_utc": 1492359404.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbyrlu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 70, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wrathagainst", "parent_id": "t1_dgbxzfm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not my pockets per se, I live in a dry dusty area (SE asia)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not my pockets per se, I live in a dry dusty area (SE asia)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgbyrlu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492373428.0, "created_utc": 1492344628.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 70}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ohaw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgrdc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bakugandrago18", "parent_id": "t1_dgbxzfm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You mean you don't use pocket sand?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You mean you don&amp;#39;t use pocket sand?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgcgrdc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400413.0, "created_utc": 1492371613.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ohaw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc49li", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Phinocio", "parent_id": "t1_dgbxzfm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My Pixel has a *ton* of small scratches on the screen just from taking it in and out of my jeans pockets :/.", "edited": 1492357561.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Pixel has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of small scratches on the screen just from taking it in and out of my jeans pockets :/.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgc49li", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492383703.0, "created_utc": 1492354903.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ohaw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd038s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Enterprise_NX-01", "parent_id": "t1_dgbxzfm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I used to stick my V10 in my pocket and ended up with a lot of fine scratches on the screen.
