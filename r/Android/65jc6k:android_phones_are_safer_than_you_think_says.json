Google only ships updates to a subset of the OS apks for vendors licensing Play, not the core OS. They moved a few things to apks to do that but the bulk of the OS cannot be updated like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to pull in the security patches for AOSP from Google, and running through thorough testing / QA doesn&amp;#39;t really take all that long. It&amp;#39;s much different than the high difficulty of porting substantial changes to the OS from one version to the other, although vendors get early access to the new version and could just stop making changes so substantial that they have no handle on them and can&amp;#39;t get them ported with months of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgb52pt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492317448.0, "created_utc": 1492288648.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jc6k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jc6k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb7y5a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItsBeenFun2017", "parent_id": "t1_dgb7j2l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I do not disagree with what you have said, but my Galaxy S4 Verizon is running 5.0.1, so the cutoff is just a little later.
