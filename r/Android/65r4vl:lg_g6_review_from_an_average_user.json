[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Android", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of LG G6 reviews lately and most of them just list out the specs. Most of the comments usually ask for a more subjective review, so I&amp;#39;ll try to describe my experience with the phone so far, which I&amp;#39;ve had for a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the G6?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m coming from a 3 year old HTC M8 where the battery is pretty much shot. Two other phones I&amp;#39;ve considered were the Samsung S8, and OnePlus 3T. I&amp;#39;ll describe my decisions on the features as well but ultimately, it came down to best value and timing as I was able to grab the G6 for about $640 CAD (available now), vs $1130 for the regular S8 (available end of the month). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really like the clean look of the G6. I have the platinum version and it is eye catching. The minimal bezels should be standard nowadays. It&amp;#39;s not a fingerprint magnet like the black version. Its comfortable to hold on the hand and it&amp;#39;s not slippery. My M8 was very slippery because of the material and curves, and thinness. I felt more confident in one handed hold with the G6. I still bought a clear case for it (Spigen clear view) to protect the glass and it doesn&amp;#39;t really add more to the size and still fits in my pants pocket. The case also helps me locate the fingerprint scanner, as during the first days, I would accidentally put my finger on the camera area. The raised fingerprint scanner lip helps, but the case just helps me locate it faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fingerprint scanner is also located at a great position for accessories. if you have a car holder, the scanner sits above the back side of the holder so you can still unlock the phone. Its very responsive and I have no complaints, even if this is my first phone with a scanner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My M8 had the headphone jack on the bottom, and volume keys on the right side. I prefer that configuration due to the way I rotate my phone in landscape (90 degree counter clockwise and volume buttons on top) and the way I insert the phone in my pocket with headphones plugged in. I insert it upside down so when I take the phone out its oriented properly. The G6 has the jack on top and volume keys on the left side so I insert it in my pocket bottom first. Its not a big deal but I&amp;#39;m getting used to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The volume keys are responsive and has a nice click to it (the scanner/power button too). I never accidentally clicked on them when they were in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The screen is really nice. Its bright, responsive, sharp. I don&amp;#39;t know anything about display calibration but I feel like it&amp;#39;s neutral. Nice blacks, it can get really bright, and the color balance is good. I don&amp;#39;t feel like it leans on the cool or warm side at all. I&amp;#39;ll leave the technical testing to sites like AnandTech but the display is really good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The extra size is perfect. I always thought on screen keys took up too much of the display on my M8. For the G6, it&amp;#39;s great as it feel like you still have a full 16:9 screen even after the on screen keys took up space. You can also have additional buttons  (I added a notification pull down and a screenshot capture) so I have 5 keys at all time on the screen row. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The auto brightness works well. There&amp;#39;s an on screen display option but I turn it off to save battery. I tried it and it&amp;#39;s actually very useful since I did not realize the G6 did not have a notification light (biggest downside!) Edit: there&amp;#39;s a double tap to wake feature to turn on your phone if it&amp;#39;s lying flat on a desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really like curved edges, but would&amp;#39;ve gone with the S8 ff the price was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People complain about the rounded corners because they&amp;#39;re not actually round and the linear part is not a tangent to the curve. Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t notice it because when do you actually look at the corner of your phone screen? You only see it if you&amp;#39;re actively looking for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming from the front facing speaker of the M8, I know that the G6 won&amp;#39;t be as good with the single firing downward facing speaker. But I&amp;#39;m pleasantly surprised with it. Its loud, doesn&amp;#39;t Crackle, and it&amp;#39;s clear. It sounds clearer and better directionally on portrait mode, maybe because it bounces off your body? Vs landscape mode where the sound doesn&amp;#39;t bounce of anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t have quad DAC but I&amp;#39;m not an audiophile. I don&amp;#39;t even know if I&amp;#39;ll notice a difference. It sounds the same, of not similar, to my M8. I use V-Moda headphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phone calls were clear, and it has good noise cancelling for the other line? It records audio pretty well too. Went to a club for a friend&amp;#39;s birthday and the audio recorder was clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love the cameras on this phone. For the most part, I use photos for social media (Facebook, Instagram, snapchat). I have a DSLR if I really need to take pro photos. The secondary wide angle was a huge selling feature for me. Photos taken were great. If you&amp;#39;re really zooming in to the pixel level, you&amp;#39;ll see the low light shots have a bit of noise. But for what I use it for, (quick snaps with friends and capture the moment, it&amp;#39;s great). The video is crisp and clear and records audio well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Photos taken weren&amp;#39;t over or under exposed. Auto works well. Flash is bright and can illuminate well 10 feet away. When I was recording my drunken snap stories at 3 in the morning, the screen would light up to illuminate selfies. I thought this was a nice feature (don&amp;#39;t think I had it in my M8.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Quick photo samples: &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6R1F-21QG5wSmcxTzlpOFkyekE\"&gt;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6R1F-21QG5wSmcxTzlpOFkyekE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RAW (DNG) + JPG that saves with it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Auto (one regular, one wide angle, one macro). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Video&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Android 7.0 out of the box. I use Nova Launcher and KLWP to customize my screens. Its fast and responsive. I hear stories about bootloops (this is my first LG), but sometimes I wonder if that&amp;#39;s just because the loudest people can be heard... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like some of Sense&amp;#39;s features better than the UX. In HTC, I was able to hide folders in my gallery. (For example, I want to hide the WhatsApp media folder because I don&amp;#39;t care about the memes or videos or gifs my friends send me). LG has a feature to &amp;quot;lock&amp;quot; photos. If you decide to go that route, it takes several seconds to lock and unlock photos and albums (there&amp;#39;s a progress bar).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Google assistant is quick. Everyone&amp;#39;s probably already seen that speed comparison of the S8 vs iPhone 7+ vs G6 vs Pixel vs Op3T. But to be honest, coming from my M8, everything opens up fast. I also turned off animations in the developer settings to make everything appear faster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Battery is above average. It&amp;#39;s bigger than the regular S8! Not the greatest for endurance though. I use Facebook Messenger a lot and I think that&amp;#39;s my biggest battery drain. I listen to music, browse Reddit, surf the web, snapchat, check Instagram, occasional videos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On screen time varies depending on battery draining apps, but typically 4.5 to 5 hours on a full charge (according to accubattery and gsam). But coming from my 2.5 hour on screen time (max) from my M8, it feels great that I don&amp;#39;t need to worry about charging. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The quick charge is blazing fast if I need a top up. I also bought a wireless charger which is so convenient. The phone doesn&amp;#39;t get hot when charging. I noticed that in my M8. I haven&amp;#39;t run anything intensive on this phone yet like games, but that&amp;#39;s because I don&amp;#39;t want to shorten the life span of the battery. I&amp;#39;m using my M8 as my secondary phone for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USB C is great, but I have to buy extra cables. I have about 4 charging locations (bed side, living room, work, and car) so updating my chargers and cable is an added expense because I cannot reuse my M8s cables. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waterproofing is great to have for peace of mind. I haven&amp;#39;t\u200b dunked the phone under water but it&amp;#39;s good to know that I can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SD card slot is great because I was able to transfer photos and music on that. All my media is on the SD card. It&amp;#39;s almost a necessity because there&amp;#39;s only 19GB free space on the phone straight out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: You get a 100GB Google Drive upgrade when you set up the device. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that my choice for a new phone was based on my daily needs. It might differ from person to person. I need an all around daily driver and the G6 didn&amp;#39;t really have any glaring weaknesses. Pixel peepers may be disappointed with picture quality (I don&amp;#39;t know why though) but it&amp;#39;s great on screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Display (amazing bezel less display)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fingerprint scanner (responsive and great location)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Camera quality (great for social media and sharing)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Size (fits comfortably in hand)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The phone is designed very well.

You get bigger storage and upgraded SoC. But because the G6 was almost half the price and available now, I decided to go with it. The 821 is no slouch, it&amp;#39;s still in the Pixel, and I don&amp;#39;t use a lot of very intensive apps (maybe snap seed?)

I was an HTC fan (previous phones: original HTC Desire which me fall in love with HTC, One S, and M8.) But the price did not justify the features.
