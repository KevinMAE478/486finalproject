Even with an SD card, there are SO many things you can&amp;#39;t put on your SD card. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speed wise, it&amp;#39;s definitely not as fast as modern phones, but I&amp;#39;m pretty impressed by how well it&amp;#39;s held up over the years. I was going to upgrade to the S7 Edge but decided to wait until the Note 7, which was an amazing phone. I was going to buy the Note 7 until they . . .caught on fire and such which forced me to have to wait for the S8. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want the Note 8, but I just honestly can&amp;#39;t wait any longer. The S4 did really well lasting as long as it did for me, but pushing it as long as I did was really about 6 months to a year longer than I should have.
