My old phone had a bigger battery (LG G Flex) and I was real concerned coming to this phone with a smaller battery because battery life is typically the biggest thing I look for or that will bother me. This thing is a beast with battery life. And is super smooth and quick. Camera is nice although not the best out there but still holds its own, even can take a quick, well focused pic at night. I would absolutely buy this phone again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dg8izab", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160580.0, "created_utc": 1492131780.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657168", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg83t85", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aerispac", "parent_id": "t3_657168", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's some good news for that new BlackBerry coming out.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s some good news for that new BlackBerry coming out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dg83t85", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141496.0, "created_utc": 1492112696.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657168", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657168", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8lndm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MontiBurns", "parent_id": "t1_dg86mnf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Where do you live?
