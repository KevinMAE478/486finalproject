Some people will even turn off the capacitive keys on their phone just to get the on screen buttons. When you do this you often reduce the effective screen size of your screen by often around half an inch, which may not sound like much, but compare a 4.5 inch display to a 5 inch display and the 5 inch display seems like it&amp;#39;s way larger. There are a few circumstances where the soft keys disappear, such as watching a video and a handful of games, and there are tools that let you hide the soft keys whenever you want, but now to access your navigation buttons it takes an extra swipe or press, which I feel is very inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screen burn in on AMOLED displays: This is less of an issue because of modern AMOLED displays, but my galaxy nexus (my first android phone) had screen burn in where the capacitive keys were after only around a month of usage.

For example, I can turn on my phone while it&amp;#39;s on a table without having to reach around the side or do a double tap on the screen. I find it easier to figure out which way my phone is facing while it is in the dark. I can turn on my phone while grabbing it out of my pocket easier than I can by pressing the power button.

While the galaxy s8&amp;#39;s solution of having a massive screen with a wider aspect ratio, I feel this is kind of a redundant solution for a few reasons. One is that unless you set them to always hide (which now requires an inefficient extra swipe to show) the majority of situations you will be getting pretty much the same screen size as you would on a 16:9 phone of the same size.

A capacitive home button/fingerprint scanner serves the same purpose as a physical one without requiring enough pressure to push in a button.  I have an iphone 6S for work, and I&amp;#39;ve used both that and my 10 in the same car mount.  In order to get enough pressure to push the iphone&amp;#39;s physical home button without flipping it out of the mount, I have to grab the back of the mount to stabilize it.  With the 10, I just lightly tap the fingerprint scanner and hold for a second.  It&amp;#39;s much faster and easier, not to mention less moving parts to fail over the lifetime of the device.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgbqwq4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492350220.0, "created_utc": 1492321420.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mg4o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mg4o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mg4o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd7tsc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PomfersVS", "parent_id": "t1_dgce41c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's probably because that bubble thing offers far greater functionality than what tends to be capable of being fit into virtual keys.

Like /u/finewhitelady mentioned with the car mount, when I watch people use their phones, clicking the button makes the entire phone tilt upwards. You can't just tap the button and go, you have to stabilize it so it doesn't flip over.

To get a feel, try using your phone without letting your pinky or ring finger touch the phone, and that's what it's like to have tiny little t-rex hands :)\n\nThe other point she also mentioned is moving parts. Switches have limitations on how many times they can be clicked and two factors are of particular importance. Firstly is that smaller switches tend to have lower levels of endurance. Secondly is that endurance goes down with increased actuation force. If there is a series of switches with various actuation forces, usually the lower force switches are rated for more clicks. These aren't hard rules, just what I've noticed while browsing through parts catalogs from Omron, Panasonic, and Alps. Large low force switches generally last longer than small high force switches, and phones tend to use the latter.\n\nMy 6P's fingerprint scanner, onscreen buttons, and Cyanogenmod's ability to turn the screen off with gestures means that I barely had to use the power button.

My main gripe aren&amp;#39;t the physical or capacitive buttons themselves, but the way they&amp;#39;ve been implemented optically &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgby4b7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492371658.0, "created_utc": 1492342858.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbwzxl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SinkTube", "parent_id": "t1_dgbw5q5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "you can change what hardware buttons do too", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you can change what hardware buttons do too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgbwzxl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492368114.0, "created_utc": 1492339314.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbw5q5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LeGensu", "parent_id": "t1_dgbuxbn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "On the s8 yes, that's why that type of buttons is better.
