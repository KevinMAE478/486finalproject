I just got a fitbit because I need to start doing something for my health, and i have to say the ability to see who is calling and get my text messages  is awesome, and all I have is a Charge 2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now things a wearable can do that a phone can not: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Monitor Health - Eventually your wearable will be able to tell  things like O2 and blood sugar levels along with heart rate and steps. This will make it invaluable to people over 40. Imagine a device that can call for help if you have a heart attack  before you even know you are having one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Easy access screen - the ability to see your text messages and caller ID without taking out your phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Simple input device - answer and hangup phone without having to pull out your phone. really useful if you are hands free. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) AR gesture controls - AR will pick up sometime in the next 10 years, and people will need some kind of input device for their hands. A smart watch with a couple of accelerometers, a gyroscope, and some kind of trackable surface will be a lot more fashionable than gloves or dedicated controllers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Replace phones all together - If we get good portable AR and use wireless headphones, then why do we need a large phone? once the screen is divorced from the phone a wearable can handle all the processing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just from the top of my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(edit to fix readability) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dg4wrk9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972953.0, "created_utc": 1491944153.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qz4z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qz4z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5hog6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "press_A_to_skip", "parent_id": "t1_dg5460e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huawei watch and Samsung Gear both last for 2 days, and you can stretch both to 3.
