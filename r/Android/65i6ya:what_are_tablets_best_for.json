She loves her iPad- there are times at home where she&amp;#39;ll lose her phone and not notice for &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;- she&amp;#39;s locked into her iPad life; lots of Netflix/Plex/Facebook/Instagram/Angry Birds/Farmville/etc. No judgment, but she&amp;#39;s a content consumer in the biggest way possible. She likes a personal, &amp;#39;me&amp;#39; device that just has a bigger screen than her iPhone 6. There&amp;#39;s just no space for this in the tech-centric/tech-geek workflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad devices like the Surface Book and Surface Pro exist for people like &amp;#39;us&amp;#39;, and I&amp;#39;m disappointed that Android OEMs can&amp;#39;t pull off what Microsoft did here- and it&amp;#39;s a software limitation for sure. The Surface products bridge the gap between where my phone, tablet, computer, and TV fail to intersect. I&amp;#39;m worried Android won&amp;#39;t be able to keep up with that, because if a guy like me who is in love with the Android ecosystem and loathes using his work iPhone is considering a Surface Book as his next purchase- we have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgbsfxy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492353806.0, "created_utc": 1492325006.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i6ya", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i6ya", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbhi0c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "assignpseudonym", "parent_id": "t1_dgaiu1f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you use a stylus?
