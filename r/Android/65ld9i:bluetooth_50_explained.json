The one exception is Sony&amp;#39;s LDAC which recently in Android O allows you to choose between 330/660/990 Kbps. The easiest way to hear the difference between HFP/HSP and A2DP is to have a computer that supports changing the audio profile: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/dT3RSRh.png\"&gt;example.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other would be to encode an MP3 file to around 64 Kbps as mono audio and you&amp;#39;ll have a similar sound to (except MP3 is a bit more efficient) HFP. It&amp;#39;s 128 Kbps because it supports two 64 Kbps streams for stereo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgbm10z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492341723.0, "created_utc": 1492312923.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbk45x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pheymanss", "parent_id": "t1_dgbcoiu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Excuse me for asking because I only understood like 70% of your comment, but could I artificially cripple my Bluetooth speed to make the comparison between 128kbps and whatever my regular speed is?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excuse me for asking because I only understood like 70% of your comment, but could I artificially cripple my Bluetooth speed to make the comparison between 128kbps and whatever my regular speed is?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Android", "name": "t1_dgbk45x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338892.0, "created_utc": 1492310092.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ld9i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ld9i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ld9i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ld9i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ld9i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgccmaq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tesagk", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9s54", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Android", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, of course not.
