Ask the average Canadian about how often they use Whatsapp, and they'll just reply \"What the hell is Whatsapp?\"\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I can speak to the situation in Canada. SMS/MMS are totally dominant here because:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMS/MMS is dirt cheap. Like &amp;quot;cost of a latte or two at starbucks for a month&amp;#39;s unlimited use&amp;quot; cheap. Unlimited SMS/MMS is usually included in even the cheapest of prepaid mobile plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile data is &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; expensive, to the point where a lot of people (especially older people and non-techies) don&amp;#39;t even bother having data plans for their smartphones at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a huge iphone marketshare. &lt;a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/canada/2016\"&gt;Some estimates put it at over 50%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone here just uses SMS, because absolutely everyone can rely on it working all the time regardless of what sort of plan or phone that someone else has. The only people in Canada who use other mobile messaging services are people with significant social circles outside of the country (immigrants, international students, foreigners working here on temporary contracts, etc).
