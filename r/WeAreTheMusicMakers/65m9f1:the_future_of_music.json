Well, at least once something of technological significance comes out of the whole US/NK/China/Russia/Superpower tensions thing (ie, state funded green energy, IP backdoor, the future survival of humanity, etc)\n\n- The now-complete Supreme Court will rule on an ever-growing Ticketmaster/Live Nation Monopoly. Since they basically own every major venue (aside from certain mafias), TM/LN will concede a concert-goers right to both film *and* broadcast at a live show in exchange for plea deal immunity from a litany of stacking lawsuits. The FED will back down like pussies in the name of jobs, *maybe* one exec or CEO goes to clubFed.\n\n- Venues big and small will panic until someone is crafty enough to set up unethical house WiFi signals that are bricked, all while telling concertgoers to \"log on for better Facebook Live Streaming!\" (idiots!) while the house streams via dedicated basement servers for ultimate clarity. \n\n- The industry will see a boom in a new niche trade: VR Concert Surrogate. Snarky, caustic Photogs who used to sneer from the VIP barricade will be replaced by millennial scabs in varying sections willing to do it for free or a comped bar tab for them and a plus one. Only catch is wearing a weird MoCap GoPro headpiece that makes you look like [Pinhead from Hellraiser](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/hellraiser/images/4/4a/960.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160204075810).\n\n- Venues will have to reinvent themselves for a bigger market pull/lost profits. Hiring Celebrity VR Concert Surrogates, up and coming YouTube stars with XMillion followers, eventually branding themselves as content holders and charging a subscription or PPV fee for non-ticket holding fans wishing to stream the same concert and sacrifice the live experience on the cheap.\n\n- In keeping with business as usual, aforementioned Supreme Court will finally rule on the legitimacy of internet radio licensing and royalty payouts (namely streaming services like YouTube and Spotify). To further maintain a stable economy (*cough keep jobs cough*), they will cite specific (or rather, extremely vague and blanket-y) language that never reflected any technological revolution of any kind.
