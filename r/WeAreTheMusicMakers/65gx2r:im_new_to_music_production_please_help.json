You will just have to know the user interface. My choice for Ableton is because the simplicity. the simplicity of ableton was explained in the video I posted above. You can do everything from recording, composing, mixing, and mastering in one DAW. No DAW is limited to one thing. I recommend to not waste your time on switching your DAW specifically if you already got used to one and know many shortcuts and etc. I used to work with Logic for a long time, and I thought it was the best. After I switched to ableton, I will never go back. My personality is all about simplicity and having minimal elements presented in front me to make me create something. Logic was a big mess, buttons everywhere and etc. Ableton was simple, straight to the point and very simple. Since you are the beginning you can download trail of all these DAW and try them and see which one you really like. it is worth it. it also depends the way you like to work. You should consider Ableton, Pro Tools, Cubase, Reason, Bitwig, and FL Studio. Mess around with each. \n\n\n\nI am not native english speaker either. The book explain the theory in simple manners. Plus it will help you build you audio vocabulary. if you are watching a video or a course, I am sure you will face many words you don't know and you will have look up and find the spilling and etc. In a book everything is presented to you in a text form, you can look up words easy. \n\n\nI don't have specific courses. To be honest with you learning something from only one source is so dull and counterproductive. I don't think you should stick to one course. Watch as many as you can. I literally never followed a course. What I do is jump around between articles, books, and videos. Create your own curriculum and search a specific topics, for example Today you wanna learn about reverb. go find articles about reverb, youtube, books, even reddit comment. Collect all that info in your head and simplify it in your own terms.  \n\nI am not sure if I understand your question about workflow for creating a specific genre of music.
