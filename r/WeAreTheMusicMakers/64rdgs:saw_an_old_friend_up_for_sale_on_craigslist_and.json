I look 2-3 times a month, so it was quite a coincidence! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While you might have an arsenal of super guitars in your current stable, I totally get what you are talking about when it comes to that Les having magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my current Les Paul is pretty sweet. Plays just as nice and sounds even better IMHO. Just doesn&amp;#39;t have any stories behind it (it&amp;#39;s a 2016, I played some bar gigs with it, nothing exciting happened).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would buy it because, I mean, what are the chances that you would have found it again!? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is the part that bothers me right now... What if I regret not buying it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem though is that he&amp;#39;s asking more than I believe it&amp;#39;s worth. Like, what I paid for it brand new. Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s not a collectible version, and it shows a lot of wear (mine mostly), but not in a cool SRV way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That symbolic decision you made to get rid of that guit was noble...but maybe your &amp;quot;musical career&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t dead at all&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Putting the final nail in that coffin was necessary for me to move on with the rest of my life (family, career, etc). As of last year I have figured out what part music plays in my life and I&amp;#39;m not letting it go, but I&amp;#39;m not sacrificing everything anymore in hopes of &amp;quot;quitting my day job&amp;quot;, not as head into my 40&amp;#39;s. Over the next few months I&amp;#39;m playing 5-6 gigs a month, but since it&amp;#39;s no longer my main money maker I get to do it just for fun and that is GREAT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the while, I&amp;#39;m helping a very promising 16 year old singer songwriter turn his compositions into proper songs and recording them. He writes the important stuff, I make the arrangements and get to play the occasional tasty solo. This makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "name": "t1_dg4hsbe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956594.0, "created_utc": 1491927794.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4fcwv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 48, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PeterIraGrinch", "parent_id": "t3_64rdgs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WeAreTheMusicMakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That guitar sounds absolutely sweet and it seems quite interesting that you found it on CL while looking for guitars.
