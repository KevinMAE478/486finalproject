catch my attention divided \n\nand energy slight, and i sensed 'em in time and \n\nascend to the sky in the wink of an eyelid. \n\nfeelin boss in my saucer, so i twist up my spliff \n\nwonderin why pigs ran into my crib like this. \n\ni let the doobie burn slow, cruisin the worm hole... \n\nthinkin there musta been a snitch, but who it the turncoat? \n\nworse, though, the agents? who do that work fo'? \n\ncan't be government...they hacked the code in that verse yo \n\nand found the coordinates to my place on this earth's globe. \n\nthey must be ad hoc, black ops, lurkin to murk ton' \n\nworkin for the zeta reticulans...its sickenin \n\nhow greys' genetics have been infected by the reptilians \n\nand now they send their lackeys to catch me, i'm in the thick of it. \n\nit musta been the music, too many people were listenin. \n\ni broke down tuskeegee's experimentin wit syphillis, \n\nrex-84 and FEMA camps they wanna stick us in, \n\ndeliberately deceptive images, RFID chippin imminence, \n\nthe venus project and it's significance. \n\nthe words stirred up too many political dissodents, \n\nand the elite can't stand to see anti-indifference. \n\nbut bygone is bygone, and i'm on to my next move. \n\nzion's relying on my finding some refuge. \n\neyes glassy as a test tube \n\ni decide to try this guy i'm told in a tight spot to jet to. \n\nyou see, the revolution depends on it \n\nand confiscation of my tapes and crates could put an end to it. \n\nmy craft re-enters our dimension and... \n\ni'm dispensed within an instant into an arctic winter wind to meet this gentlemen. \n\nall i know is he's an indigionous inuit, \n\nspiritually in tune, and similar in sentiment. \n\ni felt his presence from within the ship, \n\npeeped a discrete ice cave to leave the whip in it. \n\nthe blizzard is a perfect cover...i move to the mouth of the cave, \n\ni see smoke and through the snow shroud there's a blazing flame. \n\ni wish i coulda packed for the weather, even a sweater. \n\nbut fuck it, it's presently or it's never. can't sleep and can't let up. \n\ni'm on a mission like it's V for Vendetta \n\nand this guy, he could be the key to forever. eager as ever \n\ni approach, and by the fire there's an igloo. \n\nand just then the snow stopped and the fire did too. \n\nand eerie calm fell on the area, and eerier, the sky was ecru. \n\ni yelled out for the guy to step through. \n\nit was quiet as deaf school...then i heard a whisper say, \n\n\"state your name a purpose and step into the entry way\" \n\ni said \"i'm Tony Moon and i'm wit the revolution... \n\nand that there was a problem that could use some retribution. \n\nsee, spiritual music is what i spit to populous. \n\nmy project was part of the 2012 shift of consciousness. \n\nthe greys have taken off with it...the deadlines approachin... \n\nand i just need a place to get my head right and focus... \n\na mutual scrupulous friend said i should go get \n\nan eskimo who lives here if ever i'm hopeless. \n\ni hope you can help yo.\" i stepped through the threshold \n\ninto some sess smoke. i heard him say \"my name is echo\" \n\nand there he was in meditation...he said this day was destined divination, \n\nfated to happen, and that it should be celebrated. \n\nhe said he know my intentions before they were ever stated, \n\nthat i was in danger, and was blessed to make it. \n\ncause the shapeshiftin...reptiles know where your spaceship is \n\nand wouldn't hesitate to make this trip. \n\nso he said he has to make this quick, passed the haze he lit \n\nand asked me if i'm ready to save this shit. \n\ni nodded and he paused. he had a pestil and a mortar in his palm... \n\nsaid taste the paste and the problem would be solved. \n\ni swallow it and fall into a trance, glancin at mandalas on the wall \n\nthen in my mind i heard a call. \n\nit said \"the past isn't permanent. dash through the firmament.\" \n\nthen, remotely, i saw the lab where they burnt my shit. \n\nthen i saw my past self with hash in a burning spliff \n\nas the agents were planning to snatch up my verbiage. \n\ni grabbed my attention, i told me to dash and then board the ship. \n\ni guess thats how i knew that the fascists were lurkin 'n \n\nthe time loop was making sense. my mind could reshape events \n\nif i could just take the trip to myself in '86. \n\nor circa '09...wit Tony murkin dope rhymes \n\nand prevent writin the code in that verses 4th line... \n\nas i travel back though, visions of a craft hold-in \n\nlizards in the hatch, show they're fixed on where i'm at so \n\ntime is of the essence. breathless, i inhale. \n\ngotta focus, can't stress the flesh ingesters with scales. \n\nthen finally i see myself, high and writing \n\nright at the time i'm penning the line that smites me. \n\ni urge myself against it, like \"this shit'll get you pinched\" and \n\nsent my intuition vivid descriptions of the mission. \n\ntold him to \"spit it and make sure that they listen \n\ncause this shit is dependin on us to fix it\", and he gets it. \n\nnow my high is coming down. nobody is around. \n\ni am on the ground lying in the tundra now. \n\nnext to my ship almost to woozy to stand \n\nso now i guess it's revolution as planned. the Past Moon understands \n\nour stanzas are scrutinized by a ruthless clan \n\nbut needed for the evolution of man. he can't \n\nreveal his secret hiding place to keep the freedom fighters safe \n\nthey gotta find a new rendezvous if they can \n\nlike maybe that peruvian camp... \n\nbut fuck it whatever they did is done, it's back to the future at hand. \n\ni evaded the raid and my location remains \n\nsecret, and i can get away from this place \n\nmatter displaced...re-penetration of space..and blaze on the way. \n\nreflecting on the implications of the day with my haze. \n\nnot far and i'm back at my haven and base \n\nand everything in my basement is safe. \n\ndamn i wish i had another taste of that paste to take me away \n\nand warn y'all about this alien race... \n\nbut now we're approaching the awakening's date \n\ni can't afford to make a mistake. these are the greatest of stakes. \n\ntime to say goodbye to the day of the slaves... \n\n'til next time unless they tap my radio waves...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 98 bar

thick of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it musta been the music, too many people were listenin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i broke down tuskeegee&amp;#39;s experimentin wit syphillis, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;rex-84 and FEMA camps they wanna stick us in, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;deliberately deceptive images, RFID chippin imminence, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the venus project and it&amp;#39;s significance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the words stirred up too many political dissodents, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and the elite can&amp;#39;t stand to see anti-indifference. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but bygone is bygone, and i&amp;#39;m on to my next move. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;zion&amp;#39;s relying on my finding some refuge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;eyes glassy as a test tube &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i decide to try this guy i&amp;#39;m told in a tight spot to jet to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you see, the revolution depends on it &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and confiscation of my tapes and crates could put an end to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my craft re-enters our dimension and... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m dispensed within an instant into an arctic winter wind to meet this gentlemen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;all i know is he&amp;#39;s an indigionous inuit, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;spiritually in tune, and similar in sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i felt his presence from within the ship, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;peeped a discrete ice cave to leave the whip in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the blizzard is a perfect cover...i move to the mouth of the cave, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i see smoke and through the snow shroud there&amp;#39;s a blazing flame. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i wish i coulda packed for the weather, even a sweater. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but fuck it, it&amp;#39;s presently or it&amp;#39;s never. can&amp;#39;t sleep and can&amp;#39;t let up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m on a mission like it&amp;#39;s V for Vendetta &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and this guy, he could be the key to forever. eager as ever &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i approach, and by the fire there&amp;#39;s an igloo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and just then the snow stopped and the fire did too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and eerie calm fell on the area, and eerier, the sky was ecru. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i yelled out for the guy to step through. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it was quiet as deaf school...then i heard a whisper say, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;state your name a purpose and step into the entry way&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i said &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m Tony Moon and i&amp;#39;m wit the revolution... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and that there was a problem that could use some retribution. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;see, spiritual music is what i spit to populous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my project was part of the 2012 shift of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the greys have taken off with it...the deadlines approachin... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and i just need a place to get my head right and focus... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a mutual scrupulous friend said i should go get &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;an eskimo who lives here if ever i&amp;#39;m hopeless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i hope you can help yo.&amp;quot; i stepped through the threshold &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;into some sess smoke. i heard him say &amp;quot;my name is echo&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and there he was in meditation...he said this day was destined divination, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;fated to happen, and that it should be celebrated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he said he know my intentions before they were ever stated, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that i was in danger, and was blessed to make it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;cause the shapeshiftin...reptiles know where your spaceship is &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate to make this trip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so he said he has to make this quick, passed the haze he lit &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and asked me if i&amp;#39;m ready to save this shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i nodded and he paused. he had a pestil and a mortar in his palm... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;said taste the paste and the problem would be solved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i swallow it and fall into a trance, glancin at mandalas on the wall &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then in my mind i heard a call. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it said &amp;quot;the past isn&amp;#39;t permanent. dash through the firmament.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then, remotely, i saw the lab where they burnt my shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then i saw my past self with hash in a burning spliff &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as the agents were planning to snatch up my verbiage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i grabbed my attention, i told me to dash and then board the ship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i guess thats how i knew that the fascists were lurkin &amp;#39;n &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the time loop was making sense. my mind could reshape events &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if i could just take the trip to myself in &amp;#39;86. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or circa &amp;#39;09...wit Tony murkin dope rhymes &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and prevent writin the code in that verses 4th line... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as i travel back though, visions of a craft hold-in &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;lizards in the hatch, show they&amp;#39;re fixed on where i&amp;#39;m at so &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;time is of the essence. breathless, i inhale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;gotta focus, can&amp;#39;t stress the flesh ingesters with scales. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then finally i see myself, high and writing &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;right at the time i&amp;#39;m penning the line that smites me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i urge myself against it, like &amp;quot;this shit&amp;#39;ll get you pinched&amp;quot; and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sent my intuition vivid descriptions of the mission. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;told him to &amp;quot;spit it and make sure that they listen &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;cause this shit is dependin on us to fix it&amp;quot;, and he gets it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;now my high is coming down. nobody is around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i am on the ground lying in the tundra now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;next to my ship almost to woozy to stand &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so now i guess it&amp;#39;s revolution as planned. the Past Moon understands &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;our stanzas are scrutinized by a ruthless clan &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but needed for the evolution of man. he can&amp;#39;t &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;reveal his secret hiding place to keep the freedom fighters safe &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;they gotta find a new rendezvous if they can &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;like maybe that peruvian camp... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but fuck it whatever they did is done, it&amp;#39;s back to the future at hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i evaded the raid and my location remains &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;secret, and i can get away from this place &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;matter displaced...re-penetration of space..and blaze on the way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;reflecting on the implications of the day with my haze. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;not far and i&amp;#39;m back at my haven and base &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and everything in my basement is safe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;damn i wish i had another taste of that paste to take me away &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and warn y&amp;#39;all about this alien race... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but now we&amp;#39;re approaching the awakening&amp;#39;s date &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i can&amp;#39;t afford to make a mistake. these are the greatest of stakes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;time to say goodbye to the day of the slaves... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;til next time unless they tap my radio waves...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "name": "t1_dg97yro",
