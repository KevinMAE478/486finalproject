dont know what im saving money for, as a beginner, i am using ableton live intro which i got for about 13\u20ac, and a copy of massive that i got for 50% off (should have gotten other synth), the limitations of intro are slowly starting to make themselves clear, specially bc of the lack of instruments i have, so thats one thing im sure ill be getting, but i dont know what, right now my options are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Fm8 or sytrus + any other useful plugin like kick2(bc i prefer using my own stuff) or studio drummer (imalso a guitarist and ive seen ppl using it for filling, which adds a really nice sound to the drum mix) or a vocoder&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-throw it all of the window and buy komplete 11 when ni have a deal season (like the 50%off all that komplete included back in nocember, when i got my copy of massive) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-since i am not entirely happy with ableton, purchase fl studio, although i dont like the workflow, it has some really nice stock plugins and fx that could help me a lot until i have a good library myself and you know, with time ill get use to it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-purchase the next version of ableton and an fm synthesiser &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem i got with komplete is that i dont know if i will be using it at its maximum, i dont like wasting that much money for using 3 or 4 plugins, but for the money each plugin costs separately maybe is not a bad thing, specially if I got a deal\nso please help me unravel my head with this dilemma, I surely will appreciate it, thx a lot&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--
