I had good control over it so I could hit the right notes all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was until last summer. I went out partying one night, after the party we were hanging out at a friends house, still drunk. So we were joking around and doing stupid things. At a certain point one of the guys wanted to show off for the rest of the guys, so he walked right up to me, and he squeezed my throat with his fingers, his fingers were pressed deeply in my throat and a bit behind the trachea. \nI tried saying something, but I felt my vocal chords felt weird, I noticed he really used all of his power doing this. And the fact he was drunk only made it worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after he did this I got mad at him, but my once deep and calm voice suddenly sounded very high and stressed, like I really had to force myself to speak. I thought this would be temporary, but today, 8 months have passed already and ever since, my voice is still sounding high and stressed. Also I can&amp;#39;t control my voice anymore like I used to. I can&amp;#39;t sing anymore, it just sounds awful now. I feel my heartbeat pumping at the left side of my throat all the time, it drives me crazy. And no one takes me seriously anymore. I used to be able to make a living working with producers in a music studio and doing voice overs for commercials, voice tags and audiobooks. But now no one wants to hear my voice because it doesn&amp;#39;t sound the way it did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also my girlfriend broke up with me, this is because  my voice is sounding nervous all the time and sometimes i can&amp;#39;t even pronounce some words. My articulation has drastically become worse, since I have a hard time reaching some sounds. So when she brings me to events, I make a fool out of myself when I speak to someone. Before the attack happened, I was a great story teller and people would listen to me for hours. But now no one wants to listen to my voice longer than a few minutes, it just sounds awkward and not like myself. I really feel trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this one night has changed my life for the worse. I really don&amp;#39;t know what could have happened with my throat/vocal cords. I went to a doctor and he acted like I was crazy. Is it possible that being choked for only a minute can permanently change your voice?? I think that maybe a few muscles have moved a little bit or a piece of my larynx/trachea have been damaged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have experienced something similar?
