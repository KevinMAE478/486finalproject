Losing direct contact to your established network (by moving) will definitely have an effect on your mental state, and so my advice would be: take a step back and don't try to write for a week. Spend your time finding new artists that inspire you, especially locally. Try to engage with the new musical community that you are now a part of. Take inspiration from these new possibilities that you would never have otherwise had.
