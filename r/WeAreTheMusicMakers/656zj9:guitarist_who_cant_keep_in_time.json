I couldn't hide from it.  \n\nPersonally, I think the best way to broach it is just frankly.  \"You're a good guitarist, but you're timing isn't perfect.\"  He probably knows, or at least suspects.  If you can, **record something with him, and listen with him.**  Flaws in timing are extremely obvious in recorded material, and if it really is bad, he won't be able to ignore it.  \n\nI have a friend who is a vocal teacher, and he has an issue with a lot of his students.  He describes it like this: \"they are not hearing their own voices, they are hearing the voices of the artists whose songs they are trying to sing.\"  \n\nMy own timing issues with guitar were fairly similar.  I wasn't hearing what I was playing - I was hearing what I *thought* I was playing in my head.  Listening to yourself recorded forces you to listen to the sounds you are really making.  \n\nHopefully it helps.  It's not a hugely common problem; most people who have experience playing in bands don't have an issue with it.  Once in a while, it comes up.  I have a friend who is a Kieth Moon of a drummer, whose timing is all over the place but whose sense of emotive drum playing is fantastic, and it just works because the rest of the band is super tight.  They play pretty bombastic, fun rock and roll, though, so just as it did with The Who, it ends up sounding good.  Other genres are less forgiving though.  I play a lot of funk, which IMO sounds fucking *terrible* when you aren't in the pocket, and is full of syncopation to boot, so I had to shape up or... well, make shitty music.  \n\nI picked shaping up.  I still have some trouble sometimes keeping the swing just right, but even that has gotten a lot better.   \n\nAt the end of the day, it's not the hardest thing to learn, I think.  Keeping in time is a lot easier than, for example, learning to play the guitar in the first place.  And it doesn't have to be nearly as gruelling: you can learn to stay in time by practicing to a metronome, or even with a band, *by playing songs you actually like*.  \n\nIf you feel comfortable showing your friend what he sounds like recorded, and you want to play music with him, then offer to help him practice.  You can play what you want, and he just has to focus on staying in time.  When you aren't around, as long as he does some work with a metronome a few times a week, he should improve a lot, very quickly.   \n\nHope that helps!  Good luck.  IMO, nothing compares to having someone you really jive with musically, so that's worth the hiccups, in the long run.
