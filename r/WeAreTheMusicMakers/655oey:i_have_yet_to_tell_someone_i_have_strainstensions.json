It *is* possible to play musical instruments without pain and discomfort.\n2. It is a matter of using your whole body in finely coordinated movements. There's more to guitar playing than just fingers. Your hand hold the drumstick, but the muscles and tendons in your arm are what control the stick. You run into problems if you think that your fingers are doing most of the work when you play piano. That leads to tendonitis, nerve damage, and a slew of other ailments.\n3. When you realize that you are in pain, STOP and analyze. You have developed really bad habits that will, I promise, plague you for your career if you do not figure out what you're doing wrong.\n\nA few things to consider when playing a keyboard instrument:\n\n1. A key takes so much force to \"play a note.\" Once the note is played, no amount of pressure (on a piano key) will change the sound; therefore, it is a waste of energy (and a cause of accumulated muscle tension). So whenever you play a key, pay attention to where the weight of the arm is. Because if your wrist and/or fingers are locked up and holding your arm up, you're doing way more work than you need to. Instantaneous release.\n2. You must constantly release the tension (which is how muscles activate your appendages) while you play. You no doubt have some tension in your back, neck, shoulders, arms, and fingers when you play. Everyone does. But some people know how to release it while playing. They don't get injured.\n3. Mechanical advantage: Your body is capable of all the movements you need to make, and it can do it effortlessly. Gravity does most of the work at the piano. We just have to line our bodies up to transmit the force in the right places. Concentrate on doing that and eliminating every unnecessary movement and tiny muscle contraction that does not serve the purpose of playing music.\n\nI can't possibly tell you everything you need to know. Hopefully that will help you start exploring a more healthful approach to the keyboard.\n\n[Barbara Lister-Sink's TEDx talk about keyboard technique](https://youtu.be/0KJjIxFk5lA)\n\n[Freeing the Caged Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4JROq_sgw&amp;list=PL8270C880F9E091BA)\n\nDon't be fooled by all the classical music.

I've heard good things about Yoga but that's less of a movement re-education discipline. My experience is with the Feldenkrais method, though you may want to ask /r/piano, /r/singing, /r/opera, and maybe some acting subreddits as to their experience of Alexander technique and maybe the Feldenkrais method.\n\nAnyway, the aim of these movement re-education disciplines is similar to how your learn technique for a musical instrument. But instead it's learning the technique for everyday movements. Kind of. The Feldenkrais method in particular is less about set movements and doing things correctly but moreso about exploration of movement. \n\nOne of the things Feldenkrais is about is giving more options and enabling choice. If you only have one option for an action, you are locked into that option. If you have 2 options you can only do either this or that. But once you have a third option, choice emerges. I can play a note on the piano using my deep flexors (the nail joint of the finger). I can play a note using mostly the lumbricals (bending at the knuckle). Or I can play that same note pushing with my shoulder (triceps, probably pecs and front deltoid). I can also play the note by pulling (lats). \n\nAnother thing Feldenkrais teaches is to aim for minimum effort with maximum results. This goes against lots of teaching from various aspects of society such as fitness, career, money, culture, etc. so it's weird at first that straining and pushing is counterproductive to what you want. One of Feldenkrais's sayings was to \"make the impossible possible, the hard easy, and the easy elegant.\" The aim is to acquire a \"effortless effort\" where intent is realised without any force or strain or a feeling of control. There are countless anecdotes of people being in the zone, in the flow, in the space where their ego disappears and what results is pure action. Thus straining and pushing and forcing is counterproductive to what we really want. In Feldenkrais lessons you're encouraged to stay within your comfort zone and make things smoother, easier, and reduce effort with every repetition.\n\nThe Feldenkrais method works on a level that is, for the lack of better terminology, lower than your conscious perception. We can only handle about 5 things in our awareness at a time, plus or minus 2, but our body is handling our heartbeat, digestion, breathing, posture, movement, etc. Oftentimes in lessons when a teacher spots tension in a student the teacher will tell the student to relax that area. It works. But it only continues to work as long as the student is aware of it. As soon as the student takes their mind off that tension, it'll creep back in because that is the way the body has become used to organising itself to perform that particular action. The Feldenkrais method often relieves tension because the lessons will change the way the brain perceives the body thus reorganises the way it uses itself. That reorganisation usually involves more of the body supporting the action rather than the limited action of before. \n\nIf you're sitting in your chair reading this, reach out with your right hand at shoulder height a few times and notice how far you can reach. Next, move your right knee forward without moving your foot. You'll notice that this'll cause the torso to twist, the right shoulder to move forward a little. You may also notice your head will want to turn to the left. Do this a few times. Pause. Now combine the right knee forward with the reaching of your right hand. You'll probably find your reach will extend by a few inches. If you've done boxing or martial arts you'll find the action is very similar to that of the punch. Notice how much of the body is involved to support the reaching of your hand.\n\nAnyway, I'm getting tired now so I shall stop here. Feel free to ask questions.\n\nEDIT: remind me to tell you about Feldenkrais and sensitivity. Also piano technique books.
