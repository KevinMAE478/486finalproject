This picture shows what the room looked like like after the car was pulled out. The bookshelf on the left had our board games. We submitted a list to our insurance company. I counted every game that had a rip/hole or water damage. If you look at the bottom the screen (below the pink vase that I swear is not a dildo) you can see the baseboard heater. That pipe is all water and all games on the floor got wet. We have actually been fighting with the insurance company, but we seemed to have come to an agreement. They never asked about the board games, but I did submit a note with our list that modern board games are not the same as Monopoly from the 80s and that if they were going to dispute the board games, they should call a local game store and ask them for a independent opinion on resale of games in damaged boxes. My stance was very firm that these board games lost value and that they will need to be replaced at some point. Sushi Go was a total loss because the box exploded and cards went everywhere. Suburbia has a hole that components can fall out of and the crease on the box top is ripped. Every game that doesn't close right because the box got wet was included. Viticulture and Patchwork are on the shelf and they were fine, so we didn't claim those. Tsuro was on the shelf, but when everything was moved out of the room it was stacked with wet games. I tried to be fair about everything, but if a game is more likely to fall apart because of the damage, then I claimed it. If the condition of the box meant we couldn't pack it in a suitcase without fear of losing pieces, then it was claimed. In your case, I'd say anything that smells so bad you won't play it, that would be a fair claim. Your insurance company is probably going to try to avoid paying it, so be ready to defend your stance. Box condition is important, as well as smell, the condition of any inner boxes that hold the pieces in place, and anything that would be mentioned if the game was being sold online. Basically, if I had paid full price and it arrived in this condition, would I have returned it? Now of course if your game was already missing something or had damage, it would be fraud to claim. But if the game was in gently used, very good condition and now it isn't, then it should be included in your claims summary. And I do suggest having a conversation with them about how these games are a modern hobby and there is a good resale/trading industry.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.reddituploads.com/f9b2ed9872df4c1cbee724067b8bab89?fit=max&amp;amp;h=1536&amp;amp;w=1536&amp;amp;s=2051aec4a4eecd27a31aa0bf879d8e6a\"&gt;https://i.reddituploads.com/f9b2ed9872df4c1cbee724067b8bab89?fit=max&amp;amp;h=1536&amp;amp;w=1536&amp;amp;s=2051aec4a4eecd27a31aa0bf879d8e6a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In September a drunk driver crashed his car into my house.
