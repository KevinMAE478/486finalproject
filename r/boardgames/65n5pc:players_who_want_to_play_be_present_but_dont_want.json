YMMV.\n\nMy groups have usually been very mixed gender (likely since I'm a chick and also tend to be the host rather than a +1). But often times, the drivers of any activity are the dudes (whether it be gaming or other). Especially in a cooperative game, the chicks often take a backseat role and will mostly observe or have others practically orchestrate their turn. This is understandable when it's the first playthrough or two, but eventually it becomes habit-- particularly if they're dating one of the dudes. (Though honestly, a lot of this is cultural upbringing and may take a while to shift/depends on personalities.)\n\nThey usually have a desire to be there, they're just more passive in their moves, less confident in their understanding of the game, and/or don't want to ruin someone else's experience. And it becomes EXTREMELY DIFFICULT not to quarterback. Like you have to actively *not* quarterback.\n\nI'd make sure they really want to be playing Descent. Because it doesn't sound like they want to as much as the other players. If they do **really** want to play, it will require a different approach. Actively stop yourselves from directing their turn: don't even provide options unless they're very distressed about making a choice, don't react negatively even if they make a subpar decision. Additionally, you can switch up the roles. Maybe make the two of them jointly play as the overlord vs. the two of you as heroes? That would give them more agency and since they're playing against you, they can't turn to either you or your buddy for help.\n\nAlso consider competitive games to avoid the quarterbacking problem. Give them a chance to choose what to play. If they're not experienced with games, consider starting slow on something like Splendor or Lords of Waterdeep.\n\nAll that said, it can also relate back to the relationships themselves and no game night changes will really fix it. (Example: had a friend who was an active game night participant and loved to be really involved. The next year her boyfriend moved in with her and started to come to game nights. She started bringing more baked goods, more knitting projects, and then showing up less-- even though she had *literally* moved closer so she could make it to game nights more often.

But often times, the drivers of any activity are the dudes (whether it be gaming or other). Especially in a cooperative game, the chicks often take a backseat role and will mostly observe or have others practically orchestrate their turn. This is understandable when it&amp;#39;s the first playthrough or two, but eventually it becomes habit-- particularly if they&amp;#39;re dating one of the dudes. (Though honestly, a lot of this is cultural upbringing and may take a while to shift/depends on personalities.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They usually have a desire to be there, they&amp;#39;re just more passive in their moves, less confident in their understanding of the game, and/or don&amp;#39;t want to ruin someone else&amp;#39;s experience. And it becomes EXTREMELY DIFFICULT not to quarterback. Like you have to actively &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d make sure they really want to be playing Descent. Because it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like they want to as much as the other players. If they do &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; want to play, it will require a different approach. Actively stop yourselves from directing their turn: don&amp;#39;t even provide options unless they&amp;#39;re very distressed about making a choice, don&amp;#39;t react negatively even if they make a subpar decision. Additionally, you can switch up the roles. Maybe make the two of them jointly play as the overlord vs. the two of you as heroes? That would give them more agency and since they&amp;#39;re playing against you, they can&amp;#39;t turn to either you or your buddy for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also consider competitive games to avoid the quarterbacking problem. Give them a chance to choose what to play. If they&amp;#39;re not experienced with games, consider starting slow on something like Splendor or Lords of Waterdeep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said, it can also relate back to the relationships themselves and no game night changes will really fix it. (Example: had a friend who was an active game night participant and loved to be really involved. The next year her boyfriend moved in with her and started to come to game nights. She started bringing more baked goods, more knitting projects, and then showing up less-- even though she had &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; moved closer so she could make it to game nights more often. Sometimes these things happen.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dgbyg71", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492372576.0, "created_utc": 1492343776.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n5pc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpgc6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cellard_dweller", "parent_id": "t3_65n5pc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree that it's distracting and can take away from the fun of those who want to take things more seriously.
