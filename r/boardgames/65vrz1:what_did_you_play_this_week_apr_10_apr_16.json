The things you do are pretty simple, you select a column with a room and tool, and place them in your house. I enjoyed it, but think there are quite a few special rules in the game, for each tool and helper you get to use. That might be a problem for people who are completely new to board games. For me it was a nice experience, and looking at your finished house is quite satisfying. \n\n**Frogriders** (4p): Very simple game, you move one frog to jump over another, than either collect or score (use its ability) the frog that you jumped over. There are public goals and a private goal you are trying to fulfill, e.g. collecting pairs of brown frogs, or groups of at least 5 frogs. Easy, able to explain it in a minute, plays a bit more than 30 minutes. Nice for families as younger kids can play as well. I enjoy it was a lighter game and would play it again. \n\n**Sheep &amp; Thief** (4p): They remade this Japanese game. Originally it came with small cotton balls for sheep, which are now out of wood (and look nice). The robber is also a fox now, but that's okay and fits with the theme. It was difficult to grasp what you should actually focus on - laying roads, collecting sheep or stealing them. The rivers also make it quite difficult to lay tiles, it's a bit weird that the roads don't need to connect, but it would be too difficult otherwise. I think this game shines after 2-3 plays, right now I'd rate it somewhere around 6/10 points. \n\n**Santo Domingo** (4p): WOW! I was completely blown away by this. I expected it to be dull and having to do with spice trading in the mediterran based on the artwork, but looking beyond that is a great game. Each player has an identical hand of 8 cards, numbered 1-8. The lower the cards number is, the earlier it's turn is after the simultaneous card reveal. There are basically 2 types of cards: cards that give you victory points and cards that give you wares which you can later trade for victory points. Most cards get their resources out of the common pool, so you might get more victory points by playing a higher card, but if the common pool is depleted before your turn you get nothing. That is a bit similar to Libertalia. I really enjoyed this one, the iconography is simple and clear after the first instruction, it plays fast and you get that exciting feeling of trying to guess what the others are going to select. It is a small box game for around 10\u20ac, which I'm going to add to my private collection. (I know this sounds like an advert, but I just enjoyed it that much). \n\n**One Deck Dungeon** (8x1p): I actually only have the PnP version, as the original isn't available here. Ordered some dice for it and started playing it last week. I am surprised how much fun it is, and how difficult it is. And the choices! Deciding if I use the defeated monster for exp or an item, or maybe I want the ability? I am currently training my paladin up, going the combat route. Still haven't managed to kill a boss once. \n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I got to try 4 different new(ish) games with release in current or previous year as part of a promotion by the German publisher Pegasus Spiele. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dream Home&lt;/strong&gt; (4p): I think this is probably a good light to medium gateway game.

One tough thing about multi-tasking is that we misread our tickets and ended up having to do long detours to our correct cities. Ended up being funnier than frustrating, and we still had a good time.\n\n\n* **Kodama** (2 players) - I recently purchased [a small expansion](https://boardgamegeekstore.com/products/kodama-the-tree-spirits-deluxe-card-pack) from the BoardGameGeek store for this tree-building game, and it added some variety to the seasons. It's another great relaxing game for when you don't want to put too much mental effort because you're only focusing on what you're doing without direct player interactions. The first time I played it, I think we all thought it was going to be more \"exciting,\" so some of us were a little bored, but I love the game for its peaceful theme. Plus, the artwork is adorable!\n\n\n* **Paperback** (2 players) - I played the game on the app first and loved it, but there's something different about having the physical cards. I finally got the physical game as an add-on when I backed **Fugitive**. Because my SO and I were still brain dead from the long week, it became more cooperative as we just tried to help each other spell out words with the cards that we had. We didn't pay attention to giving each other cubes for the help. I'm excited for the **Paperback** expansion that's coming out as an add-on for **Hardback**!\n\n\n* **Dodgy Dealers** (6 players) - We went to a game night, and this was the first game we played when we got there. Everybody is an art dealer, but there are fake paintings out there. We each \"specialize\" in an artist (Rembrandt, Monet, etc.) and have to collect four authentic paintings of that one artist to win. To collect, you can draw cards, look at cards at different discard piles, trade, or steal. It turns out, we should have traded contracts (the card that says which artist's paintings we need to collect) because my SO started off with two authentics that were not his artist, and another friend ended up with four paintings from MY artist. It was a neat little filler game.\n\n\n* **Bloodborne** (2 players, 5 players) - My SO and I played at home first to re-learn the rules and mechanics. We had played it once before at someone else's house and had loved it enough to purchase our own copy. For two players, we subtracted a blood echo from the enemies. It played ok enough for us to re-learn how to play the game, but it's definitely more exciting with 3+ players. We brought the game to that game night before Easter, and it was a small disaster. There were actually six of us all together, but I didn't mind sitting out to help run the game. However, it became a little bit chaotic. People were talking over each other, people would go into hunter's dream and immediately pick an upgrade card, but it'd be out of turn order, but I wouldn't notice because I'm trying to answer one question while another person's wondering why I didn't flip the card for the next monster, someone kept asking what the attack points were when he meant health points/blood echoes, and it didn't help that I forgot to tell people to put down their cards first, reveal, and THEN monsters attack. I just wanted to kick myself for botching that. I've introduced games and have run games in the past to other game groups just fine, and I thought this group would have been ok too because everybody's been a gamer longer than I have, but I wasn't expecting to be overwhelmed. We still finished the game, and people claimed it was fun, but I was no longer into the game and just wanted to move on. It made me realize that I'm too easily overwhelmed and am not the best to introduce games in the future unless I know the group well. My SO is the one with the more commanding air about him :P\n\n\n* **Fury of Dracula** (4.5 players) - Finally got to try it! After hearing so much hype about it, I asked my friend who owned it if we could bring it to the table. We made the mistake of not starting until around 7pm, and factoring in a dinner break, we didn't finish until midnight. I put \"4.5 players\" because one of the players decided to go to bed, so we took over her role. The hunters were doing so well at the beginning! We stunk at actually revealing Dracula's trail, but we were awesome at verbally discussing where he had gone to pinpoint where his actual location was, and we were able to fight him down until he was at 1 health point. We focused too much on finding his actual locations though that many of his event cards \"matured,\" raising the terror level up. Ultimately, he just had to make sure he was ahead of us to buy some time until we got to week 3, and he hit his target terror level, so the hunters lost. Such a close game! Due to the time commitment though, I don't foresee this game hitting the table often to justify the now $90+ price tag. I'm glad one of us has it though!\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n* I wish that **Paperback** allowed up to 6 players. I understand that it makes for a longer game, but whenever we have big groups and split up, a lot of other players will sort of backseat drive anyway and offer suggestions for words, even if they're not playing.

I was able to snag some loot and escape the dungeon, but I didn't grab enough things on the way out and was outscore by the other person that made it to the entrance.\n\n**Scythe** - This was my first game at 4 players and it was really interesting how much it changed. I normally play 2p with my wife so the extra enemies on the field really changed up how easy it was to spread out for area control. I'm not very good at this game, but I really enjoy all the options and paths to vicotry (which I haven't seen...). Megan and James are really for another go at this one because they think they can do better in certain areas.\n\n**Takenoko** - In preparation for discussing it on next week's podcast, my wife and I played the game that really got her into the hobby: Takenoko. The cuteness of it really drew in her interests years ago and now she's enthralled in the hobby as well. Everyone had a great time learning the game which was nice!\n\n**Celestia** - To lighten the game load a bit, we played Celestia based on Cloud 9. I love the risk/gamble in trying to decide if you the captain has what it takes to navigate to the next city. There's tons of luck in this so a long run by two passengers really proved enough for victory. Looking forward to playing with more of the family.\n\n**Orleans** - This is such a wonderful engine builder. Teaching Megan and James this went really well and they quickly started to understand how things needed to be done to get the engine going. I'm going to need more practice because I got obliterated in points. Everyone had a blast though and that's what matters.\n\n**Concept** - Playing games with my side of the family can be tough due to my father having a stroke a few years ago and it causing some issues with reading/thinking very quickly. I picked out concept and we basically took turns with a pair of people trying to give the rest of the family clues to their hidden word. It was a lot of fun and went over really well.\n\n**Telestrations** -  This game is so much fun especially when your family isn't full of artists. The way the words/images evolve into crazy things is what makes this entertaining. It's just silly fun and everyone enjoyed themselves.\n\n**Timeline: Americana** - This is a great one for the family because it's not very intense and you just need to place a card in the timeline in chronological order. It's always funny learning that things happened many years away from when you were thinking. \n\n**Animal Upon Animal** - This is a great family game by Haba. All you do is roll a die and stack animals on top of an alligator/croc based on the outcome of the die. The simplicity and cuteness is really what makes this fun.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nQ1 It's really hard to say.

The rulebook is ordered in the most nonsensical of ways though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasons&lt;/strong&gt; 2p - Again, for Easter/Spring &lt;em&gt;Season&lt;/em&gt;. Played with the Lewis Greyface mat because rabbit. I&amp;#39;ve played this one before and I like it as a quick 2 player card game that can be knocked out in around an hour which was perfect for the holiday business.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiny Epic Galaxies&lt;/strong&gt; Solo - Got in a couple quick games for fun and to keep the rules fresh in my head since its been a while since I&amp;#39;ve played and I have the new expansion set to come in from KS next month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I very rarely end up playing in large groups so this issue hasn&amp;#39;t really come up for me. In the opposite direction I kind of wish Agricola: ACBaS could be played with one less player since I really like the Uwe Rosenberg WP games, but I wish they were quicker to set up and took up a bit less space since I often solo play on my desktop. ACBaS is way quicker to set up and with a smaller footprint, but has no solo rules.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As others have said, Chwazi is great, but I also like when games have weird thematic rules like Gloom&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Whoever had the worst day&amp;quot; which ends up with people arguing why their day was shittier than everyone else&amp;#39;s.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dgdoox6", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474332.0, "created_utc": 1492445532.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vrz1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vrz1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdou6q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pooploserbq", "parent_id": "t1_dgdo32e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What game do you wish would play with 1 more player and the current rules allow?\n Flamme Rouge would be interesting with another team.\n\nWhat is your favorite rule for determining the starting player?\nChwazi", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What game do you wish would play with 1 more player and the current rules allow?\n Flamme Rouge would be interesting with another team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your favorite rule for determining the starting player?\nChwazi&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dgdou6q", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474500.0, "created_utc": 1492445700.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdo32e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pooploserbq", "parent_id": "t3_65vrz1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Flamme Rouge**: x5 **4p** played a lot cause everyone was interested on he cycling/racing.

I just got this game and got to try it out twice at my game night with my friend. We learned the rules and played twice in about an hour and 15 minutes, which was awesome for sheer pace of play. I won both games, the first time as a military victory and the second with points. I then took the game with me on a short trip to visit my gf. We played three more times. I was determined to win the third way with science and tried to twice, failing both times and as a result lost to points. I won the third game on points. Overall, I like this game and feel like it is already starting to open up as I learn more about. You kind of have to know that the gold commerce cards are the best ones to go for because they are going to be providing lots of value for the rest of the game easily paying for themselves. However, I have some concerns that I hope more plays will resolve. For one, it seems really hard to win with science unless your opponent is particularly brain dead. Not sure it is a viable path, which I'm just not sure about. Military on the other hand definitely is viable, but I've noticed it takes a lot of drama out of the game in the last few turns, when it becomes clear the military win is off the table. If one player goes for military or science and don't get it, then they are likely way behind on points. Still, I've already have already had a good time with it and just the fact that I'm still thinking about it and wanting to explore it more is a good sign that it will continue to see a lot of play. It also fills that great niche of 2p game to break out when you have 45 minutes to kill.\n\n**Five Tribes** 3P x1. Played this at game night after the games of Duel. I was playing with one new player and one player, who has been playing a lot on tabletop simulator, and told me he was tired of beating up on his friends. This was a challenge I couldn't back away from. For whatever reason, this is the game I'm definitely best at. It just works with my brain and is one of the few games where I can successfully navigate both the tactics and long term strategy. I ended up winning handily in the fastest game of **Five Tribes** I've ever played. There wasn't a single turn where I didn't drop at least one camel, and more often I was dropping two thanks to the Leta Djinn I picked up very early. However, much of this was facilitated by the new player leaving many awesome plays wide open, though she said she really liked the game and enjoyed learning it. Thus we all decided to have a rematch next week at game night if possible.\n\n**Manhattan Project: Energy Empire** 5P x1. I learned this game at another event at a local game store. Because we had 5 players and a limited amount of time, we removed several of the pollution tokens to trigger the end of the game quicker. I found the game really interesting and can tell it is a really solid worker placement. That said, 5 players resulted in quite a bit of down time. Often you aren't doing all that much on any given turn besides placing a worker, though sometimes you do a whole lot - hence the downtime. On top of this, the fact that we sped up the end condition meant the game was ending right as my engine was really starting to go, which was a bummer. Ultimately it was still fun, but it certainly wasn't the optimal conditions for the game. I'd love to play again, but probably would try to play with just 3 players if I were to get the opportunity.\n\n**Karuba** 4P x 1. We played this as a warmup before **Energy Empire**. Honestly, I think I enjoyed it more than the main course. It's super light tile placement game, but has just enough meat in the decisions that you will have to employ tactics and long term planning to be successful. I really love that. The whole game played in 30 minutes, with 4 new players being taught by the person running the event. I ended up winning by a really big margin just because I was the only one (or at least first person) to solve the puzzle that you want to place the 2 ended paths as much as possible and move with 3&amp;4 ended paths exclusively. I do have a couple nitpicks however. 1. It was kind of weird how you just all play simultaneously because if people wanted to get competitive, it would kind of make sense to subtly wait for everyone to go and then place your piece last with better information than everyone else. 2. One player is programmer who flips up their tiles randomly to determine which one all players will place. It's another small thing that would only matter to someone who gets too competitive about all games (me), but I felt like that player was at a big disadvantage because unlike the rest of us they couldn't quickly look and see all the tiles remaining in their pool to quickly calculate odds of getting the kind of piece you'd need or if indeed any were left at all. Nevertheless, these are just nitpicks and the game is great overall.\n\nSuccessful week of gaming for me!\n\nBonus questions:\n\n* I'd choose Love Letter. This is a game we often play while waiting for people to show up to game night. When the 5th player shows up and we are still waiting for more, it would be great if they could just jump in. I've tried this, but the limited amount of cards just don't really work for 5 people!\n\n* I like any rule that asks something random about the players which leads to discussion at the table. Blood Rage for example, which asks who was born furthest north. Other games I've played ask who has gardened most recently, or traveled to Europe. I see games as all about interacting with your friends, so I love when games facilitate that even before play begins.\n\nEdit: how do numbered list???", "edited": 1492448240.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Wonders Duel&lt;/strong&gt; x5 2P.

We played **Legendary Encounters: Alien** twice, on tuesday and wednesday. We played the first movie scenario. Our first game of Alien we played we won, although we might have messed up the rules a bit. So we were determined to beat the first movie scenario without question. The prior week we had a loss, and then on tuesday we did pretty badly as well. We got one of the shedding skin xenomorphs in the combat zone early, and trying to come up with 7 power to defeat it was tough, especially when we were unlucky enough to land another one in the combat zone a few turns later. We drew some of the worst strikes early in the game and didn't even come close to completing the second objective. However, on Wednesday we won! We had a much better plan of deck management and drew a few of the Ripley cards that lets you kill a character early, so by the end of the game I only had four of my original 13 cards still in my deck. We had much better luck with strikes this game and made some better choices as to what cards to scan and defeat. We put it away but I'm excited to move on to the next scenario.\n\nOn Sunday we had a good game day. Started off with **Lords of Waterdeep**, a perpetual favorite. I've played probably about 17 or 18 games of LoW (8 or 9 of those with Scoundrels of Skullport) and the expansion is so good that I feel like I'm still discovering a few quest/intrigue cards and buildings each game. Really keeps the game fresh. I was slow to start but a little bit after mid game I had a round where I completed a quest that let me put all three buildings in builder's hall under my control and then also completed a 40 point quest that put me right back into the thick of things. Didn't matter though, H just outplayed me. She was able to block a few spots I needed to go to late game and I was left with my last few turns unable to complete any more quests or get rid of my final three corruption tokens. Final score was 235-220, which were pretty certain was one of our highest scoring games, if not the highest.\n\nFollowed up LoW with our first couple of games of **Android: Mainframe**. I'm not really interested in any of the other games in the Android universe but I do love abstracts with variable player powers so I had to try this. Pretty cool game, I liked it better during the second game even though I got absolutely demolished. H completed a 32 point zone which eclipsed her entire point total from the first game. I only managed 10 points during the second. I think this game could be even better as a multi-player game but as it is I quite enjoyed it. \n\nEnded the day with a play of **Paperback**. We were excited to get this and play it, but were left kind of lukewarm after playing both competitive and co-op modes once. Sat on the shelf for a while and we brought it back out. I think we liked it a bit better this time around, but as a long time Scrabble player I think maybe this is a bit too easy as a competitive game? I dunno. It's easier to spell big words in Paperback because you don't have to connect it to another word or worry about leaving your opponent open for a big play, which are two big reasons why I love Scrabble and the strategy of Scrabble so much. Even if I lose Paperback I don't feel as challenged during a Scrabble game. I do think it's a fine game but perhaps we need to try it co-op again.

I generally don't want to play any board game with more than 4 players.

Really fantastic.  Can't wait to try it again.\n\n**Vinhos Deluxe** (1x, 3p) - First time trying this with three and it was just as enjoyable as with two players.  Even when the time between your turns gets longer (near the end, it feels like), you feel engaged throughout this game.  Which of the limited choices will your opponent take, and how will that affect you? How will you be able to use the few dollars you have left?

My favorite aspects are the \"Bohnus\" cards that require you to get certain combinations on your fields, and the \"gifting\" process (with bluffing!) using the cards in between the players.  Really wonderful.\n\n**Scythe** (1x, 2p) - Finally tried this with two players and we really liked it! Sure, there is less fighting over spots on the board, and you can pull certain moves in combat that might not otherwise work (for example, maybe winning two rounds back to back when your opponent is weak, or something).  But this feels minor compared to the overall fun we have when building the engine.  I love the improvement of the player boards, bringing out your mechs, etc.  It makes doing a little bit of everything fun even when you know that it may be better to optimize your path to victory.  The one thing I haven't come across yet is anyone maxing out their two tracks to earn stars (Popularity and Strength, or whatever they're called).  Still, this (again) feels like a minor criticism.  \n\n**Incan Gold** (1x, 7p) - Really fun, silly game that we played at a game night.  Tempted to pick this one up.\n\n**Avenue** (2x, 2p/3p) - A great twist on the Karuba formula that I really love! It feels more stressful to me than Karuba, actually, since you're never going to know exactly how long a round will last, you have the requirement to constantly increase your score, and you have no 3- or 4-way roads!  Will be picking this one up.\n\n**Brass** (1x, 2p) - One of my favorite games, and one of my favorite games with two players.  Absolutely love this game and the complex decisions that it presents.  Considering Kickstarting both new versions just to have them, even if the art may be less functional than the current (ugly) version we own.\n\n**Beasty Bar** (1x, 3p) - A great little filler with some really bizarre art.  Easy to carry around and easy to play.  \n\n**Memoir 44** (1x, 2p) - I really like the concept of this game, but I go back and forth in terms of how much I really like it.  We are slowly getting into the wargaming genre, and this feels just a little too random and light for me sometimes.  The fact that you can be limited to only moving troops on one third of your board with a bad draw of cards, or that you can plan plan plan only to have some really unfortunate luck on the dice roll... I dunno. I think one of those things needs to be mitigated, at least for me (I know dice rolling is big in the genre, but here the odds sometimes feel a little too chance-heavy).  I really like the concept though, and think that I generally prefer the non-beach scenarios.  We don't do the \"play two games and see whose score is higher\" so it can sometimes feel like the beach scenarios are too weighted against the Allied player.  I know this would balance with a second play, but we're enjoying trying new scenarios too much, haha.\n\n**Escape Room: The Game** (1x, 5p) - I was surprised by how much fun this was and how great a job it did at recreating the escape room experience! Did the first scenario and had an absolute blast.\n\n**Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** (2x, 2p) - We've played this twice now and are really digging it!  We love the original game but have not played it in some time, and this feels like a fresh twist on it.  I think it feels quite a bit more random at times, but I really like the various changes they've made to the formula.  This would travel really well, though you'll need a big table.\n\n**Burgle Bros.** (1x, 4p) - We survived, despite some really bad rolling!  What a wonderful cooperative game (my personal favorite, discounting Pandemic Legacy).  We had some really great moments of running from the guards, distracting the guards, boldly running into new rooms, etc.  So much fun.\n\n**Arkham Horror: TCG - Carnevale of Horrors Scenario Pack** (1x, 2p) - we tried and terribly failed this one.  I really like the theme that this game oozes, even if the frustration I feel from the chance and bad luck can sometimes overpower that.  This scenario felt particularly difficult to me, as we were doing it as a stand-alone, and one of us basically got trapped by a monster and couldn't do a thing about it.  Maybe we need to mulligan + beef up our characters before venturing forth, next time.\n\n*Questions*\n\n* One more player?  Maybe Lord of Vegas, since we don't have the expansion\n\n* Starting player?

What a game!  I love the balance of the war going on simultaneously with the fellowship&amp;#39;s quest, the fact that the sides are asymmetrical, and the incredible tension that comes with the hunt for the ring!  Really fantastic.  Can&amp;#39;t wait to try it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinhos Deluxe&lt;/strong&gt; (1x, 3p) - First time trying this with three and it was just as enjoyable as with two players.  Even when the time between your turns gets longer (near the end, it feels like), you feel engaged throughout this game.  Which of the limited choices will your opponent take, and how will that affect you? How will you be able to use the few dollars you have left?  Or do you try to get more money by burning precious barrels, turns, etc.?  Really fantastic game.  Highly recommend this one, including much more than &lt;strong&gt;The Gallerist&lt;/strong&gt;, personally.  It just sings.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bohnanza: Das Duell&lt;/strong&gt; (1x, 2p) - Also known as Bohnanza: The Duel, this is a fantastic 2-player only game that barely gets any recognition in the U.S. because it&amp;#39;s not available here.

Thankfully we have a scoring wizard who can make the ending of this game less painful.  \n**Sushi Party Go** 4x4p, 4x7p - big hit with everyone.  The game has a great tempo to it that keeps people engaged at all times and all the different cards keep it fresh and fun.  The only gripe I have is the scoreboard.  Wish there was a more efficient way to keep all those soy sauce pawns on the game board.  Playing with 7 players it was hard to keep them all straight and on the board.  \n**Splendor** 4x3p, 2x4p Everyone that played this really took to it.  The quality of the weighted chips is always something new players comment on - they love em.  Game always starts out a little slow but the finish is almost always tight and close.  I think once there was a blow out but that game seems to keep peoples scores close and everyone usually has a chance to win in the final turns.  \n**Codenames** 8x8p What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said.  I've introduced this game to at least 25 or so people and not one has gone away not enjoying it.  I've found that the laughter and fun is not just happening during the game but also carries over to the next day.  We talk and laugh about other games played months ago.

As usual with Splotter it didn't come cheap, but man do I feel like it was money well spent!\n\nPlayed two games so far, both two player. The first, we used the suggested first game rules of using six specific gods and leaving out the specialists. I'm glad we did; there's loads going on in the game without them (although it does seem like there are certain strategies that probably need them to truly work). I managed to keep a relatively low victory requirement, and achieved it with ease. I was also able to keep second in the play order throughout, as I never needed to force myself into first, and my partner was hoarding cattle.\n\nThe second game, we decided to add in the specialists, but keep with the same six gods. We both decided before the game that we were going to use different ones from the first game, so the options were a bit limited, but we were able to explore different strategies.
