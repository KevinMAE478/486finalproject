I think game design has also improved, over time and I&amp;#39;m not sure that component design necessarily pulls away from game design.  Even if it does, it&amp;#39;s not a trend happening in isolation.  Kickstarter has certainly enabled many games to exist that would never have been made otherwise.  Even though I&amp;#39;m not sure component quality is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a negative, I think the increase in the ability of designers to publish games could lead to more innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg82uo4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140458.0, "created_utc": 1492111658.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656gw4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8tp2p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boybogart", "parent_id": "t3_656gw4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What an utter load of melodramatic BS.
