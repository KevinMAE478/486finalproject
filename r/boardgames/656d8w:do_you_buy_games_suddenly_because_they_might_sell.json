In fact, there have many multiple examples this year where even pre-ordering a game wasn't enough to get you a copy (Ladies of Troyes expansion for example.) 15% of the pre-orders got fufilled. \n\nBelieve me, I hate it. I hate that publishers are so caution about production. You don't have to sell all copies immediately, it's okay to have some left over to fill the shelves for the next 1-2 years. More people are discovering board gaming, and that means more people are watching OLDER videos about top ten this, and top 100 that. So people are investigate games from all time periods, not strictly the new hotness.\n\nMost of the games on my wishlist are games that may of came out 2-5 years ago but have been sold out ever since I joinned the hobby 18 months ago. \n\nAlso, non \"mass-market\" games almost never go on sale. You're not going to see a sale for Lignum or Keyflower. So there is no incentive for me to wait for prices to drop like video games.\n\nIf I'm going to pay $50 for a game, I might as well pay it NOW and make sure I have my copy, than risk it going out of print and having to wait years for it to come back. In fact, many games wont even see a reprint. \n\nThere are tons of games I want to buy that are a few years old that will never be reprinted, and I have to wrestle with the idea of paying 2-3 times as much from the second hand market. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes actually I do... and this is a sharp contrast to my opinions about entertainment spending in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I despise the idea of pre-order or even spending full price for a video game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have been pre-ordering board games. The difference is substantial though, board games have been selling out before they even become available.
