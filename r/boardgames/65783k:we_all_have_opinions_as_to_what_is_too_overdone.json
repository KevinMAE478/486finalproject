Asymmetric games.   You get a nice crossover RPG feel when everyone plays a different character / style.   I feel like Vast was a great step but there is much more to explore.  Since I've made some games already, I am actually trying to tackle one right now called [Town Square](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1683727/wip-town-square-asymmetric-game-where-you-play-npc) where each player has to play as totally different \"NPC\" characters.\n\n2.  Mature horror.   As in, a notable step beyond Werewolf and Eldritch Horror, etc.  I look at the success of Kingdom Death Monster as it flies in the face of conventional casual board gaming themes, and think, there could be demand for actual horror games.    Combining social deduction anxiety with a good horror theme has potential for adrenaline junkies. \n\n1.  Thematically, lately I am really drawn to games that \"drill down\" in to narrow sub-themes that we all know/love.   So for example, instead of a game about Knights and Orcs, a game purely about Blacksmithing, or Lumberjacking and all of the cool details about the trade.

You get a nice crossover RPG feel when everyone plays a different character / style.   I feel like Vast was a great step but there is much more to explore.  Since I&amp;#39;ve made some games already, I am actually trying to tackle one right now called &lt;a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1683727/wip-town-square-asymmetric-game-where-you-play-npc\"&gt;Town Square&lt;/a&gt; where each player has to play as totally different &amp;quot;NPC&amp;quot; characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mature horror.   As in, a notable step beyond Werewolf and Eldritch Horror, etc.  I look at the success of Kingdom Death Monster as it flies in the face of conventional casual board gaming themes, and think, there could be demand for actual horror games.    Combining social deduction anxiety with a good horror theme has potential for adrenaline junkies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thematically, lately I am really drawn to games that &amp;quot;drill down&amp;quot; in to narrow sub-themes that we all know/love.   So for example, instead of a game about Knights and Orcs, a game purely about Blacksmithing, or Lumberjacking and all of the cool details about the trade.   Instead of a game taking place during the Cold War, a game about players building bunkers and Defcon 2, etc.    It becomes a learning experience and I like when designers are heavily invested in sharing their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg85m2i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143474.0, "created_utc": 1492114674.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65783k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65783k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8a8zd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mib5799", "parent_id": "t1_dg88dqv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How have you missed Giant Killer Robots? \n\nhttp://gkrgame.com", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How have you missed Giant Killer Robots? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gkrgame.com\"&gt;http://gkrgame.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg8a8zd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148914.0, "created_utc": 1492120114.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65783k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65783k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65783k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ouat", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JavierLoustaunau", "parent_id": "t1_dg8bhgk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, I have a system I call 'the bullseye system' where you roll for a hit location on a grid, which is an illutration of the target, and they use skills to move your hit away and you use skills to place your hit closer. \n\nSo in terms of a mech you can have a 10x10 grid and know exactly where you hit a mech by rolling 2d10 and selecting which is X and which is Y, and your weapons would have spray patterns, so you put damage counters on spots and try to keep hitting the same squares to punch through armor and damage circuits or sever limbs. \n\nIf I can do a mock up I'll PM you, I've toyed with it a little for a pistol dueling mystic western called Tex Arkana I was workiong on and it is fun to miss by an inch and know you did, because that bullet was in the square next to the cowboy's neck.

The game *requires* that players be Heroes, and mechanically punishes things like orphanage burning.

And just because they may not be the shaper of the world doesn&amp;#39;t mean they have no agency or fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but the post declared one true wayism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Usually you are bound, a good DM just uses increasing amounts of leverage to get you back to where you are supposed to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; GM does that. Indicating that  not doing that is... Not good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like well thought out world&amp;#39;s that don&amp;#39;t revolve around the player group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do too. Here&amp;#39;s the thing. The players aren&amp;#39;t seeing that, experiencing that. World mechanics are a black box. Conditions go in, events come out. Unless players have an active hand in things... It&amp;#39;s literally indistinguishable from a deck of event cards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world revolves around the players because it literally does - just like in real life. You only know what you know. Everything else appears random. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is for &lt;strong&gt;the players&lt;/strong&gt;, not the GM. It&amp;#39;s their stories bring told, not the setting. If it&amp;#39;s the setting&amp;#39;s story you want to tell, write a novel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A writer once tweeted this snippet of truth: &amp;quot;here is an opinion about fantasy stories: extensive worldbuilding is more fun for an author than it is for 99% of their readers&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is really fucking painfully true. And it happens in RPGs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, but see how excited your DM is when you just decide to just completely ignore the campaign he just spent a month creating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are the players ignoring the campaign? Because &lt;em&gt;they want something different&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;a good DM just uses increasing amounts of leverage to get you back to where you are supposed to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the wants of 4-6 people are outright invalidated and ignored, because why exactly? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like random shit happening like spontaneously deciding to burn down the orphanage yknow? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then what control do the players actually have? If your game setup and social contract would permit that, you&amp;#39;re being a dick if you &amp;quot;actually no&amp;quot; that out of (apparently) nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently running 7th Sea. The game &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; that players be Heroes, and mechanically punishes things like orphanage burning. That&amp;#39;s setup and social contract. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something like Necessary Evil, where players are supervillians, that&amp;#39;s on the table. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they do it. It&amp;#39;s just important that they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg8tnpj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492177393.0, "created_utc": 1492148593.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8g3g0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FFF12321", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fnxp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You both just have different ideas of what fun is.
