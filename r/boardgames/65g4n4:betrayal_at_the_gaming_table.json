Having played Betrayal at House on the Hill with guys from work, I decided to purchase my copy for the home to play with my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter is only nine years old, for the purpose of this story lets call her Amy. I know Amy enjoys horror themes, which is part of the reason why I bought Betrayal at House on the Hill. Amy isn&amp;#39;t allowed to watch horror movies, but she has an active imagination and between playing with her dolls and acting sweet and innocent, Amy enjoys writing horror-themed short stories. Often Amy tells these stories to her friends at school, which ends up in the class having nightmares and sleepless nights! I&amp;#39;m sure the other children&amp;#39;s parents cursed our family during bed time when they couldn&amp;#39;t put their daughters to sleep. Amy also scares herself when she thinks about her stories, resulting in Amy being too scared to sleep as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the post, I&amp;#39;ve managed to get Mom, Amy and Amy&amp;#39;s older brother around the table for a game night of Betrayal, which is no small feat when competing against the other screen addictions of Netflix and Youtube. Mom is concerned with Betryal&amp;#39;s theme and 12+ rating, but I assure her it&amp;#39;s fine as Amy writes stories much worse than anything in the game. Perhaps, I was too optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We start playing the game by exploring the house, and everyone is getting into the game. I questioned my decision to play the game with Amy during some cards; I toned down the reading of the hanging corpses event. So far the game was a hit, and I was pretty excited at picking a winning game. I could already see many successful family game nights of Betryal. My main concern was thinking how I could make the haunt a success, as nobody else my family likes reading game rules. For those who haven&amp;#39;t played Betrayal, the haunt is where the game begins and one person betrays the group. The betrayer and the rest of the group are then given a page or so of rules with secret objectives on how to kill each other. However, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have worried too much, as we never got that far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy picks a seemingly harmless card, freaking her out a little. I can&amp;#39;t remember the exact wording of the card; but her character looks into a grave or coffin and see&amp;#39;s a dead body, and then notices it&amp;#39;s her. Amy has a startled look on her face and states &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s creepy&amp;quot;, and I can see her mind starting of a new story to haunt her class mates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we hear it, a little girls voice says &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; from Amy&amp;#39;s bedroom. Everyone at the table freezes. Now, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I know there are only four people in my family, and everybody is at the table. Then it repeats again &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;, we are breathless as we look at each other startled. Now I can see my wife starting to shake, and Amy&amp;#39;s eyes are red and welling up in tears, her older brother is turning white. My entire family has broken down crying, and are shaking in fear. I feel like I&amp;#39;m in a horror movie, as a little girls voice keeps repeating &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; from my daughters room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will never forget this moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being the father of the house and with no other members able to stand, I need to investigate. Slowly, I get up and walk towards Amy&amp;#39;s room, in my head I&amp;#39;m rationalising what could be happening, to give myself the confidence to investigate. I open up the door and there it is, Amy had received an early Christmas gift from a friend, an alarm clock requiring the owner to record their own voice as the alarm. That morning, Amy had recorded her voice as a simple &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; and being a new gift she&amp;#39;d accidentally set the alarm for 8pm instead of 8am. Due to the cheap electronics in the alarm clock, her voice being replayed sounded distorted and creepy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never got to show the awesomeness of a haunt reveal to my family. Everybody was in tears and highly emotional, it was time to call an end to game night. Amy slept in our bed that night, and Amy refused having the alarm clock in her room again, it got thrown in the trash after my Elf on the Shelf prank went wrong. Betrayal of House on the Hill now sits collecting dust on our game shelf, it&amp;#39;s too difficult to get out for the family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R.I.P.

When Amy wakes up, the first thing she would do in the lead up to Christmas is look for the Elf on the Shelf doll, even at nine, she is a hardcore believer.

As it was school break, Mom took the children to the shops for the day. Before I went to work, I decided to make up for the night, feeling a bit guilty I went decided to go above and beyond. I moved the elf to the kitchen, set up Amy's iPad on a loop of her favorite Youtube channel and connected the earphones, and tried to position the earphones near the elf's ears was a nightmare, but it worked ok. Then I decided to write a note from Santa to the elf. The note was a permission slip from Santa, excusing the elf for not making the trip back last night.\n\nTo seal the deal, I decided to record a \"Merry Christmas\" from the elf onto the alarm clock. I should've learned my lesson from the night before about the alarm clock, but I didn't. Not wanting to record my voice as the elf, I searched Youtube for an elf voice saying Merry Christmas which finished with laughter. I recorded the elvish audio from Youtube on my laptop to the alarm clock. Then I positioned the alarm clock next to the elf and left for work.\n\nWhen I got home from work, Amy was excited to show me the note from Santa, she was disappointed the letter wasn't addressed to her but none the less it seemed to do the trick. I tried to drop a lot of hints because if the alarm clock and the elf had moved while she was at the shops, maybe the elf recorded a voice onto the alarm clock. After my constant hinting, Amy never investigated the alarm clock recording. I couldn't be any more obvious about listening to the alarm clock, without giving it away.\n\nLater at night, Amy was playing in the kitchen alone with her dolls, and the alarm clock went off. The process of recording the cute elf voice on my laptop to the crappy electronics in the alarm clock had changed the high pitch jolly elf voice, into something from the depths of hell \"Happy Christmas, Ha Ha Ha Ha...\".\n\nAmy ran into our room bursting into tears as she had no idea what it was. She didn't associate the voice with the elf or the alarm clock, but I knew. I thought to explain the elf must've recorded the voice, surely this would calm her down. However, it made things worse \"Dad, elves aren't meant to talk!\" She had a point, a moving elf on the shelf doll is cute, a talking elf on the shelf doll is possessed.\n\nPetrified of the elf on a shelf doll, Amy slept in our bed again. The Elf on the Shelf went back to Santa early, and the alarm clock went into the trash.\n\nElf on the Shelf dolls should never speak and never buy an alarm clock with voice recording.

I couldn&amp;#39;t be any more obvious about listening to the alarm clock, without giving it away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later at night, Amy was playing in the kitchen alone with her dolls, and the alarm clock went off. The process of recording the cute elf voice on my laptop to the crappy electronics in the alarm clock had changed the high pitch jolly elf voice, into something from the depths of hell &amp;quot;Happy Christmas, Ha Ha Ha Ha...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy ran into our room bursting into tears as she had no idea what it was. She didn&amp;#39;t associate the voice with the elf or the alarm clock, but I knew. I thought to explain the elf must&amp;#39;ve recorded the voice, surely this would calm her down. However, it made things worse &amp;quot;Dad, elves aren&amp;#39;t meant to talk!&amp;quot; She had a point, a moving elf on the shelf doll is cute, a talking elf on the shelf doll is possessed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petrified of the elf on a shelf doll, Amy slept in our bed again. The Elf on the Shelf went back to Santa early, and the alarm clock went into the trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elf on the Shelf dolls should never speak and never buy an alarm clock with voice recording. At least with the elf&amp;#39;s early exit, I didn&amp;#39;t have to keep waking up in the middle of the night wondering if I&amp;#39;d forgot to move it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit":
