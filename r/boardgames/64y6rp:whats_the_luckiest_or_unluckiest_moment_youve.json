If anyone doesnt know percentile systems are 2 x ten sided dice one with units and the other tens and the idea is your skill will be a set value and you have to roll under your skill to succeed, for example i had 85 with rifles so i would roll and the tens would be 60 and units 7 so i roll 67 and thus succeed. You could effectively crit whatever you were doing by rolling under 05 or critically fail on 100 ( by rolling 0 on units and 00 on tens ) Anyway eventually we were on a space station and looking to find some dude we were trying to assassinate, friends went to the bar to ask questions meanwhile i hacked a terminal and found his name on a ship register and knew were he was docked. Fearing he may leave soon i thought it would be a good idea to sneak onto the ship and kill him, awesome because i was a sneaky sniper based character anyway queue trying to get into a crate and sneak in and had to make 2 x sneak rolls , failed BOTH checks by rolling 0, 00 (100 - worst possible roll ) both times..  and the guards saw me metal gear solid style running to the ship with a crate on my head big burly guard proceeds to literally sit on the crate and wait for back up. So i thought fuck it burst out the crate shoot everyone of these motherfuckers up and combat roll to cover, so the GM was like ok then... you need to roll three times.. one for strength, guns and dodge (dexterity) which if i recall were all around 60-70 for me, and thought i can do this that's fine.

If anyone doesnt know percentile systems are 2 x ten sided dice one with units and the other tens and the idea is your skill will be a set value and you have to roll under your skill to succeed, for example i had 85 with rifles so i would roll and the tens would be 60 and units 7 so i roll 67 and thus succeed. You could effectively crit whatever you were doing by rolling under 05 or critically fail on 100 ( by rolling 0 on units and 00 on tens ) Anyway eventually we were on a space station and looking to find some dude we were trying to assassinate, friends went to the bar to ask questions meanwhile i hacked a terminal and found his name on a ship register and knew were he was docked.

At one point, he surrounded my transport with Scarabs and rolled to destroy it in close combat. He was going to do it, handily, but the question that came up was whether or not he could explode it. In that edition, there was a distinct difference between exploding and wrecking: if you explode a vehicle, you remove it, and anything inside is placed in the footprint of where it was. If you wreck it, everything has to get out around and on top of it (there&amp;#39;s more to it than that, but it&amp;#39;s not worth going into here), and anything that can&amp;#39;t fit is destroyed. Long story short, he basically had to roll a fistful of dice, and if any of them were 6s, I had at least a decent chance of killing a few scarabs and making enough of a hole to get out some of my squad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did not roll a single 6. Keep in mind, I&amp;#39;m not exaggerating when I said he was rolling a fistful of dice - I think it was in the 20s. Every single die was a 5 or lower.
