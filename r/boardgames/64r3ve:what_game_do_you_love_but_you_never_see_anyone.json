Fairy-Tale Gloom solved that problem for me, and actually made it easier to get into some of the other versions of Gloom. \n\nHere is how I would rank all of the versions of Gloom from best to worst: \n\nFairy-Tale Gloom &gt; Gloom in Space &gt; Munchkin Gloom (and I hate Munchkin, who'd have thought) &gt; Gloom &gt; Cthulu Gloom (even if you're a fan of the mythos, there's a shitton of hard to pronounce words in the deck that make story telling jilted)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution to this (I feel) is Fairy-Tale Gloom. Why? Because instead of pre-built families of characters you&amp;#39;ve never heard of, you get to build your &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; out of famous fairy tale characters like &amp;quot;Snow White&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cinderella&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like this because most people have SOME familiarity with some, if not all of these characters. This makes it SO MUCH EASIER to come up with fun stories, because you have some idea of what their character motivations might be and how they might react to the awful things happening to them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always enjoyed Gloom, but I found it really tough to keep track of other people&amp;#39;s stories during game play, and thusly how to interact with their stories when I played cards on their characters.
