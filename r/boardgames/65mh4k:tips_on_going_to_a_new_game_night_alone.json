Don't spill food or drink on someone's game. \n\nIt's all pretty basic common decency stuff, but it can be easy to fall in to habits like these, especially if you get nervous and worried about being too quiet. \n\nJust play, chat, find out about the folks you are playing with, let them find out a bit about you, have fun. Game nights aren't (in my experience at least) intimidating at all. Even groups that look intense and focus generally have one or two people in them willing to chat while they play.\n\nGetting there on time is good advice, getting there early is better. Turn up fifteen minutes or so early. There'll be people there already. The organisers will usually be there by then and they'll spot you as a new face, good ones will come up and introduce themselves and introduce you to the people already there. Get a drink, doesn't have to be a beer, get a soft drink or a coffee and then sit and chit-chat with the folks until the games begin.\n\nYou'll often find that the folks there early will form a group and pick a game to play but mostly they are pretty good at not actually starting playing till the start time.
