This means that you have to be careful while teaching, because your crowd is not all the same. Also, teaching goes beyond explaining the rules. It&amp;#39;s something you should do and care for throughout the game. Watching out for players who have a hard time getting it is especially important, and can make a big difference in them having a great or a terrible experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say try again, if they feel like it. Explain them what went wrong, and how it can go right this time, and start with the turn by turn. If they don&amp;#39;t want, that&amp;#39;s fine: sometimes first impressions are really hard to shake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hold on to the game a little longer, I&amp;#39;d say. You can always sell it later, but you might regret it if you sell it too soon and need to buy it again later. And remember you really enjoyed your play with the first group. We all have bad experiences, the important thing is that we learn from them. Give it another try!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg4r56i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966761.0, "created_utc": 1491937961.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4q2c0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bigfatlittlefat", "parent_id": "t1_dg4nr0z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "tl;dr: People in my group sucked at learning the rules.\n\nI'll explain how I taught the game so please let me know if I did a bad job explaining the rules. I started by explaining the objective - kill the other sub with 4 hits, whether direct or indirect. I then went through rules by simulating a round. I started with the Captain and explained submarine movement where the sub cannot cross its own line or run into an island. I moved onto what the captain would say (eg. \"Head North\") and followed up with the corresponding actions performed by the First Mate (charge one system) and Engineer (break 1 system), as well as how they each have to say \"ok\" for the captain to continue. I then explained the different systems and how they worked in terms of attacking/locating/going silent. After that, I explained how the engineer had to break 1 system per move and how to repair systems by completing circuits. I also explained how the engineer can damage our own sub (by filling an entire area or by crossing out all nuclear symbols). I then explained how to surface and what that meant (clearing of all systems and submarine movement); and explained how to dive (draw outlines/initial). I ended off with the Radio Operator and explained how they are listening in on the other team and are trying to locate their sub by moving the clear sheet around. I did a bunch of clarifying and started the game. I felt like I was pretty thorough.\n\nAnyways, I think one of my biggest mistakes was not going turn by turn. On our first playthrough with our other group, we tried turn by turn but it felt suuuuper slow/dull. Switching to live really ramped up the game and made it a much more enjoyable experience so we started live with this second group. I started with a casual pace while the other team went at 110% off the bat - even though they agreed that everyone should go at a casual pace at first.\n\nSo in terms of not understanding rules, my engineer is probably one of the slowest players in our group to learn any rules. For example, we were 4 hours into a game of Dead of Winter once and she was still confused with some rules. She's just not very good at learning boardgames. Annnnnnnd this person played as the engineer. She basically never had an systems open to use. If there was 1 system left to clear a circuit, she would select a different icon instead. We had to explain surfacing several times and kept having to remind her to draw the outlines or to erase the damaged systems if we were surfaced. She basically is just really bad at picking up on rules, let alone understanding them. So her incompetence basically lead to her husband getting super annoyed with her because he played as 1st mate, sat next to her, and saw what she was doing. By the end, he was basically telling her what to cross off and they were more or less just constantly arguing under their breaths. My radio operator, on the other hand, was completely lost and I don't know why. I didn't pay attention to him for most of the game and was just waiting for him to let me know where he thought the enemy was. At one point, I look over and he had a bunch of lines on his clear sheet crossing all over each other. I asked why the lines were crossing over and he said \".... I don't know....\" \"Well, did you erase the old line after they surfaced?\" \"...no....\" and that happened a couple times. On another occasion, I look over and he's just drawing a line through an island and didn't move the clear sheet around. I asked \"Why are you drawing through land?\" \"...I don't know.....\" \"Well, they can't travel on land. You should position the line somewhere that makes sense.\" \"....okay.....\"\n\nEventually, everyone was just getting super stressed, the couple next to me were more or less arguing, my radio op was completely lost, and I was suspecting the other team was cheating. Their Captain would call \"Northnorthsouthwestwestnorth\" without pause so I asked if he was even verifying that his First Mate/Engineer was doing their actions and he claimed they were (but they weren't. I asked later.) We decided just cut the game short.\n\nI honestly don't know how to feel about the game and it's actually the first game in my collection I'm seriously considering selling because no one seemed to have a good time.
