Not easy and really hard to teach but my husband is a good sport and he catches on quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game is a beast! I had him play the free people and I played the shadow since he&amp;#39;s usually faster at picking up on the nuances of a game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now since I had no idea what I was doing I decided to make a run for the ringbearers and moved my armies out of their strongholds. (First question: but can an army ever attack the ringbearers? Even if they&amp;#39;re with an army of their own? Aren&amp;#39;t they always impervious to shadow armies?) This allowed my husband to eventually realize I&amp;#39;d left those four points just sitting there and he moved in and immediately scored them. (Question 2: that&amp;#39;s legal right?) He also rolled much better during battles than I did and I had a bunch of useless combat cards mucking up my hand that I should&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of earlier. (Question 3: can the shadow attack a free people&amp;#39;s nation even if they&amp;#39;re not at war? Do they move to active after that? Or do they move to at war? What if they&amp;#39;re already active when I attack them?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh man when I first got suggested this game I thought how hard can it really be for the shadow to win? My goal is to build up an army and take the free people out. Their goal is to get through my armies to mount doom. No way that&amp;#39;s happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus it seemed kind of boring to me and like there would be no replayability to it, but was I wrong! Those cards and how they work together and how your characters work and where to move and when to bring certain people into play. There is a TON to think about. My brain was fried by the end of the night.

I love that my husband and I get to learn this game together so eventually (hopefully) we&amp;#39;ll be evenly matched. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More questions: the usage of fellowship, characters and companions confused me. Can fellowship and companions be used interchangeably or does fellowship mean Sam and Frodo and companions mean everyone else left back in the fellowship box? Also are the people in the fellowship box considered to be with the ringbearers in Rivendell or not until you separate them from the fellowship? Also can you separate someone from the fellowship and then have them come back later to become a guide again? I&amp;#39;m gonna have to read the rulebook again because this game is crazy with the amount of little rules. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this and answer my questions!
