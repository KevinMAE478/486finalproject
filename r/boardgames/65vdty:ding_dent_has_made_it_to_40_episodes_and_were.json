The board game is a big honking multi-hour game where you move around the board having random encounters and rolling a lot of dice. It's polarizing...some hate it, some love it.\n\nThe Card Game is similar in concept. You're moving from place to place, collecting clues and trying to deal with horrors. It's more focused though as you're working through a scenario. e.g. the first scenario is you figuring out wtf is going on in your own home. The 2nd is then taking that story into the city of Arkham and dealing with cultists, etc. \n\nAgain, simple structure but rules dense because it's a card game and you both would have your own custom built deck of cards that you play through with abilities and powers and stuff.
