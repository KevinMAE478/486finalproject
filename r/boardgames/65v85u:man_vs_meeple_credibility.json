Just wanted to weigh in with my personal philosophy.  \n\nFirst -  I do not believe that every game is good (and most are bad), I do believe that every game has \"merit\" of some sort.  Monopoly has merit.  Payday has merit.  Candyland has merit.  I consider none of these good games, but what they do is they incorporate more people into our hobby and force people to sit down and interact with one another in a social atmosphere.  They teach children about basic economics, strategy, tactics and how to handle both failure as well as success.  All games have merit - but it doesn't mean that I still want to cover them.\n\n\nSecond - because of this I would agree with the original poster of this thread - we steer away from \"bad\" games whenever possible.  We understand that this might be a disservice for some viewers, but what people don't realize is that there are now 2,500 new games being released a year and a huge portion of these games are not good games.  When we developed MvM, we wanted to push the industry forward, not backwards - and by focusing on the negativity surrounding a game or better yet, even giving these bad games the limelight, we then fail in our ability to push the games that we feel are good.  Trust me, even with the two of us, we have trouble just keeping up with the sheer amount of good games that we want to cover.\n\n\nThird - Production and Time.  David and I do this full time now, but there are only the two of us.  Even now I am working 16-18 hour days Monday through Sunday and sleeping maybe 5-6 hours a night, and I have two young children and a wife.  I rarely see them because I am spending my weekends working to produce content for the channel.  In 9 months, I have personally shot and edited over 146 videos - that's one every other day.  And our videos aren't easy to create as most people probably realize.  We shoot from multiple cameras, take dozens of unique pictures per game, create animated graphics, include additional graphics and are still required to play the games multiple times so that our reviews/previews are accurate and precise as possible.  I assure that what we do is no small feat to coordinate day after day for essentially one person (myself) who has to edit every single video.  Spending 2-3 days on a bad game is not worth our time, it simply isn't.\n\n\nFourth - having said that, David and I do have differing opinions on a multitude of games that we have covered and I promise you not every game we like....I could look back to several of the past year that weren't my cup of tea.  David and I disagree on a lot of things.  If you don't see that in our channel than I am not sure you are truly watching all our videos.  We have very different tastes in games and we disagree quite a bit on what makes a good game and what doesn't, and I believe we are very good at distilling down a game in 8-10 minutes with our own personal beliefs - especially in our reviews.   \n\n\nFinally - Just to make myself 100% clear.  I love this type of criticism and I am glad that the original poster of this thread brought it up.  I understand people's hesitancy towards us.  We are doing as much as we can though to make the industry a better place for everyone and to bring more people into the hobby.  Do I wish we could cover every single game good or bad?  Yes, but we simply do not have the bandwidth.  We are who we are and are genuinely positive people who want to put good games on people's tables to play, enjoy, share with their friends and teach to their own children.  Despite our \"commercial appearance\", we are still just two geeky grown ups sitting at a desk shouting our love for games and pop culture to the world.\n   ", "edited": 1492437262.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy here from MvM.
