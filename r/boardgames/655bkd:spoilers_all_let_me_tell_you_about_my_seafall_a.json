Our own leaders + empires!  Neat!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After making short work of the prologue I was pleased to be one of the Leaders who named an island... morale was high as we embarked upon the first game of the campaign soon thereafter.  I was also tickled with what would turn out to be &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/nEkwHGD.jpg\"&gt;a prophetic choice of Leader avatar&lt;/a&gt; but did not know that then!  It remained fun to talk &amp;#39;in character&amp;#39; throughout the whole affair... it was mostly appreciated by my fellow captains.  &lt;em&gt;Mostly.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We clipped around the cardboard ocean, plundering and subjugating natives like nobody&amp;#39;s business.  The little &amp;#39;choose your path&amp;#39; captains log entries were moments of high tension at first which left us wondering what other realities a different choice might have conjured.  Then everyone began to notice the &amp;quot;play nice&amp;quot; trend which pretty much put an end to the high-stakes nature of the choices.  Everyone but me was always a benevolent explorer and was duly rewarded for it.  I though continued to be a conquistador when the opportunity arose pew pew!  :P  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two of us explored, One ransacked, One traded like a madman and I did a bit of everything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of our explorers was cursed with sour luck from the very start... like the kind of luck where he&amp;#39;d roll a dozen dice for a 4-Difficulty endeavor and be forced to pop two Luck Token because he only came up with two successes!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And our newcomer was very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good at cube-moving euros apparently... so much so that his overflowing treasure room was the source of much impressed ribbing.  :)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with a bit of luck I was able to snag each Milestone a turn before his much better equipped ships could get in position or a big sale would afford great treasure... I took advantage of whatever event bonus was available and went with that for my move.  A fortunate explore roll here, an island-high raid there saw me gaining bonus after bonus.  And then those bonuses offset his cash piles by just enough.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We raided each other, we set out West and we opened boxes like candy over the first few games... my Glory lead kept increasing by ~7 per game with a boardfull of +1s to each bit I bought.  The other four, now allied against me in total, began to do what they could to vex my plans - buying the goods I needed, gobbling up the lower areas of exploration I was aiming toward, etc - only occasionally nipping at each other during opportune times.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But despite all their efforts my lead continued to grow and my bonuses stockpile... it wasn&amp;#39;t until we popped the &amp;#39;take X for every 5pt you are behind the leader&amp;#39; ruleset that things evened up for a game or two.  I was able to weather the storm and two games in a row stole the &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; milestones out from under our newcomer by a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; turn due to lucky Advisor pulls... for example he had brilliantly shut me out of the needed resources to complete a final colony but I was dealt a workaround Advisor who allowed me to substitute gold for good while building colony.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One turn, essentially a 14 point or so glory swing!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every game we would begin even and I would grind glory, stockpile huge reserves of gold via exploring/mine raiding and then hover around victory before nabbing whatever largest Milestone was available.  Close games became runaways and having +3 glory just living on my board began to shine through as redonkulous.  The fact that a +3 became a +&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; in the final two games was just insane.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The campaign dragged terribly once Ker was exposed... the very next game I made it my business to kill the Pirate King asap even though I benefited from its existence - most of my enmity never became permanent and the real sufferer was our newcomer... via Ker&amp;#39;s effect he had half a dozen enmity on EVERY island.  Ouch!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the help of the &amp;#39;Grizzled Veteran&amp;#39; - who thereafter became my absolute &amp;quot;go to&amp;quot; dangerous site guy that never, ever failed me - I felled Ker and sat on an &amp;#39;always active&amp;#39; colony, soon making it another 8 field then later plowed through Temple and Society with equal ease.  Each of my upgrades was either a field or a reputation, followed by a handful of garrisons and then renown, renown, renown!!  The captain&amp;#39;s log continued to reward my empire with little +1s here and there.  They all added up to a stash of automatic glory and piles of chits.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By virtue of the Guild Hall and Observatory I burned through lesser options and spammed luck at Temples to gain huge rewards... the only part of the game I was &amp;quot;unlucky&amp;quot; with was tablets + relics.  Didn&amp;#39;t get a SINGLE one until the very last game of the pre-hell campaign.  But the 50 gold, 5 goods, etc I would invariably receive was far more beneficial than the cute but tiny bonuses tablets afforded.  And having those damn relics in their holds was a regrettable millstone about the necks of my fellow captains!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were only one box away from the end (or so we though at the time) and I was ahead in Glory over 2nd place by 50 or so points... and 3-5th place were 10 points behind him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our 5th stated he would not be coming to any more games... we were surprised and disappointed but not overly upset - I&amp;#39;ve always reiterated in my group the old Elrond line &amp;quot;On you who travel with me no oath nor bond is laid, to go further than you will.&amp;quot;  We read and implemented the rules on campaign absences and sailed onward.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truth be told I fully expected a &amp;#39;hang the winner&amp;#39; sort of ending a la Churchill&amp;#39;s scoring system for those too far out ahead.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were confused as to the &amp;#39;chart&amp;#39; we needed but kept figuring the answer was in the tombs... then we found out about the &amp;#39;backs&amp;#39; of the advisors.  I was able to hire 2 per turn due to my appellation and set about inquisiting the world.  I shot the society in the face with my Grizzled cannon and built their temple... the statues and all 4 chart advisors made for a notably anticlimactic &amp;#39;end of the world&amp;#39; roll.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the &amp;quot;naughty naughty imperialists&amp;quot; tone of the game it was to no surprise that winning colonization meant losing.  What was the quip from MST3k on the hamhocked Red Scare film?  &amp;quot;Message coming through here people, MESSAGE!&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final few games felt like more of a chore than a delight, sadly... most especially the &amp;#39;close hell&amp;#39; game.  And then to read the final entry... THE END.  Yeesh.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still have my Leader in all his pompous glory and some neat ships for my youngest to play with (mama ships and baby ships!) but damn if Seafall didn&amp;#39;t fall flatter than a pancake with us.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool idea, interesting map generation, some neat little plot turns but blase boardart, bloated &lt;em&gt;ok stop going so fast and everyone slow down&lt;/em&gt; mechanics - having to endlessly snatch map bits back and forth between vaults, Ker impacting everywhere, Tomb rooms that in no way drive the plot, every game reboot to do the same four moves you did last time to build up your ship, etc etc etc - and a rather empty message without relent made for an underwhelming experience that as mentioned felt like a chore to finish.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even with us working as a group to hurry each round along at a sensible pace the last few games took nearly three hours apiece!  &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/UDo0bDH.jpg\"&gt;We made it to THE END after 13 games&lt;/a&gt; but my victory was pretty much a foregone conclusion by game 8.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t necessarily &lt;em&gt;regret&lt;/em&gt; playing through Seafall - I certainly got my 20$ out of it - but I would never recommend it to anyone and may even come to caution folks against it... it&amp;#39;s just not worth the time investment and my gut tells me that will become more true with each passing day beyond campaign completion.  My runaway win and the extremely predictable / prosaic ending didn&amp;#39;t leave a good taste in anyone&amp;#39;s mouth.

I think we were all ready for the game to end about a game or two before it actually did, and none of us ever want to replay that last round again.  And man, that last round was rough.  I mean, I know it's supposed to be hell, but it felt a little like it came out of nowhere and felt so different than the rest of the game.  You spend so many rounds making minor incremental changes and then, wham, like 8 major things all change at once.\n\nDespite how that sounds, I did enjoy most of our playthrough, and I'm actually playing it through a second time with my son (I know that makes me seem like something of a sadist, but it's his first exposure to a Legacy game, and so far he's really been enjoying it.  We're five games in now, and just cracked Box 3), but I did pick the second copy up on sale for $40, and gave my son some early upgrades to level out the field against my knowledge of what's to come.\n\nAs a 2-Player game, turns go really quick, and each of us can carve out a role without overlapping.  With 4 (and I can't imagine how bad it was with five), I feel like there are really 3 viable specializations:  super explorer, super trader, or super raider.  One of our players tried to do a little of everything at first, which always meant he was unable to compete in that space with the specialist, and spent a LOT of rounds just feeling frustrated.  With 2-players, it's a much more open game, and there's a lot more opportunity to do the thing we think is fun that game.

We had one player surge up from 4th place to first in the last two rounds of the game, and he loved that piece.  All the rest of us could only sit and wait for him to finish the rounds.  I think we were all ready for the game to end about a game or two before it actually did, and none of us ever want to replay that last round again.  And man, that last round was rough.  I mean, I know it&amp;#39;s supposed to be hell, but it felt a little like it came out of nowhere and felt so different than the rest of the game.  You spend so many rounds making minor incremental changes and then, wham, like 8 major things all change at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite how that sounds, I did enjoy most of our playthrough, and I&amp;#39;m actually playing it through a second time with my son (I know that makes me seem like something of a sadist, but it&amp;#39;s his first exposure to a Legacy game, and so far he&amp;#39;s really been enjoying it.  We&amp;#39;re five games in now, and just cracked Box 3), but I did pick the second copy up on sale for $40, and gave my son some early upgrades to level out the field against my knowledge of what&amp;#39;s to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a 2-Player game, turns go really quick, and each of us can carve out a role without overlapping.  With 4 (and I can&amp;#39;t imagine how bad it was with five), I feel like there are really 3 viable specializations:  super explorer, super trader, or super raider.  One of our players tried to do a little of everything at first, which always meant he was unable to compete in that space with the specialist, and spent a LOT of rounds just feeling frustrated.  With 2-players, it&amp;#39;s a much more open game, and there&amp;#39;s a lot more opportunity to do the thing we think is fun that game.
