We don&amp;#39;t change the victory condition that the expansion brings in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually games are close so if you&amp;#39;re playing to 9 VP, you may see that two or more of the players will achieve that in the current round. This pushes the players to try for that extra battle win before the round is over to either:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) Get 10 VP to beat everyone above the necessary VP to win or;\nB) Get that extra battle win to break ties in the event that multiple people end the game at the same VP amount  (most battle wins break ties)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with the original victory condition, it entices people just that bit more to try to squeeze another VP in a final round to achieve victory.
