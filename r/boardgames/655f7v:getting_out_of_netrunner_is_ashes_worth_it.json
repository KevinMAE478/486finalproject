It solved my need of card games that didnt require constant purchases, has tons of depth, is highly replayable and only one person needs to buy it so that everyone can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might I suggest BattleCON or Exceed? Both are very excellent Card Dueling Games. Require no pre-constructed decks, 1 Copy is good for 2-4 players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you like being overly analytical with each decision you make in a card dueling game, you might want to look up Pixel Tactics, or if you want a more relatable theme, the Megaman Pixel Tactics that is soon hitting stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg7qu5m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492127625.0, "created_utc": 1492098825.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655f7v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7p3iy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "reversezer0", "parent_id": "t3_655f7v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Star Wars: Destiny by the same designer (Lukas Litzsinger) is the hotness right now in my neck of the woods.
