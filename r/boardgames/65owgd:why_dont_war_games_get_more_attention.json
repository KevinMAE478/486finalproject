Which isn&amp;#39;t to say that people who play wargames don&amp;#39;t do it for the enjoyment, but they do it for the learning experience too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dgc4wg8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384625.0, "created_utc": 1492355825.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owgd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owgd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owgd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgckanv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Omnislip", "parent_id": "t1_dgcbveo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I started with Battlestar Galactica.\n\nThere are dozens of us, dozens!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started with Battlestar Galactica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of us, dozens!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dgckanv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404975.0, "created_utc": 1492376175.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owgd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owgd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owgd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5ck1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "calgary_db", "parent_id": "t1_dgd08si", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, when I was a teenager I played Axis and Allies so it isn't like I was a total stranger. 1st game of TI3 was a 4 player slog, but really fun.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, when I was a teenager I played Axis and Allies so it isn&amp;#39;t like I was a total stranger. 1st game of TI3 was a 4 player slog, but really fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dgd5ck1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492434812.0, "created_utc": 1492406012.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd08si", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Locclo", "parent_id": "t1_dgcvhgq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yikes, I kinda want to know how that went.

Play any of the Attack Wing styled games?  Imperial Assault games?  Risk?  Axis and Allies?  Kemet?  Incredibly popular wargames - heck, my FLGS even has a night dedicated to some of these wargames.\n\nNow, how many people jump into Arkwright or A Feast for Odin as their first modern boardgame?  If you did, you'd make all the same accusations about boardgames and \"boardgamers\" make about wargames.  Is it the hobby's fault you picked the wrong games to start out with?  No.  You didn't do your due diligence.\n\n*********\n\nOkay, so lets talk *Cuba Libre* specifically.  What is involved in that game?  You get an excessively deep box, a small 4 panel map (with all component holding spots on it, a map of 13 areas - 3 cities, 3 economic zones, and 7 provinces), a mere 86 wooden pieces for 4 players (blue player: 30 cubes and 2 disks; green player: 6 cylinders and 10 disks; yellow &amp; red player: 15 cylinders and 4 disks each - plus 2 big cylinders per player); 54 cards (a standard deck); one counter sheet with 108 counters (mostly as helpers so you don't have to recalculate everything on the board constantly); 7 player aids (enough so every player has identical needed player aids); 3 six sided dice; a playbook to help you learn the game and get the history; and a rulebook.\n\nSo what is that rulebook like?  Its 11 pages long.  That's it - 11 pages.  It isn't filled with exceptions or twists.  Page 1 is the cover/table of contents, page 2 is the introduction and components, page 3-4 is the information on the components and what the bits mean/how they are used, page 5 is the summary of the sequence of play, pages 6-7 are the main operations players will do in the game (\"actions\"), pages 8-9 are the special actions a player might get to do, page 9 is also events, page 10-11 are scoring cards and all the special board maintenance that follows if no one wins (with page 11 having victory conditions clearly spelled out).  Oh, and then there is the setup guide on the back for 1 page plus a 2 page index.\n\n*************\n\nHow does that compare to A Feast for Odin? A 2 panel action board, 1 panel board for each player, a small supply board, 4 small map boards, a small oval board, 15 special shaped tiles, 2 tile extentions, 1 large round overview tile, 11 small rectangular tiles for buildings, 8 mountain range tile strips, 32 ship tiles, 125 money tokens, 336 goods tiles, 7 thing penalty tiles, 48 wooden player pieces (12 per player), 96 resource tokens, a starting player token, a round tracking cube, 137 cards, an eight sided die, a twelve sided die, an appendix, an almanac, and a 24 page rulebook!\n\nFro the rulebook you have 22 pages of rules.  Page 1 is the cover/intro (no table of contents to get to the section you need quickly is provided), pages 2-3 is a pictorial guide of components (no explanation of what they are for or how to use them), page 4 has how to arrange your bits (because the game has to tell you how to punch and sort everything), pages 4-6 is the rules for setting up this sprawling mess, pages 6-7 is an overview of play, pages 8-11 is the sequence of play, pages 12-13 is is details on actions; pages 14-16 is the details of the boards and tiles; pages 17-20 is the rules of how to do the things that the spaces let you do, page 21 is details on the cards, page 22 is about component limits and running out, page 22/23 has end of game and scoring, and page 23 remainder can be ignored as it is the solo rules which I am not counting in this comparison plus page 24 (credits).\n\n*******************\n\nSo what do we have - the \"great game\" of *A Feast For Odin* which has about the same length of rules (as *Cuba Libre* has far less illustrations, thus twice the content in the same amount of space) with horrible organization (no table of contents/index), tons more components, tons more of complex rule exceptions to learn and master, a lot more bits to constantly manipulate, more difficulty learning the gameplay, and a shorter 30 minutes per player and thus 2 hour versus approximately 3 hour (or 2.5 hour with short scenario) game length - in other words, about a 30 minute difference in play length.\n\nYet people will talk about how great a game *A Feast for Odin* is and all its merits, but then turn around and call games like *Cuba Libre* unnecessarily long and complicated, with poor rulebooks (that give you TOCs, Indices, in-line citations to other sections that you might need to reference, and clear explanations)...\n\nSorry, no.  It is predominantly boardgamer bias against wargame - the same issue boardgamers have with non-gamers.  Non-gamers see boardgames as time wasting activities that are either for kids or unduly complicated... a lot of the sentiment non-gamers have can be equated to the views of boardgamers, who never gave that niche in the hobby a fair chance.  They might have tried the equivalent of *Arkwright* or *Magic Realms* for their first wargame and said \"see, everything I though about them was right\" instead of playing through proper introductory level games (like they did with their board game hobby).\n\n*********************************\n\nAll that said, I won't comment on your WSIG question at the end.

It&amp;#39;s also about confllict which as theme and mechanic, I guess is much less popular in board game circles: Even a little &amp;quot;Take That&amp;quot; can be unwelcome for a lot of people who don&amp;#39;t want others to feel bad or themselves when having a social bonding time around a table board game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly EUROS often take weirdly neutral themes and make great boardgame systems out of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History, for whatever reason, doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a part of that canon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the profusion of youth culture and geek culture and postmodern (there&amp;#39;s no history - only an ever changing present) attitude is part of this. The Neophytes of the 60&amp;#39;s rebelled against Tradition after the austerity of the post-War years certainly in Europe. I think it&amp;#39;s very difficult to consult academic history with so much more eye-catching modern culture churning out so many films, comics, books, fashions, innovations in technology and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to play some historic games but I don&amp;#39;t feel like I have the time nor stamina: 30mins is my preferred max duration for a game!
