Then, from each of those initial 20 states, Black has 20 possible moves to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means there are 400 (20 times 20) potential ways for the board to look after 2 moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each new move after that balloons that number. Tons of outcomes, lots of room for strategy. This is why you can rank people in Chess. No one can possibly prepare for all the game states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the end of a chess game you start over from scratch. Back to the initial game state every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy games do not do this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you made a chess variant where each time you played, you threw your first piece to be captured into the woodchipper (a common device every gamer keeps in their home).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Game 2 now has a board with 30 of the original 32 pieces on it. Which means that game 2 &lt;strong&gt;starts&lt;/strong&gt; with the potential for 256 unique layouts. And if White and Black can make the same 20 moves to start, game 2 now has...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;102,400 (256 times 20 times 20) possible game states&lt;/strong&gt;. Compare this to &lt;strong&gt;400 possible game stats&lt;/strong&gt; at the same point in game 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s just with one rule adjustment! Imagine how many game states are possible by the start of the final game of Pandemic Legacy or Seafall!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This inherent complexity means that someone will eventually find a way to break your system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, this has happened no fewer than 3 times in QuickFight. Some playtester will come along and either&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A.  Get super lucky&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B.  Get super smart&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and bring the game to a state where it is now broken, and no one wants to play anymore. Once this happens, you need to determine if a small patch can fix things, or if the problem you&amp;#39;re seeing in game 6 is aaaaactually related to a flaw in the game design that needs to be addressed in game 1. Which now means you have to &lt;strong&gt;rewrite your whole game again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sucks, and I have done this 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to think that I couldn&amp;#39;t allow for a situation where the players can break the game. In my head, that&amp;#39;s still my ideal. But the honest truth is that I&amp;#39;m not sure you can account for this in 100% of the cases. The best I can do is playtest with as many people as possible, so I can get a handle on how different groups diverge, and try to account for those situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, but why aren&amp;#39;t there more Legacy Games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my standpoint, the answer is this: This natural complexity of a Legacy Game leads to a herculean amount of development and testing time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a reference point, I&amp;#39;ve been working on QuickFight for 4 years. It&amp;#39;s a side project; I&amp;#39;m not a full-time game designer. But when I took some time and converted the game into a non-Legacy version (called Corporate Raiders), I did it in just shy over 1 year. Same basic mechanics to start, but waaaaay faster to design and balance because you start over the same way every time. Here is a timeline of the progress on my 2 games:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://boardgamefightclub.com/img/dev-timeline.png\"&gt;http://boardgamefightclub.com/img/dev-timeline.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any Legacy Game is going to take &lt;strong&gt;at least&lt;/strong&gt; 2 or 3 times longer to design than a standard board game. And you will need a constant stream of playtesters because instead of testing the same game once or twice, the same group needs to playtest like, 10 or more constantly changing games. Most playtesters simply won&amp;#39;t stick through to the end. And honestly, how many game designers are willing to devote way more time and energy into a Legacy game versus designing (and maybe even releasing) 2 to 3 games in the same span of time? The risk is gigantic, for a game that might not even succeed in the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be this way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I started this, I had a dream of converting my favorite game at the time into a Legacy Game and just seeing where that journey took me.

I can&amp;#39;t let these 15 people have all the fun so I&amp;#39;m going to make my own Legacy Game!&amp;quot; There are plenty of resources and people to help, and no two people are ever going to design the same game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you decide to dive in, I&amp;#39;ll be there when you have questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So am I wrong?

So we pulled in someone from the earlier game (who knew the rules fairly well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were able to get the mechanics down, but they made a critical mistake because they weren&amp;#39;t aware of our group&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;interpersonal dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The later group played really aggressively, which meant you could never let your guard down.  The new player made a normal move, but in doing so, left their harbor wide open.  Something none of us would ever do.  Another player noticed, and immediately demolished the new player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a meta with our group that the new player just didn&amp;#39;t see until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd quick example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my QuickFight game, I&amp;#39;ve tried a bunch of tests where I&amp;#39;d have a completely new player replace someone into an ongoing game.  I&amp;#39;ve even had instances where the new player took on a deck that was imbalanced &lt;strong&gt;in their favor.&lt;/strong&gt;  But the new player lost every single time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory is that even if you know the rules inside and out, you&amp;#39;re be entering a Legacy game at a major disadvantage in terms of experience, and understanding the existing player dynamics.  Maybe you can come in at game 2, but past that, you have almost no chance to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "boardgames", "name": "t1_dg7t8jx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130180.0, "created_utc": 1492101380.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg67lja", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ah-grih-cuh-la", "parent_id": "t3_64zbqs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Of the people that have played legacy games, how many people actually had different people play the game during different sessions?
