There are some synthetic versions that basically do the same thing. I used to use Rapidlash, which was AMAZING and cheap. However, Latisse stuck them with a lawsuit and they had to switch out the actual effective ingredient with peptides and amino acids, which do nothing. So there are some brands that USED to work, but had to take out the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some products still out there that still contain the ingredients mentioned above, Revitalash being one of them (mentioned by &lt;a href=\"/u/aquajack6\"&gt;u/aquajack6&lt;/a&gt;). There are a few other options as well. I find &lt;a href=\"http://belashed.org/eyelash-growth-serum/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; rundown of available products to be helpful, and was updated Feb 2017 so it should be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, with castor oil... it basically conditions. So your lashes will probably look/feel nicer, but you won&amp;#39;t get noticeable growth like you would with something with active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg6lgwa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061383.0, "created_utc": 1492032583.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52x03", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cullies", "parent_id": "t3_64rqkc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do any of you ladies use an eyelash serum?
