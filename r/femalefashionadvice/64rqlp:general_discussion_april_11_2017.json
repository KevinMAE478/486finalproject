Those versions change -- with my mood, my age, the weather, my interests etc. So the way I dress also changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say the ladies at your work probably just don&amp;#39;t get it. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean you look bad or even that they&amp;#39;re terribly mean, but most likely they know next-to-nothing about fashion and care about it even less than that, so you dressing up just probably...bewilders them. Add to that all the ingrained cultural messages that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people have absorbed about women&amp;#39;s fashion and dressing (it&amp;#39;s frivolous, it&amp;#39;s showy, it&amp;#39;s too slutty, it&amp;#39;s too modest, etc) as well as the fact that they have probably never seriously interrogated these ideas or where they came from, and you end up with a bunch of people who have a bunch of opinions that are, well, based on &lt;em&gt;not much of substance.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;ll wager that you&amp;#39;ve thought much more about why you love the clothes and shoes you love, and I&amp;#39;ll wager that you have reasons for dressing the way you do. Be proud of the time, energy, thought and creativity that goes into dressing -- those are qualities that make you special.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg4q0wv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491965590.0, "created_utc": 1491936790.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rqlp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4nyr9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tyrannosaurusregina", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jubp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's weird and I don't think your colleague handled it well.
