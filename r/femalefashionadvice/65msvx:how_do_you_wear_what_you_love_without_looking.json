I find this approach more helpful than the &amp;quot;x number of shirts, pants, cardigans, and shoes&amp;quot; approach. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you exactly why it works better for me, but I think that maybe including absolutely everything in the capsule is too overwhelming for me, so it&amp;#39;s easier to minimize my core items and then pick the shoes that go with whatever outfit I wear. (For the record, I do not own a hundred cardigans and shoes, etc. The idea is not to have ten core items and then a thousand extras.) Another reason it works for me is I live in an area with really variable weather (two days ago it was in the 50&amp;#39;s, today it&amp;#39;s in the 80&amp;#39;s), so having ten core items and then a few extras help me have a limited wardrobe while also being able to account for temperature differences. I also do a slightly different ten item wardrobe each season. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dgc2qx8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381376.0, "created_utc": 1492352576.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbvq49", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wittyusername902", "parent_id": "t1_dgbpcse", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, how is that possible? \n\nDon't you need at least a jacket, a coat, two pairs of shoes (winter, and the rest of the year), a pair of pants - and then you've only five items left, four tops or another bottom?
