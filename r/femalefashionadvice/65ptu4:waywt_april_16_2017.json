Goal is to be comfy and look put together, and I have to wear flats and pants that are slightly loose at the hips due to medical stuff. \n&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/pKU0h\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to an album with my work outfits from last week&lt;/a&gt;; apparently I went with white shirts all week without realizing it. =P. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to love the shirts in the Mon and Tues fits but when I pulled them out last week I wasn&amp;#39;t thrilled with how the outfits turned out. Is it just me? I feel like the embellished shirt and rugby striping are suddenly dated, but maybe it&amp;#39;s just the pairings.
