I know a lot of folks who are NB who wear them and they're not as uncomfortable as you'd think! This will help make more male styled clothes fit your chest better, and may help you feel more masculine. I have tiny boobs so usually a sports bra, or one of my CK modern cotton bras smooshes my breasts down enough to a point where I'm comfortable with them.

Quality wise, stuff from goodwill is usually great because boys clothes are judged really harshly, since boys essentially destroy their clothing from the ages of 5-13.
