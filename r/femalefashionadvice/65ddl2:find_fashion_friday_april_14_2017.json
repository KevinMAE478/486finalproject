These are definitely &amp;quot;going out to indie pop dance parties&amp;quot; shorts that I know I&amp;#39;m pairing with a choker and some converse, but I&amp;#39;m dying for a sexy/edgy/fun crop top (or several) to go with them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously I checked out Dolls Kill, but their crop tops don&amp;#39;t totally work for my slightly bigger bust (I&amp;#39;m a 32D/E). Most of their tops require no bra, and I can&amp;#39;t quite pull that off. I don&amp;#39;t have my exact body measurements, but I&amp;#39;m a tallish (5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot;), busty, skinny-adjacent gal, and I love me some slutty punk school girl chic! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you have any places for me to start, I would super appreciate it!!
