I&amp;#39;m going to do study abroad next spring, it might not look the greatest on a resume and organizing it is going to be a PITA for various reasons but this is like my one free pass to live in another country for 6 months, plus it kind of lands in my lap academically (I don&amp;#39;t need any credits that semester to &amp;quot;stay on track&amp;quot; -- so thanks for all the kind words last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(b) The one hitch in my plans is that I may/may not pass physics this semester &lt;sup&gt;oops&lt;/sup&gt; . I wouldn&amp;#39;t be &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; pissed about it except my last midterm got misgraded and I lost 20% for no reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the exam while on a school trip and submitted it but my exam was an &amp;quot;away exam&amp;quot; and they must have put it through the wrong scantron. When my score was uploaded I even emailed the professor to ask if there was a mistake (I did pretty bad, but I didn&amp;#39;t think I did &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad) -- and he swore up and down there was no mistake but he would double check for my peace of mind(!). I got the question booklet back last week (2 weeks after everyone else because it was misplaced (!!)) and I actually scored 20% higher than the score currently entered. So I emailed the professor about it but after 3 days he has yet to reply (!!!). Was going to talk to him after class but he wasn&amp;#39;t there today. &lt;sup&gt;ARGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg9d1mx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216091.0, "created_utc": 1492187291.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ddjw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ddjw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9eowx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "koko_bean", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ea6q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "SWEEET!!!
