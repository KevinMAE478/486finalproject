Higher end and European brand denim tend to run smaller (Aka true to size) as well- think topshop, h&amp;m (sometimes), Boden (online only unless you want to drag yourself to the warehouse in central Pennsylvania I think), Paige, Joe's jeans, etc. Nordstrom halogen brand has a good selection of work clothes offered in size 00p as well.
