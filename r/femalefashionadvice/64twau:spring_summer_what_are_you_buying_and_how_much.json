I asked my parents to bring me any of the summer things I had left at home, but it appears I don&amp;#39;t have very much! So I&amp;#39;m intending on rebuilding a little more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already bought a &lt;a href=\"https://cdnd.lystit.com/520/650/n/photos/asos/918578-Pink-49a853c1-.jpeg\"&gt;beautiful lingerie-playsuit&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn&amp;#39;t fit my tiny boobs, so it&amp;#39;s going to go back up on eBay at some point soon. I was hoping to wear it as a cami with summer skirts or to fetish events on its own, but alas, no luck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, these are the things I&amp;#39;m looking out for particularly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sandals - my last pair disintegrated at the end of last summer after years of faithful use, so I&amp;#39;m desperately seeking new ones right now, but the current trends don&amp;#39;t do much for me :(&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tea dresses and classic summer dresses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My wardrobe staples: print and plain blouses (in sheer/silk/chiffon/satin materials) and skirts (also printed/plain) - I&amp;#39;m particularly after a yellow midi skirt&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A burgundy crop top - I&amp;#39;m trying to snap a specific one on eBay, but I&amp;#39;m also looking out for other ideas; mostly to go with a skirt I already own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started keeping lists of things I want/need, so I&amp;#39;m hoping not to buy too much. However, I have discovered that since developing a huge eBay habit, I now feel guilty buying anything full-price. Not sure if I&amp;#39;m okay with this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg80dnu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137777.0, "created_utc": 1492108977.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64twau", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9lp2h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "roncey", "parent_id": "t3_64twau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I bought: \n- a white linen blouse from J Crew\n- a lightweight scarf in a batik print\n- 2 tees to replace old ones that were getting grody\n- a new pair of keds\n\nStill in the market for a nice pair of leather flats in tan (why did Madewell discontinue the Sidewalk Skimmer!) and a pair of sandals with a low chunky heel.
