So, CCW welcome. My main goals right now are to actually wear the great stuff I already own, buy stuff that makes sense with my wardrobe and lifestyle, and wear outfits that are interesting, either to look at, or touch, or think about I guess. Or just stuff I like. My inspirations are sort of all over the place - Katharine Hepburn/sweater bunny/surly teen/Vassar girl/Fran Fine/Phryne plus Mac/my mom in the 80s.\n\nDuring work I'm constrained to pretty much teacher guidelines I guess. I'm customer-facing so my clothes need to be presentable (and rad when possible), but also modest and durable for moving furniture around all day (Can I walk backwards down stairs in this dress? Can I bend over without whale-tailing in these jeans? Can I lift a sofa without flashing my entire torso in this shirt?). Also I'm in and out of doors throughout the day, so I have to be mindful of the weather. During my off days my only limit is my imagination! ha. I've been focusing on wearing my nsfw (for whatever reason) stuff on those days, including all the lipstick I buy and then consign to fancy events.

So, CCW welcome. My main goals right now are to actually wear the great stuff I already own, buy stuff that makes sense with my wardrobe and lifestyle, and wear outfits that are interesting, either to look at, or touch, or think about I guess. Or just stuff I like.

I&amp;#39;m customer-facing so my clothes need to be presentable (and rad when possible), but also modest and durable for moving furniture around all day (Can I walk backwards down stairs in this dress? Can I bend over without whale-tailing in these jeans? Can I lift a sofa without flashing my entire torso in this shirt?).
