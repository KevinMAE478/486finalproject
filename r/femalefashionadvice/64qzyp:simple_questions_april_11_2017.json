I\u2019ve read the threads discussing Modcloth alternatives but some brands either don\u2019t appeal to me anymore, have closed, or don\u2019t ship to my country. I also like Louise Ebel\u2019s style, although I\u2019m unsure if I can pull it off, or if it\u2019s work appropriate (e.g. her shorts and maxi dresses and tulle skirts, for starters).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Can I just wear printed fit-and-flare dresses with cardigans for the rest of my working life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the wall of text. I appreciate any sort of help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg4kd7j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959412.0, "created_utc": 1491930612.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qzyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qzyp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ko8s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Truant_Muse", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jkpj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I really like the dresses I've gotten from [eShakti](http://www.eshakti.com/Shop/Maxi) and with their customization options you could easily get what you're looking for, if you like their styles.
