Choose a fabric weight that is appropriate for the level of heat where you live. As for showing shoulder I have a couple shirts that are sleeveless blouses but in more casual or semi casual fabrics (like a simple cotton) but with something just a little formal or deliberate about it like ruffle or embroidering. Once again stick to what will be comfortable for the temperature. Of the shoes listed the Sneakers would probably be easiest to style with shorts, but it might be worth looking into lightweight cotton lace ups. A sporty look, like a polo shirt could go with the Adidas shoes and shorts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you go out and buy more things, try the shorts on with what ever is already in your closet, you probably already have some things that go.
