My typical M.O. is to update my accessories -- belts, shoes, bag, jewelry, scarves -- to the latest trends, and incorporate them with modern-classic clothing items. Or I may pick just *one* trendy clothing item and mix it with more classic pieces. \n\nWhat I avoid is head-to-toe trend. I do not want to be \"that mother\" who looks like she raided her young teenager's closet, or is trying too hard. \n\nI also do not embrace every trend that comes along. I only embrace the ones that tickle my fancy. And I think long and hard about trends I wore the first time around. I will only adopt these if I really, really loved them the first time, and they flatter me. And if so, I'll analyze what is different about the trend this time around, and make sure I nail that quality so I don't look stuck in time. \n\nI'm going to add here that I think we live in a marvelous time where there are so many trends to choose from, and it's not like there is just one look. It's as if everything is on trend. This gives us the ability to pick and choose what flatters and tickles our fancy. We do not have to be slaves to trends any longer. We can say no... or say yes. \n\n&gt; Is trendiness worth it?\n\nI do think that trends are worth it for women my age. Being just a little bit trendy, in judicious doses, helps avoid the \"stuck in time\" effect. It also helps to pay close attention to the minor &amp; subtle tweaks that make up the difference between say, 1970s trend and today's 70s rehash trend. \n\n&gt;  How do you maintain trendiness without buying new things every month or two?\n\nGenerally I buy a few times a year, not every month or two.\n\n&gt; What trends do you buy into and which ones do you usually say no to? Do you have a rule you follow?\n\nAnswered above. \n\n&gt; At what point does a trend become \"classic\" (I would argue that skinny jeans are in that category for many of us)\n\nSkinny jeans are classic but the trend is in how you wear them: nowadays the trend is ankle length with booties, rather than tall boots. I'm not getting rid of my tall boots anytime soon though. They are taking a rest until tall boots come back into fashion, which they will, because tall boots are classic. They are classic because they are quite practical.\n\n&gt; How much do trends affect your style?\n\nI like to have a small dose of trend to keep my style current. For example, I pay a lot of attention to trends in color, as this is an easy way to update. I won't invest in a color that doesn't flatter me, and I've been known to stock up when a flattering color comes around. But it's just so simple to buy an inexpensive scarf in the color du jour and now your same exact outfit from last year looks up to date. \n\n&gt; Is it possible to remain trendy without updating your wardrobe?\n\nIf you *never* updated your wardrobe, eventually you will look stuck in a rut and dated.  Little details matter. But you needn't update your wardrobe every year or every season. \n\n&gt; What trends are you staying away from because you think they will die quickly?\n\nI'm not staying away from any trend because I think it'll die quickly. But I do stay away from trends because they just aren't my own personal style. For example I will likely take a pass from the ankle length culottes. That isn't a new trend, by the way. I know from experience it just makes me look short and dumpy. I also take a pass from jeans that are ripped, faded, acid-washed. That's just not me, I don't see the sense in buying damaged clothing. That said awhile back I did invest in the printed sweatpant craze, and I do have a pair of sweats that look like ripped jeans, but they aren't ripped. I don't wear them all that often though because as I said, it's just not my style. \n\nMeanwhile I'm embracing higher-rise bottoms because that works fantastic for my figure.

I think it's important not to let trends inform your style, but you should. If you like something, then wear it, if you don't then don't bother. \n\n- How do you maintain trendiness without buying new things every month or two?\nI think what you notice overall is that the most encompassing theme is silhouette or the composition of an outfit, and both of those factors are really personal. If the trending silhouette or 'uniform' isn't something I like or suits me, then I'm not going to force myself into it.\n\n- What trends do you buy into and which ones do you usually say no to? Do you have a rule you follow?\nI only go for a trendy item if I like it, know it will suit me, and can see myself wearing it well beyond the period it is trending in. If I'm feeling like I'm buying it just to \"fit in\" then it's probably not the right reason to purchase it. \n\n- At what point does a trend become \"classic\"?\nI think if it's a piece that's referenced throughout history then it's probably a classic, thus why the skinny pant silhouette is classic. I tend to think it's usually items that are universally flattering and easy to work into many outfits that become classic. \n\n- How much do trends affect your style?\nI think we'd all like to think it doesn't affect our personal style, but who knows? Despite people telling me my style is distinctively 'me', trends may be just as much a part of it.\n\n- Is it possible to remain trendy without updating your wardrobe?\nThis really depends on what matters to you: do you want to be trendy? What purpose would you like fashion to serve in your day-to-day life? What are you trying to portray or express with fashion?\n\n- What trends are you staying away from because you think they will die quickly?\nThe first thing off the top of my head is the white sneaker trend just because it isn't my style.
