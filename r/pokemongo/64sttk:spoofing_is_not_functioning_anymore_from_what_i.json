There is talk of making it available  for 6.01 which has a share of 31.3% of the phones so if this happens then it will make more of an impact.\n\nSecond PoGo  can only go so far in stopping their program from running on lower versions. Version 4.4, 5.x, and 6,x if you eliminate it from running on each it means a market share of approx 1/4 + for each version. in other words  each version you eliminate means that you loose 1/4 of your player base. The real number is that if you eliminated all but 6.x and above then only 34.1 % of androids could run Pogo you loose 66% of your possible user base.\n\nNext. Every phone will not get the Update. The Models controlled by Google like the Nexus and Pixel will get the update unconditionally. The rest it first depends if the Manufacture will make a ROM with the March update and Patch for each different Model and then second it is up to the Carrier if they will push that ROM out to consumers.

The thing is that PoGo is getting better at detecting rooted phones and closing all the bypasses. \n\nSo yes spoofing is getting harder but not really that hard yet. The fact that there is noticeable change is because the phone of choice for Spoofers was the Nexus an Pixels since they are pure Android, controlled by google and easy to unlock and root to get the best spoofing because they were able to implant their mock GPS program as choice as a system file making it easier for the app to work without screwing up. So the thing is March 2017 update caught a lot of them by surprise and if they installed the March update their only choice would  be to buy another phone and dish out hundreds for either a 6.x device or a 7.x that had not received the update. I also think thsat you cxan only ignore the update so long before it will force install too.\n\n\nSo this is why Spoofing is down.
