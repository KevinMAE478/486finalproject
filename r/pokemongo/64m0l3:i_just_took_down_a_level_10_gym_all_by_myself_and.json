I finally got enough mons over 1800cp with decent IVs and moves, so after a solid week of not catching anything and just stocking up on items, i felt i needed to do some spring cleaning in my items, so instead of trashing items, i went out to battle. Took on a level 10 Mystic gym by myself after work. Took an hour. I knew it would be not long before I lose it as it is next to a bus depot and transit hub, so I stuck my worst pidgey in it that I named \"MysticSux\". Tonight me and another buddy did it again with 2 level 10 mystic gyms back to back. \"MysticSux\" the pidgey and \"MysticBlowz\" the hoothoot, while he left \"SucitMystic\" Magicarps. \n\nI know its not that hard for them to take it back, but it gives me great amount of joy that ive \"inconvenienced\" them. Im like the annoying fly they cant catch. They are going to check their daily coin income and they are going to get 80 instead of 100, and that satisfies me to no end. \n\nAnd now I have no revives yet.
