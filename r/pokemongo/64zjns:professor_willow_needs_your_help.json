Additionally, the game frequently gltiched/errored on catching, which is a feels-bad moment for the user to begin with, and again, was exacerbated by the fact that they didn't refund any berries/pokeballs used during the glitched encounter.

Issuing refunds would have alleviated a lot of the ill-will from these moments.\n\n**3)** Besides server stability, the in-game tracker (a **CORE** feature of an already shallow game) was completely broken relatively early on. This is an issue in itself. However, **there was no way to know it was broken unless you looked for outside information**. Players got frustrated because they couldn't find shit with the in-game tracker, and they didn't know why. Once again, a bug with the game was made even worse because it was not properly dealt with. Removing the in-game tracker, sending a pop-up notification, a line in the patch notes, anything would have helped. \n\n**4)** It is difficult to play this game \"casually\" if you don't live in a city. You have to specifically go out and play this game once every couple of days, or else you will run out of pokeballs (and therefore be completely unable to play at all). \n\n**5)** All games, especially mobile games, thrive on getting people hooked and developing a habit. \"Wake up, go to the bathroom, check facebook/twitter, check MOBILE-GAME, eat, go to work\".  At the start (and even still now) if you ran out of pokeballs there was practically no reason to open the app.  The game has very few things to actually do -- which makes it even harder to play casually and very hard to develop a habit of playing every day.\n\nEven the \"login\" bonuses (didn't exist for months), which are lackluster, require you to spin a stop, making it hard for suburban/rural players to get hooked.
