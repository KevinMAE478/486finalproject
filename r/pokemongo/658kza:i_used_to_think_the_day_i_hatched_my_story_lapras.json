You don't have to have the app open, most of the time my phone is locked. If it's paired, it'll count your walking distance, even if the phone is locked or in the background.\n\nHere's how it's supposed to work. Basically, once you've paired it, when you open the pokemon go app, there's a small icon in the top right corner that you push, which makes it start searching for the pokemon go plus device. You push the button on the device, and it connects. Once connected, every time a wild pokemon appears, including those spawned by incenses and lures, will cause the device to vibrate and flash colors, green if it's a known pokemon, white/yellowish if it's a new pokemon. If there's a pokestop in range, it'll flash blue. If the catch/pokestop spin is successful, then it flashed different colors. If the catch missed, or the pokestop is out of range, it'll flash red. It'll only use regular pokeballs, if you run out, it won't use great or ultra balls, and if it fails on the first attempt, that's it. The pokemon runs away. \n\nHere's how it REALLY works. It can be extremely touchy when pairing, I find it works best if my WiFi is off, and it'll occasionally drop, so it's best to check it once in a while to make sure it's still active. Sometimes it takes several attempts to pair. Also, at times it picks up pokemon before they appear on your screen, but it also has the annoying habit of waiting until they're almost out of range to register it. Same with pokestops. It works great when walking, and far better then nothing if in the car. Catching pokemon to grind for stardust is much easier this way, but you'll go through regular pokeballs like water if there's a lot of spawns around you.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it worth it.
