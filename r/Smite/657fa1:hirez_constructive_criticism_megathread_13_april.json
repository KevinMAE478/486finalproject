Hi-rez is a game company and is trying it's best to make the game fun, sometimes some ideas may sound nice but may not always be the right answer. I hope we see more points and good discussion ideas instead of some person shouting \"NEW MODE SUCKS, FIX YOUR SERVERS)\n\n\nAnyway let's start with the discussion. I first would like to discuss a key factor with Hi-rez and that is their servers. I truly love this game, and love it's cast too. Hinduman is an amazing goofball, ponpon is such a sweet person and shows us that when it's live mistakes are bound to happen, tina and chuck lighten up the mood, and f dot is f dot! This cast and other employees make u know how much they work hard to make this game pollished. Now the thing is as much as I love them it would be nice if Hi-rez starts focusing on KEY FACTORS before adding anything.\n\nFirst of all is the servers, I know I know it's that post again, but the servers aren't really stable. Hi-rez has been having this issue for like since what? season 1? and the problem is still not addressed. Server issues are huge and have been growing for every patch, we players love the game but find it frustrating if we can't actually play it. I personally dont experience much issues, but many others do. Some games our pings are perfect then come to smite and it's either quite well or just complete trash. **I would prefer 3 patches heck even 5 patches scheduled just to fix servers** this problem must be fixed. A good start up is to divide the paladins/smite servers since that has been causing issues highly.\n\n\nSecond I would like to see  Hi-rez to focus on other MAIN key factors then adding new stuff. Like i said earlier it would be nice if Hi-rez just focuses on the servers and other key factors.  A good example is the new event. I like the art and the work put into it, but it was not really necessary. Sure Hi-rez wants to try new stuff and add fun and new ideas, but sometimes we, as players, would like Hi-rez to just focus on what's important and then add what they want. The new game mode is fun and unique, but then gets boring after time and it would have been nice if they focused on other things. TLDR: Hi-rez has good attentions, but sometimes some things should be pushed aside and what's important should be put first.\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE/LIMITED SKINS. This is an issue I would like to stress about.  Yes this is a F2P GAME, YES this is one of Hi-rez's few games/sucess, YES not everything has to be free. But this has gone wayyy too far. EXCLUSIVE/LIMITED SKINS SHOULD NOT OVERTHROWN REGULAR SKINS. Season 4 basically just started with exclusive skins, it would be nice if some skins are bought and one is exclusive. Make for each patch for the ammount of skins they make, make 3/4 buyable and 1/4  exclusive. This would be a good balance. The morrigan skin/ Athena skin would have been god t4-t6 skins. Skins that are in chests should have unique animations/emotes. A good example is the doll skin for izanami, I wasn't mad that it was in a chest because it shows how much work was done in it and even had it's own emote **IT REWARDED  PLAYERS FOR BUYING GEMS**, so these skins should be in chests and the others not. Because seriously at this point it's just hi-rez greed.\n\nAlso some bugs need some fixing, Fenrir's wonderland still shows, and it would be nice if these small aspects can be fixed that way people would take this game more seriously\n\nFinally please we are playing this game **because it's a MOBA**.  I would play mario kart if I wanna play mario kart. I seriously love the effort and hi-rez wanting to make something fun and unique, but it's nice if they focus on the key aspect and that is a MOBA. We prefer balance changes and new gameplay/effects. If they wanna add new adventures makes them more unique. Let's consider the new overwatch PVE (NOTE I'M NOT COMPARING, great companies learn from eachother, not everything is a ripoff). They made their event based on lore. It's amazingly fun, it makes us lore loving people feel connected to the cast even more, and did i mention it lets u play the legendary skins for a given time?! That's amazing! We need more like these, how about a ragnarok event in which we play as Hel/Fenrir/Loki and we fight Odin/Freya/tyr/thor in a pve event. Basically ragnorak is unfolding, sol gets eaten by fenrir, and many more aspects . It would be hugly fun, and can't be a rip off since it's smite-related. We lore lovers would even get so attached to it. **TLDR: Hi-rez should focus on what truly smite is A MOBA, and if they wanna add new events, make them unique and smite-related**\n\n\nI hope I didn't bore something to death, and grammar mistakes will be made, but  I hope i send my message, and truly hope Hi-rez sees what the community wants. a good game is a game that connects to it's players, Hi-rez having been doing that very well, but we need them to focus on some aspects.\n\n\nA huge thanks for the mods for making this post, a thread where we can say our thoughts and have hi-rez easily see them is a huge step to progession :)", "edited": 1492110576.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay I would start off, first I would like this thread to be rational.

I very narrowly missed the message cap with this too. There will be no TL;DR.\n\nI think Hi-Rez is doing a lot of positive things, like doing Charity Events or giving out things for free (like Gems every week). Not to mention that the godpack is still a very good deal. There are also the free gem surveys. With dedication and luck there are so many free gems to be made. It's also worth mentioning that for the most part, 95%, this game is still free to play, not pay to win, which is a big plus. There's no characters behind paywalls or things you absolutely must buy to be a top player. (The other 5% are specific skins that are more quiet or easier to aim.)\n\n\nNow to the mixed and then the not so positive things:\n\nThey do try to give feedback, yes, but I feel like it's nowhere near enough. There is so much more room to interact with the community. They don't have to jump every time someone asks for a reply, but whenever there's a minor uproar from the community, it takes *forever* for someone to reply and that looks bad for the company/to the community.\n\nCustomer support is sometimes a joke and it's a coin toss if you get someone competent that helps you or someone that gives you a copy-paste reply. I've literally had cases where I wrote \"I already tried restarting\" and the answer I got was \"Have you tried restarting,\" which only proves that my message was actually not read at all. Now I get that they have a lot of messages every day, but it's customer support. You should take the time to read them, not copy-paste reply and hope that you ticked the right box with it.\n\nI appreciate the work Hirez puts into trying to provide new content constantly, but I feel like they go about it the wrong way or with the wrong focus. Especially mind boggling is the fact, that despite the community providing so many amazing content ideas, those never get done. Either Skin concepts or even map concepts. There have been many requests for Christmas versions of the Conquest map in the last years, but instead we get Arena focused events. Yes, yes, Arena is the game mode with the most players, but I'm sure most people would agree that Conquest is the main mode of the game.\n\nNow I'm not someone that plays a lot of Conquest, but even as a player that tends to focus more on the casual side of games, I still feel like Conquest *needs* more attention. It needs to be pushed into the focus. It needs a proper tutorial, it needs to motivate players to start learning it. Yes, there are many elitists that complain about \"Arena casuals\" ruining their games because they have no idea about Conquest meta. And I partly agree. Mostly that would be a matchmaking issue. I disagree with the fact of scaring players back out of the game mode for having less experience.\n\nSadly Hirez missed the chance to introduce players newly into Conquest with the start of the new season, so I would hope that they can focus on this point for S5. If the map is changed, the jungles branched out and it comes with a proper tutorial and proper focus (such as putting it first place in the game modes), maybe it will get people interested. And since the map is new, there would be less of a Meta pressure as is now. But it needs to have main focus right away. Edit: See also my edited comment on the Wisdom Tab at the bottom.\n\nAnd speaking of game mode placement: Siege and the UI. Now I'm not going to discuss the general design direction of the UI, but is it really so difficult to have a UI that scales differently from a console UI and thus fits more game modes into the main view? Adventure currently pushes not just Siege, but also Match of the Day completely out of view. This should *very easily* be fixable with a different scaling that should also be no problem for the PC version. I can understand bigger boxes and everything for console, but if the console has a different HUD from PC, why can't we also have a different UI?\n\nSiege leads me to another thing that I currently have issues with: The Matchmaking. Something is just off, sometimes. Matchmaking, even at top play time is really weird at times and players under level 20 should *never* be matched with level 30 if they solo queue. (Party queuing with level 30 players is different, obviously). And I'm also sure Siege Matchmaking took a lot of hits, because people legitimately forget, that the game mode exists. Why? Because it's at the bottom of the mode selection and nobody sees it without scrolling. \n\nMy next point, outside of the actual game concept, is the quality control. It was already an issue back in Season 3. Back then it was the season ticket. It is *currently* working, sort of. The non EU/NA games still need some time to update, but at least it's not as bad as it used to be. There's still improvements to be made though. And with the quality control, I come to a lot of minor things that I noticed over the last months, where I wonder if nobody even thought about checking them. \n\nIt starts with the really *obvious* things, like different volume levels for voice packs. It's very hard not to notice that, unless you play with loud music blasting over the gameplay? Some voice packs, like the Star Tamer Bastet voicepack are *obnoxiously* loud. So much so, that despite my game main volume being at 20% it hurts my ears. The Woodland Rogue Morrigan's VGS files are at normal volume, but her Non-VGS lines (VOX files) are way too loud when she uses her abilities.\n\nThen there are the typos. Along with typos come ability texts that are not up to date after nerfs/buffs/changes. Also, I know S4 introduced a lot of item changes, but did nobody bother checking if the item *tags* were correct? (Like CCR, Aura etc.) Or the buff displays? It took, I think, 4 weeks to finally have Gauntlet of Thebes' buff icon show the correct *new* buff, as opposed to what it did in S3. Some people might think this is minor, but if they can't quality control these small things when they change parts of the game, how can we expect bigger things to be noticed? (And did anyone ever notice that Uncommon Sash's background image is not actually black? It's a slightly lighter grey colour and it's the only item in the entire game where the background is not black. It really stands out to me.)\n\nThere are also things like Cutesy AMC Avatar being tagged as \"new\" for... how many months? Too long. Or the bug with Fafnir's Wonderland still showing up after matches on Console. How do these things happen? No, actually, let me rephrase that, because stuff can always bug out and break in a game: *How come nobody notices these things, after weeks and weeks of them being in the game?* So long, in fact, that the community has started to make fun of it in reddit posts.\n\nI guess I just expect HiRez people to actually play their own games and notice these sorts of things. Like playing a match and thinking \"wait, why is there a Fafnir's Wonderland bar at the top, when that game mode is not in the game anymore? Something is off\" and report it. But the more these things happen and the longer they seem to go unnoticed, the more I think that the people responsible for the content, balancing etc. don't actually play their own game. And you can't balance something to \"feel good\" to play with/against, if you don't play your own game and can feel the effects of your decision. You can only make vague guesses and hope that you hit it right.\n\nThat would explain why some buff/nerfs are not just ridiculously out of the blue, but sometimes way over the top. Hi-Rez also seem to have a talent for nerfing *every single thing that is not the actual problem before actually nerfing the problem* \n\nExamples: Release Chang'e, release Bellona, Thoth\n\nI can imagine that balancing is not always easy and finding the problem might not be easy either, but in some cases, just playing the game enough on an above-average level, where you see good players make use of the overpowered gods, the problems should become easier to pinpoint. Are the community feedback documents still a thing? I haven't seen one in a while (or maybe I'm blind) but maybe the idea needs to be expanded in one way or another, because it's actually quite good. It just shouldn't be done on reddit. Here's a few vague ideas I quickly put together:\n\n* Either have players apply for survey feedback every month/patch (Might need a filter, like minimum amount of games played, MMR etc.) or \n\n* Just sent out emails to every player that played at least X amount of matches since the last god release.\n\nThe first one is good for higher level play, but it leaves open the lower level view of less experienced players that might see a whole different arrangement of problems compared to more experienced ones that have certain counters already \"built in\" at this point. \n\nIn any case, the rest of the suggestion would be: \n\nDo surveys. For game modes, items, gods *only*; not \"general feedback\". Like after a new god release, send out surveys via email to the players, with questions regarding the general feeling on the god and then questions on every single ability, health and mana. Is ability X too strong or too weak? Does it need an adjustment? Does the god appear too tanky? Does he have too much CC? Is he too mobile? Does he run out of mana too fast? Whatever could be important for the balancing. Also ask for what the players would suggest for *every single point*\n\nI know this sounds very tedious, but I bet there would be a lot of players more than happy to help with this once a month for free. Because there shouldn't necessarily be a reward for this. \n\nEdit: I completely forgot that I wanted to talk about the outdated Wisdom tab too. But I guess I can quickly sum it up: It took way too long to come up with \"plans to update it\" - which has now been a few weeks since that was announced and nothing happened. Please don't wait too long to update it. This should be done at the same time as a new season comes around, not a few months afterwards.", "edited": 1492119427.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: This is a text wall.

You should take the time to read them, not copy-paste reply and hope that you ticked the right box with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the work Hirez puts into trying to provide new content constantly, but I feel like they go about it the wrong way or with the wrong focus. Especially mind boggling is the fact, that despite the community providing so many amazing content ideas, those never get done. Either Skin concepts or even map concepts. There have been many requests for Christmas versions of the Conquest map in the last years, but instead we get Arena focused events. Yes, yes, Arena is the game mode with the most players, but I&amp;#39;m sure most people would agree that Conquest is the main mode of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m not someone that plays a lot of Conquest, but even as a player that tends to focus more on the casual side of games, I still feel like Conquest &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; more attention. It needs to be pushed into the focus. It needs a proper tutorial, it needs to motivate players to start learning it. Yes, there are many elitists that complain about &amp;quot;Arena casuals&amp;quot; ruining their games because they have no idea about Conquest meta. And I partly agree. Mostly that would be a matchmaking issue. I disagree with the fact of scaring players back out of the game mode for having less experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly Hirez missed the chance to introduce players newly into Conquest with the start of the new season, so I would hope that they can focus on this point for S5. If the map is changed, the jungles branched out and it comes with a proper tutorial and proper focus (such as putting it first place in the game modes), maybe it will get people interested. And since the map is new, there would be less of a Meta pressure as is now. But it needs to have main focus right away. Edit: See also my edited comment on the Wisdom Tab at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And speaking of game mode placement: Siege and the UI. Now I&amp;#39;m not going to discuss the general design direction of the UI, but is it really so difficult to have a UI that scales differently from a console UI and thus fits more game modes into the main view? Adventure currently pushes not just Siege, but also Match of the Day completely out of view. This should &lt;em&gt;very easily&lt;/em&gt; be fixable with a different scaling that should also be no problem for the PC version. I can understand bigger boxes and everything for console, but if the console has a different HUD from PC, why can&amp;#39;t we also have a different UI?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Siege leads me to another thing that I currently have issues with: The Matchmaking. Something is just off, sometimes. Matchmaking, even at top play time is really weird at times and players under level 20 should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be matched with level 30 if they solo queue. (Party queuing with level 30 players is different, obviously). And I&amp;#39;m also sure Siege Matchmaking took a lot of hits, because people legitimately forget, that the game mode exists. Why? Because it&amp;#39;s at the bottom of the mode selection and nobody sees it without scrolling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My next point, outside of the actual game concept, is the quality control. It was already an issue back in Season 3. Back then it was the season ticket. It is &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; working, sort of. The non EU/NA games still need some time to update, but at least it&amp;#39;s not as bad as it used to be. There&amp;#39;s still improvements to be made though. And with the quality control, I come to a lot of minor things that I noticed over the last months, where I wonder if nobody even thought about checking them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It starts with the really &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; things, like different volume levels for voice packs. It&amp;#39;s very hard not to notice that, unless you play with loud music blasting over the gameplay? Some voice packs, like the Star Tamer Bastet voicepack are &lt;em&gt;obnoxiously&lt;/em&gt; loud. So much so, that despite my game main volume being at 20% it hurts my ears. The Woodland Rogue Morrigan&amp;#39;s VGS files are at normal volume, but her Non-VGS lines (VOX files) are way too loud when she uses her abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there are the typos. Along with typos come ability texts that are not up to date after nerfs/buffs/changes. Also, I know S4 introduced a lot of item changes, but did nobody bother checking if the item &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt; were correct? (Like CCR, Aura etc.) Or the buff displays? It took, I think, 4 weeks to finally have Gauntlet of Thebes&amp;#39; buff icon show the correct &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; buff, as opposed to what it did in S3. Some people might think this is minor, but if they can&amp;#39;t quality control these small things when they change parts of the game, how can we expect bigger things to be noticed? (And did anyone ever notice that Uncommon Sash&amp;#39;s background image is not actually black? It&amp;#39;s a slightly lighter grey colour and it&amp;#39;s the only item in the entire game where the background is not black. It really stands out to me.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also things like Cutesy AMC Avatar being tagged as &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; for... how many months? Too long. Or the bug with Fafnir&amp;#39;s Wonderland still showing up after matches on Console. How do these things happen? No, actually, let me rephrase that, because stuff can always bug out and break in a game: &lt;em&gt;How come nobody notices these things, after weeks and weeks of them being in the game?&lt;/em&gt; So long, in fact, that the community has started to make fun of it in reddit posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I just expect HiRez people to actually play their own games and notice these sorts of things. Like playing a match and thinking &amp;quot;wait, why is there a Fafnir&amp;#39;s Wonderland bar at the top, when that game mode is not in the game anymore? Something is off&amp;quot; and report it. But the more these things happen and the longer they seem to go unnoticed, the more I think that the people responsible for the content, balancing etc. don&amp;#39;t actually play their own game. And you can&amp;#39;t balance something to &amp;quot;feel good&amp;quot; to play with/against, if you don&amp;#39;t play your own game and can feel the effects of your decision. You can only make vague guesses and hope that you hit it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would explain why some buff/nerfs are not just ridiculously out of the blue, but sometimes way over the top. Hi-Rez also seem to have a talent for nerfing &lt;em&gt;every single thing that is not the actual problem before actually nerfing the problem&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Examples: Release Chang&amp;#39;e, release Bellona, Thoth&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can imagine that balancing is not always easy and finding the problem might not be easy either, but in some cases, just playing the game enough on an above-average level, where you see good players make use of the overpowered gods, the problems should become easier to pinpoint. Are the community feedback documents still a thing? I haven&amp;#39;t seen one in a while (or maybe I&amp;#39;m blind) but maybe the idea needs to be expanded in one way or another, because it&amp;#39;s actually quite good. It just shouldn&amp;#39;t be done on reddit. Here&amp;#39;s a few vague ideas I quickly put together:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either have players apply for survey feedback every month/patch (Might need a filter, like minimum amount of games played, MMR etc.) or &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just sent out emails to every player that played at least X amount of matches since the last god release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first one is good for higher level play, but it leaves open the lower level view of less experienced players that might see a whole different arrangement of problems compared to more experienced ones that have certain counters already &amp;quot;built in&amp;quot; at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, the rest of the suggestion would be: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do surveys. For game modes, items, gods &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;; not &amp;quot;general feedback&amp;quot;. Like after a new god release, send out surveys via email to the players, with questions regarding the general feeling on the god and then questions on every single ability, health and mana. Is ability X too strong or too weak? Does it need an adjustment? Does the god appear too tanky? Does he have too much CC? Is he too mobile? Does he run out of mana too fast? Whatever could be important for the balancing. Also ask for what the players would suggest for &lt;em&gt;every single point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this sounds very tedious, but I bet there would be a lot of players more than happy to help with this once a month for free. Because there shouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be a reward for this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I completely forgot that I wanted to talk about the outdated Wisdom tab too. But I guess I can quickly sum it up: It took way too long to come up with &amp;quot;plans to update it&amp;quot; - which has now been a few weeks since that was announced and nothing happened. Please don&amp;#39;t wait too long to update it. This should be done at the same time as a new season comes around, not a few months afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dg88x54", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492147271.0, "created_utc": 1492118471.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657fa1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg810fw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LeoFireGod", "parent_id": "t3_657fa1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The lack of a west coast server, and zero mentioning of any plans or progress of moving towards getting a server outside of atlanta.

You have a platform to talk shit and be reactionary about stuff and, because the internet is known to be very... extreme about everything, you'll surely find others who agree with you.\n\nr/Smite is the only sub I post on because I care about this game and I like to tell the devs that I enjoy it, or things that could be better within the game. I agree with people that are saying that one of Hi-Rez's biggest flaws is communication, it would be good if they could talk more to us about issues that have been constantly mentioned in the community like the server issues, the number of exclusive cosmetics and so on. But I also like to inject some positivity to my posts because, frankly, I enjoy the game for what it is and I feel like the people at Hi-Rez are overall very good developers that made a game that gave me countless hours of fun. It's very rare for a game to do that with me. I love the theme of the game, I love its art direction, I love the god kit designs, I love speculating about what gods could be added in the future, I love how they included casual friendly modes like Arena and Assault. I couldn't care less for being competitive in online games, I just want to have fun in my free time and Smite gives me that.\n\nBut the community... man, it's not exclusive to Smite, a lot of videogames, specially online multiplayer focused ones, have extremelly toxic, petty, arrogant, negative, spoiled, childish communities. They will complain about simply everything. It's so much complaints, and addressed mainly in uneducated form that degrades the work of the devs in every possible way, that it turns the focus away from real issues, like the servers not being great. Instead of complaining politely and respecting the developers of the game you play, you have people screaming \"WHO CREATED ADVENTURES SHOULD BE FIRED, FIX YOUR STUPID SERVERS LOW-REZ, I HATE THOSE DEVS SO MUCH\". And then you ask me why you go on a match and there's always someone telling you to kill yourself irl because Thanatos ganked and killed you. Everyone is so toxic, so extreme, so unpolite that you just can't have a good conversation about stuff. When you go to colleges, you have people with different opinions disagreeing at each other, on issues much more important than an online game, but they don't act like 6 years old mad that their mommy didn't buy the chocolate they wanted. God, get some perspective. Do you think people will take your opinions seriously if you scream at them like a ferocious dog? Good luck getting far on your jobs, love life, relationship with friends, well, anything at all. \n\nAnd you guys come and say you spent a lot of money on the game and you have the right to be, well, assholes to the devs. Did HiRezAjax or someone else put a gun on your head so you could buy the 55 chests to get the Morrigan skin or something? Everything you do with the game, you do based on your personal choices. Like everyone here says, you can play the game and unlock absolutely everything gameplay related without paying a single penny.\n\nYou get people complaining that a 3D model doesn't look as good as the card art. Have you ever tried to take a look at LoL, aka the biggest game in the world? Their card arts is amazing and the in-game models, well, they are simpler, but it's the artstyle they chose, and the earlier you can accept that, the more you can appreciate how the models look. Smite won't ever look like Paragon or Horizon: Zero Dawn or something, but I love its art style for what it is. \n\nI swear, people are so spoiled that whenever Hi-Rez gives free stuff, a lot complain that is not *the* free stuff they wanted. If you look right now at the thread about the skin giveaways on this weekend's streams, there are people complaining that the skins from last year's Odyssey look like shit and that they wanted other skins. For free. By watching a stream. Holy shit, at least try to explain why you think the skins don't look appealing to you, be constructive about it instead of mindlessly complaining about every single thing. \n\nAbout the whole Adventures fiasco... I agree that the decision to include them in the game was a bit unfocused, and that the resources that went to that could have gone to something else, including the server issues. The racing Adventure could also be more polished, even if it took a longer time to be released. But asking people to get fired because of that? You don't know what happens inside a company. You don't get to make those calls as an outsider, random internet person. Smite and Paladins have been successful games on the last few years and it's natural that Hi-Rez may want to take some risks and do something that are, you know, innovative. Because there are thousands of options of good games to play right now, and a lot of players may get bored as shit to play just Smite, the MOBA, and nothing else. It's ok to seek innovation, but perhaps from now on they have learned their lessons from Adventures so they can take the best steps in the future. \n\nTo you complaining everyday on thread after thread about \"Low-Rez\", thank you for wanting the game to improve, but is it too much to ask to have some maturity and not be completely overreactionary about everything? Not asking someone to get fired, not disrespecting them as human beings by calling them stupid, retarded or much worse names, not flat-out lying by saying that anything they do is illegal or unethical when that's literally NEVER the case? As much as this game has to improve, and I don't deny that, the community should rethink of their behavior just as much. Of course things won't change, but at least I voiced my opinion.\n\nThanks for everyone who listened and to Hi-Rez, thank you for making this game ( and for making Ganesha, I can't express how happy I am with that! ). For criticisms, I hope servers can be more stable, and I hope there can be a better balance between exclusive/limited and direct purchase items. Otherwise, I love Smite and I want the game to grow more than anything. \n\nNo one will read this crap but god, does it feel good to write it out. Welp, back to only posting on datamining, lore-related, future gods speculation, and Kaios concepts threads. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post incoming, as if anyone gives a damn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never been a big fan of Reddit as a platform because I dislike the very concept of voting for posts, you can call it a &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; but it&amp;#39;s very easy to circlejerk and if the sub doesn&amp;#39;t have appropriate moderation, you&amp;#39;ll get posts that are extremelly hateful, unconstructive and just mean-spirited get upvoted like hell ( not saying that happens in &lt;a href=\"/r/Smite\"&gt;r/Smite&lt;/a&gt;, but still ).  You have a platform to talk shit and be reactionary about stuff and, because the internet is known to be very... extreme about everything, you&amp;#39;ll surely find others who agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/Smite\"&gt;r/Smite&lt;/a&gt; is the only sub I post on because I care about this game and I like to tell the devs that I enjoy it, or things that could be better within the game. I agree with people that are saying that one of Hi-Rez&amp;#39;s biggest flaws is communication, it would be good if they could talk more to us about issues that have been constantly mentioned in the community like the server issues, the number of exclusive cosmetics and so on. But I also like to inject some positivity to my posts because, frankly, I enjoy the game for what it is and I feel like the people at Hi-Rez are overall very good developers that made a game that gave me countless hours of fun. It&amp;#39;s very rare for a game to do that with me. I love the theme of the game, I love its art direction, I love the god kit designs, I love speculating about what gods could be added in the future, I love how they included casual friendly modes like Arena and Assault. I couldn&amp;#39;t care less for being competitive in online games, I just want to have fun in my free time and Smite gives me that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the community... man, it&amp;#39;s not exclusive to Smite, a lot of videogames, specially online multiplayer focused ones, have extremelly toxic, petty, arrogant, negative, spoiled, childish communities. They will complain about simply everything. It&amp;#39;s so much complaints, and addressed mainly in uneducated form that degrades the work of the devs in every possible way, that it turns the focus away from real issues, like the servers not being great. Instead of complaining politely and respecting the developers of the game you play, you have people screaming &amp;quot;WHO CREATED ADVENTURES SHOULD BE FIRED, FIX YOUR STUPID SERVERS LOW-REZ, I HATE THOSE DEVS SO MUCH&amp;quot;. And then you ask me why you go on a match and there&amp;#39;s always someone telling you to kill yourself irl because Thanatos ganked and killed you. Everyone is so toxic, so extreme, so unpolite that you just can&amp;#39;t have a good conversation about stuff. When you go to colleges, you have people with different opinions disagreeing at each other, on issues much more important than an online game, but they don&amp;#39;t act like 6 years old mad that their mommy didn&amp;#39;t buy the chocolate they wanted. God, get some perspective. Do you think people will take your opinions seriously if you scream at them like a ferocious dog? Good luck getting far on your jobs, love life, relationship with friends, well, anything at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you guys come and say you spent a lot of money on the game and you have the right to be, well, assholes to the devs. Did HiRezAjax or someone else put a gun on your head so you could buy the 55 chests to get the Morrigan skin or something? Everything you do with the game, you do based on your personal choices. Like everyone here says, you can play the game and unlock absolutely everything gameplay related without paying a single penny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get people complaining that a 3D model doesn&amp;#39;t look as good as the card art. Have you ever tried to take a look at LoL, aka the biggest game in the world? Their card arts is amazing and the in-game models, well, they are simpler, but it&amp;#39;s the artstyle they chose, and the earlier you can accept that, the more you can appreciate how the models look. Smite won&amp;#39;t ever look like Paragon or Horizon: Zero Dawn or something, but I love its art style for what it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swear, people are so spoiled that whenever Hi-Rez gives free stuff, a lot complain that is not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; free stuff they wanted. If you look right now at the thread about the skin giveaways on this weekend&amp;#39;s streams, there are people complaining that the skins from last year&amp;#39;s Odyssey look like shit and that they wanted other skins. For free. By watching a stream. Holy shit, at least try to explain why you think the skins don&amp;#39;t look appealing to you, be constructive about it instead of mindlessly complaining about every single thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the whole Adventures fiasco... I agree that the decision to include them in the game was a bit unfocused, and that the resources that went to that could have gone to something else, including the server issues. The racing Adventure could also be more polished, even if it took a longer time to be released. But asking people to get fired because of that? You don&amp;#39;t know what happens inside a company. You don&amp;#39;t get to make those calls as an outsider, random internet person. Smite and Paladins have been successful games on the last few years and it&amp;#39;s natural that Hi-Rez may want to take some risks and do something that are, you know, innovative.

I want to make that clear, I really do. But ever since the first chest popped up in the smite store, I have been noticing a growing trend of how my Gems could be spent. There are less and less and less and less skins I can just straight up buy with my gems. I don't think I have ever looked at a video game so full of chest exclusives. Not only that, but there are gods in the game that dont even have a *single* purchaseable premium skin, like **Khepri, who has 6 exclusive skins, 5 of which are premiums**. \n\n**My primary point of frustration, AND I KNOW IM NOT ALONE HERE, is this:** What once was a simple, cool, and unique exclusive Ymir and Hercules skin in a neat little chest, has been bloated to a store that contains more exclusive skins from limited time events and chests, than the simple, player freedom gem market that made buying things for this game so damn appealing in the first place.\n\nI look at league's store, and as RP dependent as is it is, I can confidently say that I know my RP is not getting dropped on some roll for a ward I don't even want in the first place. They're exclusive skins are not locked behind a RNG number and the amount of skins I have already bought, they're seasonal, with the exception of the two skins redeemable in the free chest and key system.. Seasonal is about how exclusive any free MOBA should have their content. It just works, and it breeds a consumer base that wants to buy in confidently and happily. Christmastime means you and all your friends can support the game and grab yourself a set of dope ass christmas skins no problem and enjoy it as a team. I mean they're only there in season! It shouldn't mean we all drop 35 dollars on a Christmas chest, wasting away a ton of gems we didn't intend on spending(nor wanted to! There's other skins and vps to buy!) just to get a Fenrir skin that was directly purchaseable the first year it came out only. I frequently am finding myself enjoying the content League is putting out a lot more, not because they're art teams are better (they're not &lt;3), but  because I don't have to A) Be playing the game at certain, never again happening, times to get the content I desire, and B) restrict myself to hitting a button to get a skin that could possibly be a 1/55 chance, with wards included, for the price of 400 gems because *their is only 10 days left*.\n\n**My point in finality is this, and I know I am not alone here as evident by the subreddit's condition the past few weeks:** I *want* to support this game.

But **I find it *really* hard to support any developer that restricts my ability as a consumer to spend my money for their content from a level of purchaseable freedom perfect and consistently ideal for any MOBA, to one that is dominated by a bloated chest system, limited time events, and more exclusively locked skins in total than all the directly purchaseable premium skins that have existed in the game ever**\n\nWith no proper response, nor addressing, from Hi-Rez time and time again, on issues far more implicative than just chests, I admit I am losing hope for this game.

It got to the point I did not play for weeks since I just did not want to deal with it. It's a big problem and hurts people from playing your game.\n\nMatchmaking in both normal games and ranked being way too random and off. One game you will have all level 30 people that are around the same level in a nomral, and then the next you have 1 or 2 level 30 on each side and then the rest are level 5-20 making the game not fun and boring to play win or lose. Ranked is not much better and I have people that call mid and feed 0-9 in about 10 mins of the game. It's okay to die, but not that much so fast. It needs work and also makes people not enjoy the game in either normal or ranked games.\n\nBugs are another thing and I won't make a long list of them here, but let's take Jing Wei since I played her a lot. She's been out for almost 1 year and her 1 is still bugged and will go on cd and use your MP without coming out when getting hit by any hard CC at the same time you use it, getting you killed since not only does it take your MP for nothing, but it puts it on cd and you can't even dash off of the gust. I believe some other gods have bugs like this, but for her it's even worse since it actually hurts her kit and will get you killed making it not fun to play. I know you guys have been fixing a lot of bugs and I'm happy for that, but please fix the ones that actually hurt the overall feel of the game/god/item/mode first.\n\nLastly I feel like some gods get way over nerfed or over buffed making them go from S+/S to the worst being at low B/C in one patch. OP or UP is not good for any god/item is not good and I know you guys know that. Let's use Jing Wei again for this. To put it simple she was not doing good when she first came out with bugs and other problems with her kit. Then she got another buff after Golden Bow was removed which were great since it was mostly just buffs to make her feel better overall. Then you guys nerf her since she's doing too good and try to make her more easy to fight. Now in S4 she got super over nerfed to the sea and back removing Fatalis from her dash without at least lowering the cd back on it by or giving it something else. \n\nNow people that even main her have a hard time picking her and when they do, they get yelled at in ranked for picking her over other hunters. Her kit is not fun to use anymore since her 3 does not do enough for the cd it has and makes using the rest of her kit like her ult and 2 hard to use without Fatalis in her kit. She's not fun to play and not even good to play. She's just one god that this happened to and it kills the mood of playing Smite for me.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I love a lot of things about Smite and don&amp;#39;t have that many problems overall with it, but the problems that are there are a big deal to me and I&amp;#39;m sure for some other players as well. These are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The servers for most of S4 have been just so bad I remember at the start of S4 I could barely even play the game, let alone watch people stream it. It got to the point I did not play for weeks since I just did not want to deal with it. It&amp;#39;s a big problem and hurts people from playing your game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matchmaking in both normal games and ranked being way too random and off. One game you will have all level 30 people that are around the same level in a nomral, and then the next you have 1 or 2 level 30 on each side and then the rest are level 5-20 making the game not fun and boring to play win or lose. Ranked is not much better and I have people that call mid and feed 0-9 in about 10 mins of the game. It&amp;#39;s okay to die, but not that much so fast. It needs work and also makes people not enjoy the game in either normal or ranked games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bugs are another thing and I won&amp;#39;t make a long list of them here, but let&amp;#39;s take Jing Wei since I played her a lot. She&amp;#39;s been out for almost 1 year and her 1 is still bugged and will go on cd and use your MP without coming out when getting hit by any hard CC at the same time you use it, getting you killed since not only does it take your MP for nothing, but it puts it on cd and you can&amp;#39;t even dash off of the gust. I believe some other gods have bugs like this, but for her it&amp;#39;s even worse since it actually hurts her kit and will get you killed making it not fun to play.
