I love math. I generally love playing support. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started playing Smite towards the end of Season 1 but mostly played Joust and then moved to a lot of Assault after that. Chaac was the first god I unlocked IIRC and I used to build Chaac crit because...??? I settled into support main sometime early in Season 2, when I started queuing and learning Conquest. There&amp;#39;s been a few different metas that we&amp;#39;ve gone through and with Season 4 we see a heavy focus on Level 1 clear. I started to wonder how each Guardian ranks on clear and why we see some dominate the early game. Below, I went through each Guardian (Warriors were not considered in this but may be at a later time) and calculated their &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; done to Wave #1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we start looking at the Guardians we need to establish a couple general things. We&amp;#39;re going to assume that we built Watcher&amp;#39;s Gift and Level 1 boots for a total of 0 Magical Power. Next, we need to know our Level 1 Minion stats; taken from &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0XbTFEbVUWcvTQ838OTM3LG1_BFL6teNM2c447ZSkI/edit\"&gt;The Word of Thoth: A Smite Mechanics

follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melee Damage&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Ability Damage&lt;/strong&gt; * 0.9 + %Health Damage * 0.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archer Damage&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Ability Damage&lt;/strong&gt; * [100/(100+1)] * 0.9 + %Health Damage * [100/(100+1)] * 0.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Melee Damage&lt;/strong&gt; * 3 + &lt;strong&gt;Archer Damage&lt;/strong&gt; * 3 (unless otherwise noted in table footnotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; calculated below can be compared to our

align=\"center\"&gt;90&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;483&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;8s&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; is calculated as the total from the ability duration. Ares does damage every 0.5s at a duration of 4s for 8 total ticks of each damage type. &lt;del&gt;I decreased damage to Archers by two ticks in my &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; for the time it takes to group the Minions up. This can probably be reduced by the grouping and positioning at the start of the ability channel.&lt;/del&gt; Ares&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; has been adjusted as 8 ticks to 2 Melees; 2 ticks to the third Melee because he ran out of the cone; 6 ticks to 2 Archers; and 0 ticks to the third Archer. I don&amp;#39;t really know what else to adjust here. Results are going to vary greatly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Athena\u2019s Reach passive is not added into her &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt;. Reach makes her next basic attack ranged and adds 25% of her Magical Power. She has a base of 36 Magical Power at Level 1 which puts her at 45 Magical Power for the attack after using Shield Wall. If this is used for clear you can add an extra 41 damage per Melee and 40 damage per Archer (because it still has to  go through mitigations). So if you are efficient, you can be looking at an extra 243 damage to the Wave!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believe this god suffers from Melee ------ Archer separation. Is it possible to hit an entire wave with this ability? Absolutely. Is it likely at Level 1? Not really. For the purpose of our table, &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; will be given as done to &lt;strong&gt;Melees or Archers&lt;/strong&gt; but not the summation of both. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I thought it was worth providing the numbers for both abilities. I\u2019ve seen both used, and experimented with both at Level 1 even though I think JeffHindla uses Belly Flop. It\u2019s safer as Belch of the Gods will pull Minion aggro pretty easily. If you don\u2019t do what JeffHindla does, you\u2019re probably doing it wrong (I might be too).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Watching people clear with Geb is a pet peeve of mine. I don\u2019t think they realize the damage on his Shock Wave reduces with distance. You\u2019ll see Melee damage calculated as standing right in front of them while Archer damage is calculated at a reduced value that I\u2019ve found to be pretty consistent in my testing. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; is calculated as the total from the ability duration. Khepri does damage every 0.3s at a duration of 3s for 10 total ticks of damage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Khumbhakarna I had to test to understand the ability. I thought it would do 70 damage to the first Minion and 90 damage to every Minion after but it does not. It does 90 damage to every Minion. Maybe that\u2019s just my misunderstanding though. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kuzenbo\u2019s &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; depends on how the ability is applied. The first number will indicate damage as if applied in a straight line. The second numbers will indicate a double bounce against Melee/Archers. The third numbers will indicate a triple bounce against Melee/Archers. It\u2019s situational if you can achieve those bounces. And Damage from the NeNe Kappa\u2019s autos have been omitted as it\u2019s not a reliable source.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;For Sobek, I chose his Sickening Strike as his main form of clear. It\u2019s largely more popular but I wonder if people realize it does less damage than Tail Whip that sits at 80 Damage with a 13s cooldown. Tail Whip, however, displaces Minions and which may impede your ADC\u2019s clear if they aren\u2019t expecting it.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sylvanus is a bit of an odd duck in that he uses auto attacks for clear. You\u2019ll see how much damage the ability does to Minions + the amount he\u2019ll deal per auto attack. Because of the protection reduction Verdant Growth causes, you\u2019ll see he does 33 damage per auto to the Archers when it is applied instead of 32 per auto. I left his &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; blank because it would require me set a duration.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Terra\u2019s wall must be placed such that you can hit each Minion with both walls for maximum effect. The area for both walls to strike is pretty forgiving. So this is calculated as both walls striking and applying damage. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; is calculated as the total from the ability. Xing Tian does an initial damage plus damage every 1s at a duration of 1s for a total of 1 total tick at Level 1.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As you can see, Ymir has an incredibly low cooldown on his main clearing ability. So while his damage might look on par with some of the other guardians, if you couple his low cooldown with his Frostbite Passive (+100% melee damage on afflicted targets for 5s), he has very effective clear.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fafnir felt left out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shackles are another hard one to predict. &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; is given as hitting your first 2 chains and hitting Melee + Archers / Melee / Archer with all 3 shots. Hitting all Melee + Archer + enemy god that many times is highly unlikely. If you can land your first two chains and still hit Minions with all 3 your numbers will look closer to the alternates listed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; is left as a per second value to the whole wave. It&amp;#39;s easiest to leave it at that. So a channel of 5s would be 270 * 5 = 1,350 &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt;. A full duration of Tremors would be 10s for 20 total ticks and would basically put you out of mana. And really there is no reason to use tremors that long. All Minions would be cleared at 8s with absolutely no help. Either you&amp;#39;re solo or your ADC needs to stop face rolling their keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had a hard time consistently hitting all Melee and all Archer Minions with the range of Groggy Strike. One Archer was left out of the &lt;strong&gt;Total Damage&lt;/strong&gt; sum.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Terra&amp;#39;s Force of Nature ability is a very short dash. Unless Minions are group, it&amp;#39;s unlikely to hit more than 3.\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Notes:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;Ability Damage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Cooldown&lt;/strong&gt; information was taken from the game. There are a few sources online but a lot of them do not have correct information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage rounded pretty consistently in the game. Any &lt;strong&gt;Ability Damage&lt;/strong&gt; point at 0.5 or higher rounded up. Any lower than 0.5 rounded down. %Damage rounded down regardless. I found two exceptions to this however. One being the amount of damage done by Terra\u2019s Crushing Earth. The math works out to be 45 + 45 damage (with the rounding stated above) to each Archer but in-game you only deal 44 +44. Sylvanus\u2019s basic attacks on Melees (without the protection reduction from Verdant Growth) should round down to 32 damage each but instead are 33 damage each.

It&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how they will rank. I&amp;#39;ve gotten some requests for Warrior supports and Warrior solo so they&amp;#39;re also on my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I love Smite. I love math. I generally love playing support. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI started playing Smite towards the end of Season 1 but mostly played Joust and then moved to a lot of Assault after that. Chaac was the first god I unlocked IIRC and I used to build Chaac crit because...??? I settled into support main sometime early in Season 2, when I started queuing and learning Conquest. There's been a few different metas that we've gone through and with Season 4 we see a heavy focus on Level 1 clear. I started to wonder how each Guardian ranks on clear and why we see some dominate the early game. Below, I went through each Guardian (Warriors were not considered in this but may be at a later time) and calculated their **Total Damage** done to Wave #1.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore we start looking at the Guardians we need to establish a couple general things. We're going to assume that we built Watcher's Gift and Level 1 boots for a total of 0 Magical Power. Next, we need to know our Level 1 Minion stats; taken from [The Word of Thoth: A Smite Mechanics and Formulae Guide; Season 4 Edition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0XbTFEbVUWcvTQ838OTM3LG1_BFL6teNM2c447ZSkI/edit).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Melee**  \nHealth: 365  \nMagical Protection: 0  \nDamage Reduction: 10%  \nQuantity: 3\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Archer**  \nHealth: 265  \nMagical Protection: 1  \nDamage Reduction: 10%  \nQuantity: 3\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur formulas for calculating damage are as follows:\n\n+ **Melee Damage** = **Ability Damage** * 0.9 + %Health Damage * 0.9\n\n+ **Archer Damage** = **Ability Damage** * [100/(100+1)] * 0.9 + %Health Damage * [100/(100+1)] * 0.9\n\n+ **Total Damage** = **Melee Damage** * 3 + **Archer Damage** * 3 (unless otherwise noted in table footnotes)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **Total Damage** calculated below can be compared to our Minion total health pool (not total effective health) of **1,890**.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**God** | **Ability** | **Ability Damage** | **Melee Damage** (ea) | **Archer Damage** (ea) |**Total Damage** | **Cooldown**\n------|------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:\nAres^1,15 | Searing Flesh (Ability #3) | 15 + 1% Health per tick | 14 + 3 per tick | 13 + 2 per tick | **~~678~~ 486**  | 12s\n  | Shackles (Ability #1) | 50 | 45 per shackle | 44 per shackle | **801/405/396** | 15s\nAthena^2,3 | Shield Wall (Ability #3) | 60 + 80 | 54 + 72 | 53 + 71 | **378 or 372** | 14s\n | Preemptive Strike (Ability #1) | 80 | 72 | 71 | **429** | 15s\nBacchus^4 | Belly Flop (Ability #2) | 90 | 81 | 80 | **243 or 240** | 16s\n  | Belch of the Gods (Ability #3) | 20 per tick | 18 per tick | 18 per tick | **432** | 14s\nCabrakan^3,16 | Refraction Shield (Ability #2) | 100 | 90 | 89 | **270 or 267** | 10s\n  | Tremors (Ability #3) | 25 per tick | 23 per tick | 22 per tick | **270 damage per sec** | 8s\nFafnir^14 | Cursed Strength (Ability #1) | 100 | 90 | 89 | **537** | 15s\nGeb^5 | Shock Wave (Ability #2) | 90 and 60 | 81 | 53 | **402** | 15s\nKhepri^6 | Rising Dawn (Ability #2) | 12 per tick | 11 per tick | 11 per tick | **660** | 12s\nKhumbhakarna^7,17 | Throw Back (Ability #1) | 90 | 81 | 80 | **483** | 15s\n  | Groggy Strike (Ability #2) | 70 | 63 | 62 | **313** | 10s\nKuzenbo^8 | NeNe Kappa (Ability #1) | 70 | 63 | 62 | **375 or 378/372 or 567/558** | 16s\nSobek^9 | Sickening Strike (Ability #3) | 60 | 54 | 53 | **321** | 13s\n  | Tail Whip (Ability #2) | 80 | 72 | 71 | **429** | 12s\nSylvanus^10 | Verdant Growth (Ability #1) | 80 | 72 + 33 per auto | 71 + 32(33) per auto | | 16s\nTerra^3,11,18 | Crushing Earth (Ability #2) | 50 + 50 | 45 + 45 | 44 + 44| **270 or 264** | 15s\n | Force of Nature (Ability #1) | 60 | 54 | 53 | **162 or 159** | 15s\nXing Tian^12 | Furious Roar (Ability #1) | 80 + 3% Health | 72 + 10 | 71 + 7 | **480** | 14s \nYmir^13 | Glacial Strike (Ability #2) | 90 | 81 | 80 | **483** | 8s \n1. **Total Damage** is calculated as the total from the ability duration. Ares does damage every 0.5s at a duration of 4s for 8 total ticks of each damage type. ~~I decreased damage to Archers by two ticks in my **Total Damage** for the time it takes to group the Minions up. This can probably be reduced by the grouping and positioning at the start of the ability channel.~~ Ares's **Total Damage** has been adjusted as 8 ticks to 2 Melees; 2 ticks to the third Melee because he ran out of the cone; 6 ticks to 2 Archers; and 0 ticks to the third Archer. I don't really know what else to adjust here. Results are going to vary greatly.\n2. Athena\u2019s Reach passive is not added into her **Total Damage**. Reach makes her next basic attack ranged and adds 25% of her Magical Power. She has a base of 36 Magical Power at Level 1 which puts her at 45 Magical Power for the attack after using Shield Wall. If this is used for clear you can add an extra 41 damage per Melee and 40 damage per Archer (because it still has to  go through mitigations). So if you are efficient, you can be looking at an extra 243 damage to the Wave!\n3. I believe this god suffers from Melee ------ Archer separation. Is it possible to hit an entire wave with this ability? Absolutely. Is it likely at Level 1? Not really. For the purpose of our table, **Total Damage** will be given as done to **Melees or Archers** but not the summation of both. \n4. I thought it was worth providing the numbers for both abilities. I\u2019ve seen both used, and experimented with both at Level 1 even though I think JeffHindla uses Belly Flop. It\u2019s safer as Belch of the Gods will pull Minion aggro pretty easily. If you don\u2019t do what JeffHindla does, you\u2019re probably doing it wrong (I might be too).\n5. Watching people clear with Geb is a pet peeve of mine. I don\u2019t think they realize the damage on his Shock Wave reduces with distance. You\u2019ll see Melee damage calculated as standing right in front of them while Archer damage is calculated at a reduced value that I\u2019ve found to be pretty consistent in my testing. \n6. **Total Damage** is calculated as the total from the ability duration. Khepri does damage every 0.3s at a duration of 3s for 10 total ticks of damage.\n7. Khumbhakarna I had to test to understand the ability. I thought it would do 70 damage to the first Minion and 90 damage to every Minion after but it does not. It does 90 damage to every Minion. Maybe that\u2019s just my misunderstanding though. \n8. Kuzenbo\u2019s **Total Damage** depends on how the ability is applied. The first number will indicate damage as if applied in a straight line. The second numbers will indicate a double bounce against Melee/Archers. The third numbers will indicate a triple bounce against Melee/Archers. It\u2019s situational if you can achieve those bounces. And Damage from the NeNe Kappa\u2019s autos have been omitted as it\u2019s not a reliable source.\n9. ~~For Sobek, I chose his Sickening Strike as his main form of clear. It\u2019s largely more popular but I wonder if people realize it does less damage than Tail Whip that sits at 80 Damage with a 13s cooldown. Tail Whip, however, displaces Minions and which may impede your ADC\u2019s clear if they aren\u2019t expecting it.~~\n10. Sylvanus is a bit of an odd duck in that he uses auto attacks for clear. You\u2019ll see how much damage the ability does to Minions + the amount he\u2019ll deal per auto attack. Because of the protection reduction Verdant Growth causes, you\u2019ll see he does 33 damage per auto to the Archers when it is applied instead of 32 per auto. I left his **Total Damage** blank because it would require me set a duration.\n11. Terra\u2019s wall must be placed such that you can hit each Minion with both walls for maximum effect. The area for both walls to strike is pretty forgiving. So this is calculated as both walls striking and applying damage. \n12. **Total Damage** is calculated as the total from the ability. Xing Tian does an initial damage plus damage every 1s at a duration of 1s for a total of 1 total tick at Level 1.\n13. As you can see, Ymir has an incredibly low cooldown on his main clearing ability. So while his damage might look on par with some of the other guardians, if you couple his low cooldown with his Frostbite Passive (+100% melee damage on afflicted targets for 5s), he has very effective clear.\n14. Fafnir felt left out.\n15. Shackles are another hard one to predict. **Total Damage** is given as hitting your first 2 chains and hitting Melee + Archers / Melee / Archer with all 3 shots. Hitting all Melee + Archer + enemy god that many times is highly unlikely. If you can land your first two chains and still hit Minions with all 3 your numbers will look closer to the alternates listed.\n16. **Total Damage** is left as a per second value to the whole wave. It's easiest to leave it at that. So a channel of 5s would be 270 * 5 = 1,350 **Total Damage**. A full duration of Tremors would be 10s for 20 total ticks and would basically put you out of mana. And really there is no reason to use tremors that long. All Minions would be cleared at 8s with absolutely no help. Either you're solo or your ADC needs to stop face rolling their keyboard.\n17. I had a hard time consistently hitting all Melee and all Archer Minions with the range of Groggy Strike. One Archer was left out of the **Total Damage** sum.\n18. Terra's Force of Nature ability is a very short dash. Unless Minions are group, it's unlikely to hit more than 3.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGeneral Notes:  \n\n+ All **Ability Damage** and **Cooldown** information was taken from the game. There are a few sources online but a lot of them do not have correct information. \n \n+ Damage rounded pretty consistently in the game. Any **Ability Damage** point at 0.5 or higher rounded up. Any lower than 0.5 rounded down. %Damage rounded down regardless. I found two exceptions to this however. One being the amount of damage done by Terra\u2019s Crushing Earth. The math works out to be 45 + 45 damage (with the rounding stated above) to each Archer but in-game you only deal 44 +44. Sylvanus\u2019s basic attacks on Melees (without the protection reduction from Verdant Growth) should round down to 32 damage each but instead are 33 damage each. The table above has been adjusted to use only whole numbers and to use the actual in-game values for damage.\n\n+ With adding Ares's Shackle ability, I found, similar to Terra, that he did 44 damage to the Archers when my math says they should receive 45 damage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf anybody has insight as to why the math and game value are different, please share.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gods\u2019 Ranking by Total Damage**  \n1.
