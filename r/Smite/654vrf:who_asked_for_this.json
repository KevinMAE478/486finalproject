They rather answer to the fans that accept the scam and problems by responding on the meme, what people love, what people want to see rather than the issues that are there in there blatant face. I love smite.... but seriously i played one game of the Kart mode laughed at how hardcore its trying to be Mario kart...i mean for fuck sake they even have the ? box like mario kart and seriously your fans are why your pockets are full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep shitting on your fans and you will end up losing your player base to other moba cause honestly MxM is pretty fun top down, but u control the characters like a MMORPG, Lobby for you to hang out in, and story mode that co-op. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fucking Step your game up Hi-rez your shit was decent now your just fucking treating your fans like shit. People are tired of the constant DC, Tired of People toxic behavior, Tired of broken updates, Broken gods( which your fucking bullshit practice is fucking stupid) and finally were tired of the PAY TO GOD TO PLAY EVENTS. The rewards you hand are are fucking garbage. Hell when you did the escape from hell event. YOU DID THAT RIGHT CAUSE WE COULD EARN THE STUFF AS WELL. Seriously Hi-Rez your literally shitting on Paladins and Smite cause you wanna be the next Dota/LOL Call of duty/Overwatch. Stop day dreaming and get your shit together you got gods who need to be fixed, skins that are badly needed for certain gods. Dont fucking pull that bullshit card. Make Hel a new fucking skin seriously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally... you have a loyal ass fan base. Constant shitting on them will make them leave to a better game.
