Smite simply doesn&amp;#39;t need a racer game, the players that play it don&amp;#39;t launch Smite for a racer game, and a big portion of them will rather play a different racer game, one that&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a racer game, and thus much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the big point HiRez missed.
