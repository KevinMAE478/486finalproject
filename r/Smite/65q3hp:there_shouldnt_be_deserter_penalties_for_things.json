There is no monetary reason for us to not fix this since it\u2019s in our best interest that players can stay connected and have fun! Since Closed Beta, we\u2019ve made numerous improvements to our server stability and throughout the data, we can see more people are having better connections then ever (that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t have room to improve, but we\u2019re working towards that). Our patch cycle is set up the way it is to be the most efficient across multiple teams. When working on a game, there\u2019s a lot of interconnected parts that need to all hit at the same time, which is why we have specific dates for patches and the schedule the way it is. Our patch cycle gives us time to react quickly, but also the time to create content with a lot of moving parts. When it comes to our platform team (server team), they\u2019re often working within the patch cycle, however, they can deploy certain server fixes outside of the patch schedule directly to the servers. Scheduling patches that only focuses around a specific thing would be incredibly inefficient since teams are already focused each patch on their specific workload - This is true for platform, design, balance, UI, etc. Our platform team is also fighting off frequent attacks to our servers and some of the instability you see is from that - however, we have invested considerable time and resources into defense for these attacks and we absorb them much better than 1 to 2 years ago. We\u2019ve got a dedicated team of programmers re-architecting significant parts of our back end code to be more fault tolerant and are aiming to release that in the fall.", "edited": 1492410128.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget the servers also have physical locations. While server 1 might be at location X server 2 might be at location Y. Because of the difference in locations they tend to travel through different choke points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also on another note, you can be certain that it was the Hirez&amp;#39; servers when the ranked safe mode is enabled. Then an automatic program kicks and and puts ranked in safe mode and then it cant be played for about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here is also the response HirezAmanda posted about the servers in the constructive critisim thread, if you or other people havent read it yet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SERVERS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Servers are not an easy thing to fix - if there was a catch all solution, we would do it! There is no monetary reason for us to not fix this since it\u2019s in our best interest that players can stay connected and have fun! Since Closed Beta, we\u2019ve made numerous improvements to our server stability and throughout the data, we can see more people are having better connections then ever (that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t have room to improve, but we\u2019re working towards that). Our patch cycle is set up the way it is to be the most efficient across multiple teams. When working on a game, there\u2019s a lot of interconnected parts that need to all hit at the same time, which is why we have specific dates for patches and the schedule the way it is. Our patch cycle gives us time to react quickly, but also the time to create content with a lot of moving parts. When it comes to our platform team (server team), they\u2019re often working within the patch cycle, however, they can deploy certain server fixes outside of the patch schedule directly to the servers. Scheduling patches that only focuses around a specific thing would be incredibly inefficient since teams are already focused each patch on their specific workload - This is true for platform, design, balance, UI, etc. Our platform team is also fighting off frequent attacks to our servers and some of the instability you see is from that - however, we have invested considerable time and resources into defense for these attacks and we absorb them much better than 1 to 2 years ago. We\u2019ve got a dedicated team of programmers re-architecting significant parts of our back end code to be more fault tolerant and are aiming to release that in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dgd76gk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492438647.0, "created_utc": 1492409847.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgco7uj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iWILDERNESS", "parent_id": "t1_dgcmv4v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I appreciate your response and how well thought out it is but it is a Hi Rez problem.
