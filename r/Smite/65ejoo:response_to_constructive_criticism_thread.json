The community team has been working with multiple teams to get some responses together to address the main concerns and give a little insights into our focus and goals for the future! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please check it out and happy to keep the conversation going in this thread. I&amp;#39;ll do my best to respond to as many questions as I can, but can&amp;#39;t promise that we&amp;#39;ll get a chance to answer each one! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We understand that there\u2019s a lot of concerns and we want to tackle as many as we can - the most important one we want to address is where our focus lies. There are many different teams working on SMITE, some working within patch cycles, others working on longer-term projects. While you don\u2019t currently see us talking about some of your core concerns, these are all things we\u2019re working on, but it takes a long time with many moving parts (some can even take a year or more!). There are dedicated teams right now to working on these things. \nFor example, Conquest is our main game mode and drives a lot of our highest level of play and esports scene. In Season 4, we did a lot to help competitive players feel like they had more to do. With Season 5, we\u2019re looking to update the map to reaffirm how much this mode means to us and to make it as competitive as possible. Massive geometry updates, gameplay changes, and complete visual overhaul, all take time from many different teams. You don\u2019t see this behind the scenes, but teams are already working on this right now! \nWhile it can sometimes feel like we\u2019re not focused on this, we are striving to make SMITE more polished - it just takes time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;SERVERS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Servers are not an easy thing to fix - if there was a catch all solution, we would do it! There is no monetary reason for us to not fix this since it\u2019s in our best interest that players can stay connected and have fun! Since Closed Beta, we\u2019ve made numerous improvements to our server stability and throughout the data, we can see more people are having better connections then ever (that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t have room to improve, but we\u2019re working towards that). \nOur patch cycle is set up the way it is to be the most efficient across multiple teams. When working on a game, there\u2019s a lot of interconnected parts that need to all hit at the same time, which is why we have specific dates for patches and the schedule the way it is. Our patch cycle gives us time to react quickly, but also the time to create content with a lot of moving parts. \nWhen it comes to our platform team (server team), they\u2019re often working within the patch cycle, however, they can deploy certain server fixes outside of the patch schedule directly to the servers. Scheduling patches that only focuses around a specific thing would be incredibly inefficient since teams are already focused each patch on their specific workload - This is true for platform, design, balance, UI, etc. \nOur platform team is also fighting off frequent attacks to our servers and some of the instability you see is from that - however, we have invested considerable time and resources into defense for these attacks and we absorb them much better than 1 to 2 years ago. We\u2019ve got a dedicated team of programmers re-architecting significant parts of our back end code to be more fault tolerant and are aiming to release that in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ADVENTURES&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our Adventures team is a very small, experimental team that is continually pushing what we can do in SMITE. It\u2019s incredibly valuable to us to test new game-modes, new content models, and purchasing methods. This allows us to test these things with a smaller team (low opportunity cost) and then be able to invest those results into other areas of the company. \nThere are many different types of SMITE players. In general, most of the reddit community is very invested in the highest levels of play so things like mid-season updates, item/balance changes, specific bugs, all have a big pay-off for that group. However, most casual players would not have the same interest for those types of changes. We try to find a good balance between our hardcore players, who are always communicating about the game, and casual players, who often go unspoken. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;SKINS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re currently working on a large blog post about how we categorize and sell skins. Getting the return on our investment of labor (100s of manhours) vs. not nickle and diming/exploiting our players is a very difficult subject. We want to give you the information so you can have an informed discussion about it. It\u2019s taking a bit to get together because we really want to dive into those concerns and be as transparent as possible. And I gotta get it all approved by my boss! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short answer - Adventures are one of the new ways we\u2019re trying to monetize content. The bundles are directly purchasable and provide choice of Limited Skin with the gold key. Having the Adventure Team be able to try these new things is a freedom that we didn\u2019t have before and allows us to test out new methods for distributing content, game-play, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;BUGS/FIXES&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have an incredibly dedicated (and busy) QA team who are constantly working on identifying and fixing bugs. They prioritize bugs based on how gameplay is affected, so a bug like Fafnir\u2019s Wonderland showing up isn\u2019t going to be a high priority vs. gameplay bugs (it will eventually get fixed, but it depends on their current workload). Continuing to submit bug reports (with good reproduction steps) is key for our QA team to be as efficient as possible! &lt;a href=\"http://forums.smitegame.com/forumdisplay.php?270-Bug-Reporting\"&gt;http://forums.smitegame.com/forumdisplay.php?270-Bug-Reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;CONSOLE&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our console team is continually growing and we\u2019re investing more resources into streamlining our console patches. Making sure console rolls out smoothly is very important to us and we\u2019ve recently hired more people on that team to make sure that happens! We\u2019re also working on a blog post that outlines how our console patches work compared to PC patches, which should address some of your questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;UPCOMING FEATURES&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve got a lot of upcoming features that will be rolling out this year and into Season 5 that will address many of your concerns.

All of us here are dedicated to making SMITE the best it can be and are invested in it\u2019s success. Sometimes we hit that mark, but sometimes we fall short - but we\u2019re always looking to improve and push our boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, keep discussing this - we\u2019re here and will continue to read/watch :) Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "There was a large thread yesterday (that's no longer pinned, so starting a new one) about constructive criticism for April - https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/657fa1/hirez_constructive_criticism_megathread_13_april/.

This is GOOD for us as a community.  This can also be bad for them as a business. Unlike a game like Path of Exiles, each skin only appeals to a tiny % of the community. instead of a large % because they are god specific.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to say that the fact people have an issue with buying them means there IS an issue.&lt;/strong&gt;  However with revenue Smite ceases to exist.  They HAVE to try and drive interest, they HAVE to try and drive reasons for new players and new heroes to be used.  Otherwise everyone loses.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an odd sitaution.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if gaming has it figured out yet.  &lt;strong&gt;So while I will not say they are innocent, I think people may have forgotten some very practical realities.&lt;/strong&gt;  I think you overestimate how much each skin costs to make, don&amp;#39;t understand how small a % is interested in each skin, and don&amp;#39;t understand how little profit they make from them compared to competitors selling heroes outright at $5 - $10 a pop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the whole I don&amp;#39;t like defending gambling boxes or microtransaction systems.  I literally have spreadsheets dedicated to showing how bad many are.  But considering the value this game gives up front I think we need to realize that there needs to be ways for all of us, not just small %&amp;#39;s of us, to give value back to Hirez.  Rather than criticize and fight them on things like this I&amp;#39;d rather see REALISTIC suggestions on what the majority of us would be willing to pay for to fund this game.  Because if all we do is fight them then this game WILL fail and then nobody wins.  Some things we will not like, some things they will not like, but we must find some middle ground.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dgad0ts", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492264860.0, "created_utc": 1492236060.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9n6kk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 184, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BrabbitX", "parent_id": "t3_65ejoo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well all the answers are pretty expected.

That may seem kind of obvious but let me elaborate.\n\nThe T screen, the Worshippers tab and Profile Loadout tab, Spectator Mode, etc. All these changes follow a pattern which lets me gleam your goals - emphasize relevant information and generally streamline information and user experience. On the surface, these are good ideas, but the implementation is all wrong.\n\n- T Screen  (couldn't find an old reference surprisingly) ([new reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2e8n0VUoAExze6.jpg)) had the gold gain graph thing removed (fair enough, because of gold fury spikes) while making damage numbers bigger. It also had the borders thinned out.\n\n- Worshippers tab ([old reference](http://i.imgur.com/7P96Sge.png))  ([new reference](http://imgur.com/a/biNR6)) had each god's individual bar enlarged and a little thing added on top that explains the diamond rewards at 1,5, 20, etc.\n\n- Profile Loadout ([old reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cg5zli0WgAA0xim.jpg)) ([new reference](http://imgur.com/a/Pu1Gq)) had literally everything flipped sideways and also had each individual selection enlarged.\n\nWhat my main point here is, is that the main feedback to all of these changes was **negative**. Your goals were only accomplished some of the time, and often in ways that made other things clunky or inconvenient.\n\n- T Screen had people mad because it gave largely irrelevant data and made the bit people care about really small. Smite is not an RTS, those individual numbers are kinda useless. I'm not going to do triple digit addition and subtraction in the midst of an epic multiplayer battle. What people want is bragging rights for Top Damage, Top Killstreak, etc. so this [Concept](https://i.redd.it/gxs8qijfe26x.jpg) posted a while back is a much better idea. Also the border around the screen is a boring red and blue, when people really want something with flair, more like in the concept.\n\n- Worshippers tab did seemingly nothing as far as improvements go. All it did was display *less* information on the page. People were actually pretty happy with the old tab and no one even wanted a change honestly. A good compromise would be this [Concept](http://i.imgur.com/QPicqJX.jpg) which is basically the old screen with the new relevant info on it.\n\n- The Profile Loadout criticism seems to be that it isn't an upgrade, but a (literal) sidegrade. Again, people weren't unhappy with the old one, and no one wanted it changed as far as I know. The slight increase in option selection size is also just enough to be jarring and unhelpful, in my opinion, and it again reduces the amount of options on the page.\n\nGiven the changes that have occurred so far, my fear is that the new UI will, in general, be bigger, less stylized, and in some cases a sidegrade or downgrade from the previous versions. \n\nAnother practical fear is that it will cater too much to consoles in an effort to unify the platforms and to reduce UI work that the console dev team needs to do. If this is overdone, it will only detract from the PC experience as we click on necessarily big buttons and deal with some strange sideways in-game shop that makes console scrolling easier but is a pain in the ass and an eyesore for PC players.\n\nSo Hirez, if you take anything away from this, please carefully consider the practical effects each UI change has on the user experience. Try to understand what we as players want from the UI, and determine if that is or isn't being properly delivered to us. Also, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nOh, One more thing, please *please* don't oversimplify the UI design (specifically the red/blue borders thing, evident in the T Screen and all over Spectator Mode). Microsoft and Apple went that route by making everything flat, dull, and white, and I absolutely *hate* that aesthetic. I want fancy regal borders, carved stone, I mean, these are GODS we're talking about, make sure the world knows it! Imagine Season 1's UI, but redone with a good 5 years of extra experience.

I would like to be ranked with my friends that know what they are doing and also to represent our clan, which i think would get more people into ranked. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dgaf922", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492270220.0, "created_utc": 1492241420.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ejoo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaggbt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "damian3101", "parent_id": "t3_65ejoo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the new ranked system isnt good there are players in diamond that were in gold every other season i dont even feel like playing ranked bc its all going to be striped away in months so whats the point it makes for a really bad experience (in my opinion)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the new ranked system isnt good there are players in diamond that were in gold every other season i dont even feel like playing ranked bc its all going to be striped away in months so whats the point it makes for a really bad experience (in my opinion)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dgaggbt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492273619.0, "created_utc": 1492244819.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ejoo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagl8k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "damian3101", "parent_id": "t3_65ejoo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the current map looks like something a 10 year old would draw in class for a moba ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the current map looks like something a 10 year old would draw in class for a moba &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dgagl8k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492274034.0, "created_utc": 1492245234.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ejoo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagsuf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Throooaaawaaay", "parent_id": "t3_65ejoo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There was a console thread which i commented that the console scene on ps4 was being severely neglected and I called the state of the game as \"disgusting\" I felt really bad saying that because I am sure there are many dedicated individuals that work for Hirez and with Smite my favorite game.
