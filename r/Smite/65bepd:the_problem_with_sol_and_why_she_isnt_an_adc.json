When Sol was first released at the end of Season 2 she was simply OP. She did way too much damage with the combination of her passive and her stellar burst. Stellar burst used to be considered a basic attack, which meant it proc&amp;#39;d things like Polynomicon. Her ability to destroy a tower (which was made possible by her passive) before 3 minutes was also insane. Keep the passive and stellar burst in mind, because this is very important. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, with every OP release come nerfs. Sol got nerfed fairly hard in the patches that followed that were mostly focussed on her passive. They also made stellar burst an ability instead of an &amp;quot;in-hand attack.&amp;quot; Which meant that it wouldn&amp;#39;t benefit from items that work for basics attacks, namely polynomicon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came season 3, in which Sol was still considered a good pick. She wasn&amp;#39;t OP anymore but was used for her safety, her solid early game, her safe chase with fatalis effect in dissaparate that led to immunity and strong tower push potential. Builds consisted of penetration and in-hand items (Boots, dynasty plate helm, telkhines ring, obsidian shard).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came season 4 and they removed her fatalis effect from her dissaparate. This is the point where this post goes from positive to negative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of items that were great on Sol got either nerfed or changed in terms of passives. Namely the helmets that allowed her to trade with hunters more, telkhines ring and pythagorems piece. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sol doesn&amp;#39;t have her fatalis effect anymore which is an issue for multiple reasons. One, you don&amp;#39;t have a stun (like Chronos), a banish (like Freya) or any reliable cc to confirm basic attacks. The problem with this is that Sol&amp;#39;s passive is designed around basic attacks.  Her passive gives her extra attack speed and extra basic attack damge, but you can&amp;#39;t reliably land basics anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing to add to this is that stellar burst stil slows you down when you throw it, like it&amp;#39;s a basic attack. This means that if you want to use the slow from this ability in order to land basics on the target you get slowed down yourself. Also you can&amp;#39;t see a circle on the ground right before you use it, like a Poseidon whirpool, an Isis silence, etc. Again, another negative that an &amp;quot;ability&amp;quot; shouldn&amp;#39;t have. This isn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal tho&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that Sol is also a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; mage. She doesn&amp;#39;t have as much natural defense as hunters do. The reason I say real mage is because Freya has higher defenses in order to compete with other hunters. This is an issue because it makes Sol squishier than basically any other ADC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A fun fact is that Sol has only been picked ONCE in the hunter role this split and she lost that game (Sorry Xenotronics).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Sol in the hunter role doesn&amp;#39;t do anything anymore, pls fix.
