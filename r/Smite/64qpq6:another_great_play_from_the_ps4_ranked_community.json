I used to play with this guy and we would actually win( about 8mos i played with him), i would literally support him to victory, no problems. But lose two times and now youre magically a garbage support, right?\n\nWell, Tonight i played with him (for the last night, might i add) and the first match, he DC 'd for the first 10minutes. Lucky for this fucking bastard i was even watching stream because he had no idea he was dc'd and i told him. Guy fucking bitched me out like i was the main problem HE wasnt paying attention to the fact that HE had been dc'd for 10min. \n\nThen, after he got into the fucking game he sat i fountain pouting about how since he was 10 levels down, he wouldnt play. But lo and behold, we begin winning the 4v5 about 20minutes in and NOW the fucker wants to start to farm up. We get the deicide for the 4th ish time, Midnight is still farming, whatever right? Titans at 15ish% and Midnight backdoors it and acts like he was the biggest dick on campus. ok. Then, i defend him against the other players saying that he was trash, telling them he's actually pretty good. Big mistake. \n\nNext game, we get a Bellona that sat in lane all game nd refused to rotate, a hebo jungle, and Midnight goes the oh so powerful pick of Ao Kuong midlane! Woooo! Right??? Guy whines about Hebo and Bellona all game and really didnt do anything with Ao kuong all game. Never even put half ablame on himself. Needless to say, we lost that game.\n\nThe third and final game is where i drew my last straw. Guy goes with the usual Morrigan jungle, whatever. I go Ymir. Guy bags on me for choosing Ymir saying that all Ymirs are idiots and dont hit their freezes (i maybe missed 4 of 50 freezes that game, btw with none of the 4 being game breaking misses). That was strike one. For one, I had been playing with him for a while, for him to literally sit here and call me an idiot support and say that we have no support when i had literally been saving my team with walls and freeze all game, initiating when needed, sort of ticked me off. But what really got me was when the rest of the team wanted to push FG. Both him and i knew it wasnt a good idea, so he left. I stayed because thats what the support does, right? He supports the majority of the team no matter whats going on. Besides, what am i gonna do in a lane by myself? So, we wipe at FG with midnight alive bc he pushed up duo lane to no avail, and then proceeded to bitch me out for sticking with the team and making an idiot decision to SUPPORT the team, saying that he would expect a support like me to not support idiot decisions to take a firegiant like i could do anything else in the game anyway. Despite my attempts to tell them NOT to attack FG through VGS, they still did it, nothing i can do but try to help them to the best of my abilitiea. But whatever, strike two. Strike three came immediately aftet that, the team revived and for whatever reason decided to go for the FG again. Trying to follow whatever garbage Midnight told me after the last altercation, i ran up to midlane and killed the wave. Needless to say, my team died at FG with 0 chance of survival due to me not being there. Guess what Midnight did? Of course he called me all types of trashes and an idiot garbage player. So when i explained to him that i was simply doing the opposite of what he told me not to do, he bitched me out yet again, telling me that im supposed to be a SUPPORT and support my team eventhough they do stupid ass shit. Then he blocked me from his stream. That was the straw that broke the camels back right there. That made me realize there is no reasoning with that guy, if you lose, he never did anything wrong, it was everyone else. \n\nThere is literally no point of talking to him or playing with him.  I promply blocked him after that match and I hope i can catch him in a future R Conq so my team can destroy him. Ps4 players, if you see him on your team, know that youre probably going to lose.
