Why wouldn&amp;#39;t I just go do gold or try to help my carries instead of the tank in solo lane, if you are a carry in solo then I might try to help you out, but if your a standard solo tank, I&amp;#39;m gonna go help mid and adc, which are the people who can help win a game. It isn&amp;#39;t season 2 anymore where solo can be five levels ahead and carry, games are won in late game team fight and if your solo and tanky your good, just front line and help your carries. Your basically another support, why do you think guardians are so prevalent in solo this season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dg4t5k6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968925.0, "created_utc": 1491940125.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4uyct", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jkorok", "parent_id": "t3_64qmih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "From a solo laner that get ahead to the jungler, fuck off mate.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a solo laner that get ahead to the jungler, fuck off mate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dg4uyct", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491970918.0, "created_utc": 1491942118.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4v9f8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Grumiss", "parent_id": "t3_64qmih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you are so bad that every time you get ganked you die, i'll just focus on lanes that are not lost, instead of going into your FED enemy to feed him another double kill\n\nI'll help you with blue and leave you alone, maybe i'll drop some wards for you if i see that you actually have map awareness, but if you get ganked even when i ward for you, you can rot in hell", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are so bad that every time you get ganked you die, i&amp;#39;ll just focus on lanes that are not lost, instead of going into your FED enemy to feed him another double kill&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll help you with blue and leave you alone, maybe i&amp;#39;ll drop some wards for you if i see that you actually have map awareness, but if you get ganked even when i ward for you, you can rot in hell&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Smite", "name": "t1_dg4v9f8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971262.0, "created_utc": 1491942462.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2stl8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4y026", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gomega98", "parent_id": "t3_64qmih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Often times when the enemy puts so much pressure on solo, your team is able to get things (kills, invades, objectives) on the other side of the map.
