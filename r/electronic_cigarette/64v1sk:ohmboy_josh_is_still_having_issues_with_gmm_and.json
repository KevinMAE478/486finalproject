Obviously I think that&amp;#39;s some bullshit, but if I use some clips from the GMM video and do the same copywriting methods that Josh uses, we could see if it gets pegged as copywriting because it&amp;#39;s legit or because they just are biased against vaping. If it gets steam, I doubt they would want to take it down because it helps their cause, but I think doing this would help the argument that Josh wasn&amp;#39;t infringing on any copywrites.
