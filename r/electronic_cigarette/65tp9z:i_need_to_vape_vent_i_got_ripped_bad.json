I started vaping last year and I was looking for a good shop to be loyal to. I found a little shop in a surrounding town that had a lot of good top shelf juices. I knew nothing about vaping besides it not being smoke, rather vapor. A married couple owns the place and they were super friendly. They taught me all kinds of things and I upgraded from a pen to my first mod. My first mod shit the bed in a month. I paid 130 for it. I went back and bought another tugboat box mod. They had my business for at least six months where I bought various RDA&amp;#39;s, coils, juices, mods (for myself and fianc\u00e9e) and the whole time they had made it seem like they were hooking me up and giving me great deals. Well. Here&amp;#39;s where their kindness started to unravel. I bought a used RX/200 (only real one I got from them because it wasn&amp;#39;t from their store) from there and decided to sell my tugboat that I paid 140 bucks for a month prior on Craigslist. A day after I posted the ad, I got a phone call from a guy that was a vape shop owner about 12 miles from where I reside. He wanted to inform me that the mod I was selling wasn&amp;#39;t real. I actually argued with him telling him&amp;quot; I bought it from my local shop, they don&amp;#39;t sell clones. They have literally told me they don&amp;#39;t sell clones. Although I felt a little offended for my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, he was persistent. He told me to call Flawless and ask them if they sold a 90 watt box mod. I did, and it turned out to in fact be a clone. I paid 140 bucks for a clone. The guy asked what vape shop I went to and I told him. I was at work so that was that. About ten minutes later I got a phone call from my &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; from the vape shop I was so loyal to and spent thousands of dollars at. He started yelling at me asking why I have multiple people calling him &amp;quot;yelling&amp;quot; at him. I explained the situation and asked why he sold me a clone. He said something like &amp;quot;of course it&amp;#39;s a clone, the real one is 300 dollars.&amp;quot; (It doesn&amp;#39;t even exist) and he acted like I was stupid for not knowing that it was obviously a clone and he didn&amp;#39;t deceive me. I was upset. I talked to my vape hero and he laughed and explained nobody yelled at anyone and only he called. They got irritated because he called asking questions they couldn&amp;#39;t answer because they don&amp;#39;t know shit. They ripped me off over and over again and taught me how to do things the absolute wrong way. I was learning everything the wrong way. They sold me fake batteries, fake mods, fake everything besides tanks. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what a difference it was using real batteries and mods. This place also decided to make their own juice and they were dumb enough to not even steep them. They just made it and put it on the shelves the same day. They had to nerve to look me up in Facebook an claim &amp;quot;I OWED THEM MONEY.&amp;quot; They backed off of that claim when I threatened to drive there and make him look me in the eyes and say that. I understand places sell clones. But they tell you. They don&amp;#39;t or shouldn&amp;#39;t sell them at authentic prices and claim they don&amp;#39;t sell clones. This place somehow created a new yelp so their complaints wouldn&amp;#39;t be there too. Their store is doing so well and all the surrounding honest stores end up closing from a lack of business all because this place makes customers think they&amp;#39;re getting a great deal for their fake shit. It makes me so mad to know they&amp;#39;re just ripping people off, misinforming and making a killing off of it. Ugh. I really had to share this with somebody that could understand my frustrations.
