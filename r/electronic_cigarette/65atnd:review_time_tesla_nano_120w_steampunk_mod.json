This is the latest entrant in their Steampunk-styled line of Nano mods. As a huge fan of the Tesla Nano 100w back in the day, I&amp;#39;ve been super eager to get my hands on this bad boy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: This is the best mod I&amp;#39;ve ever owned, and I&amp;#39;m completely in love with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos&lt;/strong&gt; (not great, apologies): &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/pAhQu\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/pAhQu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the steampunk design is subjective here. I personally love it. Unlike the Nano 100w, there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; version (that I know of). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~ COMMENCE GUSHING ~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the deal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an entirely zinc alloy, dual 18650 mod, available in metallic colors. I got &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; which is more of a &amp;quot;bright/faded gunmetal.&amp;quot; They also do silver (which I might pick up as well!), copper (slightly reddish \u2013 looks amazing with coffee/brown attys) and bronze (slightly\u2026 uh, bronze \u2013 best for gold tanks). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;120w max output&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TC modes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;0.9&amp;quot; OLED&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multiple strength modes + user adjustable curve&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multiple memory slots&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;250g in weight&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can take a 25mm atty without any overhang&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026anyway, boring, moving on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Quality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gotta say, the packaging is exceptionally nice. Really beautifully embossed patterning, great construction. Like I really noticed how well done the box was. Tesla&amp;#39;s pretty good in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good lord, this entire thing is one solid block of CNC&amp;#39;d zinc alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels premium as all get-out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a weighty mod for sure, but not uncomfortably so (though I would not call it pocketable), and its weight matches its construction: the entire chassis is milled from a &lt;em&gt;single piece&lt;/em&gt; of alloy, and is very very thick. No seams at all, and &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; exposed screws. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bottom battery door is thick as well, closes nice and tight, and is zinc alloy. There is effectively zero plastic anywhere on the mod. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The steampunk design is beautifully milled and feels great, no sharp edges anywhere. The black (err, gunmetal) is really slick. It&amp;#39;s not super dark, which I appreciate \u2013 it&amp;#39;s a great contrast against SS attys while still feeling it was made for them. Black attys look amazing as well. Even my Royal Gold Super Tank Mini 25mm looks totally baller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In its price range (and frankly, &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; outside of it), it &lt;em&gt;absolutely fucking destroys&lt;/em&gt; the Alien, the Predator, the Battlestar, my Heavyweight, the previous Nano 100w, and any other contenders. Tesla absolutely &lt;em&gt;nailed&lt;/em&gt; build quality here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict: Freaking Insane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2017, so, how&amp;#39;s that 510 pin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Delicious. It&amp;#39;s got a heavily tapered edge that guides your atty right into the 510 threads. Get close and you&amp;#39;ll make contact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 510 connector is nice and deep and springy. Threads are super smooth. I&amp;#39;ve had no problems with any attys, both long and short pins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All my attys \u2013 well, so far, the Kennedy, SZCRDA, CSMT, Icon, Medusa, Alpine \u2013 fit flush. No gap, not even a micron. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict: Super Fine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s cool and/or nifty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the sheer awesomeness of the build quality and the design, the OLED display is bright, and doesn&amp;#39;t bleed light. The OLED itself is right there in the open, there&amp;#39;s no plastic over it, which makes it tack sharp. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The info on the display is damn ample. It&amp;#39;s got both a battery graphic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a percentage readout. Nothing is hidden, everything is on display. The info arrangement makes sense and is obvious. All good things here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an On-Off switch. Seriously. It might not seem like much but it&amp;#39;s freaking great. It makes the mod awesome to build and wick on. No fucking around with multiple fire button presses. Flip the switch, it&amp;#39;s off. Wick. Flip it again, it&amp;#39;s on. &lt;em&gt;Awesome.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The menu system is stupid easy. Three fire button presses and you get an onscreen cursor. Use the +/- buttons to select any item on the screen, hit fire to select it, get a submenu to change it. For example, select the ohms readout, and you can change the ohms. Select the strength display to change the setting or adjust the user curve. And so forth. Super simple, no messing around with a top-level &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; menu, just select shit on the screen and change it. Love this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big, angled fire button is super comfortable and my fingers naturally land right on on it however I hold the mod. The +/- buttons are large and clicky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adjusting watts is always in 0.5w increments. This is &lt;em&gt;so great.&lt;/em&gt; I love how the Alien adjusts intelligently depending on how long you press the +/- buttons, but this is better, and one of the features I loved from the Nano 100w. And of course it&amp;#39;s infinitely better than the adjustment on the Predator. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict: So Many Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How&amp;#39;s it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I don&amp;#39;t do TC, so I can&amp;#39;t speak to it. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wattage mode, holy crap. &lt;em&gt;This thing hits hard.&lt;/em&gt; I mean power delivery feels effectively &lt;em&gt;instant.&lt;/em&gt; I had to cut my power by 10w just to get used to it. Compared to both the Alien and Predator, there&amp;#39;s no contest here \u2013 this thing &lt;em&gt;delivers&lt;/em&gt; power &lt;em&gt;fast.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you switch to the Hard mode, it&amp;#39;ll blow your head off. It&amp;#39;s strong. &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; strong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The user-adjustable strength curve is great. It&amp;#39;s easy to use and works like a damn charm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reads all my coils&amp;#39; ohms perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict: Amazingly Great&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alright, bullshit, there&amp;#39;s gotta be a con or two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fine, fine, here: I can&amp;#39;t use my own drip tips. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay, kidding aside\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire button rattles the &lt;em&gt;tiniest&lt;/em&gt; bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrolling from 100w down to 10w could be a wee bit faster, I guess? It could accelerate faster, specifically. (Don&amp;#39;t worry, it&amp;#39;s way faster than that Arms Race for sure!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. Those are the only cons I can think of. And honestly I didn&amp;#39;t consider them actual cons, or even notice them, until I forced myself to find some cons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Wait. Alright, one more con for &lt;em&gt;some (weird) folks&lt;/em&gt; may be the steampunk styling. It&amp;#39;s not for everyone. But it is extremely well done. It&amp;#39;s gorgeous in person \u2013 photos don&amp;#39;t do the quality and detail justice. (Photos &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; seem to make it much stronger/deeper than it actually is.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict: Nothing Wrong At All&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find it around for between $45-50 USD. Everywhere seems to be sold out at the moment (got mine from ecig.com, and other vendors seem to be getting them slowly), but 3FVape has them as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict: Cheap!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well then.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pros: Literally &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cons: Figuratively &lt;em&gt;nothing.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kid you not, this is hands-down &lt;em&gt;the best mod&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;ve ever gotten my mitts on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It screams premium. It&amp;#39;s affordable. It&amp;#39;s stupidly well built. It performs perfectly. The screen and menu system are fast and easy. The display is sharp and readable. The 510 pin is great. It has a freaking On-Off switch. It&amp;#39;s a solid chunk of well-designed and beautifully crafted metal that, by the way, you can vape with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go buy one.
