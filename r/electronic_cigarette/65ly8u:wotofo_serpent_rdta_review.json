In addition to the Serpent RDTA itself, there is a brief user manual, a little screwdriver, a spare glass tank sleeve, a 510 drip tip, a little chuff cap, plus three heat sealed black baggies containing spare o-rings, post screws, Japanese cotton, and a couple of prebuilt mystery meat fused Clapton coils that are probably stainless steel or nichrome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Serpent RDTA disassembles into seven parts: the top cap, an Ultem 510 drip tip adapter ring, the drip tip, build deck, tank section, glass tank sleeve, and 510 pin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tank section is a baseplate with a post in the middle, and once the glass sleeve is seated into the baseplate, the entire section screws into the bottom of the build deck. The 510 pin is then screwed in, locking both sections together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The build deck is superficially similar in arrangement to the Hop &amp;#39;n&amp;#39; Vape KOF RDTA&amp;#39;s build deck: two massive post walls with a centered bottom airflow port in between. The walls are large clamp terminals, secured by one Phillips head screw each. The clamps have an interesting two-tier, stepped design that allows you to position your coil leads high or low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two wicking holes are located near the edges of the build deck, and seem optimally sized for 2.5-3mm coils.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two closely spaced fill ports are located on the side of the deck, each lined with a soft white grommet. Either one can be used while filling, the other serves as an air relief vent. The fill ports are large enough to accept a dropper tip, and the grommets seal against the inside of the top cap, eliminating one potential source of leakage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the build deck, there is a single rounded off bottom airflow slot. Airflow is adjusted by twisting the entire top cap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, to start off with, I&amp;#39;m having a hard time finding things to complain about, but there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a few issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had high expectations for the flavor due to public praise before mine arrived, but initially felt a bit let down with my usual round wire builds. I went through several test builds with gauges ranging from 28 all the way down to 22, and only the 24 and 22 gauge builds seemed to start providing decent flavor. I must&amp;#39;ve said &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s the beef?&amp;quot; a dozen times when experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Serpent really shines with Clapton or fused Clapton builds, however. The coils that came with it are quite nice, and similar builds perform well. My current build is a 5-wrap 24k/34k Clapton with a 3mm ID, clocking in at 0.54 ohms, and it makes for a pleasant vape on my Sage V2 mechanical mod, but not as good as the one provided by the supplied coils.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The build deck is very easy to work with, although I wish the clamps were spring-loaded because my clumsy bratwurst fingers don&amp;#39;t make fiddling with tiny moving parts easy. I also dislike how cockeyed the clamps get when you screw them down on thick wire, and it makes me worry that the terminal screws will eventually be damaged or sheared off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The airflow, even when fully open, gives me a smoothly restricted lung hit that I like. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel very turbulent or whooshy, it&amp;#39;s just smooth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I like the most is how straightforward filling it is. I don&amp;#39;t even have to take the top cap all the way off, I can just twist it off a bit to expose the fill holes and stick my needle bottle tip in. This is a refreshing change of pace from having to remove entire top caps or drip tips, especially when refilling it in the passenger seat of a moving vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aesthetically, the curvy, rounded shape appeals to me because it&amp;#39;s a departure from the typical &amp;quot;squared-off tube with a smaller squared-off tube coming out of the top&amp;quot; approach that a lot of designs take. I get that that&amp;#39;s the normal geometry to expect given the function of an atomizer, but I always like it when manufacturers try something a bit more daring. Even if it&amp;#39;s just a tapered or voluptuous drip tip, that&amp;#39;s enough to get bonus points for style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Serpent RDTA just looks plain classy on a matching tube mod, and goes really well with curvy mods like the iStick Pico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a single coil RDTA, the Serpent RDTA is a good option. It&amp;#39;s inexpensive, easy to build on, vapes nicely, and let&amp;#39;s be frank, I was scraping the bottom of the barrel looking for negatives, found very little to make fun of, and nothing to give Wotofo a proper Greybush roasting for. They just did a really good job this time, and it&amp;#39;s a regular in my rotation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm clearing another review from my backlog.
