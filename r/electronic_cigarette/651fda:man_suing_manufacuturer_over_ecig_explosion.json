Thermal energy builds, and you have 3-5 seconds before the boom boom.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg8s4xo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174413.0, "created_utc": 1492145613.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651fda", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651fda", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651fda", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74rql", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wishbern", "parent_id": "t1_dg72w42", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fucking Skynet, bro...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fucking Skynet, bro...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg74rql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492085906.0, "created_utc": 1492057106.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg72w42", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Turbonomics", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ypes", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I didn't even know we had a bot like this", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even know we had a bot like this&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg72w42", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492083100.0, "created_utc": 1492054300.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ypes", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LawBot2016", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ras3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The parent mentioned [**Ambulance Chaser**](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Ambulance_Chaser).
