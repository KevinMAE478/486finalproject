Both are very welcome additions. The changes are small, but actually add alot to the overall expierence.  The Phillips heads make building much easier, and the divider does a great job at preventing leaks while in your pocket or while its on its side.  It takes marginally longer to wick, but greatly reduces the possibility of leaking and makes sure that the wicks are correctly pointed downwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out again how cool the Augvape logo cutouts are inside of the base.  They not only look cool, but some liquid clings to the webbing in them and passes the liquid up to your wicks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deck/Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Production Deck: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/BFkwKY8r.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/BFkwKY8r.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original Deck: &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/X2mLCm8.jpg\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/X2mLCm8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to replicate the build I used in my original review, so I did 22g spaced again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deck is the same as far as I can tell, except for the screws.  The new screws are Phillips head and seem to be slightly larger at the bottom to better fill the terminals.  Like I said in my original review, this deck is excessively large and hungers for huge coils.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After throwing a ton of builds at this thing, I&amp;#39;ve developed a love hate relationship with building it.  With really thick/wide builds, it&amp;#39;s awesome and you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about fitting anything.  When using plain round wire or small gauge claptons, my brain feels like its going to explode while getting the wires to make a solid with the screws.

Once you get past building, pretty much everything about this RDTA is enjoyable.  The wicking can easily keep up with high wattages, the flavor is excellent, and the center filling is very well designed.  The center filling is so well designed that I still look forward to when I get to put juice in it, even after using it for this long.  It&amp;#39;s just cool.
