Wasn&amp;#39;t interested in unregulated, single 18650, 26650, lipo, any of those. Just a dual 18650 with a DNA board. When I found out Lost Vape was coming out with one, I looked up everything I could. Waited months for it to come out and ordered it as soon as I saw it from an American retailer. I got mine at Element Vape with a pair of VTC6s so I paid just under $175. Ordered on a Thursday morning, arrived on Saturday via Priority Mail. Note that I live in San Diego and Element Vape is in LA, so that&amp;#39;s not a real distance to travel. Anyway onto the mod.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My box came shrink wrapped. It was in a regular priority mail envelope. The ones lined with bubble wrap even though you know an actual fall would probably do some kind of damage. No damage to the box&amp;#39;s exterior which is basically a black Triade box. Like other people have noted, the inner lining where the mod sits was messed up a bit. Plastic was cracked but it didn&amp;#39;t mess up the mod so I can forgive that. Maybe it&amp;#39;s me but the material for the box is nicer than the one the Triade came in. It&amp;#39;s softer but hey, a box is a box, you&amp;#39;re not gonna vape a box so it&amp;#39;s not something to gush over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-Mod&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-USB-A to Micro-USB cable&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-11ml bottle&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instruction Manuals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only thing I (and a lot of other people) can complain about is the lack of a second bottle. Other thing that&amp;#39;s just nitpicky is the USB cable. It&amp;#39;s too short and fragile. I used the one that came with my Triade to charge my Halcyon from a battery bank and that&amp;#39;s the only charge it ever made. Why? The plastic part of the Micro-USB section came apart. We all probably have more cables than we need, but even I can say that I don&amp;#39;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gotta get it off my chest first. I HATE the firing button on it. It&amp;#39;s too mushy, requires too much force to press, and could just come off the body a hair higher. The up/down buttons feel much more solid and have a more positive click to them. I just hope it doesn&amp;#39;t suffer the same fate as my Triade, as the firing button on that likes to stick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not much bigger than the Triade and it feels good in my hands. There&amp;#39;s quite a bit of heft to it with batteries in but I prefer it since I feel like it makes for a sturdier mod. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care too much for the bare metal look, I&amp;#39;d much rather it be painted the same color as the rest of the mod or be more matte but it makes it unique and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;ll stop caring or just grow to like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The battery door isn&amp;#39;t too strong nor is it too weak. It takes a lot less effort than the Triade because the notches to lock the bottom aren&amp;#39;t there but it&amp;#39;s not like any violent shaking will remove it. A drop will, but I don&amp;#39;t want to test that and dropping my mods is the last thing I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cutout for the squonk bottle is something I&amp;#39;m still determining whether or not I like. On one hand, it shows the bottle and just that, a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; cut out. But on the other hand, I feel like it could show just a bit more so you have more of the bottle to push down. You don&amp;#39;t have to use another hand to squeeze the bottle and the chamfer helps but I feel like it could just show a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I opened it up, there was what I assume was the residue of VG or PG inside the bottle. Little droplets that I washed out with water but still enough to make a stickler pissed off. Same for the 510, little drop of VG/PG but something you can clean up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bottle is nice and soft for me. A lot softer than the Halcyon, but probably not as much as those Italian super soft bottles. The tubing is real tight and makes a good seal but I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;ll loosen up a bit over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if Lost Vape set up the board with the right case settings, but I&amp;#39;m trusting that they did. The presets on there are decent. Option for straight wattage, Ni200 with different preheat levels, SS316, Titanium, all the standard stuff. Not much to say since DNA75/200/250 are basically the same when it comes to layout on the mod and on EScribe. I just did my usual tweaks to change brightness, what info shows on the screen, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using my Hadaly on there with 26N80/36K 6/5 wrap and compared to my Halcyon, the Drone reads .03 lower. (0.61 vs 0.64). That might just be the 510 on the Halcyon but it doesn&amp;#39;t make too big of a difference for the way I vape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it worth it? To me, yes. Until something like a 1600mAh lipo squonker comes out with a body that doesn&amp;#39;t feel like a massive brick in my hands comes out, this will probably my daily mod as long as I squonk. If there was a way to have the board max out at 60W to allow the batteries to be run in parallel, I&amp;#39;d love that and I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t buy another squonk mod for a long time.
