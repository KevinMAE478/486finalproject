Both happened this week, so I decided to clear it from my backlog along with the Wotofo Serpent RDTA review that I posted earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here&amp;#39;s the Odis O-Genny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odis O-Genny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Odis O-Genny is a 22mm RDTA with a 3 mL juice capacity, and can be built in single or dual coil configurations, and has both single-coil and dual-coil airflow options. It shares many design elements with the Odis O-Atty, and an optional squonk conversion kit is available for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I ordered it, I already knew that I was going to preorder a Lost Vape Drone BF squonker at the earliest opportunity, and I wanted something nice to pair with it. Since the O-Genny was a squonkable single coil flavor RDTA that could also be built with dual coils if I wanted, it seemed like just the thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I ordered one plus the squonk conversion kit directly from Odis, after trying out a $10 clone of the O-Atty for a couple weeks to make sure that I&amp;#39;d like the basic design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/front.jpeg\"&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/bottom.jpeg\"&gt;Bottom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/disassembled.jpeg\"&gt;Disassembled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/deck.jpeg\"&gt;Build deck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/fillports.jpeg\"&gt;Fill ports on build deck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/fillplugs.jpeg\"&gt;Fill plugs on barrel sleeve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/barrel-on.jpeg\"&gt;Fill plugs in action&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/airflow1.jpeg\"&gt;Airflow controller front&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/airflow2.jpeg\"&gt;Airflow controller back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/build.jpeg\"&gt;Single coil layout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/on-drone.jpeg\"&gt;On Drone BF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/in-hand.jpeg\"&gt;In hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The O-Genny comes in a thick, sturdy two-part black box with foam padding inserts. In addition to the O-Genny itself, a spare tank glass, screwdriver, spare post screws, two Ultem block plates for single and dual coil wicking, and spare o-rings are included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The O-Genny disassembles into nine pieces: the bottom baseplate and post assembly, a glass tank sleeve, the build deck, an Ultem wicking channel block plate, the barrel sleeve, a Delrin top cap airflow controller, a 510 drip tip, a long 510 positive pin, and the insulator sleeve for the 510 pin. Technically, it&amp;#39;s eleven pieces, as removing the 510 positive pin will also release the positive terminal and its insulator from the build deck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The build deck is a slightly refined version of the O-Atty build deck. The positive and negative terminals use a screw clamp system, and the clamp plates on the O-Atty build deck are chamfered to make inserting coil leads a bit easier. A second set of shorter screws is included for people who don&amp;#39;t want to use the clamp plates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The airflow channel posts are also chamfered and inset a bit to make room for the adjustable Delrin airflow controller top cap. It uses the same downwards-directed airflow system as the O-Atty. The airflow controller has three teardrop slots arranged so that two are on one side, and one on the other. The barrel sleeve itself has two opposed teardrop slots. Twisting the top cap slightly allows you to shut off the airflow on one side entirely if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four closely spaced wicking holes are drilled into the base of the build deck, and are slightly larger than 2.5mm in diameter. Next to two of the wicking holes, there is a small slot-shaped fill port.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The barrel sleeve of the cap has a pair of fill plugs milled into it, which locks the cap in place when seated on the build deck. Only the top airflow controller cap turns freely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Setting up the O-Genny for single or dual coil use is done with a round Ultem block plate that sockets into the underside of the build deck before screwing the build deck and baseplate/post assembly together. The dual coil block plate exposes all four wicking holes, while the single coil block plate closes off two wicking holes. There are slots and peg holes to aid registration, but it&amp;#39;s easy to accidentally install the block plates backwards and end up covering up the fill ports too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tank holds 3 mL of juice, and Odis are planning to release a 2mL conversion kit for TPD markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The O-Genny, at first, was one of those purchases that made me question my own sanity and contemplate writing a polite email to Odis Collection and Design suggesting that an entry-level career in the fast food industry would be a better match for their talents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first nasty surprise was that because of the slight differences between the O-Atty and O-Genny, builds that run great in an O-Atty will either not fit in an O-Genny or will run hotter, because the O-Genny is basically a slammed O-Atty. So, you&amp;#39;re gonna have to get to know a new atomizer all over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching me build dual coils in an O-Genny is a lot like watching a severely inebriated person trying to fuck a department store mannequin. It starts out funny, then becomes awkward, and then downright painful, and also involves a lot of frustrated grunting and repetitive muttering of &amp;quot;just gotta find the screw hole...just gotta find the screw hole...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Single coil builds are not difficult in comparison. Single coils are positioned in a diagonal orientation, and should be level with the bottom of the airflow post slopes. The size of the wicking holes limits your effective coil interior diameter to 2.5mm. While you could build a fat coil and split its wick into 4 tails like with a NaRDA or O-Atty, the positive post and 510 pin protrude upwards far enough that you can&amp;#39;t really sink a fat coil as low as you ought to. This isn&amp;#39;t the case with the O-Atty, which has more room to sink the coil lower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dual coil builds are essentially just a pair of coils side-by-side, oriented straight across, but the amount of fiddling and fuckery it takes to get them lined up without choking off the wick holes, and then actually trying to wick them...let&amp;#39;s just say that the reward generally isn&amp;#39;t in proportion to the effort unless you&amp;#39;re a fan of mouth lava or radioactively hot and wispy vapes, so I stick with single coil builds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting anything remotely resembling flavor out of a single coil build was quite the challenge. In a fit of consternation over the fact that my O-Genny was getting its ass handed to it by a $25 Chinese atomizer like a handicapped toddler in a MMA cage fight, I emailed Odis and asked them exactly how they build it for flavor themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odis&amp;#39;s recommendation was a single 28/36 fused Clapton coming out to around 0.45 ohms, but I found that to be a bit underwhelming still. Working my way through the various spools of premade Clapton wire in my stash, I found that a 5-wrap 24k/36k Clapton with an ID of 2.5mm, at around 34 watts, seemed to strike the best balance between flavor and heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found adjusting the airflow to be unnecessarily frustrating. For whatever reason, Odis decided to ship the O-Genny with a black Delrin airflow controller top cap instead of stainless steel or Ultem. Unless you&amp;#39;re someplace with very good lighting, you can&amp;#39;t really tell the difference between black Delrin and...a dark hole. It really should have been Ultem or stainless steel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to adjust the airflow directly under my desk lamp and then hope I don&amp;#39;t accidentally twist it out of the optimal alignment somehow. This is ridiculous and makes me wonder if Odis even tests their shit under real-world conditions, or if they just went &amp;quot;Whatever, bro, this looks cool, ship it!&amp;quot; and then went out for hipster beers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To compound matters further, the fact that it has adjustable airflow is a joke in and of itself. The 2 airflow holes on the barrel sleeve are tiny teardrops, and there is very little room for adjustment. So, in practical usage, you&amp;#39;re limited to having 2 holes fully open or 1 hole fully open and the other fully closed. Closing off one air hole has no real effect on flavor unless you&amp;#39;re using a tiny MTL coil, and you&amp;#39;re not getting a decent MTL vape off of this thing because even a single hole is too airy for MTL. Sure, you could close it halfway, but it&amp;#39;s still not great. They really should have added detents or stops for the airflow adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Refilling this thing is also a bit on the stupid side. Odis had the clever idea of integrating fill plugs into the barrel sleeve that click into the fill holes on the build deck. Unfortunately, those fill plugs are tiny slots. Tiny. Really tiny. In practice, this idea is about as clever as the idea of a condom that&amp;#39;s open at both ends to facilitate insertion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dropper bottle? Sure, if your idea of a good time is wiping up the 3mL of blooped runoff that&amp;#39;s all over your O-Genny, your mod, your hands, and your soon-to-be-ex-significant-other&amp;#39;s Pomeranian. It&amp;#39;s like trying to fill a shot glass from a bucket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unicorn bottle, Innokin U-Can or Coil Master SEB? If you love the titillating risk associated with slot machines or video poker, go right ahead. You&amp;#39;ll either successfully fill it up, probably at least once, or more likely, you&amp;#39;ll end up wiping up the 3mL of blooped runoff that&amp;#39;s now all over your O-Genny, your mod, your hands, and your soon-to-be-ex-significant-other&amp;#39;s Pomeranian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope, you need a needle-tip bottle that you can stab through the microscopic fill port like a hungry hummingbird shoving its beak into a juicy steel flower. Fortunately for me, I happen to own needle tip bottles, and I was planning to squonk it in the first place anyway, so it&amp;#39;s not that much of an issue. But as a design decision, it&amp;#39;s...not well-executed. These ports should have been round and at least large enough for an unicorn bottle tip to seal into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, what happens is that after you fill it up the first time, the other fill port gets clogged with juice, so air doesn&amp;#39;t exit through it like it&amp;#39;s supposed to, and the back pressure forces the juice up through other paths of lesser resistance...like the wick holes and the hole you were filling through. Do people not test these things in the real world before putting them on the market? Jeez Louise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, how does it squonk? Fairly well, actually! The squonk conversion kit is pretty straightforward, and consists of an alternate baseplate/post that&amp;#39;s vented for squonking, a vented positive insulator sleeve, and a partially vented 510 pin. You replace the normal baseplate/post assembly and 510 pin with these conversion parts, and it&amp;#39;s ready to squonk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/squonk1.jpeg\"&gt;Squonk kit pieces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/squonk2.jpeg\"&gt;Squonk pin, bottom view&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.greybush.com/redditphotos/odis-o-genny/squonk3.jpeg\"&gt;Squonk kit assembled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a squonker, the practical shortcomings of the O-Genny mostly disappear, and it seems to be in its own element finally. Once you get a good flavor build worked out and install it on your favorite squonker, it&amp;#39;s like a whole new device.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the first video reviews rolled out and I saw how large the Drone BF was in people&amp;#39;s hands, I started worrying that my cute little O-Genny would look like a micropenis on a hulking bodybuilder. Fortunately, that didn&amp;#39;t turn out to be the case once my Drone BF arrived, but I&amp;#39;ve ordered a beauty ring for it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, is the O-Genny worth buying? I can&amp;#39;t really recommend it unless its shortcomings as a non-squonker are unfucked &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re going to exclusively squonk this thing. Even then, the price is still steep for what you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start by taking the barrel sleeve and airflow controller top cap and depositing them in the nearest wastebasket. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#39;s replace them with an O-Atty 510 slam cap, which will let us actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the results of airflow adjustment more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, you also need the Ultem fill plug inserts, so let&amp;#39;s add those to the cart too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The alternate O-Atty caps don&amp;#39;t include drip tips, so let&amp;#39;s add one to the cart too. Or fish the one you just tossed out of the wastebasket and save $15.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you&amp;#39;re now the proud owner of a $235 Frankenatomizer!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know what else you could do with $235? You could buy a Serpent RDTA for single coil and a Cthulhu Gaia RDTA for dual coil. You can squonk the Gaia. If you want a single coil squonk RDA, there are plenty of cheaper, good options out there. And you&amp;#39;d still have money left over to take your special someone out for a nice dinner. Or buy a new squonk mod, whatever floats your boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have your heart set on a single coil squonking RDTA...well, I guess the O-Genny is the one viable option at the time of this review, but it&amp;#39;s still very difficult for me to wholeheartedly recommend buying it when there are equal, better, and much cheaper single coil RDTA options out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This one has been in a holding pattern awaiting the arrival of my Lost Vape Drone BF and review photos.

Even then, the price is still steep for what you get.\n\nLet's start by taking the barrel sleeve and airflow controller top cap and depositing them in the nearest wastebasket. \n\nNext, let's replace them with an O-Atty 510 slam cap, which will let us actually *see* the results of airflow adjustment more clearly. \n\nOh, wait, you also need the Ultem fill plug inserts, so let's add those to the cart too. \n\nThe alternate O-Atty caps don't include drip tips, so let's add one to the cart too. Or fish the one you just tossed out of the wastebasket and save $15.\n\nCongratulations, you're now the proud owner of a $235 Frankenatomizer!\n\nYou know what else you could do with $235? You could buy a Serpent RDTA for single coil and a Cthulhu Gaia RDTA for dual coil. You can squonk the Gaia. If you want a single coil squonk RDA, there are plenty of cheaper, good options out there. And you'd still have money left over to take your special someone out for a nice dinner. Or buy a new squonk mod, whatever floats your boat.\n\nIf you have your heart set on a single coil squonking RDTA...well, I guess the O-Genny is the one viable option at the time of this review, but it's still very difficult for me to wholeheartedly recommend buying it when there are equal, better, and much cheaper single coil RDTA options out there.
