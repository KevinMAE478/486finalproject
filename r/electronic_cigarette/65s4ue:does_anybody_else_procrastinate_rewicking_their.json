In my Kayfun v5 I only use BlueDot and B-X and it&amp;#39;s literally been months since I&amp;#39;ve changed the  cotton, let alone cleaned and dry burned the clapton I have in it.  Just checked it and the cotton and coil are still clean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum, If I use some &amp;#39;premium&amp;#39; crap that&amp;#39;s loaded with sweetener and my coils and cotton are black in a day or two and is just generally nasty, which forces me to rewick at a minimum, sometimes just chuck the coil and rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;ve found the coil types that I like, I&amp;#39;m settled in and only rebuild when I have to.  Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll get in the mood and rebuild just for the hell of it, but for the most part if I&amp;#39;m rebuilding it&amp;#39;s because the coil has been used for too long and too many dry burn cycles or it&amp;#39;s just too gunked up from sweetener and I don&amp;#39;t even bother trying to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dgds7gs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478244.0, "created_utc": 1492449444.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ue", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdshmi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Elek93", "parent_id": "t3_65s4ue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have over 15 rta/rda/rdta that are always coiled and wicked up.
