I like not having to replace the coil often (usually only if I change flavors that are not complimentary or menthol) Are there any devices to buy that have coils that are more widely used and also maybe slightly more sophisticated device(endura t22 feels really weak)? I&amp;#39;m not looking to be the king of cloud city, just something to help me stop smoking. or should I just stick with endura t22? only flaw I have with it is minor leaks and sometimes when I change a coil it takes awhile for it to stop popping with a new juice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg9dq7w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216864.0, "created_utc": 1492188064.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bqav", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bqav", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9l9cz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sc0lm00", "parent_id": "t1_dg9jqae", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If they're the same gauge then the twisted will take longer.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re the same gauge then the twisted will take longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg9l9cz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492225679.0, "created_utc": 1492196879.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bqav", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9lmt0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pevinsghost", "parent_id": "t1_dg9jqae", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If they're the same number of wraps, same gauge, same id, etc, they can't be the same resistance.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re the same number of wraps, same gauge, same id, etc, they can&amp;#39;t be the same resistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg9lmt0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492226127.0, "created_utc": 1492197327.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bqav", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tcv7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ustutt", "parent_id": "t1_dg9jqae", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "More coil mass = more ramp up time at the same wattages.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More coil mass = more ramp up time at the same wattages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "name": "t1_dg9tcv7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492235620.0, "created_utc": 1492206820.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9jqae", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lvl5Loki", "parent_id": "t3_65bqav", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronic_cigarette", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ramp up time\n\nSo lets say I have a .1 round wire build, single strand, and a .1 twisted wire build, 2 or more strands.\n\nWill the twisted wire take longer to glow?
