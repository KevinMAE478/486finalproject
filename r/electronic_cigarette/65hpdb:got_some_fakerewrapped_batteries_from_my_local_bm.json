They came in the little cardboard sleeves and they tossed in a bunch of cases so good deal so far. I get home, start putting them on the chargers to see where they are at, charge them etc and they just look odd, the printing on the sides don&amp;#39;t line up like on my old ones, the positive side/protector appears to be glued down so I cut it open to make sure and yes a fake/rewrap. Proceed to open all, not cut the wraps off all of them but a few to check and awesome.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take them back to the store and ask WTF? How would they not know they are fakes. They tell me to come back tomorrow when the owner is there and it will all be straightened out. Whatever it happens but how would they not know they got a batch of fakes I wonder? I check their Facebook and a week ago they post a pic of 2 cases saying &amp;quot;New battery shipment! Come replace your old with new and be safe&amp;quot; and advertise the 30Q at $8. Then magically this week they push hard to dump all their stock? Seems shady and I decide not to go there anymore but let&amp;#39;s get a refund before I tell them how fucked that is to sell fakes to people who wouldn&amp;#39;t know how to spot them or know the dangers of it because who knows WTF those cells actually were. Skip forward to today I go back in and talk to the owner who tells me that I never even bought batteries yesterday at their store. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now the fun starts because I left the fucked batteries there not thinking any issue would ever arise, I know the usual clerk well enough from going in there and talking about coil builds juices etc and have spent maybe $250 in the past 4-5 months there. Hell I would have taken store credit and grabbed some Halo juice or a mod or whatever, sure I would have never went there again but why make a huge issue over something that may be an error. So I just go so I didn&amp;#39;t buy anything here yesterday? He says nope, open my phone and show a credit charge to the store and then he claims I never made that purchase. So I go ohh okay I&amp;#39;ll just report it as fraudulent right here then and I can go ahead and tell my bank that you the owner have verified I never made any purchases at this store ever? He agrees so I go great I can just report all of these weird charges to this store going back forever since I&amp;#39;ve never purchased anything here. Thanks man and walk out. Also their battery sale has mysteriously disappeared from Facebook and no more sign in the store. Good times &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do I do here? I can&amp;#39;t really report it as fraudulent because I did make the purchases however they have the batteries, etc now.
