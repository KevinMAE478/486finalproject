had sold all my high end sub ohm devices, DNA mods and mechanical mods etc, but I couldn&amp;#39;t go without a vape of course so I took the money from my sale and went down to the local shop and purchased the following a Nautilus X and a Epetite DNA60  as I knew money was gonna be tight so I wanna be easy on juice consumption, took hit home, filled it up and on the first puff I was in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tight MTL draw oh my goodness, the very warm snap and sting  of the vapor hitting my throat at 15w, not blowing a huge cloud but still being very satisfied with the
