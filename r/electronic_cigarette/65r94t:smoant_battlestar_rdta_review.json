[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey ECR!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/RmrWxY3.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/RmrWxY3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I will be reviewing the &lt;a href=\"http://smoant.com/battlestar-rdta-atomizer/index.html\"&gt;Smoant Battlestar RDTA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Battlestar RDTA is a 24.5mm genesis-style atomizer with a velocity deck and a 4.5ml capacity. It also uses a side-filling port for refilling, uses quartz glass, and has a gold plated 510 connection for better conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Package Contents:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/DjeEaSw.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/DjeEaSw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Package includes: Battlestar RDTA, Spare Glass, Tiny Blue Screw Driver, Extra Screws/O-rings, User Manual &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully Disassembled:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/t378FBQ.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/t378FBQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest the machining quality leaves a little to be desired.  I was expecting the threading and tolerances to be a bit smoother because of the quality of their mods.  For a $20 RDTA it&amp;#39;s not bad at all, but sometimes it can be difficult to thread the ring that goes around the deck on and the post screws catch a little bit while screwing in/unscrewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deck/Building:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deck Closeup:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/w1QcGu1.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/w1QcGu1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Battlestar has an awesome deck.  Really simple, and just works well.  It is very accommodating for thicker builds, but can also make a solid connection with thin round wire.  It uses slotted screws also! Huge plus in my book&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I Build and Wick:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cxijuqK.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/cxijuqK.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 3mm ID 2x26 + 38 NI80 fused clapton.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the screws go in laterally, it will twist up the legs of wider builds.  Not really much of an issue to me, but if you are trying to go super wide it could create an issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually really like this deck.  It plays well with larger builds, but also accepts small round wire with ease.  I used 26g for a build and had no problems, and have also thrown some big fused claptons into it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I love that they used slotted screws for the post holes, the threading is a little rough.  I can screw the screws in no problem, but the machining isn&amp;#39;t the smoothest and can catch a little. This might just be mine, but it&amp;#39;s worth pointing out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/O6zPZO7.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/O6zPZO7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Filling is easy and the port can fit any dropper or unicorn bottle.  Just pop off the cap, and dump the juice in.  Its big enough that you don&amp;#39;t have to wait for air to escape, so the whole process can be done in like 3 seconds.  Nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airflow/Flavor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFC Closeup:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/WGx4lye.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/WGx4lye.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delrin AFC Adjustment Cap:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/lJGhuco.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/lJGhuco.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To adjust the airflow, it uses a spin-able delrin inner sleeve.  I wish the inner sleeve was made from stainless steel, because I&amp;#39;m kinda uncomfortable with delrin being the closest thing to my coils.  If your coils are slightly too wide or it gets too hot in there, there&amp;#39;s a chance of inhaling burnt delrin.  I&amp;#39;m...not a fan of that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at the &amp;quot;Delrin AFC Adjustment Cap&amp;quot; picture above, the cap has one setting with just two tiny holes.  While using this setting at around 55W gives a nice restricted lung hit with some pretty dense flavor. The top cap is domed, which helps with flavor production also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wide open it just gives the flavor of hot vapor, and is completely unrestricted.  It can handle 100W+ wide open, but that isn&amp;#39;t really my speed.  I prefer to use it mostly shut off around 60-70W, or with only the two tiny holes open around 50-60W&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance/My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about this RDTA is the deck.  It&amp;#39;s got a nice wide velocity-style with slotted screws. Also, the deck easily accommodates round wire or thicker  complicated builds, so it&amp;#39;s nice to be able to throw a simple build in it when I&amp;#39;m in a hurry or just want something basic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flavor it gives is not outstanding, but it can produce some nice notes with a good build and using the small 2 hole setting.  It is a 24.5mm RDTA, so it makes sense that flavor will not be it&amp;#39;s strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also want to mention that this is the most leak-proof RDTA I have ever used.  It fell over on my desk, sat there with a full tank for like 20 minutes, and not a drop came out.  Ever since I noticed that, I&amp;#39;ve been completely comfortable throwing it in my pocket or bag knowing it&amp;#39;s not going to drain itself into my clothes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/RTP2bOb.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/RTP2bOb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Pros&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Cons&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Great velocity deck with slotted screws&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Delrin inner chamber&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.5ml capacity&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;No 510 driptip adapter, also driptip is not Goon sized&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Works well with simple round wire and thicker builds&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Threading on post screws and deck is a little rough&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Very leak resistant&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Price ($20!)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Lots of extras&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, for $20 it&amp;#39;s a solid atomizer.  I really like the deck, the flavor is decent, and it performs well.  However I am not a fan of the delrin inner chamber, and really would prefer that it was made out of stainless steel or something that won&amp;#39;t melt.  If you&amp;#39;re looking for an RDTA that&amp;#39;s easy to build at a low price point, I&amp;#39;d check it out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If interested, I found it on Fasttech here for $20.43:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.fasttech.com/product/7259300-authentic-smoant-battlestar-rdta-rebuildable\"&gt;https://www.fasttech.com/product/7259300-authentic-smoant-battlestar-rdta-rebuildable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!
