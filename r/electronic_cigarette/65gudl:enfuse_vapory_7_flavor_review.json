I am one of the winners of Enfuse Vapory&amp;#39;s last giveaway.

I have not heard of a flavor profile utilizing candied yams with cream. This flavors name says a lot. It is a savory flavor with a hint of sweetness. It finishes with a creamy exhale. I did not know what to expect from this flavor. It&amp;#39;s like vaping a Thanksgiving dish. Definitely a flavor I would recommend anyone to try once, and it&amp;#39;s something I would buy for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday Morning Pebbles:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the next on my list of interest. I love cereal, absolutely love. Being a diabetic I tend to try to stay away from sugary things. This one tastes very close to a mouth full of fruity pebbles with a very subtle milkiness on the exhale. The fruit taste in this is all blended together and it&amp;#39;s not too sweet. This flavor is very spot on. Another flavor I would totally recommend anyone who loves cereal to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ebony &amp;amp; Ivory:&lt;/strong&gt; This flavor is a bit of a mixed bag for me. It does taste of Cookies and Creme but it is not that strong. The inhale and exhale are very close to the same taste. I don&amp;#39;t have a lot to say about this one. I feel it could be a bit sweeter. Lastly, the only complaint with this one is the flavor is kind of muted but still good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juicy:&lt;/strong&gt; Wooooweeee I love peach flavors, and I feel it is a hard one to get right. Enfuse Vapory did a fantastic job on this one. I expected it to taste like Dole canned Peaches, so super sweet. No, that is not the case, it tastes just like a fresh peach. I don&amp;#39;t usually get single flavor liquids. I like complex profiles, but I can see this juice finding it&amp;#39;s way into my rotation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red, White, &amp;amp; Chew:&lt;/strong&gt; This flavor is reminiscent of The Cobra by Om Vapors. It is a strawberry yogurt and rice crispy bar flavor. The more I vape this one, the more I am liking it. The inhale is a straight up fresh strawberry note, when exhaled its slightly creamy. Here&amp;#39;s the kicker after vaping it I have an awesome strawberry shortcake kind of aftertaste. I don&amp;#39;t usually like strawberry juices but this one is pretty damn good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bliss:&lt;/strong&gt; I have never had Lychee before and I am not quite sure how to describe it. The other flavor present is mango, and this one is the main flavor of this mix. I would describe this flavor as tropical (duh mango.) To be honest this reminds me of one of the diet V8 juices I drink occasionally, which happens to be the tropical one. This liquid I feel will grow on me over time, it would be great to mix it up for me considering I am mainly into dessert and savory flavors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, I do have to say that these guys and or gals who designed and mixed these liquis know what they are doing. I am thankful they hosted that giveaway and so here is my thanks. Hope you all enjoyed this review!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait wait waitt... You are all probably thinking &amp;quot;You said there was 7 liquids!&amp;quot; Well, there is. Fine, I will continue. So here goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cream of the Crop:&lt;/strong&gt; This flavor tasted like a fucking ash tray. There was a reason I decided to drip this liquid last. This is in no means a cut at the company, but who in the hell thinks vaping ash tray flavored juice is a desirable thing? All jokes aside, this juice just wasn&amp;#39;t for me. This stuff is for the people who enjoy the taste of cigarettes and are trying to quit. Well I am much past the quitting phase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like these juices were all fairly good in each of their own right. My favorite flavors were between Savor and Saturday Morning Pebbles. It wasn&amp;#39;t a hard choice, I was sure before I even started vaping them, even before I got them what ones I would love the most. I can say I would order from these guys again.
