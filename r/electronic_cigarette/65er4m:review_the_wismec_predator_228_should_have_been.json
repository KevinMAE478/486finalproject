After &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/6dR6bBB\"&gt;2001 puffs&lt;/a&gt; and almost 2 weeks of use, I&amp;#39;ve complied a very in depth, hard hitting review of this mod.  &lt;strong&gt;SPOILER&lt;/strong&gt; There are some serious issues with this mod that need to be addressed quickly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Specs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dimensions: 43.6mm length X 29mm width X 86.7mm Height&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spring-loaded 510&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dual 18650 with on board 2a charging&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Output types: Power Mode (1-228 watts), Temp Control for Ni, Ti, SS, TCR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resistance Range: Power Mode - .1-3.5ohms; TC Mode - .05-1.5ohms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Temp Range: 200-600\u00b0F / 100-315\u00b0C&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max Charging: 2A&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My First Impressions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was VERY excited about getting this mod.  I loved all of the promo shots and initial reviews I saw of this mod (specifically the one from Matt @ Suck My Mod).  It had a great looking form factor and seemed very sturdy.  It&amp;#39;s a very small dual 18650 mod for sure.  It fits well in the palm and is easily &amp;#39;pocketable&amp;#39;.  The finish seems pretty solid, scree looks great, 510 looks well formed into the mod.  First impression: great looking device for the price.  One can choose for 4 different color schemes, and I went with the Black on Black color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I&amp;#39;m using the device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I figured I&amp;#39;d just give a little blurb about what I&amp;#39;m using this device with and so on.  I&amp;#39;ve paired it with the Cthulhu GAIA RDTA.  We&amp;#39;ve got a nice fresh pair tri-core 26ga staple coils with 36ga on top, fresh Puffs organic Japanese cotton wick all crammed in and ready for some good ol&amp;#39; fashioned flavor!  I will say, &lt;strong&gt;I am using this in POWER MODE ONLY, I AM NOT TESTING THIS MOD FOR ANY TC/TCR USEABILITY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And awaaaaaaaaaay weee goooooooo!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 1 week of use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only swapped my cotton out 1 time at the 1 week mark, just to make sure everything would stay consistent.  Around this time I started getting the &lt;strong&gt;ATOMIZER LOW&lt;/strong&gt; warning on intermittently.  I cleaned the contacts and it still happened but it became a much smaller occurrence.  I did notice that the side panel (the one opposite of the firing switch) is working loose.  While it may not look as noticeable from afar, just &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/JWby0g1.jpg\"&gt;look here up close and personal&lt;/a&gt; and you can see the gap getting wider.  The damn thing rattles like nickles in a can.  The resistance constantly jumps as well.  I am willing to accept a .02ohm jump one way or the other for the multicore coils ramping up but we&amp;#39;re talking a full .1 to .15ohm jump.  To be thorough, I tested the resistance on a stand alone meter and it read .26-.27 no matter what.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 2 weeks of use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok so I&amp;#39;ve come across some major issues with this mod that are concerning.  First, let&amp;#39;s start with the major problem everyone seems to be having... Resistance fluxuation.  Holy crap, this thing is finnicky at best.  It&amp;#39;s happening constantly now and the side panel is rattling, and the paint is worn in TWO PLACES where I hold it.  &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/uk5n0zz\"&gt;These&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/0H3uXdQ\"&gt;not scratches&lt;/a&gt;, they are spots where the paint has actually worn off.  After 2 weeks, the paint is rubbing off.  Great. &lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt; And the damn side panel is rattling like a son of a bitch.  Seriously.  Like, I kind of want to just rip it off so it stops rattling, but I dont wanna screw up the mod any worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never dropped this mod, I carry it in a special pouch to keep it in great condition, and keep it away for any keys OR metal.  I&amp;#39;ve babied this damn thing and it seems like its falling apart!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there&amp;#39;s also the non-fire issue as well.  I depress the firing switch, and nothing happens.  At all.  I could understand if I kind of hit the switch a bit crooked or off kilter... but I can press it, and it will fire.  3 seconds later, try to fire it again and it will not fire.  Instantly let up and depress it and it fires.  What the fuck?!?!?! I&amp;#39;ve also had the wattage jump while it was just sitting on my desk.  I have it set at 72w, then suddenly it drops to 67.2 watts, even with a fresh pair of batteries.  I mean seriously, why?  What the hell is causing this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came into this whole thing really really excited about this mod.  I are disappoint. While I thank the good people at Heaven&amp;#39;s Gifts for the giveaway, this mod fell WAY short of my expectations.  From the get go I was excited about this.  I can&amp;#39;t say that enough. The look, the features, the size, the colors... all of it was just what I was looking for.  That is until it began to fail me.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s in QC, or just crappy manufacturing, but Wismec has really missed the mark on this one.  No, it will not be the Alien 220w killer.  It won&amp;#39;t even be the RX200 killer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the ultimate question.... Would I go and buy this mod after my review?  NO!  I would not.  There are too many issues that Wismec needs to get worked out on this unit first.  If they come out with a v2, or Predator 229, or some other ridiculously named revision I may give it a try.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alas, I will continue to use it until I can&amp;#39;t deal with the issues anymore or it falls apart, whichever happens first.  I&amp;#39;ll post a follow up when I hit 10k puff benchmarks, just to keep the fun going.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for reading!  Hopefully I do not deter anyone from buying this who may enjoy it.  It&amp;#39;s not my purpose to deter anyone, I&amp;#39;m just telling you the way I sees it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; My views and opinions are mine alone and not necessarily the views of Heaven Gifts or Wismec.
