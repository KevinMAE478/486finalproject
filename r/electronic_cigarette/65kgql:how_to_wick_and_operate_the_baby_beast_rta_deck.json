These will be adjacent to your air flow holes, or located diagonally to their respective coils. Obviously you can&amp;#39;t really run a singly coil build easily on this deck, as all four holes need to be filled to avoid serious juice leakage into your deck.

The idea is to get as much cotton possible into these four small juice wells, and then gently tease the cotton to a point where the bulk of it is focused towards the opening, with a small amount sticking outward. Think of these like small dams. They are semi-permeable walls that disallow seepage into your atty, but still give the adhesion the juice needs when the coil is fired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/qAD8C\"&gt;Picture of the process.&lt;/a&gt; (Notice that there is not a single gap in the juice holes, cotton fills the entire thing from wall to wall.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Vx4PD\"&gt;Completed Wicking :)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;STEP THREE: Filling the tank and firing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure iv&amp;#39;e restated the obvious to a lot of people, but please make sure your airflow is completely closed before filling the tank. After painting your coils with a decent layer of juice, you&amp;#39;re now ready to put the metal top cap back on your deck and attach the glass, completing the tank. Keeping the air holes closed, fill to your desired level. Now begin firing and sucking in the vapor at a wattage considerably less than your target vape. This allows the adhesion of the juice to start, and creates a vacuum due to you heating the restricted space. I personally go through 2 puffs on 3 increments of wattage before reaching my target. (I use around 55W on a .35 Ohm coil build). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/vVG7x\"&gt;Assembled tank (airflow closed)&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition, while I recommend keeping the airflow closed any time you re-fill the tank, it should be fine to refill without any extra hassle from here until you rebuild or clean your coils. I haven&amp;#39;t had a single leak from this set up, and it&amp;#39;s been upside down, on its side in the cupholder, ect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helped some of you guys out :) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So in the past I've seen a lot of post as well as comments strewn throughout reddit and youtube about troubles building on and operating this atty.
