I have purchased somewhere around ten mods, countless tanks, and I spend 20-40 a week on juice. I do not sit in the shop to hang out, and mooch free samples. the only thing I have ever returned was bad coils, that did not work straight out of the box. (I have had to return around ten of them, over a span of a couple months) and a battery that didn&amp;#39;t hold a charge (not to mention he switched from elast or whatever that&amp;#39;s called to generic green batteries, that do not stay charged more than an hour of steady use, at a low setting. He charges 17 for 50ml of house brand, and did not tell me for months that 120ml were available for 24. I specifically asked, only reason I found out was because some lady asked for it in front of me. He has been through like 5 partners, and whenever that happens he ends up out of stock, also I buy one of the more popular house brands and more than half the time they are out. Now to the thing that pissed me off, I purchased a used, but new looking J150 from him for about 5 dollars more than I could have purchased new online. The second day I had it, the ring around the charge port came out with the charger, I talked to him the next day and he said that he would replace it. I stopped in once or so a week to buy juice, he was not there but I asked if they knew if my replacement was in, they texted him and he said he was having trouble getting one from his supplier, I told him to text him and say that I didn&amp;#39;t really care if it was exact, just something comparable and he said okay.  that happened for a few weeks, each time employees said bthey did not know where it was. I decided to text him after 3 weeks, and he told me the best he could do was half off a used 80 watt snow wolf. so I would have to pay 30 for it. I told him no thanks, he said &amp;quot;seriously? I guess I will just have to sell this one&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;am I being a baby about this? I know these stores are strapped for cash a lot, but this was more about the principle? any good websites to buy a mod? What would a reasonably priced mod be that is like the J150? Whos got a good strawberry milk shake for around 25 for 120ml? also what would be a good tank? I am so fucking over this UD. Not looking for one that will burn through the juice, but would like a decent hit, and a little bit of clouds.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit. I forgot the cash thing. He wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as his workers with this, but they would get so annoyed if you wanted to pay with a card. You wouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay tax with cash was their selling point. Lol one dude actually asked me if I could run across the street and just hit the atm. So he wanted me to rack up 4.50 in arm charges so they didn&amp;#39;t have to pay tax themselves?\nEdit on my edit.

Mostly because of the issue with the defective product. If you buy new and it&amp;#39;s defective, you take it up with the manufacturer. With used you have no such luck. Seems to me that if a business wants to roll the dice selling a used mod, they&amp;#39;re going to have to deal with it if the device becomes defective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tracking down a replacement? What&amp;#39;s up with that? If he didn&amp;#39;t have one there to give you, he should have given you cash or store credit. That&amp;#39;s ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for them dodging tax. It&amp;#39;s not your problem. The IRS will find out. The IRS will bone them.
