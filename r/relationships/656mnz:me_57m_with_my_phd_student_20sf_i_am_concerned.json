Your description definitely supports anorexia as a possibility, as well as other physical or mental illnesses. She may already be diagnosed and trying to manage whatever it is, or she may be unaware. If she has personality tendencies of over-responsibility, seriousness and setting herself high standards, then working hard and being a high achiever will be both a comforting distraction and an exacerbator of whatever health issues are going on. Being in a PhD program is probably an incubator for this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a supervisor it is your responsibility to ensure that the program demands are not inconsistent with maintaining health and wellbeing for your students (regardless of other/pre-existing issues), and perhaps you could take a review of the PhD program - ensuring that you provide an environment where your students are flourishing wholistically, not just intellectually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is probably not appropriate for you to be directly quizzing her about whether she has anorexia. However, if you were to take her somewhere quiet and initiate a conversation where you say that you notice that she has been looking tired lately, and that while you don&amp;#39;t want to invade her privacy or private life, emphasise that you care about her well-being. That she is welcome to come to you to ask for support or advice, and to take advantage of whatever support services your university offers. I would acknowledge the pressure that a PhD program puts on people, and share something personal (not too extreme) about difficulties you have faced with workplace stress or work/life balance, particularly when you then asked others to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t put any pressure on her to tell you details, but try to impart that you are trustworthy and non-judgmental, that admitting problems and asking for help doesn&amp;#39;t negate being competent, and that looking after personal health and wellbeing is compatible with, and ultimately necessary for, sustained professional/academic excellence. I would leave that conversation open without requiring anything from her, go back to normal work, and leave it up to her to initiate further discussion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a kind of &amp;#39;father figure&amp;#39;, there are many possible problems that she wouldn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable disclosing to you. However, the professional example you set, and the care you show towards her as a person and mentee, will speak volumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg8ohdg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492168385.0, "created_utc": 1492139585.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656mnz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8thtk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZeMeest", "parent_id": "t3_656mnz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a 24 year old woman getting my PhD in immunology/microbiology.
