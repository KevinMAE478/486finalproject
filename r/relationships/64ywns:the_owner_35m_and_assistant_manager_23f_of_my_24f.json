You all are so nice!! As much as it saddens me, I&amp;#39;m going to talk with Husband tonight and we&amp;#39;ll figure out the best way to let Steve and Susan know that I quit. I do have one other question though... Husband originally got the job as a bartender 2.5 years ago because we were such loyal regulars at the place (we used to be in there 2-3x a week as customers) and then Husband worked his way up to become the GM. I usually go in for happy hour 2ish times a week and I love it. The vast majority of our friends are staff at/from this restaurant and the thought of never going in there for happy hour/a meal/drinks ever again makes my heart sink. Do you think I&amp;#39;ll never be able to patronize the place again? Maybe when Susan isn&amp;#39;t working (Steve isn&amp;#39;t actually in the FOH very often). OR should I cut &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my losses and never step foot inside again? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original post:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt;, I thank you in advance for your advice! This situation has a lot of necessary background info; I&amp;#39;m sorry for the length!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband (27M) is the general manager of a sports bar and restaurant. His only superior is the owner Steve (35M), and Husband oversees assistant manager Susan (23F). Most of the servers are young 18-21 y/o college students. It\u2019s also important to note that Steve and Susan are dating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In December 2016 there were some server shortages and I was looking to make a little extra money, so Husband asked if I wanted to serve at his restaurant 1-2 days a week. I work full time in my chosen field but am the youngest in my office by about 20 years. I thought it would be nice to make pocket money and have some work peers my own age. I served for several years in college and was qualified for the job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I trained and worked very hard and neither Steve nor Susan voiced any complaints about my performance. My interactions with customers (and great tips!) also led me to believe I was doing a good job. I started to really enjoy it and looked forward to my shifts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until one week I\u2019m not on the schedule, which Susan drafts and then sends to Husband for approval every week. No biggie, it was right after the students came back from spring break, so maybe Susan gave one of them an extra shift because they needed the money. But then I wasn\u2019t on the next schedule either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Susan submitted the second schedule to Husband for approval, Husband asked (texted) \u201cHey, is there any specific reason you have RandomServer on Saturday morning instead of Michigander (me)?\u201d and Susan replies: \u201cYeah, Steve and I have been meaning to talk to you about that. We don\u2019t think Michigander should work here anymore. Are you home with her now? Can you let her know? Thanks!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband asks if he can come in to talk to Steve and Susan about their concerns. They basically said they think it\u2019s unfair that even though I \u201calready have a real job,\u201d I\u2019m taking shifts away from the other servers (who didn\u2019t even work there when I was hired!). Husband comments that this is a fair point, but it should have been something they discussed with him (as the general manager) and me before taking action. Susan said she hoped she could just stop putting me on the schedule and I\u2019d \u201ceventually get the message\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband enjoys working with me and I knew I really enjoyed working there. Plus, he felt that it was inappropriate to ask one spouse to fire another during our personal time at home, especially so out-of-the-blue. He says that, if I wanted to continue working there, he\u2019d try to reason with Steve and Susan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as Husband tried to talk about the issue, Steve and Susan suddenly came up with a long (grasping-at-straws list) of all the mistakes I\u2019ve made. It was literally as nit-picky as, like, \u201cOne customer 2.5 months ago complained that she seemed stressed,\u201d and \u201cLast month, she put the damp cleaning rag on a stack of napkins and we had to throw away napkins\u201d. However, these issues were NEVER brought up to me individually and I was never given any feedback about my performance. Not to mention, none of my tables ever needed to have food or drink comped and I never made any mistakes with ringing food in, serving the wrong thing, etc while other servers regularly makes mistakes like this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Steve and Susan decide I can keep working, but I\u2019ll be the \u201clowest priority server\u201d meaning that I\u2019d be the first one or called off if it\u2019s slow. I thought that was fair and agreed to keep working. I asked Steve and Susan to please address any concerns with my performance or other feedback with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the following month or so since the first \u201cfiring\u201d I worked three shifts and, again, believed I was doing a great job. My customers left happy, I was making very generous tips, and Susan, Steve, nor Husband brought up any performance issues. We opened our patio this last Saturday and were EXTREMELY busy, plus I had a mother-daughter painting class to serve in our private room. I had 3x the tables I usually do and worked very hard and made only one mistake, which Husband says is common and that I took the right steps to fix it. Husband said I did a great job handling the chaos, and that was an objective truth and he wasn\u2019t just saying so because of our relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yesterday, Husband came home from a work meeting in tears. During the rush on Saturday, Husband helped me out by bussing and tidying up our private room after the paint class. Steve and Susan claimed this was extremely inappropriate for him to do, even though he insisted that he would have done it for any server, not just his wife. PLUS! We had just had a staff meeting where Susan stressed the importance of all staff helping each other bus tables and clean. (So what the hell?!) Steve and Susan want to fire me again because I accepted Husband\u2019s offer to help bus after the party, which they claim was inappropriate because of our relationship (remember that Steve and Susan are dating, too). They also said they want to fire me because &amp;quot;it was chaos&amp;quot;... Yes, it was chaos. We sold over 150% as much food and beverage than any other Saturday to date! They asked Husband to tell me I no longer work there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I\u2019m more than happy to leave the job. Steve and Susan obviously want me gone, but will not give a legitimate reason. It\u2019s obviously causing Husband stress and I don\u2019t want to do anything to make his full-time job more difficult, especially not for the extra $60-100 I make per week. But Husband feels that they are manipulating him and acting inappropriately. He feels taken advantage of and doesn\u2019t want to let Steve and Susan act this way. He feels that if I quit it\u2019s \u201cletting them win\u201d and he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cgive in\u201d to their unprofessionalism. I told Husband that I will do whenever he wants me to do, keep working at the restaurant or quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should we do?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Husband&amp;#39;s colleagues want to fire me but cannot give a legitimate reason why.

I'd bet a tidy sum Susan is jealous of the tips you're making, as well as your full-time non-serving job &amp; happy, supportive marriage. Steve wants to continue screwing his 12-years-younger GF, and has decided the best way to keep her from bitching to him about you is just to cave to her demands that you leave.

You may be able (possibly) to collect some tiny unemployment if you're let go than if you voluntarily leave (which is what they're trying to coerce you into doing.)

I guess what I&amp;#39;m getting at here, is does Steve run the restaurant in a way where both him and your husband act like managers, or is your husband the one pretty much doing the running of the business? Is Steve just hearing things from his girlfriend or is he there too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because, your husband doesn&amp;#39;t have an assistant manager anymore. Susan has taken charge of the business now. It&amp;#39;s her way, or she goes to the owner. As long as they are dating it&amp;#39;s not going to change, it&amp;#39;s only going to get worse. Your husband can just deal with it until he gets fired after Susan makes up some story so she can get his job. Or he can look for new work. Or, if they get along well enough to be blunt with each other, he can sit down face to face with Steve alone and address this change in dynamic. Not insulting Susan, understanding Steve must be in a difficult spot because he&amp;#39;s dating his assistant manager and it&amp;#39;s got to be pretty difficult to put work out of mind when they are together, but that he has to feel like he can do his job and not be reprimanded by his assistant manager while doing so. That if he wasn&amp;#39;t dating her, he would have told her that she&amp;#39;s overstepping and you aren&amp;#39;t going to fire someone doing a good job when you are short on people, and that everyone should help out when things get busy. And put his foot down. But he can&amp;#39;t because he doesn&amp;#39;t know how to effectively do his job in this situation and would like some guidance here to work this out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg64l9g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043846.0, "created_utc": 1492015046.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ywns", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ywns", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg673in", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Inevitablename", "parent_id": "t1_dg64xnm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm on the same cynical train.
