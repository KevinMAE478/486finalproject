Online dating is hard enough (trying to stand out in a sea of shit like you said), I don&amp;#39;t need to be expressly told &amp;quot;Hey, you&amp;#39;re not good enough.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fact of the matter is that for me, an average looking dude, 20% response rate is a pretty good / above average hit rate for me to even get a single message back. If you don&amp;#39;t respond, there are a million reasons (deleted the app, didn&amp;#39;t read the message, etc.) and in all honesty, I&amp;#39;d just forget you existed after a short period of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you pop back up in my mind as a clear express notification that I&amp;#39;m not good enough, not the type, etc. to even continue a conversation, that feels like shit. And anyone who will repeatedly badger you (in a mean way) for not responding is just a dick, and you&amp;#39;ll never make him happy anyway (esp with a rejection). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying you&amp;#39;re wrong, I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s just an attempt at politeness, but thought I&amp;#39;d just chime in with a dude&amp;#39;s perspective, hopefully someone finds it instructive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgdyg68", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492485219.0, "created_utc": 1492456419.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tmhc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tmhc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tmhc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tmhc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnu3t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RememberKoomValley", "parent_id": "t1_dgdl2xg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have done that repeatedly, and it has never worked.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have done that repeatedly, and it has never worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgdnu3t", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492473352.0, "created_utc": 1492444552.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdl2xg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "songoku9001", "parent_id": "t1_dgdkw29", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Usually should be an unsubscribe link at bottom and I managed to delete my account by going to the help page, clicking on the delete account link and going from there.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually should be an unsubscribe link at bottom and I managed to delete my account by going to the help page, clicking on the delete account link and going from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgdl2xg", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470110.0, "created_utc": 1492441310.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkw29", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RememberKoomValley", "parent_id": "t1_dgdkh2k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like I said in the third sentence in the comment you're replying to, it won't let me delete my profile, and even after five years it sends me unwanted emails every single week.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said in the third sentence in the comment you&amp;#39;re replying to, it won&amp;#39;t let me delete my profile, and even after five years it sends me unwanted emails every single week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgdkw29", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469873.0, "created_utc": 1492441073.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkh2k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "songoku9001", "parent_id": "t1_dgd5b54", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\nHow come you think POF account is hard to delete??", "edited": 1492451525.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How come you think POF account is hard to delete??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgdkh2k", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469348.0, "created_utc": 1492440548.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5b54", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RememberKoomValley", "parent_id": "t1_dgd4yqm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Warning--PoF is impossible to break free from.
