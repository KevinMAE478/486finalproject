In between class I had originally planned to meet my boyfriend (&amp;quot;C&amp;quot;) and grab something to eat, but one of my other friends was having car trouble and needed a ride, so I texted C that I wouldn&amp;#39;t make it to lunch and I was really sorry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t hear a response from him for a little bit, went to class. By the time I got out of class and looked at my phone again, though, I had 12 missed calls from him and 22 texts. The messages made it clear that he was extremely angry over something, so I called to get clarification. On the phone, he accused me of cheating on him over lunch and demanded to know what I had been doing and who I had been with. I told him that I had just been helping a (female) friend with a ride and it was no big deal, and I was really sorry about missing our lunch date. He was still mad and hung up, I figured it would just blow over by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should probably add, C does sometimes have jealousy/anger issues. He has been working on it and he has never gotten violent, and I think we all have issues of one kind of another. I probably should have foreseen agrravating those issues when I cancelled on lunch, but I just didn&amp;#39;t think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, right as it was about time for class to be over, I got another text from C telling me that he was coming over to my apartment so we could &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot;. He was still mad, and I really didn&amp;#39;t want to get yelled at anymore, so I told him I wasn&amp;#39;t going to be there, and I went and chilled at another friend&amp;#39;s place for a while. Again, I figured C would burn out sooner or later and everything would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, a couple hours ago roughly, I got a text from C telling me that he was outside my apartment. I just reiterated that I was not home and we could talk later. I put my phone on silent because I was kind of getting peeved at him messaging me while he was still mad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like five minutes later I happen to look at my phone again. I have three missed calls and a message from my roommate (K). Her message says something like &amp;quot;C is slamming on the front door!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to call her, no answer. I message her back &amp;quot;Tell him I&amp;#39;m not there.&amp;quot; No answer. Now I&amp;#39;m a little concerned, so I decide to head home and see wtf is going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I get home, K and her boyfriend (W) are there. She&amp;#39;s crying, and he looks &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt;. I asked him what the hell happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: this is all info I got from W, I didn&amp;#39;t see it personally, and am unable to verify details)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that K had opened the door and tried to tell C that I wasn&amp;#39;t home, but he didn&amp;#39;t believe her and pushed his way into the apartment. I guess he was yelling and cussing at K a lot in anger, and she panicked and went and locked herself in her bedroom and called W to ask what she should do. W told her to call the police and he was coming over to wait with her until the cops got there (he lives like two buildings away from us).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Details get a little sketchy at this part, but what is obvious is that W and C got into some kind of physical confrontation when W got to the apartment. W has some bruises and a busted lip, I don&amp;#39;t know what the damage to C is. K had called the cops immediately after getting off the phone with W, and they arrived at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of the boys were initially detained by police, but I guess after talking with everyone, the police decided C had started it all and released W. C was taken to the police station, probably until morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;W and K left just a few minutes ago, K telling me she is probably not coming back for &amp;quot;a while&amp;quot; and may even pursue a restraining order against C. She and W both seem very mad about the situation. I have no idea where C is other than &amp;quot;in custody&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I am home, alone. My roommate is ignoring my texts trying to apologize and I have no idea when or if she is coming back. If she does get the restraining order, C won&amp;#39;t be able to come over anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know C fucked up, and K has every right to bar him from the apartment. But I think jail is only going to aggravate his issues and he may wind up getting in more trouble. So now I am alone, sad, and I feel like the whole world hates me over this shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I need to do to make it right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: My boyfriend got mad, and frightened my roommate.
