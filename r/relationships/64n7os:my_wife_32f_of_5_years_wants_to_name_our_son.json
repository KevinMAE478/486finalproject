Saying something is cute is not the same thing as telling me she for sure wants to name her future son after me, but she insists that she told me in advance and I agreed, even though no such thing happened. That has become sort of a side argument and conflict here. She seems to think we already had agreed on this, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s reasonable for her to claim we had an agreement when all I said was I thought it could be cool.
