He also has full license to harass me about things that I need taken care of that I could have done when he was away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still get my favorite hobby, fianc\u00e9 gets his emotional needs met. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure the issue could be revisited if this blog was making him money, but until then. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7yxj2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136233.0, "created_utc": 1492107433.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7etnr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 148, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pomguo", "parent_id": "t1_dg7aqkb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, seriously.

If drinking coffee made talking to him akin to talking to an ADD squiril and he always drank coffee... not fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His hobby is weed. Ok. If it didn&amp;#39;t cause him to get withdrawn, that could work. Or if he smoked in the morning and was sober by the time you got home to hang out, that could work. But him smoking during what should be your together hang out time is not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d tell him you are fine with his smoking, but you are not fine with how he treats you when he smokes. You need him to compromise with you by making time in the evenings for you to hang out when he&amp;#39;s sober (or at least no high). Maybe he only smokes 2-3 nights a week instead of 5. Maybe he agrees not to get high till 8 pm so you have together/chill time before his alone time. Whatever you two come up with. But he has to do something, because it is not fair for you to stay in a relationship that is emotionally damaging to you. Right now, his behavior is making you hurt. It would hurt if he did this when he was sober, just as bad. So he needs to find a way of changing his behavior, even if that means cutting down on the pot, because otherwise what is this relationship anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7fdy1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492112221.0, "created_utc": 1492083421.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 85}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kvh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kvh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kvh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kvh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7s2f0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BlueberryTheBantha", "parent_id": "t1_dg7q2q8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So he's bad at his hobby (which is writing a blog)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s bad at his hobby (which is writing a blog)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7s2f0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128932.0, "created_utc": 1492100132.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7q2q8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itsnotbrexit", "parent_id": "t1_dg7olyr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "although he doesn't seem to be very descriptive\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;although he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be very descriptive&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7q2q8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126814.0, "created_utc": 1492098014.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7olyr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "city17_dweller", "parent_id": "t1_dg7jkez", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep, about the best you can say is that the blog is a hobby about his weed habit.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, about the best you can say is that the blog is a hobby about his weed habit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7olyr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125240.0, "created_utc": 1492096440.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kvh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kvh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sqga", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itsnotbrexit", "parent_id": "t1_dg7sggp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol.
