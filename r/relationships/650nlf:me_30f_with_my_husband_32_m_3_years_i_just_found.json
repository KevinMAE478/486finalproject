He wasn&amp;#39;t in the middle of a divorce the divorce hadn&amp;#39;t even started. But there was a break in their marriage because he had moved out 4 months prior to us ever meeting, so when I met him he was what appeared to be a man living alone, while trying to iron out all the complications of a divorce. They had a kid together so it also seemed logical that he was in contact with his ex during this time, and spending time at the house. Turns out she was still under the impression that their marriage was intact, that the move out was just him needing some space for the time being and he strung her along for those 4 months he was living on his own, as well as an additional 2, almost 3 months, into our relationship. They would make plans together (he would cancel last minute because he was with me) She would try desperately to be a good wife to him (probably hoping he&amp;#39;d come back) send him I love you text...to which he&amp;#39;d respond back with a &amp;quot;love you too&amp;quot; or the dreaded &amp;quot;luv ya&amp;quot; She&amp;#39;d offer to make him breakfast before work or dinner after work to get him to come by the house...sometimes he would go most of the time he wouldn&amp;#39;t. He was pretty much using her while he tried to figure out what he wanted. And there were other things like we took a weekend trip about a month in, and had one of the best weekends ever, we still talk about it to this day...and he had sent her flowers during that trip. Probably because of his guilty cheating conscious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well one day social media does what social media tends to do and it got him caught up. He never used Facebook but did have an account, which made him tag-able. We went on a trip with his friends and during that trip his friend tagged him in photos of us together, his mom commented on the photo pretty much calling him a POS for what he was doing to his family. I was like WHOA...what am I mixed up in? He had told me before his family had turned on him and did not approve of his divorce so he had pretty much cut them out of his life, so again I had a reason as to why his mom was so irate over seeing him with someone else. And again, divorce is messy so none of it seemed that suspicious. Well it turns out that was the incident that actually ended his marriage, because THAT is when his ex actually filed for divorce. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding all of this out actually made things much more clear for me, I was always treated like I broke up their marriage but I always thought I had nothing to do with it, from my perspective they were done months before I ever met him and were just handling legal things. That was not that case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here is my dilemma now, what do I do with this information? There is:\n1) do nothing, it was so long ago, there is nothing to gain from it. We have such a great marriage and relationship, what&amp;#39;s the point? I was really mad when I found out and now I don&amp;#39;t know how I feel. I,too, have been in limbo in a relationship, where things are done but you&amp;#39;re too scared to pull the trigger, so you just end up being a shitty person till the other party has had enough of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Bring it up. He was technically cheating on me too. There are so many moments in the beginning that are now tainted or would have never been had I known the truth. I would never disrespect another woman or a marriage like that, and yet I did. And because of the position he put me in, I had to take years of being treated like scum by his family. And I also wonder, had he not got caught, how long would that have gone on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Without my knowledge I was the other woman in my husbands first marriage, now I&amp;#39;m wondering what I should do with all of this information...bring it up or let it die?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "When I met my now husband he told me he was in the middle of a divorce...which I found out this week was not completely the truth.
