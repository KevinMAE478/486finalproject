[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "relationships", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me - Luca\nFiance - John\nFiance&amp;#39;s friend - Vicky\nFiance&amp;#39;s friend&amp;#39;s husband - Ralph&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now that that&amp;#39;s out of the way. let me elaborate on the situation. I met John in college and we were friends for a bit. I was a transfer student so I didn&amp;#39;t have many friends, and John introduced me to his friends which included Vicky and Ralph. Everyone was really nice to me at first and we all became a really close-knit group. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point John was considering himself straight, and in a sense he still does. But for whatever reason he found himself attracted to me and I liked him back, so we started dating. Vicky was really enthusiastic about our relationship and kept calling us &amp;quot;the cute gay couple&amp;quot; etc, which was nice at first but it soon got slightly offensive. It felt like she was somehow fetishizing our relationship by constantly calling it &amp;quot;cute,&amp;quot; making comments about how &amp;quot;cute guys dating is hot,&amp;quot; and asking very intimate and personal questions about our sex life. One day I had enough and very politely asked if she could tone it down, and she immediately became enraged and left. She hasn&amp;#39;t talked to me since then, and I was honestly fine with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was still friends with John, and I was okay with this as well because they&amp;#39;d been friends for far longer than I&amp;#39;ve known John. But John started complaining about how whenever Vicky talked to him, she would always trash talk me even when he told her to stop. He showed me her messages and she said some really disgusting stuff like &amp;quot;you used to be such a nice guy, but Luca is turning you into just another obnoxious f&lt;em&gt;g,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Luca is such a b&lt;/em&gt;tch, he&amp;#39;s so girly and weak, he might as just get a sex change and be a normal girl,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t you see that Luca is just using you because gays like corrupting straight guys? he&amp;#39;s so manipulative and abusive&amp;quot; etc etc. Every time John shut her down, she&amp;#39;d just apologize and say she was &amp;quot;drunk&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;just frustrated&amp;quot; because they used to be really close but suddenly John was only hanging out with me and not with her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was understandably really upset and asked John to stop talking to her. I know that this might have been extreme, but I was just incredibly offended and felt disgusted that she&amp;#39;d say these things about me for no other reason than me very gently telling her to tone it down. John just kept saying &amp;quot;oh she has borderline personality disorder, she&amp;#39;s just having a bad day, I don&amp;#39;t even read her messages anymore and she just vents in my inbox&amp;quot; and stuff, and even though I was very upset I just stopped talking about it. Eventually when Vicky got married to Ralph and said she would only invite John if he didn&amp;#39;t bring me, John got fed up and blocked her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This didn&amp;#39;t really do much because Vicky simply started making fake email accounts and kept sending John horrible emails. There was the usual &amp;quot;Luca is shit&amp;quot; emails, but there were also some really creepy and obsessive ones like &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re supposed to be MY soulmate not his,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ralph is just a little boy compared to you, a REAL MAN,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;one day you&amp;#39;ll understand that I&amp;#39;M the only one who truly understands you and wants the best for you&amp;quot; etc. She even photoshopped my face onto some pretty extreme gay porn and sent it to him (we got a good nervous laugh out of those) with captions like &amp;quot;have fun with your f&lt;em&gt;g sl&lt;/em&gt;t&amp;quot;. I got some really bad horror-movie vibes from these and asked John if he had anything to tell me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He confessed that before we met, Vicky had gotten drunk one night and came to his apartment barely able to stand. When he let her in and was about to call Ralph, she said that she and Ralph had broken up and begged him to hook up with her &amp;quot;to ease the pain.&amp;quot; They fooled around for a bit but it just didn&amp;#39;t feel right to John, so he shut it down and slept on the couch while she passed out on his bed. The next morning Vicky left his apartment and he found out that she and Ralph hadn&amp;#39;t broken up, he was just out of town. He had contemplated telling Ralph what had happened, but didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now John is getting these horrible emails on a near daily basis. When he blocks one email address, another one comes up. He says he doesn&amp;#39;t want to call the police because Vicky is erratic and unpredictable, and he doesn&amp;#39;t trust the police to handle her nonviolently (he says with certain conviction that he wouldn&amp;#39;t put it past her to bum rush a cop and get shot). I&amp;#39;ve suggested contacting Ralph and asking him to tell Vicky to stop, but obviously this would probably destroy their relationship. What do we do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Fiance messed around with a female friend a long time ago, now she&amp;#39;s obsessed with him and keeps trying to ruin our relationship.
