She whipped around and looked at me with with a look on her face that told me instantly.  Something was up.  Long story short, I gave a made up reason for needing the code to her phone to make some changes on the account.  She gave it to me and I snooped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a text conversation with a name I did not recognize,  I opened the text, scrolled up read a few lines that made it obvious what it was.  I could not read any further.  I began to hyperventilate..  She was putting our 3 kids to bed.  I went upstairs and handed he the phone back with the conversation still on the screen.  She look at the phone and I stood there for a few moment, she could not look back at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked back down to my office as to not make a scene in front of the kids.  She came downstairs and I asked her what the hell was going on.  She basically explained to me that she started talking to an old friend of a friend on Facebook and it turned into sexting and morning (after I had gone to work) phone sex.   He is not local so they have not met up (But have talked about it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked he straight forward if she wanted a divorce.  She said &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot;  We talked a little more.  I guess it&amp;#39;s important to note that though I was visibly upset I was not yelling .  I am normally VERY level headed.  Typically she is the emotional one.  And she was..  After a little more conversation I asked her again.  &amp;quot;Do you want a divorce?&amp;quot;  And she said &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fell apart I reacted to emotion in a way I have never done.  I had adrenaline going, I could feel my heart beating in my chest.  It was a place I had never been before.  I grabbed my keys and my gun.  This sounds bad but I conceal carry all the time and it&amp;#39;s just habit.  Told her I would make it easy on her and left.  (What I meant was I would just leave,  But it was not taken this way.  And looking back I understand why)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she called the Sherriffs office concerned for my safety.  I drove maybe a half mile from my house and realized I should not be driving.  I stopped in a cemetery (This was around 8:30 at night) drove to the back and parked.  I sat there for about an hour to collect myself.  I decided that I should go to my parents house (only about 3-4 miles away) as they are south for the winter and I can just sleep at there house for the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I turned down there street I noticed a car pulling in behind me (dead end street so usually no traffic).  As it turns out my wife had called a friend of hers to come over and her and her husband showed up and he went looking for me. (My wife had seen me parked with the find my iphone app).  I puled into my parents driveway got out of the vehicle as did the husband of my wifes friend and he asked me if I was ok.  I told him I was.  I went for the front door and he followed.  As I unlocked and went in he asked if we could talk.  I told him I didn&amp;#39;t want to talk.  I shut the door and locked it.  Headed upstairs and could hear the knocking and doorbell being rung behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 10 minutes later I am laying there in the bed staring at the ceiling and I can see a flashlight being shined on the windows.  And then my phone rings.  It was the friends husband.  I answered asking what he wanted.  He told me my wife was concerned for my safety and had called the authorities and the local PD was outside for a wellness check.  I had calmed down plenty at this point and told him  I will be down.  I opened the door to find 4 police cars waiting for me (sleepy little town only has 2 on duty at any given time but it happened to be shift change)  .  The officer who spoke to me knows me from some past run-ins.  Nothing illegal and no bad blood.  He asked where my gun was I told him it was on my hip.  He asked if we could talk for a moment.  I told him yes.  We spoke for a few minutes he was cool and basically said they had to come.  I assured them I had no plans to hurt myself or anyone else.  They were happy and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to bed.  I laid there for probably 30 minutes mind going 100 mph.  No way I was going to sleep.  I had texted back and fourth with my wife.  Thanked her for calling the police, she explained it was out of worry.  I wasn&amp;#39;t really mad..  Just embarrassed..  She told me she still loved me and did not want a divorce.  I decided to go for a drive as sleep was not in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realized I was heading home.  I texted her and told her I was headed that way..  Did she not want me there.  She replied &amp;quot;I want you here&amp;quot;.  I drove home and found her friend and husband still there.  I walked in and greeted them..  Walked to the kitchen to get a drink.  We all chatted a little, they left after 20 minutes or so.  My wife is apologizing repeatedly (she made a mistake / she still loves me) .  We eventually went to bed (about 3:00 AM). She had asked if I would go to counseling with her the next day.  (Not something I would normally agree to.  But I cannot explain the state of mind I was in.  She has seen a counseler on and off over the years.  (Currently on))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got an appointment with someone in the same office but not her normal person.  As they were booked up.  She kind of went over what happened, what she had done.  It was a fairly short term thing, 2-3 weeks.  No actual contact (he lives in another state). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand counseling as something that helps some people.  Though it has never struck me as something I would benefit from.  Though I realize I don&amp;#39;t know it all.  I was there for her, and I told her and the counselor that.  No offense intended.  She recommended marriage counseling and we have an appt scheduled next week.  We are Christians and this counseling center is faith based.  They recommended some reading of particular scripture together and praying together.  And I recognize this as a good thing.  But not a fix all be all.  I was asked during that session if I could forgive her.  My response was &amp;quot;not today&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the wall of text above.  I have reacted to this in a way that I have never experienced before.  I was physically sick to the point of vomiting.  I told her I am having a hard time with this.  Yesterday I had a few meetings and other obligations ot attend to.  But my time at home consisted with her and I sitting in the same room not really saying anything.  She wants to say she&amp;#39;s sorry in a way that I will accept.  And I don&amp;#39;t know how that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her last night before bed.  &amp;quot;I am not saying I don&amp;#39;t/won&amp;#39;t forgive you.  But I am not saying I forgive you.&amp;quot;  We both cried and eventually went to sleep.  I am back at work today. (had just happened to have taken Monday off)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something had seemed off recently.  Lack of sex, almost seemed ot be avoiding it.  Though she had in the past month or so had surgery to repair a hernia.  So I just chalked it up to being tender from tat still.  I did ask her point blank one evening last week.  &amp;quot;Are we ok?&amp;quot;  and she told me we were...  That hurts..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I don&amp;#39;t really have any direct questions.  Maybe just looking for advice/insight.  I felt/feel broken.  I think I needed to type this out maybe... I don&amp;#39;t know...  Also, this is the second time something like this happened.  6 years ago something very similar happened and she came to me with it (with the advice from her counselor).

It wasn't until I decided that she didn't love me the way I felt I deserved to be loved that I decided to end it.  While I'm still going through the process, I know I made the right decision.

I have no idea what the future holds for me, but I'm excited about it, in a way I wasn't before.\n\nI can tell you that, if your wife was sexting another man, having phone sex and talking about meeting up, odds are she's already met up with somebody.  I don't know if that's determinative for you - it wasn't for me even after I cut through all of my STBXW's lies.  Ultimately, you need to decide whether you can trust her and whether you're getting what you need out of the relationship.  I can tell you that there's lots of women out there who won't take you for granted like that.\n\nBest of luck.  Feel free to PM me if you want to talk further.

We have talked a lot since this happened.  I'm hurt and I'm angry, not at her I don't think.  But at what she's done.  I believe she is sincere in her regret.  Folks recommending a secular counselor.  I understand where you are coming from.  We went with someone not affiliated with our church directly.  And I know it's not a popular opinion on reddit.  But we are Christians so it was important to us to go somewhere that would be supportive and have some insight on that.  And to clarify one posters concern that the counselor \"already asking you to forgive? WTF\".  I guess just to clarify, the counselor asked me if I COULD forgive her. Not if I had forgiven her.  \n\nI hope that I can, I do love her.  I feel that she does love me.  But I don't trust her right now, and I don't know what will change that.  And that's what scares me.\n\nI have been very transparent with my feelings about this to my wife. (Some thoughts bring her to tears)  She is answering all of my questions but I am not getting as much voluntary input as I would like. (And I have expressed that)  And I believe this is where she/we will benefit from the counselor.\n\nThere just happened to be a marriage workshop \"The Art of Marriage\" starting this week at our church.  She had asked me about going to this a couple times.  (Maybe that should have told me something?)  Not my thing, I am not a talker.  Not a small group person.  But neither is counseling.  I am stepping outside of my comfort zone here and decided to go.  \n\nWe have had sex for the past 3 nights.  Something unheard of in our marriage.  Probably the best sex we have ever had.  I'm not sure what that means.  If it's good or bad or somehow reactionary. It's not the usual makeup sex after a spat.  It's lovemaking(If that makes any sense).  We have talked and cuddled before and after.  \n\nWe have both disabled our Facebook accounts for the time being.  We talked a little bit about how to \"end\" the thing with this other guy.  She has not been in contact with him.  He has not made an attempt to contact her.  But both agree it needs to have an official \"end\" .\n\nI asked to look through her phone (being transparent that I have trust issues right now) she let me look at it.  A friend of hers was apparently aware of the relationship (and apparently is having something similar herself).

We have talked a lot since this happened.  I&amp;#39;m hurt and I&amp;#39;m angry, not at her I don&amp;#39;t think.  But at what she&amp;#39;s done.  I believe she is sincere in her regret.  Folks recommending a secular counselor.  I understand where you are coming from.  We went with someone not affiliated with our church directly.  And I know it&amp;#39;s not a popular opinion on reddit.  But we are Christians so it was important to us to go somewhere that would be supportive and have some insight on that.  And to clarify one posters concern that the counselor &amp;quot;already asking you to forgive? WTF&amp;quot;.  I guess just to clarify, the counselor asked me if I COULD forgive her. Not if I had forgiven her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that I can, I do love her.  I feel that she does love me.  But I don&amp;#39;t trust her right now, and I don&amp;#39;t know what will change that.  And that&amp;#39;s what scares me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been very transparent with my feelings about this to my wife. (Some thoughts bring her to tears)  She is answering all of my questions but I am not getting as much voluntary input as I would like. (And I have expressed that)  And I believe this is where she/we will benefit from the counselor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There just happened to be a marriage workshop &amp;quot;The Art of Marriage&amp;quot; starting this week at our church.  She had asked me about going to this a couple times.  (Maybe that should have told me something?)  Not my thing, I am not a talker.  Not a small group person.  But neither is counseling.  I am stepping outside of my comfort zone here and decided to go.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have had sex for the past 3 nights.  Something unheard of in our marriage.  Probably the best sex we have ever had.  I&amp;#39;m not sure what that means.  If it&amp;#39;s good or bad or somehow reactionary. It&amp;#39;s not the usual makeup sex after a spat.  It&amp;#39;s lovemaking(If that makes any sense).  We have talked and cuddled before and after.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have both disabled our Facebook accounts for the time being.  We talked a little bit about how to &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; the thing with this other guy.  She has not been in contact with him.  He has not made an attempt to contact her.  But both agree it needs to have an official &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked to look through her phone (being transparent that I have trust issues right now) she let me look at it.  A friend of hers was apparently aware of the relationship (and apparently is having something similar herself).  This bothered me at first to see that she was keeping it a secret from me but could open up to this friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think eventually I will be able to trust her again.  But it will take time.
