I was at my worst while in a 7 year long-distance relationship, and was jealous of every*one* and every*thing* my boyfriend received pleasure from outside of myself: his mother, friends, exercise, hobbies. My therapist at the time asked me, \"imagine a scenario where your partner is locked in a room with nothing to do and can't see anyone except you - would this make you happy?\" I realized the answer was \"yes,\" and it scared me so much that I never went back.\n\nAs I've grown and had other relationships, I've worked hard to give my partner space, encourage them to do their own thing and find more meaning for myself. It's easier said than done for people like us. But you know that it's important, and it *is*. You need to start working on this aspect of yourself right away, for your partner and yourself, in this and all future relationships. \n\nA few pieces of advice:\n\n- Practice encouraging and supporting your partner in what they want, even if it's hard. When they think about taking a solo trip, just say \"go for it!\" without thinking. If they want to sign up for a class or join a club, encourage them. Ask how it's going and be engaged in what interests them. Avoid making underhanded remarks that might discourage them because you feel that you're losing a piece of them - you're not.\n\n- Find something meaningful for you. Again, this seems obvious, but for people who derive pleasure from making other people happy, it can be a challenge. Complicating factors include if you're introverted or have a small social circle. For me, it was getting a job that I was truly passionate about. If that's not an option right now, volunteer. But *do* find something you enjoy doing without your partner. As a bonus, this will make you seem like a better person in your partner's eyes! People love others who are passionate, giving and engaged. You'll also have more to talk about.\n\n- Communicate. This is the number one most important part of a relationship, after love. It goes hand in hand with respect. I've been with my partner for six years - is smother him to death if given the chance. I love *lots* of time on the couch, lots of cuddles and only want to do things if they're with him. Meanwhile, he is fiercely independent, needs a lot of alone time and can only tolerate so much physical affection. We make it work by communicating our needs: I let him know when I need some more time together or to be shown more affection, and he tells me when he just wants some time to himself. \n\nI've overcome my codependence and you can, too. Loving someone and wanting them to be happy is *not* a crime. But that also means making sure you're taking care of their needs, and that means giving them space when necessary and encouraging them to pursue what makes them happy, even if that's sometimes on their own.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to say that I was once in your shoes - I&amp;#39;ve always struggled with codependence in relationships and let me tell you: it is very, very damaging.

When they think about taking a solo trip, just say &amp;quot;go for it!&amp;quot; without thinking. If they want to sign up for a class or join a club, encourage them. Ask how it&amp;#39;s going and be engaged in what interests them. Avoid making underhanded remarks that might discourage them because you feel that you&amp;#39;re losing a piece of them - you&amp;#39;re not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find something meaningful for you. Again, this seems obvious, but for people who derive pleasure from making other people happy, it can be a challenge. Complicating factors include if you&amp;#39;re introverted or have a small social circle. For me, it was getting a job that I was truly passionate about. If that&amp;#39;s not an option right now, volunteer. But &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find something you enjoy doing without your partner. As a bonus, this will make you seem like a better person in your partner&amp;#39;s eyes! People love others who are passionate, giving and engaged. You&amp;#39;ll also have more to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicate. This is the number one most important part of a relationship, after love. It goes hand in hand with respect. I&amp;#39;ve been with my partner for six years - is smother him to death if given the chance. I love &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of time on the couch, lots of cuddles and only want to do things if they&amp;#39;re with him. Meanwhile, he is fiercely independent, needs a lot of alone time and can only tolerate so much physical affection. We make it work by communicating our needs: I let him know when I need some more time together or to be shown more affection, and he tells me when he just wants some time to himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve overcome my codependence and you can, too. Loving someone and wanting them to be happy is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a crime. But that also means making sure you&amp;#39;re taking care of their needs, and that means giving them space when necessary and encouraging them to pursue what makes them happy, even if that&amp;#39;s sometimes on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgd16yb", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427857.0, "created_utc": 1492399057.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sv70", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sv70", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd7gag", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MittensTheLizard", "parent_id": "t1_dgd32c1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "These are important questions.
