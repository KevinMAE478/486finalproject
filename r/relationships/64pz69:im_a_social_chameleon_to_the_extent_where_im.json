I listen to scremo and chat nonchalantly about drug use and make jokes I would have been offended by with my previous friend.

I found myself always wanting to do whatever she wanted to do because I knew as long as she was happy I would be with her and &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; too. I think because I grew up basically training myself to adapt that way, it became second nature and now I don&amp;#39;t know how to turn it off. When my boyfriend asked me what I want to do, or really when anyone asks me that, I find myself immediately going down a list of what THEY would want to do and picking something from there. I don&amp;#39;t mind, I know I&amp;#39;ll enjoy myself, and even if I don&amp;#39;t, I know I can fake it until I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it makes me think that there is something actually wrong with me.

For the sake of coming off as real, I could disagree with them on minor things (Like \"Oh, man! That movie was great\" or \"I don't really like this food\" while they don't think so), but for a lot of fundamental stuff, I won't disagree aloud. I wouldn't even realize what I was doing until much later. For the longest time, my boyfriend and I had problems with communications because of this, but at least that's gotten better. \n\nWhile I struggle with my own emotions all the time (to the degree that I disassociate at the drop of a feather; it's a huge issue), I can fake empathy very well and give sound advice.

There's so many people who feel they know me (and tell me how nice I am, and welcoming, and it's like...no, I'm not. The things I tell my best friend are a massive stark contrast to how others perceive me), but that's because I make them feel that way, even though they don't know the most basic of things about me. I also find it very easy to lie while I adjust myself to people, which used to frighten me about myself. To some degree, once someone likes me, I then get the sort of \"Okay, well that's conquered\" feeling and move on. I never felt that way toward my boyfriend or best friend, as they're the exception. Doing this would make people (those who felt they \"know me,\" because I made them feel special) feel abandoned and they would end up trying to repeatedly get my attention again, but I'd have become bored during conversation (all the while still giving them tidbits, I guess? So they still get that special feeling), and it just being an endless cycle. I'd feel awful, but not know how to change it.\n\nFortunately, I'm in therapy for all this, and have been for a while.

So when I meet someone new who has passions that I don't know anything about, it is VERY easy for me to dip into getting involved in their passions...at least for awhile.\n\nLike others have said, therapy is the best place to work on this. One therapist of mine in particular worked with me extensively to slowly tease through myself to learn what things I actually like and also taught me how to speak up/advocate for myself in terms of doing what I like with friends (with can be anything from going to a concert that *I* like/want to go to with like-minded friends, to speaking up when a group of friends is deciding where to go to dinner, and being firm that no, I do NOT want to go for Thai, but I AM in the mood for Italian or Mexican). It is a long slow process. I can tell you (15 years after that therapy) that it is a life-long process.\n\nOne of the most important things is that if you start to get signals that you DON'T like something as much as you originally did, it is OK to speak up and say so. For many hobbies, after I dip into them for 3-6 months, I get an idea of whether or not I want to continue with them, or if they're something I'll do occasionally with my friend, but the hobby really isn't for me. Learning to speak up like that was really important to me, and the best thing I learned to make that easier is to be really clear with my friends. By which I mean, if it was a new hobby, I would tell them \"X is a new hobby, and so far it sounds really cool! I definitely want to try it out, but I don't want to fully commit to getting totally into it until I've done it for some months\" And then I'd check in with myself about how I was feeling about this hobby, so I could update my friend \"Friend, I do like this, but I don't looooove it, so I'll be happy to do it with you sometimes, but I don't see myself being as into it as you are\" and make sure we were clear. \n\nAnother important thing is that if you're comfortable playing \"devil's advocate\" or talking \"in theory\" with people (I'm referencing your Christian guy/rock-&amp;-roll guy comment), it is VERY important to make it clear to them that you are doing that. For the sake of future fighting and someone feeling as though you lied, knowing how to make it clear that you can see how X works for some people *but might not necessarily be the thing that you personally ascribe to yourself* is really important. A therapist can help you learn to do that. \n\nAnyways, it's good to know now that you will probably never be \"neurotypical\" in this particular way - and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In some ways, I find it really nice to enjoy such a wide range of activities and personalities and ways of doing things. I think that overall, my life is richer for it and happier. And I do now know a lot of dislikes and likes I have, though it took me a long time to get here. So I feel more secure in myself. But at the same time, still very flexible in the way that you describe. \n\n**TLDR: You can be happy just the way you are, but therapy will really help you to navigate the world well with the mental/emotional framework that you have inside you.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just want to chime in that I dealt with this too.
