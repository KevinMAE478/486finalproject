They fought for custody of my brother [17 M] and I, and since I was the oldest I was constantly put in the middle. I went a long time thinking my dad was a terrible person for all the things my mom told me he did, and I hated him for a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My senior year of highschool, I found out my mom was pretending to be me on my Facebook account, talking to a woman who had taken my senior pictures for my dad and telling her I didn&amp;#39;t like them, didn&amp;#39;t have fun taking them and didn&amp;#39;t want to be tagged in them (because she only wanted Facebook to see the pictures she had taken, not my dad&amp;#39;s). This woman was pretty hurt and had no idea it wasn&amp;#39;t actually me saying these things. I immediately texted her and told her that was a fucked up thing to do, and changed my password since she violated my privacy and pretended to be me. She reacted by taking all of my money out of my bank account for a made up debt I now suddenly owed her, and I went home, packed up all my stuff, and moved to my dad&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made me spiral into a depression, because I had realized i&amp;#39;d spent most of my life thinking my dad was awful and my mom never did anything wrong and didn&amp;#39;t deserve any of it, but after that I realized she was pretty messed up too, and I didn&amp;#39;t know who to believe anymore. I couldn&amp;#39;t wait to turn 18 and move away so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be a part of their drama anymore, and could love them both from a distance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, I now live 1,000 miles away from my parents. I decided to forgive all past transgressions on both sides so I could have good relationships with them both, separate from each other, and my mom never understood this despite my trying to explain it. My mom would continue to try and tell me things my dad did to hurt her and my brother, and I&amp;#39;ve told her several times that I have zero interest in anything that goes on between them and not to talk to me about it. As far as i&amp;#39;m concerned, when i&amp;#39;m talking to my mom, my dad doesn&amp;#39;t exist, and vice versa. (It&amp;#39;s important to note that not once has my dad ever told me anything my mom had done, and doesn&amp;#39;t mention her, ever.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad is finally able to come and visit me next week for the first time since moving here 2.5 years ago. During the time he&amp;#39;ll be here, my brother will be turning 18. The plan was for my dad, brother, and step mom to all come visit for a couple days. I didn&amp;#39;t mention it to my mom because I figured she already knew and there was no reason for me to mention it to her anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got a text from my mom that read:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, not one soul told me about this trip to (state) for (brother&amp;#39;s) birthday. Not only did I have no idea I wouldn&amp;#39;t get to spend my son&amp;#39;s 18th bday with him at all.....but we made plans to go see Jeff Dunham in (another city) that night so he could spend the day with dad. I&amp;#39;d prefer it if you stayed at dad&amp;#39;s when you come visit in May (for my brother&amp;#39;s graduation). I&amp;#39;m not doing this anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my initial reaction is: wtf? \nAfter talking to my brother, it seems he forgot to tell my dad he had made plans with my mom, so my dad, thinking there were no other plans in the way, decided to come and visit me and take my brother so he could see me, too. He bought everyone plane tickets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I sent back to my mom:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Idk why you&amp;#39;re mad at me. I didn&amp;#39;t know you had plans with him and I didn&amp;#39;t know that you didn&amp;#39;t know he was coming here. It&amp;#39;s not my responsibility or place to tell you things like that. It&amp;#39;s not my fault (brother) forgot to tell dad about your plans and it&amp;#39;s not my fault that you and dad can&amp;#39;t communicate with eachother efficiently so that this entire situation could have been avoided. Now (brother&amp;#39;s) upset that he&amp;#39;s letting everyone down and i&amp;#39;m upset that somehow i&amp;#39;m STILL being thrown into the middle of shit that doesn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with me even when i&amp;#39;m 1,000 miles away. We will stay with one of our friends in May.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my mom flipped out, my brother told my dad he wasn&amp;#39;t going to see me anymore since he felt bad that he made plans with mom first and forgot about them, my dad called me to tell me my brother wasn&amp;#39;t coming and he honestly had no idea why he wasn&amp;#39;t coming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother listened to my mom on the phone with one of her friends, and from the way she was talking, she truly believes that I knew that she didn&amp;#39;t know about the trip, and that she&amp;#39;s convinced herself that my dad planned this all out just to fuck with her and make her not see my brother for his &amp;quot;very important&amp;quot; birthday. She told my brother directly that I &amp;quot;attacked her&amp;quot; in that text message. After all this, my brother decided to come on the trip. He said &amp;quot;i felt bad for her because I fucked up, but if she&amp;#39;s going to slander you and dad then she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we come to the true problem. This is the next and last thing she&amp;#39;s said to me so far, and I have no idea how to respond or go forward from here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The FACT that you are still blind to what he is doing &amp;amp; his motives is literally astounding to me. &amp;amp; yea it does have to do with you because you keep allowing him to use you to hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHY would he make plans for an 18 year olds bday &amp;amp; not ask him what he wants to do &amp;amp; where he wants to go?! Who does that?! And never say a word?!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one thinks it&amp;#39;s strange to go to (my state) just weeks before you are coming here? No one? (Brother) would rather go to New York or someplace he hasn&amp;#39;t been. But instead of discussing it with his now adult son, he makes his own plans with his own agenda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t believe for one second it never crossed your mind it was weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Brother) should be upset! Upset he is being used as a pawn at 18 years old without his permission!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like you allow him to use you. I send (brother) over there for all the holidays, mine or not! I went out of my way to ask (brother) what he wanted to do for his birthday &amp;amp; made sure dad also had time with him! I don&amp;#39;t behave the way ya&amp;#39;ll do!!\nAnd this is it!!\nI went over there to see you in Sept. &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;ve never felt more unwanted &amp;amp; unwelcome anywhere in my entire life&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But i&amp;#39;m SURE dad won&amp;#39;t feel that way when he is there. You&amp;#39;d NEVER treat him like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You honestly think had (brother) been given the options he would have wanted this?! Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is still being played, &amp;amp; i&amp;#39;m the one being hurt &amp;amp; YES.....you ARE still allowing it. So stop lying to yourself. You don&amp;#39;t care&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No reason to worry anymore, we haven&amp;#39;t been close in the last year anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fine.\nEnjoy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think my mom is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally all of this is in her head and none of it is happening. My dad made a plan to come see me, made sure it was ok with me and my boyfriend, and asked my brother if he wanted to come. My brother said yes, forgetting all about his plans with my mom, and so my dad bought plane tickets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my mom came in September, she didn&amp;#39;t ask but instead told me she had bought tickets. When she was here, she somehow got it in her head that I was mad at her, and despite me trying to assure her that I wasn&amp;#39;t mad, she acted like a child, refused to believe me, and stayed in our guest room the entire rest of the time she was here, which was like 2 days. I made efforts to try and invite her to go put put or bowling or anything at all, and she would decline and stay in the room. Then went home and cried that I had treated her like shit and didn&amp;#39;t want her there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk what to do. Idk how to respond. My mom always makes herself the victim, no matter what it is. I was depressed and cutting myself? No, I was faking it just to hurt her. I was quiet at lunch because I was tired and had a lot on my mind? No, I hate her and don&amp;#39;t want her to be here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty hurt that she thinks I would intentionally conspire with my dad to hurt her, especially since I&amp;#39;ve told her over and over I don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with what goes on between them bc I mentally could not handle it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I do, reddit? The only response I can think of is &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re crazy, get some help&amp;quot; But somehow I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;ll go over too well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up to a long text about how she feels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--She says my father and I &amp;quot;stole her son&amp;#39;s 18th birthday from her, after she&amp;#39;s spent years fighting to not miss one (They fought over full custody the whole time - she says she was fighting for equal custody, and he wanted full with no visitation. I believed this growing up.) &amp;quot;Then legally have been forced to miss more than any parent should ever have to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--Then she talks about how when my brother was born she was under &amp;quot;nightmare conditions&amp;quot; because she had just found out my dad had an affair (unsure if it was emotional or physical) and even though she was mad at him, she still allowed him to be in the room when his son was born, because she &amp;quot;chose not to deny him the birth of his son even though he didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be in there and had every right not to allow him&amp;quot; And says how she never denied him the right to his children. Then that child grew up, reached his big 18 milestone and it was stolen from her not only by him, but &amp;quot;by the daughter who spent years of her life watching her mother go through enormous pain &amp;amp; sacrifice... it&amp;#39;s a betrayal I never saw coming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--She goes on to say more about how I should have known that she didn&amp;#39;t know, and won&amp;#39;t believe I didn&amp;#39;t. How she would never do this to my dad, and that my dad isn&amp;#39;t even planning this trip for my brother, he&amp;#39;s planning it to hurt her, and doesn&amp;#39;t care about my brother&amp;#39;s birthday. She says my dad and step mom go on vacations all the time, so why didn&amp;#39;t they bring my brother on those instead of this one, when I was already going to see them next month anyway? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--She says I could have told him it wasn&amp;#39;t a good time to go. (It was a great time for my dad and my boyfriend and I, plus I was happy to be able to spend a birthday with my brother who I haven&amp;#39;t spent a single &amp;quot;so important&amp;quot; birthday with in years.) and I &amp;quot;could have done what you did to me when I&amp;#39;ve tried to go up there&amp;quot; (I told her no, it wasn&amp;#39;t a good time.) But instead, I chose sides and hurt her. Choices have consequences, and now the consequence is our relationship. Dad&amp;#39;s goal has finally been obtained: taking her kids away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to respond, told her I would only say one more time that I wasn&amp;#39;t a part of some plan that doesn&amp;#39;t exist, and that I was sorry that she felt as though we stole something from her, but the reality is that, that isn&amp;#39;t the case. I told her she wasn&amp;#39;t entitled to our birthdays or anything in our lives since we are both now adults, and the day is about him, anyway. I told her about how she acted when she was here, and that her constant victim playing is exhausting and I&amp;#39;m concerned for her. I told her I loved her, that I wanted the best for her, and when she was ready to let go of the past and move on, and can stop making everything about hurting her, then she could call me. She&amp;#39;s the only thing standing in the way of her happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sent 2 more long messages (we don&amp;#39;t really talk on the phone much. Neither of us ever call the other). The first one saying how it&amp;#39;s amazing how we&amp;#39;re the only ones who think this, but all her friends &amp;quot;see the truth&amp;quot;. She even had to go sit with her pastor because she was so heart broken and even he told her it wasn&amp;#39;t right. It seems my brother told her that he thought she knew about the trip, didn&amp;#39;t realize the timing of the days, and forgot that I would be here for his graduation. She says this is my dad&amp;#39;s manipulation. She&amp;#39;s not gonna explain anything to me anymore because it&amp;#39;s clear that I view her so negatively, and view my father so highly (To be fair, guys, my dad put myself and all of my things outside for my mom to pick up because they thought I was my mom&amp;#39;s spy, and I bought into what my mom was saying and didn&amp;#39;t like my father. We didn&amp;#39;t talk for a yearish after that.) She says I don&amp;#39;t love her, I know what love looks like because she&amp;#39;s demonstrated unconditional love to me my entire life, and this isn&amp;#39;t it. I&amp;#39;m lying to myself and i&amp;#39;ll regret this forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next one calls me heartless for talking about my problems and not having empathy for her own. She says how she went through so much with her mom abusing her, fighting with my dad during and after both pregnancies, have that same man spend years trying to take her kids from her, then her daughter grows up to be just like him. She&amp;#39;s been in more counseling hours than I could imagine, dedicated her life to Christ because it&amp;#39;s the only way she wouldn&amp;#39;t have ended her life years ago, and that I know nothing about true depression. I know nothing about her except what I chose to believe. She asks how I could call her a victim, that sounds like my step mom. She has many friends who&amp;#39;ve seen things with their own eyes and wouldn&amp;#39;t call her a victim. I&amp;#39;ve placed misplaced blame on her for my own pain growing up because her only other option was to give us up and that was never an option for her. I abuse her because it somehow makes me feel better about myself. She doesn&amp;#39;t allow pain to turn her into someone who hurts those who hurt her, including how I treated her while she was here. I&amp;#39;m blind to who I am. I never send so much as a card for holidays (I got her a birthday present, and mother&amp;#39;s day card, and a Christmas present last year, as well as a call for thanksgiving. I don&amp;#39;t participate in any other holiday.) but she sends me all kinds of things for all holidays, never let a single one go uncelebrated. But this is how I feel, since she has no right to be in my life &amp;amp; this is how I treat her after she moved me to (snowy state) in the dead of winter (I originally wasn&amp;#39;t planning on taking her up for my move, and could have easily done it without her company, but decided to invite her because I knew she was sad I was leaving), then that&amp;#39;s fine. No more relationship for us. She loves me as her daughter, but doesn&amp;#39;t like who I am and won&amp;#39;t allow that in her life. This is how a nonvictim behaves. She prays for me, and says &amp;quot;I pray that you always know how much you are loved even when everyone around you is telling you all the reasons why you aren&amp;#39;t loveable&amp;quot; Until the healing of God brings us together again, she releases me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to respond, I guess. I&amp;#39;m sad to know she isn&amp;#39;t going to be a part of my life anymore, but at the same time I can&amp;#39;t deal with this shit. I hope one day she figures out that she&amp;#39;s the problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: My mom is deluded and thinks i&amp;#39;m conspiring with my dad to hurt her when no one is doing anything to her, and is taking it out on me and telling me i&amp;#39;m a liar and i&amp;#39;m not welcome at her house anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**UPDATE at the end**\n\nReddit, guys, I really need some advice here.\n\n**Background:**\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was 10, and while they got along at first, my dad got remarried and they couldn't agree on anything after that.

How she would never do this to my dad, and that my dad isn't even planning this trip for my brother, he's planning it to hurt her, and doesn't care about my brother's birthday. She says my dad and step mom go on vacations all the time, so why didn't they bring my brother on those instead of this one, when I was already going to see them next month anyway? \n\n--She says I could have told him it wasn't a good time to go. (It was a great time for my dad and my boyfriend and I, plus I was happy to be able to spend a birthday with my brother who I haven't spent a single \"so important\" birthday with in years.) and I \"could have done what you did to me when I've tried to go up there\" (I told her no, it wasn't a good time.) But instead, I chose sides and hurt her. Choices have consequences, and now the consequence is our relationship. Dad's goal has finally been obtained: taking her kids away. \n\nI decided to respond, told her I would only say one more time that I wasn't a part of some plan that doesn't exist, and that I was sorry that she felt as though we stole something from her, but the reality is that, that isn't the case. I told her she wasn't entitled to our birthdays or anything in our lives since we are both now adults, and the day is about him, anyway. I told her about how she acted when she was here, and that her constant victim playing is exhausting and I'm concerned for her. I told her I loved her, that I wanted the best for her, and when she was ready to let go of the past and move on, and can stop making everything about hurting her, then she could call me. She's the only thing standing in the way of her happiness.\n\nShe sent 2 more long messages (we don't really talk on the phone much. Neither of us ever call the other). The first one saying how it's amazing how we're the only ones who think this, but all her friends \"see the truth\". She even had to go sit with her pastor because she was so heart broken and even he told her it wasn't right. It seems my brother told her that he thought she knew about the trip, didn't realize the timing of the days, and forgot that I would be here for his graduation. She says this is my dad's manipulation. She's not gonna explain anything to me anymore because it's clear that I view her so negatively, and view my father so highly (To be fair, guys, my dad put myself and all of my things outside for my mom to pick up because they thought I was my mom's spy, and I bought into what my mom was saying and didn't like my father. We didn't talk for a yearish after that.) She says I don't love her, I know what love looks like because she's demonstrated unconditional love to me my entire life, and this isn't it. I'm lying to myself and i'll regret this forever. \n\nThe next one calls me heartless for talking about my problems and not having empathy for her own. She says how she went through so much with her mom abusing her, fighting with my dad during and after both pregnancies, have that same man spend years trying to take her kids from her, then her daughter grows up to be just like him. She's been in more counseling hours than I could imagine, dedicated her life to Christ because it's the only way she wouldn't have ended her life years ago, and that I know nothing about true depression. I know nothing about her except what I chose to believe. She asks how I could call her a victim, that sounds like my step mom. She has many friends who've seen things with their own eyes and wouldn't call her a victim. I've placed misplaced blame on her for my own pain growing up because her only other option was to give us up and that was never an option for her. I abuse her because it somehow makes me feel better about myself. She doesn't allow pain to turn her into someone who hurts those who hurt her, including how I treated her while she was here. I'm blind to who I am. I never send so much as a card for holidays (I got her a birthday present, and mother's day card, and a Christmas present last year, as well as a call for thanksgiving. I don't participate in any other holiday.) but she sends me all kinds of things for all holidays, never let a single one go uncelebrated. But this is how I feel, since she has no right to be in my life &amp; this is how I treat her after she moved me to (snowy state) in the dead of winter (I originally wasn't planning on taking her up for my move, and could have easily done it without her company, but decided to invite her because I knew she was sad I was leaving), then that's fine. No more relationship for us. She loves me as her daughter, but doesn't like who I am and won't allow that in her life. This is how a nonvictim behaves. She prays for me, and says \"I pray that you always know how much you are loved even when everyone around you is telling you all the reasons why you aren't loveable\" Until the healing of God brings us together again, she releases me.\n\nI'm not going to respond, I guess. I'm sad to know she isn't going to be a part of my life anymore, but at the same time I can't deal with this shit. I hope one day she figures out that she's the problem. \n\n\n\n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My mom is deluded and thinks i'm conspiring with my dad to hurt her when no one is doing anything to her, and is taking it out on me and telling me i'm a liar and i'm not welcome at her house anymore.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Non-Romantic", "id": "65fq2w", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 581, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Goldenmountains", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65fq2w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.relationships", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "edited": 1492293053.0, "link_flair_css_class": "m-gn misc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/65fq2w/my_mother_43_f_has_deluded_herself_into_thinking/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492238256.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65fq2w/my_mother_43_f_has_deluded_herself_into_thinking/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "My mother [43 F] has deluded herself into thinking a situation is happening that isn't, and is mad at me [22 F] for it.", "created_utc": 1492209456.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 96, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 581}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fq2w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fq2w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fq2w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga85ur", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 52, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dearabby1", "parent_id": "t1_dg9vpx4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Idk, I mean despite her being crazy af, she's done a lot for me and sacrificed a lot so I could have and do what I want.\n\nI see that statement (or some variation) posted a lot here, as if those times are enough to constantly excuse bad behavior and problem making.

Overall it seems to help a little, but she is still the same.\n\nMaybe give this a little time to see if your mother initiates another conversation. It truly sounds like your mother has a lot she might be dealing with internally, but if refuses to get help then it's not unjustified for you to want to end the relationship. Or even put a hold on it until she gets help or realizes that she is hurting more people in her life that she doesn't need to be. If you want to be there to help her, then let her know that, but remember to keep boundaries because now that you've grown and seen how your parents are as people it is important to watch out for yourself and those you love. \n\nFamily isn't always blood; my family now are people unrelated to me but they care. So I will love them back. Your love can still be unconditional because she is your mom and she has been there for you before, but that doesn't mean she can treat you like this. Surround yourself with positive love and know you aren't the only one who cuts off contact with parents. \n\nBest of luck OP!\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy shit.

If she reacts  poorly, reinforce calmly and clearly that you are not getting angry but that you want to resolve issues in the relationship.\n\nIf that fails, go option 1.

Family is NOT forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb, is the actual saying. Those you choose to keep in your life are more important than some arbitrary biological similarity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Calm Discussion\nI&amp;#39;d recommend this option first. Sit down, explain how you feel logically. Take steps to make things as clear as possible, if she doesn&amp;#39;t understand, ask if YOU can explain it better. If she reacts  poorly, reinforce calmly and clearly that you are not getting angry but that you want to resolve issues in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that fails, go option 1.
