We we first started dating in our early 20&amp;#39;s she was a well rounded person Obviously the physical beauty was what first caught my eye, but getting to know her really made me fall for her. She had a thing about her, that she liked what she liked, whether it was popular or not, and she wasnt ashamed to get motivated about it. She had her own style....people knew, oh that looks like something your girlfriend would like, etc. She played multiple musical instruments. She did a LOT of art. She had hobbies and things she loved. \nFast forward 10 years or so. Her daily routine mostly revolves around work, household chores, and at least a few hours of instgram/reddit/snapchat/pinterest/tumblr/celebrity gossip websites/etc.  She plays a musical instrument once a month, if that. She does maybe one small art project once a year. She dresses in whatever casual thing she pulls out of the closet, and anything &amp;quot;HER&amp;quot; has been sitting for pretty much years now. Her running shoes sit in the closet...i cant remember the last time ive seen her do yoga or a workout video, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here comes the issue. My wife is gorgeous/beautiful. Not just in my eyes, i&amp;#39;ve always thought she should be a model, and so have many others. When she was younger, this meant that the guys she knew only wanted one thing. And many let her know that. They couldnt care less about her interests or personal life, she was gorgeous and they wanted in her pants. She had low self esteem, and body issues so she ate up the attention. As she has gotten older she has come to resent that attention. She HATES when guys whistle or call her on the street solely for her body. She hates when the first thing people use to describe her is beautiful, etc. She has broken down multiple times to tell me she is sick of being just a pretty girl and wants to be complimented and appreciated for her talents, skills, intellect, etc.  Which i can totally understand. But it seems her actions are working to the opposite where she is removing all the other aspects of her life, leaving only the physical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;she is setting up her life to where, that makes it hard to do. We have recently moved to a new area, and most of our newer friends have no idea her talents, hobbies, etc. Its hard to find a compliment to give to someone when they are lounging around the house for 4+ hours on a tablet looking at photos of other peoples lives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now comes the selfish part. When we first got together ,our sex life was frequent to say the least. as is normal, thats gone down, but at this point its almost non existent. She has said the reason is because she feels i only want her for her body and am no different than other guys from her past. I only show her so much attention when she comes out of the shower naked, or we get into bed together, etc.  Its demolished our sex life and negatively affecting our entire relationship. I still find her insanely attractive, and im stuck between purposely never telling her she is beautiful, which i dont like that idea......or telling her she is beautiful and have another argument over how i only want her for her body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel I show her plenty of attention and look for ways to compliment her in many aspects. I dont think im a jerk (although, how many jerks think that about themselves). I have tried to support her over the years, buying art supplies and canvas/sketchbooks (all of which sit empty in the art closet), or musical instruments (which sit hardly played in the corner), etc. I like to think of myself as extremely supportive. I dont care if it costs some money, or my time, if its something she loves, i am willing to do it/learn it/buy it, etc. But it just seems like now, there is nothing she loves (except maybe social media platforms). I have always told her how amazing she is at those hobbies or personal things. \n There is not much opportunities anymore to compliment her on things other than telling her she looks beautiful, which is just always there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is afraid of becoming &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; and having no personality, or forgettable. but that seems to be just what she is becoming (i know how rude that sounds, but i dont know how else to put it). How can i encourage her to do something for HERSELF first of all, and second of all.....that will elicit compliments about another aspect of her life that is not her body. I feel like anything i bring up to tell her this, just reinforces that she is boring and has nothing in her life worth complimenting other than her body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Wife is super talented and smart and extremely beautiful. She now resents the beautiful part, and wants to be known for the talent/smart aspect.

That was all somebody who never existed because that&amp;#39;s what he thought I wanted, and because he had no sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we were together about a year, he did a 180. We never went out. It was hours of TV, go to bed, and get &amp;quot;Wanna fool around?&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t expect constant adoration, but I do expect to feel like more than a sexual resource that was just available rather than wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to wonder if he was embarassed of me. If he wanted a relationship at all, or just a piece of ass. Our conversations stopped, anytime I would bring up anything we used to talk about, I&amp;#39;d get &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I suppose&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m not saying this is all on you, OP. But &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; you changed how you interact with her? Could at least part of what she&amp;#39;s doing be in reaction to a lack of interest she perceives from you? Maybe part of her past vibrance came from feeling her mate was interested by her and in her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg8ogey", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492168345.0, "created_utc": 1492139545.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6579yw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8pxtn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Oppenhumormaddash11", "parent_id": "t3_6579yw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1) the brain is the largest sex organ.
