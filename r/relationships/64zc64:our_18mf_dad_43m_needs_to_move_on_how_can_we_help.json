Some women might find that really endearing.  If she's receptive to the idea, I'd encourage her to go slow...ask him out for a simple cup of coffee first.  If there is any overlap with your dad's career and dentistry maybe she could even ask him out for a cup of coffee to \"get some business advice\" or something like that.\n* I think you mentioned in another commend that he has a brother.  I second *gently* enlisting the help or someone to give him a pep talk.  Specifically someone that he's close with and trusts.  It sounds like the divorce was especially crushing to your dad's self esteem and it might be scary and make him feel vulnerable to discuss those feelings.  Choose carefully who you reach out to on this.\n* Bigger picture, I think you need to find a way to get your dad to see a counselor.  Has he ever seen a counselor?  I think he's burying a lot of old emotional wounds that he never finished processing.  When you burying painful feelings they don't really ever end up healing.  You end up being stuck with them.  If you think he'd be receptive to counseling you could bring it up directly.  \n* If you want to be more indirect about it, you and your brother could tell your dad that you want to see a family counselor to discuss some things.  He sounds like an incredibly supportive dad and he'll probably help find you a counselor quickly.  When you meet with a family counselor, a common strategy is for the counselor to meet with everyone individually first and then do the group sessions.  The individual part is where you'd tell the counselor what an awesome dad you have but he hasn't finished dealing with the pain of his divorce and what you *really* want is some help steering him towards getting him into private counseling for himself.  Most counselors would jump at the chance to help a single dad who has gone above and beyond for his kids.\n* If none of these angles work out, I think you should at least try to get your dad interested in some social hobby like activities.  Maybe you can take up one of his interests as your \"hobby\" as an excuse to get involved with some club or organization.  That way when you and your brother go off to school, he'll have some friends and a small social network to lean on.\n\nEDIT - A suggestion.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of angles you can try working...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How comfortable are you with the dentist?
