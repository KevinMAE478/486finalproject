Can you get an abortion? I know it will be shitty for you, and emotional, and awful, but do you really want to be tied to a guy who comes after people with baseball bats for the rest of your life? You're 21, with so much life ahead of you. I think considering terminating this pregnancy is a very wise option for you. \n\n2. You need to call the police non-emergency number and tell them you need to move out of your apartment but that your boyfriend is violent, and there is a child involved. Request an officer to be present when you pack your things. \n\n3. Alternatively you need to leave when he is at work. I left an abusive relationship, and it's the only way you can escape. Yes you will feel bad, yes you will doubt yourself. It's normal. It doesn't mean that leaving at the safest possible time is not a good idea. Push through the doubt and have the courage to do what you know is right. \n\n4. Leave a note or send him a message that makes it abundantly clear that you desire no contact at all, and any contact will be viewed as harassment. Block him on Facebook and all other social media. DO NOT RESPOND TO HIS TEXTS OR CALLS. \n\n5. If he attempts to call you or text you, if he drives by your house, if he shows up at the house, at your work, etc you must call the police immediately. Get a paper trail started so you can get a restraining order on his violent ass. \n\n6. If you plan on having this baby, DO NOT tell him when you are in labor, and DO NOT PUT HIS NAME ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Seriously if you do nothing else in your life, this is the only thing that matters. This could save you years of violence and heartache. You put \"unknown\" on the birth certificate, and wash your hands of it. I'm telling you. I'm shouting at you. Don't be a sucker to your guilt, protect yourself and your child, and put as many barriers up between this guy and your child as you can. DO NOT put his name on the birth cert. \n\nI did this. I left an abusive man mid-pregnancy. I told him that if he wanted to see his child, he was welcome to do so: he could order a paternity test, hire a lawyer, and have his day in court. I did not put his name on anything (because he wasn't around, didn't want the kid, and wasn't present anyway) and it was the best thing I've ever done in my whole life. Seriously. If you do nothing else, do this. \n\nI met a very nice man about a year later, and we got married. He has raised this child with me, and it made the legal adoption process so much easier. We hired a good attorney, and she told me I was very very lucky. We saved ourselves thousands of dollars in court fees, and the heartache of child custody battles with an abusive psycho. My son is an emotionally healthy child because he wasn't raised by a crazy violent asshole. We are a family, and the one smart thing I did to ensure that was not make it easy for the abusive asshole to get to us. \n\nBullies will give up when they realize they are out-mustered. As soon as he figures out he's going to have to sink thousands just to get in front of a judge to hear his case, he will probably lose interest. But you must be strong! If he knows he can get what he wants by manipulating you, he will continue to torment you--and your child will be the only one who suffers for it. \n\nIf he wants to see his kid, fine. He is not legally required to be present at the birth. He can hire a lawyer, get a paternity test, and have his day in court if he wants to be part of this kid's life. You won't stop him. But you WILL NOT make it easy for him. He will have to claw and fight to get to this child. \n\nIt sucks so bad walking away from the father of your child. It sucks so bad that your child won't have their father in their life. I get it. I cried many tears. It's hard. But it's right. Sometimes things don't work out the way we want, and that's okay. Do not let your emotions dictate how you proceed here. Be smart.\n\n7. Terminate the lease AFTER YOU VACATE the apartment. Worry about everything else later! Leave, get to a safe place, THEN attack each problem one by one. That's how you do this. That's what I did. I had no idea how I was going to put one foot in front of the other. But once I got out, I figured it out. I managed. I worked hard, and it sucked sometimes, but I did it.

Push through the doubt and have the courage to do what you know is right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leave a note or send him a message that makes it abundantly clear that you desire no contact at all, and any contact will be viewed as harassment. Block him on Facebook and all other social media. DO NOT RESPOND TO HIS TEXTS OR CALLS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he attempts to call you or text you, if he drives by your house, if he shows up at the house, at your work, etc you must call the police immediately. Get a paper trail started so you can get a restraining order on his violent ass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan on having this baby, DO NOT tell him when you are in labor, and DO NOT PUT HIS NAME ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Seriously if you do nothing else in your life, this is the only thing that matters. This could save you years of violence and heartache. You put &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; on the birth certificate, and wash your hands of it. I&amp;#39;m telling you. I&amp;#39;m shouting at you. Don&amp;#39;t be a sucker to your guilt, protect yourself and your child, and put as many barriers up between this guy and your child as you can. DO NOT put his name on the birth cert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did this. I left an abusive man mid-pregnancy. I told him that if he wanted to see his child, he was welcome to do so: he could order a paternity test, hire a lawyer, and have his day in court. I did not put his name on anything (because he wasn&amp;#39;t around, didn&amp;#39;t want the kid, and wasn&amp;#39;t present anyway) and it was the best thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done in my whole life. Seriously. If you do nothing else, do this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met a very nice man about a year later, and we got married. He has raised this child with me, and it made the legal adoption process so much easier. We hired a good attorney, and she told me I was very very lucky. We saved ourselves thousands of dollars in court fees, and the heartache of child custody battles with an abusive psycho. My son is an emotionally healthy child because he wasn&amp;#39;t raised by a crazy violent asshole. We are a family, and the one smart thing I did to ensure that was not make it easy for the abusive asshole to get to us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bullies will give up when they realize they are out-mustered. As soon as he figures out he&amp;#39;s going to have to sink thousands just to get in front of a judge to hear his case, he will probably lose interest. But you must be strong! If he knows he can get what he wants by manipulating you, he will continue to torment you--and your child will be the only one who suffers for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he wants to see his kid, fine. He is not legally required to be present at the birth. He can hire a lawyer, get a paternity test, and have his day in court if he wants to be part of this kid&amp;#39;s life. You won&amp;#39;t stop him. But you WILL NOT make it easy for him. He will have to claw and fight to get to this child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sucks so bad walking away from the father of your child. It sucks so bad that your child won&amp;#39;t have their father in their life. I get it. I cried many tears. It&amp;#39;s hard. But it&amp;#39;s right. Sometimes things don&amp;#39;t work out the way we want, and that&amp;#39;s okay. Do not let your emotions dictate how you proceed here. Be smart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Terminate the lease AFTER YOU VACATE the apartment. Worry about everything else later! Leave, get to a safe place, THEN attack each problem one by one. That&amp;#39;s how you do this. That&amp;#39;s what I did. I had no idea how I was going to put one foot in front of the other. But once I got out, I figured it out. I managed. I worked hard, and it sucked sometimes, but I did it. And it was all worth it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgaeq7p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492268864.0, "created_utc": 1492240064.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gf6m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga322j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "isstronglikebull", "parent_id": "t3_65gf6m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Your first step is to talk to the police, ideally in person.
