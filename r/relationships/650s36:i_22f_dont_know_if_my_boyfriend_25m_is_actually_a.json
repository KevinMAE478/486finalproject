It&amp;#39;s definitely more of a convenience than a necessity around here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend himself only learned to drive a couple months before we met - just shy of his 24th birthday. The main issue I have with his driving is that he goes way too fast and he never leaves anywhere near enough space between him and the car in front of him. By the time we had been together for a year, he had been involved in FOUR minor accidents:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Someone hit him from the side (I wasn&amp;#39;t there so I&amp;#39;m not sure what the circumstances were)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-He was behind a truck on the highway and something flew off and badly damaged the front of his dad&amp;#39;s nice car&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-It was winter and he was following someone WAY too closely, they braked at an intersection, boyfriend was unable to stop in time and slid into a rear-end&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-He and his dad decided to do a DIY tire change. A week later we were driving and his front tire flew off. It went 2 blocks down the road at a crazy speed and it was a miracle no pedestrians or vehicles were struck by it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also openly admits that I saved him from other accidents, where if I hadn&amp;#39;t said anything he 100% would have collided - like once when he was backing out of a parking space really quick and almost struck the car behind him, I screamed his name and he stopped JUST shy of the car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just today we were going 80 on the freeway and he was riding the ass of some Jeep. I casually, calmly pointed out that if that Jeep needed to brake for any reason, we&amp;#39;d rear-end it... and be severely injured, as we are in a tiny ass Mini Cooper. He got very angry and said &amp;quot;no, I&amp;#39;m watching, I&amp;#39;d brake at the exact instant he did&amp;quot;. And I tried to tell him that he needs to account for stopping time, especially when we&amp;#39;re going so fast, and he said &amp;quot;yeah but that applies to the Jeep too, duh. Just shut up, I know more about driving than you do, so stop it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just at the end of my rope here. I try to avoid riding with him unless absolutely necessary. I just cannot understand why he is always putting our lives at risk. I don&amp;#39;t get how he can be involved in four accidents and multiple near-misses in one year and not see how HE is the common denominator, when most people aren&amp;#39;t involved in that many incidents in a DECADE of driving. I&amp;#39;m so scared he&amp;#39;s going to get himself killed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He learned how to drive from his dad who has the horrible road rage. It&amp;#39;s easy to see where my bf got it from, and he&amp;#39;s an angel in comparison. I pointed this out to him, and he openly acknowledged that his dad is a horrifying driver. But he still won&amp;#39;t change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to say to him. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR boyfriend is a scary driver who rides everyone&amp;#39;s ass and has been involved in 4 accidents in his first year of driving. What can I say to help him realize something has to change?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks for your responses, everyone. I really needed some reassurance that I wasn&amp;#39;t being overly sensitive about this. Our initial discussion about it today didn&amp;#39;t go well at all (see my comments for details) but after he had some time to cool off he apologized and said he&amp;#39;d make an effort to change. He was still a lot more dismissive about it than I would&amp;#39;ve hoped, but it&amp;#39;s progress. Now that I know for sure that it&amp;#39;s a real problem, I guess I&amp;#39;ll just have to gently keep on him about it when I notice him slipping up. Wish I could figure out why he&amp;#39;s so abnormally angry over this one issue when he&amp;#39;s normally great at conflict resolution, but I guess for now I&amp;#39;ll just take it as a bizarre one-off.
