Explain to him how you expect your lives to look after you have the kids. Don't forget the, \"EVERY day, we'll have to do X,\" and, \"Until our youngest is Y years old, we will NEVER do Z,\" and, \"I expect you to fully commit to raising our kids if we decide to have them.\" Look carefully at his facial expression and listen well to what he will say to you. Tell him, \"If you can't honestly imagine yourself being happy while living like this, I want you to tell me now.\"\n\nDo not stay with him if he doesn't say he thinks he'll be happy. Don't have any kids with him if he says he can live like that, but you won't believe him. You have to be as sure as you can reasonably be that he won't end up resenting you and the kids after they are born. \n\nAlso, did her really word it like, \"I'll have kids FOR YOU?\" If he did, I smell him putting all the responsibility for the existence of any kids you end up having together on you. Tell him that's not how it works. If he decides and agrees to starting to try for a kid with you, he's accepting half of responsibility for that child's existence. If he says yes to the trying and willingly stops using any birth control during sex, then he has exactly half of the responsibility for the outcome unless you are holding a gun to his head. He doesn't get to frame you having kids as entirely your fault just because you want them and he doesn't. If he's going to agree to have kids and then blame you for his unhappiness because he never wanted to have them, then he should leave you right now instead.\n\nYou say you love kids and I think you want them to have a good start in their lives. Do not knowingly burden them with a father that doesn't want them.\n\nIf he means it like he doesn't need to have kids, but he thinks he wouldn't mind having them with you, I think that is something that can be worked with. Absolutely ask him to participate in the planned babysitting, just don't forget to notify the parents of the kids that he will be babysitting with you. If the family doesn't know him a lot, they could have some reservations.

Explain to him how you expect your lives to look after you have the kids. Don&amp;#39;t forget the, &amp;quot;EVERY day, we&amp;#39;ll have to do X,&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;Until our youngest is Y years old, we will NEVER do Z,&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;I expect you to fully commit to raising our kids if we decide to have them.&amp;quot; Look carefully at his facial expression and listen well to what he will say to you. Tell him, &amp;quot;If you can&amp;#39;t honestly imagine yourself being happy while living like this, I want you to tell me now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not stay with him if he doesn&amp;#39;t say he thinks he&amp;#39;ll be happy. Don&amp;#39;t have any kids with him if he says he can live like that, but you won&amp;#39;t believe him. You have to be as sure as you can reasonably be that he won&amp;#39;t end up resenting you and the kids after they are born. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, did her really word it like, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll have kids FOR YOU?&amp;quot; If he did, I smell him putting all the responsibility for the existence of any kids you end up having together on you. Tell him that&amp;#39;s not how it works. If he decides and agrees to starting to try for a kid with you, he&amp;#39;s accepting half of responsibility for that child&amp;#39;s existence. If he says yes to the trying and willingly stops using any birth control during sex, then he has exactly half of the responsibility for the outcome unless you are holding a gun to his head. He doesn&amp;#39;t get to frame you having kids as entirely your fault just because you want them and he doesn&amp;#39;t. If he&amp;#39;s going to agree to have kids and then blame you for his unhappiness because he never wanted to have them, then he should leave you right now instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You say you love kids and I think you want them to have a good start in their lives.
