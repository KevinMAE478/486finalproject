We had decided to build a house before the wedding, which is set for June. It&amp;#39;s because we wanted our new house to be completely ready for us once we marry each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are living in his apartment (he and his brother inherited it from their father), and obviously, since the apartment is only half in his possession, we needed to get a house, and we&amp;#39;d managed to build it (it took two years for everything to be finished, including planning and some saving; the rest is on mortgage but it&amp;#39;s a small fee). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a joint bank account that we named &amp;quot;House&amp;quot;, and we contribute to it equally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the first problem was building the house. We had agreed to look for a 120 m2 house plan. The house floor plans he had considered were some houses with HUGE garages, only two bedrooms, but massive living and dining rooms... and I wanted a house with four smaller bedrooms (one for us, two for children once we have them and one for guests or office if needed). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, we ended up fighting, but not too much... he was saying that guests could sleep in our bedroom while we slept in the living room and if we had two kids, they could sleep in the same room... However, in the end, we agreed to have a three-bedroom house with average rooms. So, we kind of &amp;quot;met in the middle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the house is ready to move in and in the past few weeks, we&amp;#39;ve been making furniture plans. And now it makes me really angry. In the living room, he wants the leather sofas, armchairs etc, while I hate everything leather because it reminds me of offices. He wants everything black-and-white and one-dimensional. He doesn&amp;#39;t even want a carpet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want it black-and-white and one-dimensional. I mean, I don&amp;#39;t want it sketchy either, but I need it to look home-like, comfortable, lovely... and not office-like, harsh and dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been fighting about it a lot. The thing is, I don&amp;#39;t really have a picture of a perfect living room in my mind, but I know what I want to feel like inside of it. I mean, he can choose the arrangements and style if he wants to, but he has to consider my opinion on things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s been trying to explain to me that &amp;quot;office-like style is what he has been dreaming of&amp;quot;... and in my case, office-style is what I have been having nightmares of! AND whenever I would visit a house of someone who has office-like living rooms, I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable, it would have some kind of a depressing vibe to me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a control freak and I don&amp;#39;t want everything to be on my terms. I told him that. I told him he could be the one to search through catalogs, and I could be the one saying &amp;quot;no&amp;#39;&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;&amp;#39;yes&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, because there might be something we would both like... but he&amp;#39;s been choosing only the stuff I don&amp;#39;t like. And since I&amp;#39;ve been saying &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to everything, we&amp;#39;ve been fighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;#39;ve only gotten a bed and two nightstands. And we had planned to buy at least 4 more pieces of bigger furniture by now (that&amp;#39;s what our budget allows us). We can&amp;#39;t even agree on a wardrobe. He wants it dark-brown (traditionally looking) and I want it light, pale blue or pale violet, or whatever, just pale-something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve no idea how to make a compromise with this! It&amp;#39;s going to be a place that we will spend the rest of our lives in! I don&amp;#39;t want to live in a place that feels miserable to live in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to break up with him over this, of course. I mean, it&amp;#39;s not relationship-related. I really love him, and he loves me. It&amp;#39;s a great relationship. We rarely fight about relationship-related things. And we agree on many things... just not this. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell should I do, how to make compromise?

Get your big ticket items that will be classic and evolve with whatever details you choose.. design which artwork on the wall and color vase or pillows you want after you choose the big ticket items.. all that can be interchangeable throughout the years and seasons... and you can change up the look quite a bit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7xbvv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492134533.0, "created_utc": 1492105733.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655k3m", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655k3m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8kiga", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "punfull", "parent_id": "t1_dg89ek6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is the real answer.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the real answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg8kiga", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492162695.0, "created_utc": 1492133895.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg89ek6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "killingnazis1945", "parent_id": "t3_655k3m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "we are aiming for function over appearance while the kids are small.  we'll upgrade in a few years when everyone is less sticky.  \n\nno point getting nice upholstery, glass tables, etc while the house is populated with small drunk people covered in grape jelly", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are aiming for function over appearance while the kids are small.  we&amp;#39;ll upgrade in a few years when everyone is less sticky.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;no point getting nice upholstery, glass tables, etc while the house is populated with small drunk people covered in grape jelly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg89ek6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492147859.0, "created_utc": 1492119059.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655k3m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7lh9f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "masterm", "parent_id": "t3_655k3m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Put in some legwork and find what you want so you can compromise.

Nothing that was my identity and how I wanted to enjoy my space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ended up compromising and I get to kinda do what I want with my den/office.  You guys need to come together and decide what is most important to you.  Do you want to choose rooms to design yourselves?  Do you want to pickout certain things and have him pickout certain things?  Should you sit down and look over some catalogues and see if you can agree on anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can tell you&amp;#39;re very emotional at this point from your arguments.  You&amp;#39;re kind of putting his style down, even in the way you describe what he likes (dead, no life) while what you like, is the desirable (full of life, warmth, energy).  Stop doing that.   His choices are just as valid as yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In relationships a lot of things is about picking your battles.  What do you really care about?  Do they care as much or more etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg96qy5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492208564.0, "created_utc": 1492179764.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655k3m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg97w2q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SaxifragetheGreen", "parent_id": "t3_655k3m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Here's how you compromise: you start trading. \n\nYou trade the dark mahogany wardrobe in exchange for picking the couch in the living room.
