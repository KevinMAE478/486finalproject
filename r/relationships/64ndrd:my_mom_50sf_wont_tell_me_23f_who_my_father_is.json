Off the top of my head: When I was a teenager, she drove me to school each day (I had no driver's license and we didn't live on the bus route). If she didn't like how my hair looked in the morning, or she wanted me to wear a different shade of eye shadow, or she didn't like the shirt I was wearing, she would refuse to take me to school until I \"fixed\" whatever was wrong. And that's the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI guess the reason why I jump straight to \"my mom is just super controlling\" instead of \"horrifying secret that I'm better off not knowing\" is because, the older I get, the more I see how dysfunctional my family really is, and how our relationships to each other aren't healthy or normal. It's hard for me to trust what my mom tells me, and trust that she has my best interests at heart, because I'm finally understanding how much emotional damage she did to me when I was growing up.\n\nThank you again for your comment!
