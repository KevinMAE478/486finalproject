We seemed like a perfect match, compatible in nearly every way, spending every day together...and then she ghosted me over the course of a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t lie, it was terrible. Every text message had me snatching up my phone, hoping it was her. Every time I saw her car model/color I&amp;#39;d strain to see if it was her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I had to limit my exposure to her where I could to forget her: This entailed deleting her from facebook, her number from my phone, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like you&amp;#39;re in a similar boat. Chances are, even if you didn&amp;#39;t recognize it, you were hoping you&amp;#39;d get a reply of some sorts when you made that donation. You need to delete that text and her number to help you move along.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless there&amp;#39;s some benefit you anticipate getting out of the relationship, it&amp;#39;s only going to drive up bad feelings every time you see her name/number.  You wouldn&amp;#39;t really want to date someone who has acted as she had, and as such there&amp;#39;s nothing really to be said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dge1eng", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492488565.0, "created_utc": 1492459765.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wadz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge2ss5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gothicel", "parent_id": "t3_65wadz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Of course I want her back, but it isn't going to happen.\n\nAlways the first step is admitting and you have taken the first few steps.
