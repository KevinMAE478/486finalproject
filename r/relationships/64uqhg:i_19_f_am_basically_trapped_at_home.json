For no reason, other than it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;not her problem&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m literally at home 24/7 with the exception of school. I live too far for anyone to want to pick me up to hang out, so I&amp;#39;m in the house all day.

The biggest thing I want to address is the savings: a lot of people have said that this situation happens a lot and the money is usually gone.

The money &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still there, now I&amp;#39;m just thinking of a way to get her to place it into my account. Also, some people were wondering &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; exactly the money is. It was a CD that&amp;#39;s since been taken out and now is just money sitting in her savings. Grandma is still alive, lol. She lives with us. She doesn&amp;#39;t really have a say in what my mom does with the money and likely doesn&amp;#39;t really care or thinks I can&amp;#39;t handle the responsibility of it.

My program is already set up for me to transfer somewhere else, and that&amp;#39;s been the plan since before I even started college. I really just need to talk to an advisor about it when break is over so I can get to the next step of actually starting the process to transfer. The only thing about it is that I still need her tax information for FAFSA, so that&amp;#39;s really the one part that I can&amp;#39;t do without her.
