This is hard to talk about.  I hope at least some of you are patient enough to read through this and offer some advice.  I know it&amp;#39;s long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been together for 10 years and married for 5 years.  We both work pretty normal 9-5 type jobs, own a home, and have no kids, so we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of the stressors of a normal marriage, I guess you could say.  I love my wife dearly and I can&amp;#39;t imagine life without her.  I feel that I am very good to her and love her in every way possible.  I am kind, considerate, supportive, and never put her down in any way.  She is beautiful and smart and I am incredibly lucky to be married to her.  The spark and adoration of a new marriage is still there 100% for me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She loves me too, I think, but I sometimes feel like she&amp;#39;s tired of me, or that she fakes happiness when she&amp;#39;s around me.  The spark seems to be gone for her and she seems bored with day-to-day married life, I guess.  I try to plan fun things with her and we always make a point to go out on a little date at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the real root of the problem.  Within the last year and a half, she found a new gaming hobby.  I won&amp;#39;t get too much into specifics, but apparently and previously unbeknownst to me, this hobby has a pretty big online community.  She started spending a good bit of time on this new hobby and I didn&amp;#39;t really think anything of it.  She was having fun.  I even built her a new computer when she asked for one so that she could have more fun with it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think two giant problems have stemmed from this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) She is now spending so much time on this hobby that I feel like she neglects our relationship and her own wellbeing.  Even though she has to be up at 6 am for work, she&amp;#39;ll stay up until 1 or 2 am playing, and then complain that she doesn&amp;#39;t feel good or that she&amp;#39;s tired all the time.  We used to go to bed together at about 10-11 pm.  We used to do a lot of things together.  It was great.  Over the last year or so, I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ve gone to bed at the same time even once.  I try to get her to come to bed with me, but she refuses, saying that she&amp;#39;s going to stay up a while longer.  Sidenote: As you can imagine, this has killed intimacy in the relationship.  We&amp;#39;ve only had sex once in the last year.  It was, at one time in our relationship, at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I wake up at 1 am to use the bathroom and she&amp;#39;s still gaming, I walk out and tell her to come to bed, and that being up so late is bad for her.  She gets irritated with me and says she&amp;#39;s not tired, even though I know she is, based off of her complaints the next day.  She says I&amp;#39;m being controlling.  I really don&amp;#39;t think that telling my wife to come to bed so she can get at least get 4 hours of sleep is controlling.  She&amp;#39;s an adult, she proclaims.  She is, and she should be responsible enough to take care of herself, but she refuses to do so.  I don&amp;#39;t know how to get around this without her getting upset.  I honestly think there may be some addictive/obsessive component at work here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) She started to become real-life friends with some of the people from the gaming community.  There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that by itself.  Friends are good to have.  A lot of the people in the gaming community are guys.  There&amp;#39;s nothing strictly wrong with her having guy friends either.  However, I think that one of the new friendships has become incredibly inappopriate.  This guy happens to be local, around our age, and single.  Let&amp;#39;s call him Steve.  They text each other ALL the time, probably over 75 messages a day sometimes.  Most of it is relatively harmless, and just chit-chat related to work or games.  However, a while back, she started complaining about me to Steve, primarily about my telling her not to stay up so late.  She even told Steve that she sometimes wishes she wasn&amp;#39;t married and spilling her guts about the things she doesn&amp;#39;t like about me... how I&amp;#39;m an introvert and don&amp;#39;t like to be around big groups of people, don&amp;#39;t like to be up late, etc..  Steve, who I&amp;#39;ve only met in person a few times, had no words of encouragement for the marriage, instead telling her to take the path that makes her happy.  He then went on to talk about how he was previously married, and is now divorced, so on and so forth.  His language with her got really soupy at that point and he told her that he cared very deeply for her, and that he just wants her to be happy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered all this when I got on the computer one day and her chat window was still open.  Perhaps it was wrong for me to read it, but I was pretty suspicious of this guy at this point.  I confronted her about it and she, without much emotion, told me that she was frustrated about some things in our relationship and that her and Steve were just friends.  I told her that his language makes it incredibly obvious that he has feelings for her.  I asked her to confront him about it.  She did and he admitted that he is struggling with himself because he likes her as much more than a friend.  I told her that it was incredibly inappropriate and that he shouldn&amp;#39;t even allow himself to get to that point.  I told her that I don&amp;#39;t like him and that I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s appropriate for them to spend time together anymore.  She assured me that I have nothing to worry about and played the &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t you trust me?&amp;quot; card.  I told her that I don&amp;#39;t think they should see each other one-on-one in private anymore, which they had been doing once a week to play games at our house when I was at work.  Once again, she told me that I had nothing to worry about... that nothing inappropriate had happened and that nothing inappopriate would happen.  I believe her when she says that nothing physically inappropriate has happened.  Making an effort not to be &amp;quot;controlling&amp;quot;, I relented and they have spent more time together since that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, they continue to chat like crazy all day and night.  She stays up way too late and even when Steve tells her to go to sleep, she just says that she really likes talking to him.  I feel like she is trying to hide that from me now though.  I still have her Facebook login though and read back through her conversations with him.  Say what you will about that, but I have damn good reason to be doing so.  The conversations are mostly harmless still, but there is still some cause for concern.  They were having a somewhat silly conversation one day and my wife said &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; with a sort of heart/smiley emoticon thing.  He wrote that he loved her back.  Now, I know that &amp;quot;L Word&amp;quot; is thrown around a lot these days, but holy hell is it inappropriate to say, even casually and as a friend, to someone that has admitted that he has feelings for her.  I mean, I still can&amp;#39;t believe it.  I still haven&amp;#39;t confronted her about this part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this weekend, my wife is going out to lunch with her mom.  I told them I would leave them alone so they could have a girls day out.  Turns out that they are not having a girls day out.  My wife invited Steve to go out to lunch with them and didn&amp;#39;t say a thing about it to me.  I directly asked her, after plans were set in stone with Steve, if it would just be her and her mom, and she avoided the question... twice.  Earlier in her chat with Steve, she also told him that she&amp;#39;s very open with her mom and had talked to her about him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is really eating away at me.  Even if I haven&amp;#39;t been physically cheated on, I feel like I am being emotionally cheated on over and over again.  I love my wife so very much and I would be destroyed if we weren&amp;#39;t able to be together.  I want to fix this and I don&amp;#39;t know how.  Every time I try to talk to her, she clams up, and barely says a thing.  Then she acts emotionally distant afterwards and I feel like talking to her about the problem just pushes her away, and makes her upset with me.  I have proclaimed with tears streaming down my face, how her relationship with Steve makes me feel and she just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to get it.  She won&amp;#39;t end her relationship with Steve, even knowing just how upset it makes me.  I love her more than anything and I want to be with her forever, but this is tearing me apart.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.  I don&amp;#39;t want to give her a &amp;quot;him or me&amp;quot; ultimatum partly because I know that will make her angry/upset and partly because I&amp;#39;m afraid of what she might choose.  Even if she chooses me I think she may become even more secretive about her relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could attack from a different angle and tell Steve to stay the hell away from her.  I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s very strong willed and I think he just might stay away or at least try to distance himself.  Then again, he might share my message with her and make her even more upset with me.  Or he might retaliate and try to become closer to her, though this last thing seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly think my wife sees her relationship with Steve as a healthy &amp;quot;best friend relationship&amp;quot; and sees nothing wrong with it.  I should also say that my wife has a very poor social barometer.  She doesn&amp;#39;t pick up on body language or other non-verbal cues very well, and she&amp;#39;s not good at reading between the lines.  I&amp;#39;m no ultra-conservative guy socially speaking, but I think their relationship is highly inappropriate because of the way it affects our marriage, and that neither of them have done anything to move it in a different direction.  I sometimes feel like she&amp;#39;s bored of me and at any moment, she might just start to have real feelings back toward Steve, whether she intends to or not.  It might just... happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we should see a marriage counselor, but I&amp;#39;m afraid she might clam up in front of a marriage counselor too, or just refuse to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t write any more for now.  I guess I just want a reality check here and want to know what other people would do in my shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel like my wife is emotionally cheating on me with her single male best friend, and she doesn&amp;#39;t see it that way.  It is tearing me apart and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Oh boy.  This is hard to talk about.

It certainly does sound like emotional cheating. Now while I agree that Steve is an enemy to your marriage, please do not absolve responsibility from your wife. He is not a threaten in and of himself. She is allowing him to be a threat. Does that make sense? \n\nYour wife is being very unfair to you. Men and women can surely be friends, but it is, in my opinion, inappropriate and disrespectful for a married woman to carry out a friendship with a man who has feelings for her. It is disrespectful to you, her husband, and she is essentially leading the other man on. *She* may see it as merely platonic, but he evidently does not and has even admitted so himself. The fact that she continues to remain friends with him after he admitted that is not okay, imo. My boyfriend has more female friends than male, but I would absolutely be extremely uncomfortable if he had this type of a relationship with a female friend who had romantic feelings for him.\n\nRegardless of whether or not she likes him, something is wrong. No one in a happy relationship feels the way that you're feeling. The fact that she is giving more attention and love to her \"best friend\" than to you is not okay. The fact that you guys have a dead bedroom is not okay. The fact that she secretly went out on a lunch date with Steve and her mom is not okay. Nothing that she is doing is okay. \n\nYou don't deserve a relationship like this. You need to open up to your wife once and for all. If my boyfriend ever came to me with *tears* on his face, I would throw everything aside to be there for him, OP. It's sad that your wife is neglecting you like this. \n\nI know that you are scared and that you love her and want to be with her forever, but I don't know if that's foreseeable right now. It seems like that's not what she wants. OP, I have no idea what's going through your wife's head. She truly could just be gullible and naive. It doesn't matter, though. What matters is how this is affecting you. \n\nAlso, despite how tempting it may be to message Steve -- don't. Don't do it. Steve will most definitely manipulate that situation to benefit himself. He could even try to persuade your wife into seeing *you* as the bad guy. Don't do it, OP. You will fling yourself deeper into this shithole.\n\nFor now, I would recommend you get into therapy. You need an outlet for what you're feeling and you need ongoing guidance. \n\nRemember, Steve may be an enemy, but it is your wife granting him access to that title. *She* is allowing this to happen. And don't forget that *regardless* of what your wife thinks of her friendship with him, she is neglecting you and making you feel this way, and that's what actually matters.\n\nI'm sorry, OP. This was very sad to read and I hope that you can find happiness soon. You deserve a lot better than what you're getting here. I know that the thought of losing someone you love dearly is terrifying, but don't stay with someone just because you're scared to be without them. You're going to slowly wither away. Leaving, if it comes down to that, will hurt. Immensely. And that's okay. It's necessary to feel those emotions. Let yourself feel that hurt and let yourself cry, if need be. \"Grieve so that you be free to feel something else.\"\n\nSorry for the giant wall of clich\u00e9 text. I just really feel for you.\n\nEdit: One more thing! If you do end up giving your wife an ultimatum, remember, SHE DID THIS TO HERSELF. She chose to make this get to the point where you have to throw down an ultimatum. You are not the bad guy in this. Setting an ultimatum does not make you the bad guy.

It certainly does sound like emotional cheating. Now while I agree that Steve is an enemy to your marriage, please do not absolve responsibility from your wife. He is not a threaten in and of himself. She is allowing him to be a threat. Does that make sense? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your wife is being very unfair to you. Men and women can surely be friends, but it is, in my opinion, inappropriate and disrespectful for a married woman to carry out a friendship with a man who has feelings for her. It is disrespectful to you, her husband, and she is essentially leading the other man on. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; may see it as merely platonic, but he evidently does not and has even admitted so himself. The fact that she continues to remain friends with him after he admitted that is not okay, imo. My boyfriend has more female friends than male, but I would absolutely be extremely uncomfortable if he had this type of a relationship with a female friend who had romantic feelings for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not she likes him, something is wrong. No one in a happy relationship feels the way that you&amp;#39;re feeling. The fact that she is giving more attention and love to her &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; than to you is not okay. The fact that you guys have a dead bedroom is not okay. The fact that she secretly went out on a lunch date with Steve and her mom is not okay. Nothing that she is doing is okay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t deserve a relationship like this. You need to open up to your wife once and for all. If my boyfriend ever came to me with &lt;em&gt;tears&lt;/em&gt; on his face, I would throw everything aside to be there for him, OP. It&amp;#39;s sad that your wife is neglecting you like this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that you are scared and that you love her and want to be with her forever, but I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s foreseeable right now.
