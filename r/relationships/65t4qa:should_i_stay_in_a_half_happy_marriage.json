I'm in a similar boat. I don't think I can give you advice, but I can give you perspective. I'm the other half of your scenario. My story is:\n\nI've been married to my wife for 12 years. We have one child. It sounds like I'm basically like your husband. I was selfish and immature early on in our marriage, so while I wan't a \"bad\" guy in all of the traditional ways, my wife felt she was stuck with someone who didn't love or care about her. You didn't go into too much detail on your situation so I'm not sure what his side is, but for us, after a lot of conversations and counseling and introspection over the past few years, we were basically not well matched. Which is to say, we have totally different love languages. Because while I was doing what I did to her, I felt she was doing something similar to me in that she wasn't warm or affectionate toward me, which served to push me away and not engender the feelings in me that were necessary for me to be sensitive and caring toward her. It just created a nasty catch 22 that fed back on itself. I needed to feel wanted physically and respected as a man. She's a very non-sexual person and early on in the marriage, she seemed to challenge me constantly on everything, which is hard. It's hard because people don't often think of it this way or put it into words, but men have a certain need to be \"respected\" by their wives. We need to be person who's opinion on things she trusts and who she goes to with a problem that needs fixing. We want to be person she leans on and whom she adores. When we're constantly second guessed and challenged, it drives a wedge that gets bigger over time. When we're made to feel like room mates because we're with someone that is fiercely independent and we don't feel needed, it drives a wedge. She has since reflected back and realized and admitted she did this. But she thinks it was a subconscious thing in response to me being the way I am. I have reflected back and realized that I did all the stupid crap I did, not intentionally but because I was immature and selfish and had my share of character flaws. \n\nSo now, we've been having really frank conversations about whether to end it or try to fix it. We're not sure what to do because we're both almost at the point where we're apathetic toward the relationship. We have tried so many times to fix it but it's hard because when the other person isn't \"feeding\" us the way we need to be fed, it sort of takes the wind out of us and makes us feel like the clock was just reset. And after this long, it feels like an existential crisis because its our fundamental joy and happiness we're dealing with. We both feel like we're asking ourselves, \" can I just go through life not being happy\"? Because aside from this, we make a great team. We both have similar values, we have a great kid we both love. We have identical parenting style opinions and we've made a great life in terms of our house and financial situation, jobs, friends, family, etc. We've got it made in every way, except this one foundational area. We're just not in love. I don't know if there's too much baggage for her to get over. I'm not sure if she can be the person I need her to be (even if I turn into prince charming tomorrow never to change back) in terms of being able to show me physical affection and make me feel like I'm wanted. \n\nSo again, I'm sorry your'e going through that.
