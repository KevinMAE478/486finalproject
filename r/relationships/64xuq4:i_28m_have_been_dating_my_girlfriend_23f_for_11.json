I live in a foreign country, I've been with my boyfriend for over a year. I've tried, I really have. I'm studying Spanish and even a bit of Valencian daily, I am on Tandem app, I have Meetup, I have been to Interpals, I've tried Facebook events, I've tried finding people based off the video games I've played, I've tried randomly approaching people. I have still, after 1.5 yrs of being in Spain, made barely any friends.\n\nMy boyfriend has met one girl I met off of Tinder (where SO and I met) once, and she scurried away. She's vegan, very popular, very cool, has tons of friends, and is doing a really rigorous college program so she's busy, we meet maybe once every few months! And we went to a meetup recently with two cool girls and a guy but two were 37 (I'm 20 lol) and the other girl again was sportsy, very popular, very cool, has tons of friends, super busy, etc. Mom's coworkers have get-together's sometimes we attend. Had a group of guy friends who I saw but being friends with an all boys group is weird even with a shared hobby and one started getting inappropriate so I cut them all off and haven't gone out with them since (maybe a bit harsh but my relationship &gt; friendships and they were all childhood pals so if one is inappropriate it's just going to cause unnecessary drama to stay). Besides online friends, I have literally never hung out with anyone outside of my boyfriend's social group since, after 1.5 years.\n\nAnd that's OK. And it's OK for your girlfriend too. It sounds like she has a few people she can casually call \"friends\" because acquaintance would be a weird word and there's nothing for \"personas conocidas\" (\"known\" people) in English really. But it doesn't sound like she goes up much. To me all of those \"girls nights\" plans are her getting literally so excited just about girls talking about possibly meeting up with her but they always fall through because they were just casually thrown around. \n\nLook dude, you've met her family and been together for 11 months. You know her people. You said you haven't noticed her have many friends. The only time your girlfriend talks to these people is presumably on social media with that occasional \"let's meet up\" talk where no plans are actually concretely made.\n\nThe *reason* your girlfriend keeps saying \"it's a girl's night\" is because she literally doesn't go out. Do you know how weird it would be to bring your girlfriend if you only saw your friends once a year (genuinely) and they never brought SO's and it was supposed to be a personal thing or a guy thing? It would be weird to bring you to that out of state trip and it would be weird to have you tag along on 1 on 1 girl meetup time. And it might be hard for you to understand because you're social and you see your friends all the time and probably have closer bonds with them but she's not social and this is her life.\n\nIt's simply a matter of how she lives. And as the person who is exactly like this girl in the situation, some of these comments are so offensive. It's not that you're embarrassing or that she thinks they're embarrassing, she literally just doesn't go out much. And it's not like a red flag at all because she makes an effort to go out *for you* and *with your friends*. She just simply isn't social enough to maintain a sick social life or is too busy or just super introverted and that's okay. Nothing's wrong with her and you just need to be patient. She's not deliberately hiding you from her friends, she just doesn't have any and only sees them in such rare times that it would be weird to bring the boyfriend along to introduce because she's probably practically re-introducing herself to them given the considerable time period between meetups.\n\nJust chill and it'll happen eventually.

I have still, after 1.5 yrs of being in Spain, made barely any friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend has met one girl I met off of Tinder (where SO and I met) once, and she scurried away. She&amp;#39;s vegan, very popular, very cool, has tons of friends, and is doing a really rigorous college program so she&amp;#39;s busy, we meet maybe once every few months! And we went to a meetup recently with two cool girls and a guy but two were 37 (I&amp;#39;m 20 lol) and the other girl again was sportsy, very popular, very cool, has tons of friends, super busy, etc. Mom&amp;#39;s coworkers have get-together&amp;#39;s sometimes we attend. Had a group of guy friends who I saw but being friends with an all boys group is weird even with a shared hobby and one started getting inappropriate so I cut them all off and haven&amp;#39;t gone out with them since (maybe a bit harsh but my relationship &amp;gt; friendships and they were all childhood pals so if one is inappropriate it&amp;#39;s just going to cause unnecessary drama to stay). Besides online friends, I have literally never hung out with anyone outside of my boyfriend&amp;#39;s social group since, after 1.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s OK. And it&amp;#39;s OK for your girlfriend too. It sounds like she has a few people she can casually call &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; because acquaintance would be a weird word and there&amp;#39;s nothing for &amp;quot;personas conocidas&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;known&amp;quot; people) in English really. But it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like she goes up much. To me all of those &amp;quot;girls nights&amp;quot; plans are her getting literally so excited just about girls talking about possibly meeting up with her but they always fall through because they were just casually thrown around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look dude, you&amp;#39;ve met her family and been together for 11 months. You know her people. You said you haven&amp;#39;t noticed her have many friends. The only time your girlfriend talks to these people is presumably on social media with that occasional &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s meet up&amp;quot; talk where no plans are actually concretely made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; your girlfriend keeps saying &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s a girl&amp;#39;s night&amp;quot; is because she literally doesn&amp;#39;t go out. Do you know how weird it would be to bring your girlfriend if you only saw your friends once a year (genuinely) and they never brought SO&amp;#39;s and it was supposed to be a personal thing or a guy thing? It would be weird to bring you to that out of state trip and it would be weird to have you tag along on 1 on 1 girl meetup time. And it might be hard for you to understand because you&amp;#39;re social and you see your friends all the time and probably have closer bonds with them but she&amp;#39;s not social and this is her life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply a matter of how she lives. And as the person who is exactly like this girl in the situation, some of these comments are so offensive. It&amp;#39;s not that you&amp;#39;re embarrassing or that she thinks they&amp;#39;re embarrassing, she literally just doesn&amp;#39;t go out much. And it&amp;#39;s not like a red flag at all because she makes an effort to go out &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;with your friends&lt;/em&gt;. She just simply isn&amp;#39;t social enough to maintain a sick social life or is too busy or just super introverted and that&amp;#39;s okay. Nothing&amp;#39;s wrong with her and you just need to be patient. She&amp;#39;s not deliberately hiding you from her friends, she just doesn&amp;#39;t have any and only sees them in such rare times that it would be weird to bring the boyfriend along to introduce because she&amp;#39;s probably practically re-introducing herself to them given the considerable time period between meetups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just chill and it&amp;#39;ll happen eventually.
