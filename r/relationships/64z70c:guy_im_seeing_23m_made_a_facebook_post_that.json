Based on you being tight-lipped about your own past, I can assume you haven't also had the \"pulled yourself out of poverty\" experience. He's actually been there - you're just assuming when he says \"shit life\", filling in the blanks with your own idea of what \"the poors\" live like and assuming he meant the same thing as you.

You're serious??\n\nI think your assumptions about their lives are just as bad as his rant - just rooted in middle-class pity rather than anger. \"Oh, those unfortunate poors, they just can't help but steal, they have to have crack money!\" You've got a healthy dose of superiority complex, but you're not actually superior.\n\nLet it go. When he's saying \"lazy\", he's speaking from his own experience. It's the same as when people who are infertile get angry and vent when others have accident babies, or people who scrabbled to a position at work get angry and vent when others get hired by their daddies to a better-paying job.\n\nEdit: I just want to add on seeing your comment that \"his assumptions turn me off\".

I&amp;#39;ve had this happen to me. I come from upper middle class too but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I can just laugh at someone breaking into my car, having to pay the deductible to get the damage fixed, and not being able to really afford to replace any valuables that were stolen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My house was broken into and someone stole my Xbox 360 back when they cost around 200+. That was a really terrible thing to happen to me because I didn&amp;#39;t have the money then and it sucked that someone would steal from me and make me feel like my neighborhood was unsafe. I was angry as all hell and couldn&amp;#39;t think of who would do something like that to me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His anger is justifiable. Even if he is upper white middle class that sort of financial set back sucks. And the only reason why its happening to him is because someone decided to be a shitty human being. I get empathizing or being politically correct but this isn&amp;#39;t the time for that. Now if he was like &amp;quot;DAMN N***** BROKE INTO MY CAR!&amp;quot; I could understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg6etso", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054317.0, "created_utc": 1492025517.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 140}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z70c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6gkgj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 84, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ailee43", "parent_id": "t3_64z70c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "he was angry, he didnt label any larger group, or berate \"poor people\" in general.
