I have enjoy being physically affectionate, but I don&amp;#39;t like favor exchanges because it ends up with people doing things for me I don&amp;#39;t need or want, and me having to take the time and energy to receive them and to give them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, I had an ex who wanted to who would cook for me all the time. I would end up helping her a lot and it made the process of eating take hours sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciated, objectively, that this was a way she expressed her affection for me. But it was both exhausting for me to spend so much time on food when I normally spend like fifteen to twenty minutes eating at night including setup and cleaning, and it was exhausting for me to try to reciprocate such an effort because I could sympathize with but not empathize with her wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even asked her if she could spend less time and energy doing things for me (like how we were when we were &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot;), but we were unable to communicate on the same wavelength and ultimately I had to break up with her.

I grew up very independent even though I'm the youngest of 3. I've always paved my own way and I'm fine interacting with others, but I'm perfectly happy doing my own thing. I don't need/want to give to others or take from others. \n\nExcept I do like all the benefits of a relationship without the actual commitment of a relationship and expectation that comes with them.\n\nAs I always explain to others, my dream relationship is 'together apart'. We enjoy being together, but we also prefer doing our own thing more often/not. I can't stand being wrapped up in another person or expected to make concessions with my time/money to please them when I don't ask/expect the same in return.\n\nI'm 23F and I solve this problem by doing casual relationships or 'fwb'. Though it's more that I now just date guys with the same mindset. Usually, they're workaholic career types that just want the fun and fluff of girlfriend but none of the seriousness and commitment of girlfriend.\n\nMaybe one day Ill change, but to do myself and everyone else a favor I don't play at relationships because I know they're too much work and people generally want to be wanted and needed by their partner and I'm just not at the point in my life where I want to bother with all of that... \n\nSo yeah... Either you need to learn how to be a better boyfriend and make the sacrifices needed to have a girlfriend (giving and taking even if you don't want to/don't need it for yourself) or just realize you're better rocking a single life.

We enjoy being together, but we also prefer doing our own thing more often/not.
