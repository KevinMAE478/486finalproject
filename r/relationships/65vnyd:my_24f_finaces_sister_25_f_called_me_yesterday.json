My fiance and I just got engaged about a week ago. My mom decided to take us out for a celebratory dinner, and invited my little brother, and my fiance&amp;#39;s sister (Sarah). I thought the night was going well, I haven&amp;#39;t seen my little brother in a while so we had some bonding time which I really enjoyed. Sarah decided to bring a friend of hers as well, which I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting, but was fine with. My mom was really kind and paid for her and her friend as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family has sort of a weird relationship. We&amp;#39;re super close with each other, but we joke around a LOT. We basically make fun of each other in a joking way, and have been this way since I can remember. My fiance thinks it&amp;#39;s hilarious, and has joined in on it and vice versa since we started dating. My mom and brother make fun of him right back, so it&amp;#39;s all in good fun, and they get along great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Sarah called me randomly at first asking what we were up to, and then randomly said how she didn&amp;#39;t enjoy the engagement dinner at all, and how I upset her and her friend. Basically her and her friend thought my brother and I were super rude towards my mom, and said that I made her and her friend uncomfortable the whole night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologized that they felt that way, and explained that we grew up differently and that my family just has a different relationship than hers. She was still upset though and said that I was ungrateful and that she wishes that our moms&amp;#39; situations were switched and that she would trade my mom&amp;#39;s life to have her mom back in a heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pretty offended at that point, because yes, I&amp;#39;m so sorry that they lost their mom, but I don&amp;#39;t think it warrants her basically saying she wishes my mom was dead so that she could have hers back. I just re-iterated that I&amp;#39;m sorry they felt that way, and hung up pretty soon after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how to handle this now. Sarah is supposed to be a bridesmaid to my wedding, but right now I don&amp;#39;t even want to speak with her after that call. I haven&amp;#39;t told my fiance about it yet because I wanted to take some time to think about this. Any advice on how to move forward? I obviously haven&amp;#39;t been in Sarah&amp;#39;s shoes, so I&amp;#39;m having a hard time seeing it from her perspective..
