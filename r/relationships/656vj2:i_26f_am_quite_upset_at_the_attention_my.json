A useful phrase I&amp;#39;ve learned towards compliments is &amp;quot;My boyfriend thinks I&amp;#39;m cute, too!&amp;quot; then a smooch for him. Any comments towards him being unattractive will be met with &amp;quot;Wow, how rude&amp;quot;. These girls aren&amp;#39;t going to listen to you, so it would be nice for your boyfriend to shut them down. They are interfering with a good night out thinking they have a shot. They don&amp;#39;t. They won&amp;#39;t believe it from your mouth, but they will from his.
