A relationship no longer seems *so necessary.* They're nice, if I meet someone who I like then sure, but I don't NEEEEEEEEED one the way I used to. It doesn't validate me the way it used to. I find my validation through making myself into the person I want to be, rather than proving to myself that I can make people love me.
