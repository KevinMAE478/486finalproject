Boyfriend is 25. We&amp;#39;ve been together for over 2 years and have been living together for almost a year (July is when our 1 year lease is up)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad has always had problems with his health. I grew up with him being overweight and being unhealthy. He eventually had his toes amputated due to diabetes and eventually became so overweight he needed help walking. I really think my dad had an addiction to food and he just never got help for it. Despite his health problems, my dad was ALWAYS there for me. My mom took off when I was 3 and never looked back. My dad worked his ass off to support me as a single parent. Yeah there were times he messed up but I always knew he had my back if something ever went wrong and I could go to him about absolutely anything if I needed to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live almost 800 miles from my dad. When my boyfriend and I were looking for places to move to, he wanted to move to a city that has a higher cost of living and wanted to be closer to his parents who aren&amp;#39;t in the best of health and are even older than mine. I relented and we moved. My boyfriend makes more significantly than I do, but he insists we split everything 50/50. It&amp;#39;s actually caused arguments between us before. Even if I&amp;#39;m sometimes struggling during the month until payday, instead of it causing a fight, I pay 50% o f all the bills to keep him happy and complacent. I have given up a lot to make him happy and I think that&amp;#39;s part of why I&amp;#39;m just so angry at him over this. It doesnt help that in the past I have had issues with spending - he likes to bring up the fact I once got myself into a small amount of debt and insists that keeping everything 50/50 is a way to make sure I don&amp;#39;t put myself back in the same amount of debt or worse. My boyfriend has also persuaded me many times not to get a credit card because of how much I damaged my credit when I was young and reckless at 18 just starting out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad passed away from a heart attack in his sleep on Friday. Ive been more a wreck than ever since then. I had plans  to at least call him on Easter and see how his went. Despite his health issues my dad has always been my best friend. When my uncle called me on tuesday to tell me my dad was gone I was ready to go back home. , the first thing I did was look into how much it would cost for me to go back home. I don&amp;#39;t own a car (everything is within walking distance so there&amp;#39;s really no need) and after doing some math, I realized I was short on the cost. I asked my boyfriend if he could help me out with the rest of the cost of the plane ticket, and he told me no. It hurt to hear but my boyfriend has always been a penny pincher and selfish with his money. When i told him it was for my dad&amp;#39;s funeral he said he didn&amp;#39;t care. There was no point in going to mourn a &amp;quot;dead fatass&amp;quot; who he &amp;quot;never liked&amp;quot; He t said he just didn&amp;#39;t see a point. He then said there was no reason for me to go. I was just wasting my time by going. That it would just be money wasted&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got angry and yeleld at him and called him an asshole for being so mean. I&amp;#39;m so disgusted by his comment. I know, it&amp;#39;s his opinion and he&amp;#39;s right to have one, but god damn I just lost my dad. I&amp;#39;m really tempted to pack a bag and leave for a while, because he didn&amp;#39;t have to say such hurtful and shitty things, but I don&amp;#39;t know if that will do more harm than good. I&amp;#39;m really upset, and angry at him, and have told him this, and he just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to give a crap. He just said &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; and started playing video games, completely ignoring me. If he&amp;#39;s thought about apologizing, he hasn&amp;#39;t shown me any interest in doing so&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think what he can be forgiven. I&amp;#39;m trying really really hard to see it from his point of view but I just can&amp;#39;t. Am I wrong for asking him to be a supportive partner and help? Am I wrong for thinking he would loan me the money and let me pay him back over time? He says I am but I don&amp;#39;t think so. I&amp;#39;m thinking of getting a payday loan so I can be there and say goodbye to my dad.
