Shrieking, intense pain. Like rolling on the floor in agony type stuff, its really, really bad. I told my girlfriend at a dinner type situation, because this was a big deal, and she kind of was just confused, &amp;quot;its just headaches? Cant you take some tylenol? They go away in 40 minutes, why are they so bad?&amp;quot; and I just kind of lost hope for truly telling her what it is. I also got one in the place we were eating and tried to hide it by going to the bathroom for 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, when we got home, I got another one about 3 hours later, and I was just rolling on the floor in pain while she was SUPER confused. Afterwards I just cried on her shoulder (it DRAINS you emotionally) and told her all this stuff about how painful my life has been and how horrible its been and how much this just adds onto everything. I am a war orphan, I was a heroin addict, I have IBS, it has all just been this compounding pain on me and I just kind of told her everything. I am not the type of person to do this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... she didn&amp;#39;t really respond the way I thought she would, with comfort and sympathy, instead she just put me to bed and left the room.

But I was so emotionally drained that I decided to not go to work. It kind of hit me that my entire life now is going to be done for, I have no real future with these. Even ONE is enough to literally drain the energy from me for days on end.

She then quietly said &amp;quot;alright...&amp;quot; and left to her job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its been two days, and since then she has just been quiet and reserved, every time I tell her about my agony she just kind of sits there with this dumbstruck look on her face. She has seen me midst heachache and was a bit more comforting, but when it was over she kind of just had no idea what to do, she looked... upset, not WITH me but almost FOR me. Almost as if she hated the fact that I got these head aches because they intruded on her life rather than mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have been going out a while now.

If she has had a bad, but not migraine level headache, without access to meds, she may have experienced the \"anything that touches any part of me makes me hurt more\" sensation.
