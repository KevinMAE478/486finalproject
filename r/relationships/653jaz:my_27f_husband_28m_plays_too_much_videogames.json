Sorry I haven&amp;#39;t gotten to reply to all of you but please know I appreciate the opinions. Didn&amp;#39;t expect this thread to get popular. (I would love to hear more people&amp;#39;s daily routines, to see what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; and how they moderate their hobbies!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit friends. Special account just for this topic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my husband of 5 years is my dream guy. I love him, he is the best guy, this isn&amp;#39;t a divorce situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this concise. We both work full time, but I also do 95% of the housework. He spends most of his day playing videogames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we were dating, it was mostly xbox stuff. We could sit on the couch together and have an open line of communication, with me occasionally showing him something funny on reddit, both doing our own thing while still cuddled up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we got married. Things were still fine until he starts playing League of Legends. Now he&amp;#39;s at a desk, away from me, unable to talk to me for 45 minutes at a time. &lt;strong&gt;However,&lt;/strong&gt; he does get off, after the current game, if I ask him to do something or if I ask him to hang out with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking. &lt;em&gt;Another needy girl complaining about gaming! Can&amp;#39;t she just let him have a hobby?&lt;/em&gt; Most hobbies don&amp;#39;t consume your entire fucking day! Literally 12 hours a day on his days off, and when he&amp;#39;s not playing, he&amp;#39;s on his phone watching streams of other people playing!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyway, baby comes into the picture. Yes, we have a wonderful two year old and hubby is a great, doting, father. If I&amp;#39;m at work while he&amp;#39;s off (happens once or twice a week) he&amp;#39;s an excellent parent and doesn&amp;#39;t play games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, baby comes and he&amp;#39;s still playing league though. Which is hard because I&amp;#39;m still doing all the housework &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; taking care of a baby. &lt;strong&gt;Sooooo,&lt;/strong&gt; he quit league! Compromised and quit his favorite game, which I appreciate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#39;s a new game. I must admit this is a much more positive community, and I like that the games don&amp;#39;t last very long. So if I ask him to get off, it&amp;#39;s only a 5 minute delay instead of an hour. He is an important member of his clan and has online friends. It&amp;#39;s a very happy thing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except all fucking day????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a day where we&amp;#39;re both off work, no social plans or anything, here is my typical day:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spend all night with toddler waking up to nurse every 3 hours.  (She&amp;#39;s a crap sleeper lol) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8am Awake with baby. Cook breakfast, empty dishwasher and load it while cooking. Feed/clean/dress baby, take the dog out, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10ish Take baby to some kind of toddler activity mom group thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12ish Home and greet hubby, who is playing video games. Put toddler down for a nap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Child napping! Quick! Have sexy time! Or go to the grocery store! Or take the dog to the vet! Or eat something!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1ish Hubby back on the games. Feed everyone lunch (baby has 2 &amp;quot;lunches&amp;quot;). More dishes, laundry, playing with baby, taking dog out, meal prep for the upcoming days I work, cooking dinner for tonight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5ish Tell hubby to get off the games and play with baby so I can scramble to get stuff done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6ish Dinner! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6:15 Hubby has finished eating and is back on games (unless I explicitly ask him not to and then watch his bored face the rest of dinner).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6:30 Me and baby are done eating. Now I try to entertain baby while cleaning up and putting the dishes in the dishwasher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bathe baby, do bedtime routine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8:00 Baby bedtime. This will take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour of sitting in the dark nursing kid to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9ish Sometimes I fall asleep with baby. Sometimes, if she actually sleeps like a normal kid, I can go out to the living room and hubby and I can have quality time. But then I also have to shower and all that stuff. If it&amp;#39;s a work-night, I have to be up at 5am. After I go to bed hubby will stay up playing games a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually timed his game play the last day we had off together, and it was 10.5 hours. Would have been more imo, but we went out with friends that evening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only time we get quality family time is if we&amp;#39;re out of the house. At the aquarium or something. And you can&amp;#39;t just do that all day every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I used to think I was getting angry about the lack of help with chores, but I realized it&amp;#39;s not that. It&amp;#39;s the lack of conversation. I told him this. I watch how other families sit around, TV on, maybe looking at their phones, but everyone is all kinda talking. Or maybe a couple will sit out on the porch together. Is this an unrealistic expectation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His rationale is: Watching TV is the same as gaming as far as quality time. (I disagree. You can multi-task with the TV on in the background. You can still play with your kid and have light conversation.) Also he always gets off when I need him to. And he quit league. Gaming is his hobby and makes him happy, it&amp;#39;s part of who he is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing that&amp;#39;s really brought this to a head though, is now that our daughter is older, she tries to get his attention. She doesn&amp;#39;t understand the &amp;quot;right after this match&amp;quot; delay, and gets visibly upset when daddy won&amp;#39;t play right this second. Or like today he was spinning her around, but the match started so he was like &amp;quot;okay here&amp;#39;s your toys&amp;quot;. The look on her face...heartbreaking. He doesn&amp;#39;t realize this though and thinks everything is fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have already told him I want him to only play at night, no more while baby is awake! Today he still played 5 hours while baby was up. (Edit) He also cleaned up and vacuumed while I was out without me asking...so hey, it&amp;#39;s an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question for you, reddit friends: What do you do all day? Do you and your family actually spend time together all day? And how?&lt;/strong&gt; My husband gets bored so easily it seems. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Hubby games all day while I do everything alone.

All three of us play video games - a lot. We're a gaming family and it's great and I love it. PC master race!\n\n\nHere's the thing though. We all three do chores *before* we game. Kiddo sweeps and tidies up. BF does dishes, vacuums, cleans litter boxes, etc. I clean the bathroom, mop the floors, fold the laundry. We have a chore chart and our responsibilities shift around as needed but mostly we stick to the chart. Why are you doing all of the work with a baby to boot? That's not right.

I've seen many people sink into gaming addiction and never get out of it. Their lives suffered greatly as a result. I have a friend in my clan going through a divorce right now because his wife just had their second child and he is not getting up off of the computer to help raise the baby. In spite of that, every single night he is online for hours, blocking out his responsibilities. There were a few times when I heard his first-born come to the computer and try to play with him and he yelled for his wife to come and take her so he could get on with his game. It's so sad.\n\n\nIt's important to balance video games with other things. We explore nature trails on the weekends. My daughter loves to read so she spends more time buried in a book than gaming. My dogs get walks every day. If your husband is not willing or capable of moderating his video game time then the sad truth is he is not a good father and role model for your child, and not a good partner for you. He needs to set limits on the amount of time he is online now or it is likely his addiction will continue to get worse.

Your husband should be doing at least half of the chores, and he should be a father to his child and put down the games every time his daughter wants his attention. He is teaching her that she is not important to him, and chances are it is going to negatively affect her down the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a cap on how much we are allowed to play in a day, because if left unchecked gaming can become a very strong addiction as you are seeing with your husband. I&amp;#39;ve seen many people sink into gaming addiction and never get out of it. Their lives suffered greatly as a result. I have a friend in my clan going through a divorce right now because his wife just had their second child and he is not getting up off of the computer to help raise the baby. In spite of that, every single night he is online for hours, blocking out his responsibilities. There were a few times when I heard his first-born come to the computer and try to play with him and he yelled for his wife to come and take her so he could get on with his game. It&amp;#39;s so sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to balance video games with other things. We explore nature trails on the weekends. My daughter loves to read so she spends more time buried in a book than gaming. My dogs get walks every day. If your husband is not willing or capable of moderating his video game time then the sad truth is he is not a good father and role model for your child, and not a good partner for you. He needs to set limits on the amount of time he is online now or it is likely his addiction will continue to get worse. That&amp;#39;s just my first-hand experience - take it or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7itdz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492118169.0, "created_utc": 1492089369.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jaz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jaz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jaz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jaz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7hyjc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SpouseOfGamer", "parent_id": "t1_dg7h2fz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg7hyjc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116895.0, "created_utc": 1492088095.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7h2fz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sleepisgr3at", "parent_id": "t1_dg7f88c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've seen you ask this question a couple times OP so I thought I'd answer too. \n\nOn the weekends, In most families with young children everyone just hangs out until the kids go to bed.

That&amp;#39;s our special time and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s up to your husband to decide what is a priority for him.
