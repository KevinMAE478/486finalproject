Our interaction was always friendly but we didn&amp;#39;t hang out outside of sports. Then I went away for college and would see her maybe once a year when I visited home. She stayed in A for college. Now I am graduated and living on my own a few hours away in a city we&amp;#39;ll call B. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laura started a new relationship and moved outside of B with Tyler after 3 months of dating. Then out of the blue I get a text from her telling me all about this horrid verbal abuse he has put her through and that she took a lot of pills and was in the hospital. He broke up with her afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now she had nowhere to live because her place in A was owned by a friend who found a new roommate (which Laura thought was awful but I find understandable) and they also had a falling out (which I&amp;#39;ve noticed is a pattern with her). She still had some classes to finish in A, but just started a new part time job in B. Her parents tell her if she moves back in with them in A, they will pay for the rest of her college and everything else. The only exception is she can&amp;#39;t bring her dog, Rocco, which they were against her getting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a very protective friend and she was at rock bottom, so I offered to help. She wanted to keep her job in B part time so I let her stay at my place while she looked for a new apartment, and asked my parents to watch Rocco in the meantime. They were generous enough to do so (they live on a ranch with multiple dogs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stayed at my place for a little over a month free of charge. When she did find a place, they didn&amp;#39;t allow dogs. My parents are again generous enough to say that since Rocco gets along so well with our dogs, he can stay part time until she graduates (which was 9 months away).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She starts to overstay her welcome a bit, but I kept letting it slide because of what a low point she was at. I don&amp;#39;t visit home very often, about once every other month. But I hadn&amp;#39;t been home in 6 months without her being there, lingering or even sleeping in my bed once (so I had to sleep on the couch). I&amp;#39;ve also done large amounts of favors for her at this point, including helping her move out of her ex&amp;#39;s place an hour away, twice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start to get miffed when all this is taken for granted. She&amp;#39;ll do things like ask me to pay her back for the one drink she bought me the night before. I think she is so delusional that she doesn&amp;#39;t even think about the free rent, dog care, drinks, gas money, I have spent on her. If I ask a small favor, she won&amp;#39;t respond or she&amp;#39;ll tell me she&amp;#39;s ready when she knows it&amp;#39;s too late.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all comes to a head when we had an event in B. I&amp;#39;m going with a group of my friends and she asked months earlier to tag along. She tells me she can&amp;#39;t pick up her ticket (which she did pay for) so I do so for her. I let her know the plans a week in advance, then text her the night before with no response, and once again the morning of just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then texts me back 5 minutes before the event starts, that she&amp;#39;s on her way. We were no longer at the pregame and I had left her stuff there because I hadn&amp;#39;t gotten a response in two days and wasn&amp;#39;t going to carry her bag of stuff around with me all day. She blows up at me. I kind of told her off a little bit and she left me alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She goes to my parents house to get her dog, and according to my mom she just stands in the door for 5 minutes crying (presumably for attention or comforting). My mom just ignored it. Laura told my mom I owed her money for the event that I &amp;quot;ditched&amp;quot; her at, so my mom paid her. Laura also said she would be taking Rocco and leaving for awhile. I thought it was all finally over with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call my mom a few days ago to catch up, and can hear Rocco barking in the background. I specifically told my parents that if she asked if her dog could return, they must tell her to talk to me. I don&amp;#39;t want this girl using us anymore. My mom lied to me at first, and then concedes and told me it&amp;#39;s because one of our dogs was lonely without Rocco. I tell her I have to go and haven&amp;#39;t heard from her since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I get a text from Laura saying &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, so I know you&amp;#39;re mad at me, and I&amp;#39;m also upset with you. But I honestly don&amp;#39;t understand why you are upset with me, if anything you ditched me and left me hanging on a day I specifically took off and worked really hard for. I&amp;#39;m sorry if I hurt you in any way, but it is no reason to be upset with your mom for watching Rocco when I&amp;#39;m in A and he has nowhere to go. Your family has been so great to me and I am very thankful for that. I am just really upset and just don&amp;#39;t understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even just retyping that has me livid. I&amp;#39;m not yet sure what my mom said to her. I guess my question is what do I say/do at this point? I do not want to be friends with this girl. I know I can&amp;#39;t lay into her (even though I want to) so I want to be mature, but am unsure the best way to go about it. I also am unsure what to do with my parents. Help!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Acquaintance of mine has somewhat of a breakdown, my family and I help her, and now she&amp;#39;s overstaying her welcome and trying to get in between my parents and I. Help! What do I say to her (see above quotes) and how to deal with parents?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you for all of your replies thus far! I am reading each one.

It is your parents&amp;#39; decision to keep Rocco, so just leave that between your parents and her.  They know how you feel about it already, so talking about it with them anymore is just going to lead to problems.  If THEY bring up Laura, just be firm in your decision to no longer be friends.  You don&amp;#39;t owe any explanations and they know you.  If you act like the bigger person by refusing to discuss it, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what she says because she will just dig herself a hole and they will start to realize how she is on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg4lrvs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960949.0, "created_utc": 1491932149.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64prv8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4lzbw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "135791357", "parent_id": "t3_64prv8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"I am upset with you because you didn't respond to my texts in the days leading up to (event), and then had the nerve to blame me for leaving without you, and even demanding money from my parents.
