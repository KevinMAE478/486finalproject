Really, it&amp;#39;s a moment to prove love through the most physical means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the truth -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;first time sex tends to be awkward&lt;/em&gt;. Painful for some women. And sort of bizarre. If you two had at least some physical experience with each other, then you&amp;#39;d be fine. But you don&amp;#39;t, and it&amp;#39;s likely going to be a whole rush of awkwardness and nothing like she&amp;#39;s imagining. She may take those emotions (along with the inevitable religious guilt) and apply them to the overall relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saying, take baby steps.
