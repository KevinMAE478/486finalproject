[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "relationships", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dating my girlfriend for over a year now and things for the most part have been great. However, lately things in the bedroom have become frustrating and have really been turning me off from wanting to have sex with her and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sex is usually very good for me and I always make sure she is enjoying it as well. She never turns me down for sex and is always up for it when I initiate sex with her. The bigger problem is after we are done having sex she always complains. Sometimes its little subtle comments like &amp;quot;well if we didn&amp;#39;t have sex all the time I could have gotten this done&amp;quot; or just flat out saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m tired at work all the time because we had sex&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s extremely frustrating because she never complains and never turns me down before sex yet complains after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;: We got into an argument a few weeks back and her big thing was &amp;quot;I always give you sex and I&amp;#39;m always tired or can&amp;#39;t get things done when I need to because we were having sex&amp;quot;. When in reality we only have sex a few times a week(sometimes only one or two times). There have been a few occasions where we&amp;#39;ve had sex during the day and needed to do errands that had to be postponed because of it. She seems to stick to those few times and forget that... well it was just a few times and since she complained about it the first time I&amp;#39;ve never done it again. Now she sticks to those snide comments every chance she can get after we have sex. It&amp;#39;s beyond frustrating to hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus my girlfriend has gained some weight over the year we have been dating and it has made her really insecure. I don&amp;#39;t mind it and I still find her as beautiful as the day I met her. It&amp;#39;s just that lately when we have sex she gets upset about her body and tries to hide away from me by keeping most of her clothes on to shield herself or forcing me to turn out the lights... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been turning me off so much. I have sat down and tried discussing with her, but she just Stonewalls me and says snide/rude remarks about how I&amp;#39;m always demanding something. Then when I get fed up with dealing with her acting like that she breaks down and cries apologizing and nothing ends up getting done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit2&lt;/strong&gt;:I&amp;#39;ve asked her to please not be so negative before, during, and after sex. She tends to berate/put herself down because of her looks and or body image. I&amp;#39;ve asked her not to feel obligated to have sex with me and to turn me down if she wasn&amp;#39;t feeling in the mood. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told her that her lack of initiation or enthusiasm when it comes to anything sexual makes me feel like she doesn&amp;#39;t want me.  I&amp;#39;ve even told her all the things I&amp;#39;ve listed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked her what&amp;#39;s wrong if anything on my side that I can change that would make things better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a very direct person and also I&amp;#39;ve been raised to be an open person and have never been afraid to say whats on my mind. I&amp;#39;ve told her everything I&amp;#39;m posting here in this thread and even some of the things people are recommending me as I&amp;#39;ve thought about this subject before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing really seems to work. She just gives me this look its a deadpan look. It&amp;#39;s one of those looks where you know the other person really isn&amp;#39;t paying attention. However, she is quick to pick out one or two words from everything I&amp;#39;ve said and throw them back at me like I was trying to insult her in some way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to break up with her because other than this I think she&amp;#39;s great but... lately I enjoy masturbating more than even bothering with sex... Is there anything I can do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit3&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;m very conflicted after reading some responses. I feel like breaking up is the easy way out. I&amp;#39;ve always been raised with the &amp;quot;diamond in the rough&amp;quot;(is this the correct saying) type mentality. Where If do my best and try my hardest things will play out perfectly in the end. However, I can&amp;#39;t honestly tell if it&amp;#39;s me thinking negatively and things in this relationship are better than I think they are or they&amp;#39;re really as bad as I think they are and I&amp;#39;m telling myself everything is going to be alright.  Sucks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit4&lt;/strong&gt;: We went to dinner earlier and had a good time. We took her car because she wanted to take me to a restaurant I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to eat at for weeks. After we are heading back and get in the car she looks very upset. I was surprised because I didn&amp;#39;t know why she was so upset we just had a good dinner and a good time. I ask her if she is alright and she says shes fine and just doesn&amp;#39;t feel good and that her clothes are feeling &amp;quot;tight&amp;quot;. It was depressing because I was just having a good time and then she starts cold shouldering me and acting upset. As we are driving her phone is going off a lot and she looked at her phone and seemed even more upset. I asked her if everything was alright and who she was talking to because I was worried something came up. She ignores this for a bit and then shows me its her friends texting her. I asked her if everything was alright and whats going on to which she snaps and said that I&amp;#39;m being nosy and that it&amp;#39;s none of my business what her and her friends are talking about. I told her I was honestly just worried about her because she was looking at her phone and seemed even more upset afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me that she didn&amp;#39;t like the way I was talking to her and that it&amp;#39;s not fair that she takes me out to eat and then I get upset..(I wasn&amp;#39;t even talking most of the way). So I sat down before she dropped me off and told her that we had some problems that we needed to talk about and they are making me feel depressed. I reiterated a lot of the things I&amp;#39;ve said in this post and some mentioned comments. I did however leave out any sex talk as I didn&amp;#39;t feel it to be an appropriate time to talk about it as the issue here was her negativity about her body causing her to lash out at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me that she didn&amp;#39;t want to talk about anything and wanted to leave. I told her that until she was willing to talk things out with me and have a proper discussion with me about our problems without getting upset I think we should take a break. She drives off taking my phone and wallet with her(which she just returned everything intact).  Then messages me saying that she &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t believe I did that and that she never wants to see me again&amp;quot;  and she drives over to my place to drop of my phone and wallet and looked to be dressed up and had her friends in the car... figured she is going out and partying I guess(which she never does with me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly once I got started and the words came out of my mouth I felt a lot better. Her response and the way she is acting makes me feel better because I know that I tried everything I could and that it&amp;#39;s out of my hands at this point. I feel quite calm and relaxed right now... I am not sure how long this feeling will last but for now I don&amp;#39;t feel as bad as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;end edit4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit5&lt;/strong&gt;: I in response to &lt;a href=\"/u/Spektor0925\"&gt;/u/Spektor0925&lt;/a&gt; comment of &amp;quot;She was cheating on you, or planning to, guaranteed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we got into that first fight that I mentioned in my edit. I saw that she had unblocked her ex&amp;#39;s number from her phone and he tried to call her while I was there. I asked her why she unblocked him and started talking to him to which she said that she was upset and angry at me and that she figured that by unblocking him it would make me upset.\nI highly doubt she cheated on me thus far. Actually that is the only thing I&amp;#39;m confident she hasn&amp;#39;t done. What I do agree on is that she might have been planning to cheat on me. After seeing her going out tonight I have a feeling that she wants to get back at me. Don&amp;#39;t want to think about it much because I know it will get to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit6&lt;/strong&gt;: She lives down the street from my house and I know she went out with her friends so I went over to grab my stuff because she is very possessive with my stuff and I know I wont get them back If I didn&amp;#39;t get it myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her mom was home which is weird since she doesn&amp;#39;t live there. In the over one year we have been dating I&amp;#39;ve only had two conversations with my GF&amp;#39;s mother (she lives out of town at least 10 hours away from where we live) but I&amp;#39;ve met her quite a few times just never talked much. She asked where my GF was and I told her I wasn&amp;#39;t sure and that she went out with her friends. Conversation continues in a friendly manner and I inform her that we were taking a break from each other at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her mom then informs me that there are some things about my GF that I should know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said that my GF is very stubborn and has always throughout her life been unwilling to compromise about anything. She said that she herself has always just let my GF have her way when doing things because otherwise it makes her extremely upset. She told me that my GF has always has body issues since she was younger and that she tries to make improvements to herself but gets upset when she doesn&amp;#39;t see the results she wants. She her own mother said that she tries to avoid her sometimes because she feels that she tends to get easily upset and lash out when things don&amp;#39;t go her own way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how I feel about this. Her mom told me that the only way to deal with her is to let her have her way all the time. She told me she thinks I&amp;#39;m a good boyfriend to her and that she can tell I&amp;#39;ve been extremely patient with her and can tell I&amp;#39;ve been taking care of her. She asked me if I would continue to be patient with her and work things out. I didn&amp;#39;t really respond much after that as I packed my stuff and left...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Girlfriend has body insecurities and makes a lot of snide/rude remarks post sex about us having sex.

I can probably guess. You don't want to \"give up\" on the relationship. You want to \"work on things\" to get over this. But these issues can only be overcome when the COUPLE aims to get through them, not just one person... Although you clearly want to work on this problem, she does not, WILL not, and you are beating your head against the wall trying over and over and over again.\n\n\n&gt;This has been turning me off so much. I have sat down and tried discussing with her, but she just Stonewalls me and says snide/rude remarks about how I'm always demanding something. Then when I get fed up with dealing with her acting like that she breaks down and cries apologizing and nothing ends up getting done.\n\n\nThis is manipulative behavior - regardless if it's intentional or not. You letting this behavior slide is very indicative you have strong codependent traits. I really hope you read into what that is, because I am very very sure you will read many examples that will resonate with you, and hopefully spark you into taking serious action here. You need to shift focus dude. Stop worrying about, \"why is she doing this? what can I do to fix this?\" and start thinking along the lines of, \"Why am I putting up with this? Why do I value her freedom to attack me with these comments and never change, over my needs of wanting a healthier relationship?\"\n\n\n\n\nPut the issue aside, just forget about its context. Do you want to be in a relationship with someone who deals with blatant problems in this manner? Because this is indicative of how she acts when other problems occur. I'm worried you are essentially letting yourself become a doormat. You sound very codependent. You lack boundaries and standards. Even when you *do* try to act on problems, you have no line drawn for when to stop - you simply think, \"i'm not a quitter!\" and keep drudging through, *hoping* it might change. \n\n\nTelling you to just break up is dumb. You already know you should. You need to dive into your thoughts and find out *why* you won't. None of these deflecting comments of \"i believe on working on things\" - you tried many times and failed every time. Be it lack of self-confidence, thinking you can't find anyone better, *needing* to be in a relationship, being uncomfortable single... There's deeper reasons behind why you are still with her that you are ignoring. I hope something here sparks a flame for you to do more introspection. Please read some articles on codependency - not to see if you *are*, but to see if you relate to some of its traits, and read into the why's and how to overcome them. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing really seems to work.

Although you clearly want to work on this problem, she does not, WILL not, and you are beating your head against the wall trying over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This has been turning me off so much. I have sat down and tried discussing with her, but she just Stonewalls me and says snide/rude remarks about how I&amp;#39;m always demanding something. Then when I get fed up with dealing with her acting like that she breaks down and cries apologizing and nothing ends up getting done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is manipulative behavior - regardless if it&amp;#39;s intentional or not. You letting this behavior slide is very indicative you have strong codependent traits. I really hope you read into what that is, because I am very very sure you will read many examples that will resonate with you, and hopefully spark you into taking serious action here. You need to shift focus dude. Stop worrying about, &amp;quot;why is she doing this? what can I do to fix this?&amp;quot; and start thinking along the lines of, &amp;quot;Why am I putting up with this? Why do I value her freedom to attack me with these comments and never change, over my needs of wanting a healthier relationship?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put the issue aside, just forget about its context. Do you want to be in a relationship with someone who deals with blatant problems in this manner? Because this is indicative of how she acts when other problems occur. I&amp;#39;m worried you are essentially letting yourself become a doormat. You sound very codependent. You lack boundaries and standards. Even when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; try to act on problems, you have no line drawn for when to stop - you simply think, &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m not a quitter!&amp;quot; and keep drudging through, &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; it might change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Telling you to just break up is dumb. You already know you should. You need to dive into your thoughts and find out &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you won&amp;#39;t. None of these deflecting comments of &amp;quot;i believe on working on things&amp;quot; - you tried many times and failed every time. Be it lack of self-confidence, thinking you can&amp;#39;t find anyone better, &lt;em&gt;needing&lt;/em&gt; to be in a relationship, being uncomfortable single... There&amp;#39;s deeper reasons behind why you are still with her that you are ignoring. I hope something here sparks a flame for you to do more introspection. Please read some articles on codependency - not to see if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, but to see if you relate to some of its traits, and read into the why&amp;#39;s and how to overcome them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgarbdk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492298596.0, "created_utc": 1492269796.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i5z1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i5z1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i5z1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqban", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 54, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ephemeral-person", "parent_id": "t1_dgap8ng", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh man this style of \"communication\" can be so frustrating.
