We were introduced to each other through a mutual friend, and we hit it off right away because we were both really big gamers. After we met, we&amp;#39;d spend a lot of time gaming together, and soon enough that transitioned to late night skype calls and early morning messages, etc. He was really sweet, and he was my first big interest since my last break-up with someone I had been with for about four years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, I learned that he was going through some stuff on his side (he lived one state away from me). He and his ex, let&amp;#39;s name her Jessica, had a child, but she left him during the pregnancy, although she didn&amp;#39;t have anywhere else to go so they lived still lived together at his mother&amp;#39;s house. By the time I met him and realized I liked him, their child was already about a year old. Jessica had moved out, but he saw her fairly often because of the kid. I&amp;#39;ve never been in a situation like that, so it was weird for me, but I liked him a lot, and I wasn&amp;#39;t going to pull back just because of a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that he and Jessica weren&amp;#39;t exactly on good terms (he called her a psycho and a bitch) but said she called the shots because she had full custody of the child and he got to see her whenever Jessica had to go to work. Essentially he only saw his daughter when she needed a babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew back then that the whole thing with Jessica and his child fucked him up emotionally, because he had told me so himself, and the situation was pretty fucked up. You find out your girlfriend is pregnant even though you weren&amp;#39;t expecting a baby, but she leaves you mid-term because she&amp;#39;s apparently fallen out of love with you, but you still have to see her every day (they still shared a bedroom) until she has enough money and moves out with your child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was understanding about the whole thing. I told him no matter what issues he was going through, I was going to try and be there for him. I had issues of my own, and I selfishly kind of saw me helping myself by helping him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this time, we were already a couple, and we weren&amp;#39;t just flirting, there were terms of endearment, and we were starting to throw the L-word around a bit, even though it was only months in. I think because of the way we had both been left by our exes, we were looking for comfort through each other. My roommates at the time commented that I looked happier than I had in months, and that meant a lot because I had been spiraling into this dark hole of sex and drug-driven depression. I thought everything was finally gonna be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I got comfortable and thought my life was going back to normal, he left. It wasn&amp;#39;t like a one minute he&amp;#39;s here and the next he&amp;#39;s gone thing. It was about a month of no calls, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m busy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;maybe later&amp;quot; which eventually turned into him ignoring me completely. This went on for about two months, and I went spiraling again, even worse than before. I tried everything, I knew he was still talking to our other friends, he was just ignoring me. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out why for the life of me, so after a month of trying, I said to myself &amp;quot;Fuck this. I&amp;#39;ve tried everything. I&amp;#39;ve told him that I&amp;#39;m willing to help him with his issues. If that isn&amp;#39;t enough for him, I can&amp;#39;t do anything else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I gave up on ever hearing from him again. I moved on with my life as well as I possibly could. A month later, he suddenly messaged me again. I was completely blindsided by him walking back into my life like the past two months hadn&amp;#39;t happened. He asked me how I had been doing, and I remember I said a lot of cruel things to him; I was so angry. He told me he had been going through a lot, and he didn&amp;#39;t want to put me through all that stuff, so he left so I wouldn&amp;#39;t get involved in his fucked up life. I asked him why he came back, and he said, &amp;quot;I missed your voice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Against my better judgement, I decided to give him a second chance. I thought I had gotten over him, but apparently not. Neither of my roommates agreed with my decision, but they just wanted me to be happy. Things were sort of better than they had been before, he was a lot more open with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about a year later, Leo really wants to move in with me. We saw each other every other week when I had a break at work and went to visit him, but he wanted to move in together and I was really excited at the idea. At first, I started looking for apartments in my city, but a few months before I bought Leo a new PC because his old one was on its last leg. I guess I should mention that Leo was unemployed at the time, but I thought he was working on looking for employment but having a hard time with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, because I had spent some of my savings to build him a new PC, it was hard finding a decent place with a security deposit that I could afford, as well as worrying about how to get Leo&amp;#39;s stuff out there without a car (he didn&amp;#39;t have a license). Eventually I found out that I could get a promotion for my job in his city, so I went for it, and we started looking for places there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We talked about income, and I told him that I disliked to do house-chores (which I do), and Leo told me he liked taking care of the house, and cooking, etc. I told him that as long as he did stuff around the house when I asked and kept it clean, I wouldn&amp;#39;t really expect him to take a job if he really didn&amp;#39;t want to. However, if the money situation looked really bad, I&amp;#39;d like him to find something part-time at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was about six months ago, and now we live together in his state. I wasn&amp;#39;t happy to move here: I loved my job, I loved my city, I loved my friends and my roommates. I also had to leave my cats behind (he&amp;#39;s allergic and unwilling to get medicine to treat it). My mother too, but our relationship needs space so we&amp;#39;re not at each other&amp;#39;s throats. Moving here was the complete opposite: the job wasn&amp;#39;t what I expected it to be and I disliked my coworkers, I was coming home stressed every day instead of coming home happy but tired, I intensely dislike the city and I&amp;#39;m constantly homesick, and I freaking miss my cats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the past four or five months, I have been asking Leo if he would be okay with getting a part-time job from at one of the several stores in our neighborhood. There are also several restaurants that are walking distance or a short bus ride from our apartment. His answer is always &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s not argue about this now&amp;quot; which always irritates me to no end. I feel like given our financial situation, this isn&amp;#39;t something to argue about. He should be willing to help with our expenses - we&amp;#39;ve had several instances that we&amp;#39;ve had to go with hardly any food that day, just so we can have enough to pay bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He constantly tells me he grew up in a poor family, so he is used to being able to starve himself. I can&amp;#39;t seem to get him to understand that just because he&amp;#39;s been living like that all his life, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean we should continue to. I certainly don&amp;#39;t want to have to starve myself on a Saturday night when I just want a small pizza or pot stickers. I&amp;#39;m also used to being able to buy things for myself on a whim, and while this has taught me a no doubt needed lesson in budgeting, I want things. I want new clothes and new games and new things in games. Is that selfish of me to want to be able to spend the money I stress-work for on things that will make me feel happy about earning it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he does is play video-games. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve stopped playing the game we used to play together because my motherboard finally gave out on me and I can only play less intensive games on my laptop now. I thought at least that would make him want to get a job to help us save some extra cash, but when I asked him to, he said I was being a brat, and that turned into another huge fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve argued so much about this. I&amp;#39;ve gone from being understanding about his situation with Jessica to understanding why she left. he&amp;#39;s addicted to video games, he&amp;#39;s extremely lazy, and he really doesn&amp;#39;t do much around the house unless I ask him to about three times. It&amp;#39;s really frustrating, and I&amp;#39;ve stuck around because I thought despite all of this, I loved him, and I was willing to carry all the stress so he doesn&amp;#39;t have to. But I think I&amp;#39;ve had enough. I&amp;#39;m not the most selfless person on earth, and  girl can only take so much, you know? Before, I used to think about kicking him out and my heart would seize up at the thought. Now, it doesn&amp;#39;t bother me and I think it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m not in love with him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I do in this situation? Talking has only ever resulted in fights, and I&amp;#39;m at a loss. How can I possibly get across to him that I&amp;#39;m not okay with the way things are in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My videogame-addicted boyfriend and I are in a shitty financial situation. I&amp;#39;m the sole breadwinner and it&amp;#39;s putting a lot of stress on me. I always get him what he wants, and he has never really done anything in return to help me. I&amp;#39;ve asked him to get a part time job at least, and it always turns into a fight. I used to panic when I thought about breaking up with him and asking him to leave, but now I feel more and more like it&amp;#39;s the thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is gonna be long, and hopefully I can put down all my thoughts in one straight go.\n\nSo Leo and I have been together for around two years, give or take a few on and off months.
