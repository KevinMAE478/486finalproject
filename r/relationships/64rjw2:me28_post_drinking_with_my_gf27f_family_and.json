I guess it feels a little different since we are coming from different places, but my own sobriety seems to make other people uncomfortable for some reason. My best (albeit not great) advice is to simply get comfortable being uncomfortable. Eventually, people will get used to it and learn to be comfortable with this new version of you. I think that they are often worried that they are going to in some way alienate you, but I think that if you continue to show them that you&amp;#39;re happy and ok, everyone will catch up at some point. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dg4skhe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968301.0, "created_utc": 1491939501.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rjw2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4yyer", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Spankonit", "parent_id": "t3_64rjw2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Granted my decision is based on purely not liking alcohol: I'm sober, I abstain because I don't like it.
