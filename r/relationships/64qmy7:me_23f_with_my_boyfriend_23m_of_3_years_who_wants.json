I&amp;#39;ve been with Jerry 3 years now. Our relationship started off a bit rocky. He was the first guy I&amp;#39;ve ever actually liked, and it took me 2 years to fess up and tell him how I felt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was friends with Jerry but wanted more, I talked about it extensively with my then-best friend Heather (same age as us at the time). She was my main support, as I&amp;#39;d always been shy and had low self esteem. Then I started noticing that she was getting closer to him, and mentioned it to her. She said that she would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; try anything with him and that she just wanted to get to know him better. Well, never ended up lasting 3 weeks and they started dating. I was devastated and sad, and though I tried to patch things up with her after, I never felt like I could trust her. Their relationship lasted 6 months and the fizzled out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that she kind of got out of the picture, she moved to another city and I didn&amp;#39;t really want to speak with her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we started getting closer with Jerry and ended up dating. Things have been pretty great. Then I started to notice that I was getting jealous of him hanging out with other women. He has a lot of female friends and often acts &amp;quot;flirty&amp;quot; but has never acted on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mainly keep my jealousy to myself as I think it&amp;#39;s just insecurity and what&amp;#39;s left of me feeling betrayed by my closest friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then yesterday he brought up that he&amp;#39;s looking for new roommates and wants to move in with this girl, his friend Sandra and some other guy. I strongly dislike Sandra for a couple of reasons, she has acted &amp;quot;flirty&amp;quot; towards Jerry in ways that made me uncomfortable. She has a history of cheating on her boyfriends and being &amp;quot;the other woman&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him that it would be extremely painful to me if he did move in with this girl as I don&amp;#39;t like her and I&amp;#39;d be feeling worried. This started an argument where he told me that I&amp;#39;m stopping him from being free and living his life to the fullest. That if I can&amp;#39;t trust him to be around other women, we shouldn&amp;#39;t even be together. That I&amp;#39;m trying to make him feel bad and that now I&amp;#39;m giving him ultimatums. I don&amp;#39;t feel like this is an ultimatum, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how I&amp;#39;ll be able to cope if they do live together. I don&amp;#39;t want to be miserable either.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know he&amp;#39;s an adult and should be able to make his own decisions.

I don&amp;#39;t want him to feel trapped, and I&amp;#39;m trying to work through my jealousy and trust issues, but with this coming up so fast I&amp;#39;m not sure I can deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I the one being unreasonable in telling him that I don&amp;#39;t want this to happen?
