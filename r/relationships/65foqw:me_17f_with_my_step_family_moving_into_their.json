I didn&amp;#39;t get birthday parties after elementary school either.  That doesn&amp;#39;t mean we didn&amp;#39;t celebrate his birthday... We were just more low key with maybe dinner and a movie instead of a big party.

I think situations like those (similar to OP&amp;#39;s dad&amp;#39;s future wife&amp;#39;s disinterest in her future stepdaughter&amp;#39;s comfort) are so easily dismissed because of how guys deal with confrontations (head on) vs how women generally deal with them (more subtly.) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationships", "name": "t1_dgax51m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492306689.0, "created_utc": 1492277889.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavywl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DFN3", "parent_id": "t1_dgav9sl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Why is this so common??

I never moved in with my Dad and Stepmother. However when I was younger I always complained to my Dad how I didn't like sleeping over. And my Dad expressed concern, ask me why and what they can do to improve my quality of life with them. Hell I complained about little things like the shower head or the pillows they had. My Dad was open to any change that would make me feel more at home. I didn't even live with him. I slept over once in a blue moon and my Dad cared enough about my comfort to be open to accomodating for me.

THIS IS NOT ONLY THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIFE, BUT ALSO THE SAFETY OF YOUR LIFE. Your Dad NEEDS to WAKE THE FUCK UP and STEP UP to be YOUR PARENT.

Does he not expect you to ever visit him?? What about your brother? I'm assuming that he is younger than you. He needs his dad around too. I'm so angry that he thinks he should neglect his own children because you guys are older. I'm legally an adult and I definitely fucking need 1-on-1 time with my Dad. Just spending time together WITHOUT my Stepmother and their kids. I love them but I still need time with my own Dad once in a while. And this isn't once a month. This is once every week or two. We go out to dinner just the two of us or just hang out if we are both free. \n\nIf I were you, I would sit your dad down and tell him he needs to step up. Tell him how you feel about being pushed away and how he is failing you as a parent. Make sure he listens to your feelings. Get him to understand what your daily struggles are going to be like. Don't bring up Cindy. Do not blame her. This is an issue with your Dad not doing his job. If she is the reason why accomodations aren't being made, that is a problem between the two of them. Your Dad NEEDS to represent you so let him know that you are depending on him. Try and suggest counseling as well. Family counseling and individual. You guys are starting a new life and it is going to be difficult. Talk with your brother too. You guys are a team. I wouldn't even be afraid to use the mom card. \"Do you think Mom would be happy about this?\" or better yet, write her an actual card. You and your brother can each write a card addressed to your mother and just talk about how you feel neglected by your Dad and how you're scared about moving in a home that you think is dangerous. Leave it on his desk or bed. Maybe that will wake him up. This way, he won't feel directly attacked.\n\nIf your dad *still* doesn't acquiesce, then you need to seek outside help. Go to school and seek out a counseler. Seek out a social worker. Seek out CPS. Go to your local fire station. I would be tempted to go up to your Dad and ask him, \"who should I call first? The fire department or CPS?\" Let someone know that your parents are endangering your life and you are not safe under their care. They refuse to accomodate for their wheelchair bound child and you need a home that you can confidently shower in without falling or escape in case of an emergency.
