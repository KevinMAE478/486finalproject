You try it, you see what it's supposed to be like, then you alter it slightly (cooking time, ingredients, proportions, whatever), and you note how the alteration affected your cooking.

I get better by using recipes.  Recipes taught (and still teach) me the principles that allow me to now combine ingredients in insightful and unexpected ways.  Also, I smoke a lot of weed, and that has resulted in a lot of ingenuitive cooking--because I have earned a solid skill set, I can let my instincts loose in the kitchen to great effect.  This is what your boyfriend wants to do, but he's putting the cart before the horse and just \"playing chef\".\n\nAlso, regarding the \"recipes are for people with no creativity\"--that's utter claptrap.  I cook, draw, paint, play music, dance, choreograph, act, interview, write, knit, sculpt, embroider, and many other things.  I am good at a lot of what I do.  I love using the internet to learn the basics of new skills because it enables me to do things well much faster.  \n\nIt's like someone learning to play the guitar, and insisting that they only play original material.\n\nDear OP's Boyfriend:  Give recipes a shot.

But it&amp;#39;s a bonus that I now get just about every time I cook, because I spent a lot of time learning patiently and observing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I&amp;#39;m in my 30s now and I can confidently say that I am a fantastic cook.  If your partner insists on blindly experimenting, he&amp;#39;ll just churn out a lot more mediocre dishes before he gets a feel for how to improvise effectively (I am good enough now that I consistently get rave reviews for meals that I improvise and don&amp;#39;t even taste before serving).  I get better by using recipes.  Recipes taught (and still teach) me the principles that allow me to now combine ingredients in insightful and unexpected ways.  Also, I smoke a lot of weed, and that has resulted in a lot of ingenuitive cooking--because I have earned a solid skill set, I can let my instincts loose in the kitchen to great effect.  This is what your boyfriend wants to do, but he&amp;#39;s putting the cart before the horse and just &amp;quot;playing chef&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, regarding the &amp;quot;recipes are for people with no creativity&amp;quot;--that&amp;#39;s utter claptrap.  I cook, draw, paint, play music, dance, choreograph, act, interview, write, knit, sculpt, embroider, and many other things.  I am good at a lot of what I do.  I love using the internet to learn the basics of new skills because it enables me to do things well much faster.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like someone learning to play the guitar, and insisting that they only play original material.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear OP&amp;#39;s Boyfriend:  Give recipes a shot.  Your cooking will improve way, way faster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.
