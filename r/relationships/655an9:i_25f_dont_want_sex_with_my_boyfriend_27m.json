Except in my case, I'm the boyfriend in the situation, and my girlfriend never wants to have sex. She swears its not me, its not anyone else, that she just doesn't want to have sex at all. She says its because she's always so tired, she's stressed out at work, she's stressed out by school, and there's just generally a lot on her plate. I try to help her with all those issues and I understand what she is saying is fair and reasonable and I make sure to never pressure her into sex and I always ask how she's feeling before making any advances. We've been dating for two years but have been practically inseparable since 2012. We used to have a great sex life, before and after dating, then in the past few months it screeched, slowed, and slammed into a complete halt. I don't know if what you're feeling is what she's feeling but I do know that it does cause strain on your partner. It causes strain on the both of you. Sometimes it would seem like we're going to have sex and then when we don't I get frustrated and I have to stop myself from making it about me. But at the same time she's watching me and seeing me go through the frustration and it makes her feel bad about herself. \n\nAll I know is that a great relationship is bigger than sex and the need/crave for it. If you truly love somebody, you'll stick it out and it'll pass because you're still young. If the sex is really that big an issue, then its okay to move on because if you love something let it go, and if it loves you it'll return...(or something like that). Support and communication are the only ways to get through and get past internal conflicts like these. So when you see that he wants sex and you don't, try not to beat yourself up for it because then his natural response as a boyfriend is to build you back up, all the while he'll probably end up harboring resentment for you, for sex, and he'll never get the closure he needs/work out his frustrations.\n\nI'm still currently battling with this every. Some days it ruins my ego and depresses me, other days it makes me worry about the fate and future of my relationships, and other days I go on pornhub and just bust a fucking nut, but it's still a matter of choice on how I deal with it. My girlfriend stays supportive of the fact that I don't like how we're not having sex and she does her best to help me cope and stimulate me in any other possible way. And although I just really wish we were having sex WAY more, I stay supportive of how she's feeling when she feels it, I find alternative ways to pleasure her, and I try not to harbor any ill-will towards her for this because it's simply how her body is feeling, which is out of everyone's control.\n\nAs a boyfriend, all we really want is reassurance. I don't think you need to see a professional to talk about your sex drive, that's probably the last step and I'm surprised it was suggested so much. I think you should continue to address the issue with your boyfriend and continue to be supportive and thankful for him being understanding, and truly show him you appreciate his love. That always makes me feel that much better and it makes me remember I'm not only here for sex. I'm here to build a lovely relationship, future, and family with somebody.\n\nTL;DR : Talk to him about how you feel and how your body feels, never beat yourself up for not wanting to have sex, don't get mad or sad when you see he's frustrated about the sex, remind him that you appreciate his love and he'll reciprocate ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s Up OP?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&amp;#39;m literally in the same situation so I had to stop by this thread.
