He used to pay bills while I went to school and I have paid them since graduating since I make more. He got a nice car and I put a down payment on a house. He buys all entertainment stuff like eating out, alcohol, movies, etc... I pay bills and buy groceries. It&amp;#39;s fair in my eyes, ESP considering he&amp;#39;s chipped in to pay our mortgage down in half the time. Yay! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well my dream team got entirely shut down and I lost my very niche job. We have 6 months savings and I got 3 months severance. I&amp;#39;m struggling to find another position and will likely take a pay cut. Obviously that makes me upset because I loved my job and worked my ass off with scholarships and loans to put myself through school, not even him put one penny into it. I did that to make good money and enjoy my job obviously. After graduating I offered to pay for him to go to school or start his own business or whatever he wanted to do to pursue his dreams, he declined and hasn&amp;#39;t made an effort &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well he&amp;#39;s been putting down my ideas and interview blurbs I&amp;#39;m practicing with him. Everything is, &amp;quot;well that&amp;#39;s not realistic, you can&amp;#39;t say that, that&amp;#39;s a dream and silly&amp;quot;. It took a friend telling me how unique some of what I was saying was and how great it would sound in an interview to make me realize the complete tear down I get at home. I&amp;#39;m being told daily my ego is in the way and I need to just accept any job I can get. Well yes obviously if I get an offer and have nothing else I will. I&amp;#39;m not even at offer stage yet though because I&amp;#39;m bombing technical interviews and have no confidence. He thinks I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;not a natural&amp;quot; at this and maybe should try something else and I feel like a failure and like he&amp;#39;s right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got 6+ first round interviews lined up with big name companies where I&amp;#39;d be making bank if I landed one. He&amp;#39;s just bitter and angry so I confronted him about and asked why it seems like he wants me to fail and that it&amp;#39;s really affecting me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me he is bitter that I will always make more and doesn&amp;#39;t want me to make more than him, he is finding it hard to encourage me to do well when it makes him feel like shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is a major issue and ridiculous because I gave him ample opportunities to go to school and get a degree in which he&amp;#39;d be making as much if not more than me and he had no interest in having to take gen eds and declined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However I still need to land a job and have confidence.

My mother skipped a grade, was in grad school for her first Masters at 21 (in the late 60s) and was on track to get her PhD in Education.\n\nMy father dropped out of college because he didn't feel like taking a foreign language.  He literally dropped out with one semester to go.  Personally I think he was failing it and couldn't tolerate that.  He doesn't let anyone know he never graduated.\n\nMy father was 'fine' with my mother working but he would run her down all the time.  There was one point my mother was taking care of us (he never changed a diaper), going to school for her SECOND Master's, and teaching full time.  My mother quit her PhD program just before the dissertation defense (ABD).  I know she did this to not intimidate him, because my father was also 'brilliant and self taught.'  \n\nHe made more money than she did but she had the insurance.  She now has three Masters degrees and it's her pension that keeps them afloat.  And yet, somehow my father is 'smarter, and he wonders what would happen if he had married someone who was his equal.'\n\nLong story but this stuff is insidious. This attitude isn't just sexist, it's toxic to a partnership.  It is so hard to get by these days that you need everyone pitching in with everything they have.
