I\u2019ve seen it like thirty times.  Sorta mid-way through this obsession, when I\u2019d probably only seen it ten times, I watched it with my friend E, and we were both already familiar and talking our way through it.  We\u2019re both transgender and really enjoy poking fun at folks who are unnerved by gender non-conformity, especially when it\u2019s stuffy old people in movies saying things like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s gettin\u2019 to be so you can\u2019t tell the girls from the boys!\u201d  If you\u2019ve seen Velvet Goldmine, you\u2019re aware that experiments with gender presentation and sexual orientation are themes of the movie, which is one of many reasons that I like it, even though it\u2019s kind of a mess of a film, and not even Todd Haynes\u2019 best.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So E and I were watching the movie, and there\u2019s a scene in the first act where the teenage version of Christian Bale\u2019s character is looking at a picture of Jonathan Rhys Myers&amp;#39; character, who is a rock star, and he starts to touch himself in NSFW ways.  Then there\u2019s some artsy cuts to other things happening, and when we come back to Christian, his dad is yelling at him, \u201cThat\u2019s a filthy, dirty thing you\u2019re doin\u2019.\u201d  The scene is set up as if the dad caught him masturbating, but then we see that he\u2019s actually mad at Christian for putting on lipstick.  In this way, we\u2019re able to establish just how taboo Christian\u2019s character\u2019s interests, aesthetics, and inclinations are in the environment in which he grew up.  E and I thought it was hilarious and brilliant, and talked at length about how great the fake-out is, and how funny that putting on lipstick as a man in 1971 in London is \u201cdirty and filthy.\u201d  I think most (or at least many) people today would say they don\u2019t think men should wear lipstick, but the reaction would probably not be that pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple years later, I watched the movie with some different friends who had never seen it before.  I got ready for the aforementioned scene, doing that thing you do when showing a friend a movie you love\u2014you know, looking for their reaction to THE THING.  And that scene happened.  The dad\u2019s line happened.  But there was no lipstick.  He really did catch Christian Bale masturbating.  There was no fake-out\u2014the scene is as it is first suggested to be.  I sat there staring at the screen and felt this huge wave of dread wash over me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still don\u2019t know if I just made that scene up.  I have looked for it on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet\u2014maybe there are different versions of the scene?  Maybe Todd Haynes couldn\u2019t make up his mind?  But I can\u2019t find anything about it.  Because I know you\u2019re going to ask, E remembers the scene the way with the lipstick\u2014but he\u2019s also a pretty unreliable narrator, plus I don\u2019t think he\u2019s anywhere near as familiar with the film as I am, and I don\u2019t think he cares very much.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he never watched it again after that, just because he\u2019s the kind of person who doesn\u2019t rewatch movies a whole lot.  So I don\u2019t really take a lot of stock in what he remembers.  But we DID have that conversation, and he does agree with my memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am more than willing to believe that we just misremember, or that maybe we had a conversation about \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if he caught him trying on lipstick?\u201d  But I don\u2019t remember it at all as a hypothetical.
