At exactly 9:44 AM, I started to watch a video, some interesting facts about our planet. OUR PLANET HAS CHANGED. Geography is vastly different. MY whole existence has crumbled at this point.

I was talking to a local farmer there and he told me when I was younger I loved to play with the horses there, I didn&amp;#39;t tell him anything because I was so confused and I just kept nodding.
