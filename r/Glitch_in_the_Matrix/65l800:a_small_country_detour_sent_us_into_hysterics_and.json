[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Glitch_in_the_Matrix", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried writing about this before, but I get spooked and quit every single time. Going to give it a try today. Not sure if it&amp;#39;s a total glitch, but still freaky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to a very rural, rich town right before high school began. Desperate to find friends, I joined as many after school sports as I could. My mom was not happy about this, because it meant that she had to pick me up all the way downtown, and we lived a good twenty minutes away from the school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night - it was about five in the afternoon on a Thursday - girl&amp;#39;s track practice had ended, and there was my mother and little brother, waiting for me in the car. I let him sit in the front because I needed the space for my big track duffel bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re taking the regular route home - pretty much a straight line through a very rural town, as I mentioned, when we notice that the road ahead is blocked off by policemen. My mom asks an officer, &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot; and he informs her that there was an accident, a fallen tree, something, and has to redirect traffic. My mother explains that we are fairly new in town, and that we don&amp;#39;t know our way around that well. She tells him where we live and he gives her some directions to follow this small side road for a few minutes and it should put us right near our home. Let&amp;#39;s call the road Seashell Road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom, already a nervous driver, demands that we all pay attention and help her. We finally find Seashell road and enter. For the first minute, it&amp;#39;s pretty normal, but suddenly becomes incredibly narrow, windy, and woodsy. There are very few houses and it looks like the type of place where you&amp;#39;d get covered in ticks. This road is so narrow that you have to drive slow, because you can&amp;#39;t see around the other side, and if a car is coming from the opposite direction, you need to pull over to let them through. So here we were, chugging along, my mother complaining for making her come out here on this dangerous drive and my little brother mindlessly bobbing his head to the Foo Fighters on his iPod. Eventually, he pulls out his earbuds and the three of us begin arguing a bit - regular sibling and parent nonsense - and we&amp;#39;ve been on the road for about six minutes when suddenly we all get very quiet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of us know WHY we got quiet, but in hindsight, we explained it as a mutual, somehow understood feeling. Like we all knew to be quiet. The woodsy road suddenly felt very still, and the hum of the car was all to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when we saw two identical bald, fat men in the distance, wearing identical blue &amp;quot;onesies&amp;quot;. Again, we couldn&amp;#39;t drive fast on this road, and the three of us took in the whole thing, slowly and quietly. Eerily, these men walked in synchronized steps, looking straight ahead. They sported the exact same look, as if they were clones, marching down this narrow, hidden road. They didn&amp;#39;t look at us, but I can&amp;#39;t imagine how I would have reacted if they did. Maybe it&amp;#39;s worse that they didn&amp;#39;t look at us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re silent for the rest of the ride until we become familiar with our surroundings and approach our home. Scared shitless, we all begin talking at once. I&amp;#39;m the first to say, &amp;quot;what the F***&amp;quot; and my brother goes, &amp;quot;I saw that! You felt that!&amp;quot; And my mother is a broken record calling them &amp;quot;mutants&amp;quot;. We all begin to recall the silence and reminisce that it was like the world stopped breathing. All that existed were those men and their matching footsteps, and their incredibly vague, expressionless faces. Paranoid, we lock our doors and never go down that road again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** TWO YEARS LATER**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I are on our way home after hanging out with friends. For a bit of context, my boyfriend was older than me and had a license, while I just had a permit at the time.  He is driving me home to my house for the night when he mentions he&amp;#39;s found a quicker route to my house. I don&amp;#39;t notice the name of the road, but after a few moments, I realize we were on Seashell Road. I began to flip out and remind him of the previous story I just mentioned. He laughs it off and says he&amp;#39; been taking this road to my house every single time he visits me, and not to worry about it. I&amp;#39;m uneasy, but I begin to relax. We&amp;#39;re listening to Sublime and it was a good night out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just before he makes his final turn to exit this narrow road, I swear, I see one of the men, frozen like a statue, peering into a mailbox. I flip the fuck out and start saying &amp;quot;THAT&amp;#39;S IT! THAT&amp;#39;S ONE OF THEM!&amp;quot; as we slowly drive past and off the street. The man hasn&amp;#39;t moved at all, it&amp;#39;s as if he is completely frozen in time, and he is on my boyfriend&amp;#39;s driving side. I begin to hysterically cry and my boyfriend finally finds a main road and pulls over and asks me what is going on.\n&amp;quot;The man!&amp;quot; I told him. &amp;quot;The clone from my story!&amp;quot; I was shocked, but I was relieved because the man was right in front of him - I knew he had to of seen him, he was RIGHT there. Except my boyfriend then turns to me and says &amp;quot;surf526, there was no man. I didn&amp;#39;t see anything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely lost my shit. We fought over it for months. That man was peering into the mailbox, frozen, right in reach of my boyfriend, and he claims he never saw him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still gives me the creeps and haven&amp;#39;t seen anything weird since. But I am left with so many questions. Who are they? What are they? Where were they going? Why were they dressed the same way and walking the same? Either the closest pair of brothers EVER or I saw something I shouldn&amp;#39;t have. I&amp;#39;ve heard theories of aliens to spies to men in black. No idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: One time, I saw a pair of semi-bald and pretty fat twins at a pizza place, and freaked out. It wasn&amp;#39;t them, though, and they were pretty nice. Still made me dizzy, though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: sorry if I didn&amp;#39;t clarify this in the story; the men were marching on the side of the road, not in the middle or in our path. The road was incredibly narrow for two cars, but bordered on dangerous for one car and pedestrians, because it&amp;#39;s hard to see around the other side of the road with all those trees and twisted turns. That&amp;#39;s what made it even more weird, I suppose. It was like we were the only people for six miles on this road together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also thought of handicapped individuals as some have pointed out, but I&amp;#39;ve pretty much ruled that out. My mom works with handicapped children and has been a caretaker for the elderly and this didn&amp;#39;t feel like that. The characteristics weren&amp;#39;t the same. And if it was the case, my boyfriend still didn&amp;#39;t see that one man. Anything is possible, though, and I&amp;#39;ll believe everything at this point. It could be a very logical explanation or not at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've tried writing about this before, but I get spooked and quit every single time.
