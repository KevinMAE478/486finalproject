I think it&amp;#39;s pretty on par with the things I have read.&lt;br/&gt;\n      I will try to not ramble on but I&amp;#39;ll set the scene. I was living with a few friends in a two story house for a couple years. The way the house is set up is when you enter the house you are in a &amp;#39;mud-room&amp;#39; (very small foyer) and immediately to your right is a staircase going up. This staircase, however, has always been completely blocked with extra crap that we didn&amp;#39;t have room for anywhere else (this is important later). Then as you keep walking into the house you enter the kitchen, then living room which leads to a second staircase going to the second floor.&lt;br/&gt;\n     So, one of my friends and I are sitting in the living room watching TV. My dog comes trotting downstairs and walks past us going towards the kitchen (his food and water are in there so it was nothing unusual). Both my friend and I take notice of him walking past us because we say hello to him (is that weird? Idk I love my dog lol).&lt;br/&gt;\n     I would say about five minutes go by and my friend and I are still sitting watching TV. Neither of us had moved from our spots. Then all of the sudden we hear my dog coming down the stairs and he trots by us...again. We both look at each other with &lt;em&gt;what the hell?&lt;/em&gt; expressions. We both know we just saw him pass us and not go by again to go back upstairs, we both thought he was still in the kitchen. There would be &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; he could have gotten up the other flight of stairs. He is an 80 lb (about 36 kg) dog so it&amp;#39;s not like he could just jump on things without us hearing a huge commotion. If he had attempted to traverse the pile of stuff to go upstairs, it would have been noticeable. We even checked and nothing on the staircase was disturbed.&lt;br/&gt;\n     My friend and I were baffled and still talk about how my dog &amp;#39;teleported&amp;#39; to this day. It really felt like we watched the same thing happen twice, like something got &amp;#39;reset&amp;#39;.  I would love to hear your thoughts!
