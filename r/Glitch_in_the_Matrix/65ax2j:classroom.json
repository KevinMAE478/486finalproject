At the time no one was paying attention the the projector because she was explaining how the next few weeks would work out. I on the other hand was fixated on the screen for some reason (I should probably mention that I do a lot of free association so i tend to let my mind wander). As I stared at the screen it very clearly changed from full blue to a lime green and then to a deep yellow. After that it went back to blue and i could see the outline of a human figure on the projector. Imagine a very slight almost un-noticeable static outline of a human figure. The figure looked around the room then looked directly at me (noticed i saw it) then the screen went through the same color changes, then everything went back to normal.
