Bear with me through all of this rambling, this has been an ongoing unraveling story in my life over the course of the last 4 months and it&amp;#39;s just been slowly getting weirder and weirder. I have no idea what to make of all of it, so I&amp;#39;d really appreciate any input. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the story starts 7 years ago. When I was 13, I went on this week-long cruise in the Caribbean with my family. One night I was sitting in the ship theater with my mom, when she pointed at a guy about my age sitting in the row in front of us and said &amp;quot;hey, he&amp;#39;s pretty cute&amp;quot; in a teasing-mom sort of way. I glanced over and the strangest feeling rushed over me. I can honestly say I haven&amp;#39;t felt anything like it, either before or since. It was like a sense of sudden inexplicable recognition. I know there&amp;#39;s the whole &amp;quot;love at first sight\n cliche but I wouldn&amp;#39;t even call it that, honestly. It wasn&amp;#39;t even romantic at first, just a sort of magnetic pull that this person had on my subconscious. I kept looking over at him (I&amp;#39;ll refer to him as &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; from now on, even though that&amp;#39;s not his actual name) during the whole movie -- it felt kind of like when you see someone at the grocery store you met a long time ago and you&amp;#39;re trying to remember their name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I went to this teen &amp;quot;club&amp;quot; on the ship where there were organized activities, and where you could meet other kids your age. As I was sitting with my brother and another guy we were hanging out with, the guy from the theater the night before walked in. He sat with us and we all started talking, telling stories, cracking jokes, that sort of thing. I remember feeling like we had this kind of weird connection between us. I&amp;#39;ll try to explain it the best I can. Basically, it was like whenever someone would say something we&amp;#39;d look at each other and when our eyes locked, it was that feeling when you have an &amp;quot;inside joke&amp;quot; with your best friend. Except that - of course-\n - I barely knew this guy. Over the next few days, the group of us hung out together doing typical stuff - walking around the ship, participating in some of the teen club activities, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last night of the cruise, John, my brother, our other friend and I were all walking around the ship. John said: &amp;quot;hey, let me show you guys something&amp;quot; and he took us to this lookout point on the very top deck. I distinctly remember this feeling rushing over me, this feeling like I needed to mentally &amp;quot;photograph&amp;quot; everything around me so I could always remember that moment. So I saved it all in my head. The smell of rain and seawater, the stars shining above us, the sound of the rushing waves on all sides of the ship and the city lights way off on the shore in the distance. I never forgot that moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all decided we wanted to go swimming, so we said we&amp;#39;d go back to our rooms to change into our bathing suits and then meet back at the pool. I remember John looking back as he was walking away, and saying jokingly &amp;quot;I know you guys are just gonna ditch me&amp;quot;. That was the last time I saw him. When I got back to the pool after changing into my swimsuit, John wasn&amp;#39;t there. I waited for almost an hour, but he never showed. I started running around the ship searching everywhere for him, but I never found him. That night, I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper, thinking maybe I&amp;#39;d see him the next morning before getting off the ship. I never did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I searched Facebook for John but couldn&amp;#39;t find him. I had a lot of numbers from other kids who were on the ship with us, but none of them had gotten John&amp;#39;s number. So time went on, and I kept waiting for my childish crush to die away. I dated 2 other guys long-term, one of whom I thought I&amp;#39;d end up marrying someday. I went to college and graduated early, I moved to the city I&amp;#39;d always wanted to lived in and pursued a calling I&amp;#39;ve been passionate about my whole life. Through all of these changes, the memory of John stuck with me. It sounds crazy to say this, but even when I was dating other guys I always had this strange feeling in the back of my mind that if I randomly reconnected with John, I&amp;#39;d have to breakup with whoever I was with because he was the one I was meant to be with. I know that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense, I mean it didn&amp;#39;t make sense to me even when it was a thought that crossed my mind. From time to time, I even found myself searching Facebook trying to find John. By the time I turned 19, I knew I&amp;#39;d never forget John but I also gave up believing I&amp;#39;d ever meet him again. That was when the first of a series of many weird things happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was living in a dorm at college. I should preface this by saying I wasn&amp;#39;t a spiritual person at the time. I thought psychics were fake, and the concept of parallel universes or &amp;quot;glitches&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;premonitions&amp;quot; were all a joke. But despite being incredibly logically-minded, something happened to me I can&amp;#39;t explain to this day. I had a dream like none I&amp;#39;d ever had before. In the dream, I was sitting at a table in a building that looked kind of like an empty airport. Sitting across from me was John, and somehow I just knew in the dream it was &amp;quot;John from the cruise&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t remember what we were talking about, just that we were talking and laughing and it was the most amazing feeling in the world. At the end of the dream, I started to realize (while still dreaming) that I was starting to wake up. I panicked because I realized I still didn&amp;#39;t know his last name. Right as I was regaining consciousness, a white scrap of paper with John&amp;#39;s full first and last name flashed in front of my vision. I woke up at 3AM to the sound of my own voice repeating his name over and over out loud, like I was trying to remember it. I remember feeling really startled, because I&amp;#39;d never woke up to myself talking in my sleep -- let alone, saying a name. So I put the name in my phone notes and fell back asleep. The next day I searched the name on Facebook, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find anything. I decided the dream was just some crazy fluke. Months went by. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then last December (2016) I logged into Facebook and saw that a guy had accepted my friend request. I was confused because I hadn&amp;#39;t remembered adding anyone. The guy had the same first and last name as in my dream. I thought maybe there was some off chance I&amp;#39;d added him back in February (when I&amp;#39;d had the dream) and he&amp;#39;d only just gotten around to accepting it. But like I said, I really don&amp;#39;t remember adding him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook John messaged me and asked if we&amp;#39;d met. At this point I honestly didn&amp;#39;t expect it to be the guy from the cruise, but I told him I&amp;#39;d been on a cruise awhile ago and met a guy with his name. He told me he actually had been on a cruise, but it&amp;#39;d been years ago. He couldn&amp;#39;t remember what year he went but he guessed it was 2008. Mine was in 2010, so I almost just ended the conversation right there. But even though I had low expectations for the whole situation, I thought we might as well compare details from our cruises to see if they matched up. Everything did. And it wasn&amp;#39;t like I was listing off details and he was like &amp;quot;oh yeah I did that too&amp;quot;, it was like a back-and-forth sharing of details. So there&amp;#39;s no way either of us could&amp;#39;ve just been agreeing to the details that the other was presenting. John said he remembered meeting a girl with brown hair in a green dress (I wore a green dress), but he didn&amp;#39;t remember her name. He also said she gave him a scrap of paper with something on it that he couldn&amp;#39;t remember (this is weird because I&amp;#39;d written out a note to give him, but never actually got a chance to give it to him, and I didn&amp;#39;t tell Facebook John about this note). His sister was in a stroller at the time (I remember seeing him push a stroller), and his siblings were approximately the ages I remember them being. His cruise went to the same places as mine, and was the same length as mine. But honestly, all these details don&amp;#39;t mean much because I know all that still could&amp;#39;ve been coincidental. But there&amp;#39;s this one very specific detail that really gets me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only story I specifically remember John telling on the cruise was a funny story about something they did to prank their band director during a concert once, to ruin it. I couldn&amp;#39;t remember exactly what the story was. I mentioned to Facebook John that I remember the guy I met telling some story about a band concert. Immediately, Facebook John starts telling me this story of something his band group in 6th grade did to prank their conductor, and when he told the story it gave me chills. Because the way &amp;quot;Facebook&amp;quot; John told the story was EXACTLY the same was I remember &amp;quot;cruise&amp;quot; John telling it, it just instantly jogged my memory because even the wording was exactly the same. I had given literally no information about this story, so the fact he nailed it exactly is too uncanny to be coincidental. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that point, although we had no definite confirmation, I kind of assumed that this was the same guy I met on the cruise. We got closer and closer, and honestly talking to him was more natural than with any guy I&amp;#39;d ever met. Although I didn&amp;#39;t know for sure that this was &amp;quot;cruise&amp;quot; John, for the first time in my life that feeling I&amp;#39;d always had in relationships that I&amp;#39;d always wonder about my childhood missed connection was completely gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK. So all this would be weird enough, but things got even weirder. I hesitate to even include this, because if you don&amp;#39;t already think I&amp;#39;m crazy then you really will after hearing what I&amp;#39;m about to say. One night, John and I had been talking on the phone for about 4 hours, then we both hung up and went to sleep immediately after. I woke up in the middle of the night to a text from John that made my blood run cold. I&amp;#39;m a songwriter/singer, and sometimes during our calls I&amp;#39;d show him songs that I&amp;#39;d been working on. In the text, he said something along the lines of &amp;quot;your voice sounded absolutely beautiful, I loved how the song sounded on piano and the way it sounded softer and sweeter than the songs you played on guitar&amp;quot; or something like that. But the thing is, I hadn&amp;#39;t sang anything for him that night on the phone. And I didn&amp;#39;t have a piano in my apartment, so there&amp;#39;s no way he heard me playing a song on piano. The text got even weirder. He said something like &amp;quot;you asked me a few questions, so I wanted to answer those now&amp;quot; ... and again, this made no sense because I hadn&amp;#39;t asked any questions. Then he had these numbered answers 1-3, all various answers about the circumstances of our meeting on the cruise. So this would already be kind of odd, but there&amp;#39;s something that makes it a million times weirder. Like I said, I&amp;#39;m a songwriter. And 3 years ago (2014) I wrote a love song on piano all about my meeting with John. I created an anonymous YouTube channel and uploaded this song on it, as a sort of &amp;quot;missed connection&amp;quot; post. In the video, I said that if John happened to see this video, he should email me the answer to the following 3 questions. The video never got more than about a thousand views. But this is the crazy part. Those &amp;quot;answers&amp;quot; John texted me were the answers to the 3 questions from the video. The text went something like: &amp;quot;you already know the answers to these questions but..&amp;quot; and then he answered all 3 of them. I had never told him about the song or video. The next day, I asked him about the text. He insisted he didn&amp;#39;t remember sending it, only that he&amp;#39;d had a dream about the cruise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after all these crazy coincidences, we just found out a few weeks ago that we weren&amp;#39;t on the same cruise at all. We&amp;#39;d both been on identical 7-day cruises on the exact same cruise line and ship, but in totally different years. He went spring break 2008, I went spring break 2010. His sister just confirmed it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another possibly relevant fact. I asked my brother (who was hanging out with me and John) if he remembered the guy I&amp;#39;d had a crush on during the cruise. He said &amp;quot;oh yeah, weren&amp;#39;t you into that Kevin guy?&amp;quot;. Kevin was the other guy hanging out with us. I said, &amp;quot;No, John&amp;quot;. And he replied &amp;quot;oh, I don&amp;#39;t remember him&amp;quot;. I found this weird because John was hanging out with us just as much as Kevin, and also I distinctly remember talking to my brother about John right after the cruise. But he had no recollection of him at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what am I supposed to make of all this? Any input? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: A few of you have asked to see the video I posted on YouTube, as well as &amp;quot;John&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; messages where he answered the questions in the video. So, I&amp;#39;ll apologize in advance for the cheesiness of all this, but here you go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YouTube Video screenshots (with the questions I asked in the &amp;quot;missed connection&amp;quot; video with the song I wrote playing in the background):\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/OpdSw\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/OpdSw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Snapchat text message I got from him in the middle of the night one night, randomly answering the questions and talking about how beautiful the song was (I&amp;#39;d never actually shown him the video with the song or questions):\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/gfiVN\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/gfiVN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "OK...I'll start by saying, this is my first time posting on Reddit so I'll apologize in advance if I'm not doing this right.

Honestly, I want to believe it too of course, but at the same time the reason I posted this is because if something about this is just me being \"conned\" then I want people to point that out to me, as well as any other more theories (logical-sounding or not). I know I'm pretty biased since I'm in the situation, and it's great to have outside perspective. That said, here are the answers to your questions:\n\n1) We communicate mainly through snapchat texts and pictures. In fact, like 99% of our texts are through there (but I save the important ones so I still have screenshots I can upload here, if anyone's interested). I've seen hundreds of pictures and videos of him. He's in the military stationed in Hawaii right now, and I've seen pictures of him in his uniform with his last name on it, pictures of the other guys there, etc. So I'm 100% sure he is a real person with the full first and last name I remember. \n\nNow in terms of appearance, yes, he does look similar to the guy from the cruise. Same hair color, hair type (straight), and eye color. Now, it's been 7 years so I really didn't put much weight on this appearance similarity at first. Not only is my memory flawed, but people also can change drastically in that period of time. But what really startled me is when I saw a picture of him from around the time of the cruise (like middle school). The picture was black and white, but EVERYTHING about it made me think \"this is definitely the same guy\" -- I mean hair length, facial expression, freckles, eyes, everything. And I've never gotten that feeling before, despite having looked through a lot of profiles of guys with his same name. There is definitely striking similarity. \n\n2) It's not possible that this is a shitty prank, because John Facebook and I didn't have that conversation with the questions from the video in the middle of the night until after we'd been talking every day for 2 months, and had about 20 hours of phone calls at least. If the whole thing was a prank based around the video, I don't think he would've waited that long. \n\nNow, despite not feeling like this is a prank, of course I must be open to the possibility of this guy finding the video a few months into our acquaintance, then pretending like he had this \"dream\" to make a good story out of it. The problem with this is, the video only has about 1200 views, isn't very searchable at all, and it's not attached to my name whatsoever. Also there were only a few hours that lapsed between our phone call and the text I received from him, so he would've had to find it pretty quickly. I suppose there's a very slim chance it's possible.\n\n3) OK, so I am 100% sure I have MY year right, because meeting him was such a big deal to me at the time that I saved my cruise key card and a cruise itinerary in a shoe box, along with the note I never gave him. It's all still there. I've checked it a million times to make sure the year is right. \n\nHe hasn't given me any solid confirmation about his year yet, besides telling me his sister told him it was in 2008. Like I said, he's stationed in Hawaii right now, but he contacted one of his parents for pictures from the cruise. So maybe I'll have a concrete confirmation soon.\n\n4) My mom doesn't remember pointing out the guy to me, and I don't think she really saw us together much since we were in a group of people. And after the cruise, I didn't immediately talk much about it with anyone in my family. She only remembers me mentioning him afterwards. \n\nDon't apologize for all the questions, thank you so much for helping me try to sift through all the logistics of this.

From some of your other posts in this thread I note you mention near death experiences/near misses to do with crime in your local area.  I had a near-miss as a child when I crossed the road without checking both ways.  I was in the middle of the road before I heard the car coming towards me FAST from the left.  I turned my head towards it, closed my eyes, and when I opened them again I was back on the kerbside as if I'd never stepped off.

I think I can be forgiven because it isn't a concept that is easily kept at the front of someones mind. I am not sure I would be able to explain it well enough so I am going to type an excerpt from the book \"Conversations with God\" book 2 by Neale Donald Walsch. You will have to decide for yourself whether or not you trust the source or believe it, but isn't a statement that is without merit, nor is it one that is mutually exclusive to believing Neale or in a Creator. \n\nBold will be Neale and non-bold text will be God/Creator answering. \n\n**Tell me about time**\n\nThere is no Time like the pre-sent! You've heard that before, Im sure. But you didn't understand it. Now you do. There is no time but this time. There is no moment but this moment. \"Now\" is all there is.\n\n**What about \"yesterday\" and \"tomorrow\"**?\n\nFigments of your imagination. Constructs of your mind. Nonexistent in Ultimate Reality. Everything that ever happened, is happening, and ever will happen, is happening right now. \n\n**I don't understand**\n\nAnd you can't. Not completely. But you can begin to. And a beginning grasp is all that is needed here. So....just listen. \"Time\" is not a continuum. It is an element of relativity that exists vertically, not horizontally. Don't think of it as a \"left to right\" thing--a sol called time line that runs from birth to death for each individual, and from some finite point to some finite point in the universe. \n\n\"Time\" is an \"up and down\" thing! Think of it as a spindle, representing the Eternal Moment of Now. Now picture leafs of paper on the spindle, one atop the other. These are the elements of time. Each element separate and distinct, yet each existing simultaneously with the other. All the paper ont he spindle at once! As much as there will ever be--as much as ther ever was...\n\nThere is only one moment--this moment--Eternal moment of now. It is right now that everything is happening--and I am glorified. (cutting out a part because it isn't necessarily relevant and may take away from the message)\n\nThere is no beginning to this, and there is no End. It---the All of Everything--just IS. \n\nWIthin the Isness is where your experience--and your greatest secret--lies. You can move in consciousness within the Isness to any \"time\" or \"place\" you choose. \n\n**You mean we can time travel**?\n\nIndeed--and many of you have. All of you have, in fact--and you do it routinely, usually in what you call your dream state. Most of you are not aware of it. You cannot retain the awareness. But the energy sticks to you like glue, and sometimes there's enough residue that others--sensitive to this energy--can pick up things about your \"past\" or your \"future\". They feel or \"read\" this residue, and you call them seers and psychics. Sometimes there is enough residue that even you, in your limited consciousness, are aware you've \"been here before\". Your whole being is suddenly jarred by the realization that you've \"done this all before\"!\n\n___________________\nThere are another couple pages that I think are very important to read but I am not sure that typing out a whole chapter of this book is necessary. This is a concept that is not new at all, and on it's face sounds like pretentious philosophical platitudes (at least to me). It is not an easy one to try and comprehend, and I myself have only been able to in brief spurts. In my experience it is something that takes a period of sustained intense concentration in order to get that brief glimpse. \n\nIf you are interested I highly suggest you read or listen to \"Conversations with God\", to my knowledge there are now 3 books of the same title with the second and third being book 2 and 3. I originally listened to the original book on youtube which is very easy to find Neale himself reading it. It is very fascinating and not at all related to religion or any kind of dogma other than to dispell it. \n\nI just found version 2 at the library today and ran across this and immediately thought of you. Just like the Dodleston messages I can't say enough about this book and it's concepts. I could talk for hours on what it means to me and how I came to find it. It is an integral part of who I am today but not simply because I have read it. Trying to explain is another thread and topic all together. \n\nIt is a bit of a mind fuck though, so beware.
