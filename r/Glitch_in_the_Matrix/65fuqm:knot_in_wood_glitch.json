Opening the gate &lt;em&gt;boom&lt;/em&gt; no. Not a bomb going off, but directly outside the door on the floor of the opened gate I noticed on the floor in front of me a small piece of wood, a knot! circular in shape, I picked it up and it resembled pretty much exactly what I had just seen deteriorate to dust when I had sanded it on the staircase, it was oval in shape and slightly angled, so not a perfect circle, just like the hole that was in my staircase. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran in the house with the knott in my hand and shouted my wife, both of us were puzzled thinking &amp;quot;what the fuck?&amp;quot; Scratching our heads, the knot of wood fit the hole and I&amp;#39;m not talking just closely fitted, it was as if it was the same fucking knot that had been sanded out, only lighter in colour of a different type of wood, almost an ash, it matched the staircase perfectly colour wise now sanded.
