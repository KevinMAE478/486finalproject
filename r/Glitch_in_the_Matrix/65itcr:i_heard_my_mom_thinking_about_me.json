I&amp;#39;ve never posted on here but I&amp;#39;m starting with this one because its the one that I told someone and they said, &amp;quot;oh, sounds like a glitch in the matrix.&amp;quot; Which I hadn&amp;#39;t heard of before but after reading a bunch of these I think this is something that happens a lot not just to me but my family. One side of my family in particular. Maybe we are somehow predisposed? Idk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; This happened when I was in high school. School would let out around 1:30 and my boyfriend at the time and I would go back to my house to do what teenagers do. My parents worked and my sister was younger and arrived home a good hour and a half later than me. So we had the house to ourselves for a chunk of time everyday. \n\nOn this day, we were up in my bedroom, sitting on my bed. I think we hadn&amp;#39;t been there that long and weren&amp;#39;t really doing anything yet but probably about to. Then, completely out of nowhere, I hear my moms voice calling my name from the bottom of the stairs. \n\n Now, my mom&amp;#39;s voice is unmistakable. It has a very unique sound to it, due to one of her vocal chords being paralyzed (not entirely sure how, it happened when she was a child). Basically, what I&amp;#39;m saying is it could ONLY have been my mother calling my name. Couldn&amp;#39;t be a woman walking by the house or a TV or a radio. Nothing like that. My moms voice is that distinct. I looked at my boyfriend and he had this wide eyed look on his face and he was like, &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s your mom.&amp;quot; He heard it too and was clearly alarmed but probably just grateful that he still had his pants on. \n\n It was unusual for her to come home at that time but not impossible. So I got up and went to the top of the stairs and called down. No answer. I shout again. Nothing. The house is completely silent. Like I could hear the actual ticking of the big clock downstairs. That quiet. So we go downstairs, the house is empty and her car isn&amp;#39;t in the driveway. So now we&amp;#39;re standing in the kitchen and I look at my boyfriend and I ask him again, &amp;quot;you heard my mother right?&amp;quot; He says that he absolutely did. He heard her say my name from the bottom of the stairs. That&amp;#39;s exactly what I heard.\n\n So now we&amp;#39;re both thoroughly confused and just looking at each other in silence feeling weird when all of a sudden the phone rings. This was &amp;#39;96 or around that time, so when I say phone I mean land line. Which at that time meant every phone in the house ringing loudly all at once. Scared the shit out of us because we were already weirded out.\n\n So I pick up and it&amp;#39;s my mother! I said, &amp;quot;you were just here!&amp;quot; She said no, she was at work but randomly thought of something she needed to ask me about. I forget what it was, but whatever it was it was important enough for her to send some kind of sonic other version of herself to get my attention.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Ok so, I've had a few glitchy things happen to me in my life but didn't know it was \"a thing\" until now.
