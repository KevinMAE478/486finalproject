It sounds that your boyfriend was sleeping but walking around doing things. \nThese people can talk and reason and think they are awake, yet their brains are still in sleep mode, so they are actually dreaming as well as walking around. This results in all sorts of &amp;#39;funny&amp;#39; actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very well known thing and comes under sleep walking; and I normally give my own experience but can&amp;#39;t do it every time, as I would have to do it once a day on this sub. Google it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There should also be a short link to well known brain anomalies on this sub that people can read through before posting yet another known fact as a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Glitch_in_the_Matrix", "name": "t1_dg5pmdi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492022550.0, "created_utc": 1491993750.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tcwa", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uwp9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg62e0x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PichaelThompsonx", "parent_id": "t3_64uwp9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You were dreaming.
