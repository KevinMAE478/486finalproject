We slept in my living room which has a hallway leading to the bedrooms/bathrooms connected to it.  My friends and I were really stupid and weird when we were young, so before going to bed we got into our sleeping bags and flopped around the place like giant maggots or something, laughing our butts off.  Of course, I got my Samsung tablet and recorded it all.  That night, when pretty much everyone but me was asleep, I pulled out my tablet and watched the video.  Just a couple minutes of five spastic sleeping bags and hysterical laughter (which was muted at the time because I didn&amp;#39;t want to wake anyone up).  I rewatched it a couple of times just to keep myself entertained, and on the last replay, I noticed something that almost made me poop my pajama pants.  Instead of five girls flopping around, there were six.  I very clearly remember the five friends that I invited; Emma, a girl with dark brown skin and braids, Avery, short with fawn-colored hair, Stevie, black hair in a pixie cut, Jasmine, blonde with glasses, and Sofie, dirty-blonde and taller than everyone in the house (including my mom).  I had no memory of the sixth girl, who I remember as being thin with a tanned complexion and long hair (brown?) in a ponytail.  She popped in and out of the video (never in a sleeping bag, just watching and laughing.)  After noticing the girl in the video, I got freaked out and scanned the living room full of my sleeping friends to see if she was still there.  Nope.  Just the five aforementioned girls.  Slightly relieved, I put the tablet down and almost closed my eyes to go to sleep, then almost crapped my pants for the second time.  Someone with a sleeping bag up to their waist was hopping down the hallway.  I let out a shriek that woke up all five girls and my mom up and made the person in the sleeping bag slip and fall down.  The person in the sleeping bag was the girl from the video, who turned out to be Avery&amp;#39;s cousin that I had NOT invited.  No memory of her arriving at my house at any time or taking part in the sleeping bag fiesta.  My mom didn&amp;#39;t remember her either, but that was probably because she stayed in her room most of the time and only came out to make dinner/breakfast.  The other girls all said that she had been there the whole time.  I left it alone because the girl (her name was something like Elise) was super nice and funny and no one really believed or remembered her appearing out of thin air in the middle of the sleepover.  She came over a couple times afterwards, nothing strange about her whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For my 10th birthday, I had a party/sleepover with five other friends at my house.
