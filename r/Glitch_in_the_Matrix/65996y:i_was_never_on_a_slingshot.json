Everyone once in a while, my parents would splurge on something fun (but then we could barely eat for the next few months). Once we took a trip to Lagoon, the amusement park, when I was about 11/12. I remember going on a some ride that spun around in a huge circle, spinning you upside down while you were in a little cart. For some reason, this ride REALLY freaked me out and I had a minor panic attack while riding... this was especially weird because rides like that typically are just fun, no real rush for me. My mom was in my cart and my dad and brother were in the cart in front of us. My mom started making fun of me for crying and yelled to my dad that I wasn&amp;#39;t having fun, I was crying. My dad replied with &amp;quot;is she crying? WHAAAT?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m a HUGE rollercoaster/thrill ride fan, but I do have my limits, so after I calmed down, my mom suggested the &lt;a href=\"http://www.lagoonpark.com/xventure/catapult/\"&gt;slingshot&lt;/a&gt;, but I refused. That was that and we went on with our vacation with the annoying harassment of &amp;quot;haha, you panicked&amp;quot;.

After a few minutes, we got my dad and brother involved and my whole family was on my mother&amp;#39;s side. I explained the whole story: my panic attack, calming down, them making fun of me for the rest of the trip, etc. No one remembers my panic attack, no one remembers making fun of me, they even told me it was absurd because it was a mild ride. They told me that I even called my Aunt Sarah, also a thrill seeker and my childhood hero, to tell her we just went on the ride. We called her because I was so freaked out and she remembered! My dad even brought out photos, granted you can&amp;#39;t tell it was me and my mom, but why would he take a photo of a random person on the ride? I KNEW what I remembered and even remember writing about it in my diary. I was upset with myself for panicking and turning down a big roller coaster. I showed my family and they accused me of writing it when I went to go look for it, but it was a full page and dated at the top.\nThis isn&amp;#39;t just a lapse in my memory, I VIVIDLY remember panicking on the dinky little ride, and remember them making fun of me the whole time for it. I don&amp;#39;t remember anything further with the slingshot other than &amp;quot;Wanna go on? No? Ok&amp;quot;.
