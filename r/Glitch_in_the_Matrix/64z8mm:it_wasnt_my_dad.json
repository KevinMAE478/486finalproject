A little information  before I start: my dad &amp;amp; I are the only people who live in our house. My dad gets home from work at about 4:30-5:00pm every day, comes in the back door, sets his things down on the counter, &amp;amp; takes the dogs out. That&amp;#39;s his normal ritual. I&amp;#39;m very familiar with how this all sounds as I&amp;#39;m usually always home at this time and I&amp;#39;ll go greet him. We share a driveway with the neighbors but the most tell tale sign it is my dad is the dogs-they know the sound of his car and will jump up, bark, and race to the backdoor to wait for him to let them out everyday they don&amp;#39;t do this when anyone else pulls up the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, two months ago around 4:30 I&amp;#39;ve heard my dad pull in the drive, the dogs barking and running to the door, the door opening, and keys hitting the counter. But when I went down to greet him, he&amp;#39;s not there &amp;amp; his car isn&amp;#39;t even in the drive.  I figure he forgot to stop by the store on his way home or something &amp;amp; had headed back out so I call him (we were out of coffee &amp;amp; figured he could grab it). When I called I ask if he was headed to the store &amp;amp; he said &amp;quot;No, I&amp;#39;m just leaving work now. Why? Do you need me to pick something up?&amp;quot;. I thought it was strange but just asked him to grab some coffee &amp;amp; hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened a few more time in the last few weeks-every time calling my dad and asking him if he&amp;#39;d just been home, and every time him telling me he hadn&amp;#39;t been. It was starting to creep me out but I&amp;#39;m not really the type to think too deep into things. I was more concerned about the idea that someone was sneaking into my house but that didn&amp;#39;t seem the case as my dogs aren&amp;#39;t too fond of strangers and would have alerted me if something was up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, last week I had heard the usual sound of his car pulling up &amp;amp; the dogs doing their thing. As I walk into the hall to go downstairs and greet him, I hear my dad ask &amp;quot;Are you alright?&amp;quot; in a concerned tone. Walking down the stairs I holler down &amp;quot;yeah, I&amp;#39;m alright. Why?&amp;quot; but he didn&amp;#39;t reply. When I get to the kitchen a few seconds later he&amp;#39;s not there. I open the door and don&amp;#39;t see him or his car so I walk out &amp;amp; look down the driveway-no sign of him.
