I practically know it front to back at this point, which is why I&amp;#39;ve always been extremely confused about the first handful of times I read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first big difference is when Harry and Ron first go to the Gryffindor common room after the start-of-the-year feast. In the book, the first years are let into the common room by Percy. Then they just sidle through the portrait hole and into the common room, and from there J.K. Rowling describes the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; version of the book, the portrait hole is quite different. Instead of just being a simple hole in the wall, it was tunnel with a long stone slide leading into the common room. There was also a moment when Dumbledore&amp;#39;s voice spoke out of nowhere welcoming them to the Gryffindor common room. As for the tunnel itself, it was described as being well lit by candles, which where floating inside small nooks in the walls, framed by red curtains tied back with ornate golden ropes. The slide ended with a large red cushion embroidered with the Gryffindor House crest. After Harry and Ron landed in the common room, the room itself was described the exact same way as it was in the &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another difference, albeit a much smaller one, happens somewhere in the middle of the book. Harry has one of his many introspective moments, one where he appreciates the fact that there seems to be no racism at Hogwarts. Of course, now I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a single mention of race in the entire series other than describing the appearance of a couple of characters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third and definitely the biggest of them all comes near the end, where Snape actually dies in the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; version of the book. Since Snape plays a fairly large role in the series and doesn&amp;#39;t die until the last book (of completely different causes), it doesn&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense that the scene would&amp;#39;ve played out. His death occurs when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are making their way through the obstacles the Hogwarts professors put in place to protect the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Stone. I don&amp;#39;t remember specifically when it happened, but it had to be before McGonagall&amp;#39;s giant Wizard&amp;#39;s Chess game, because Hermione and Ron were still with Harry. In this version of the book, the trio are crossing a long stone bridge in between the last obstacle and the next. There, they&amp;#39;re cut off by Snape, who appears from behind one of the stone gargoyles that dot the sides of the bridge. He tries to stop the trio, and through some sort of mishap ends up blowing up part of the bridge with a spell. Snape then loses his footing on the loose stones and falls to his death. Hermione repairs the bridge with magic, and she, Ron, and Harry proceed to move forward, shaken but determined to find out who was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; after the Stone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, none of those things are in any version of the book, movie, video games, or anything like that.

I&amp;#39;ve been a diehard Harry Potter fan almost my entire life, and I definitely know my shit when it comes to the franchise. I also definitely know that that early version of the story I just described really existed at one point. I can remember reading that version not once, but maybe two or three times. Afterwards, it changed to the version we all know and love today. The oddest part was the fact I can vividly recall reading the book after it had changed. I was confused about where the Gryffindor slide went, and where Snape&amp;#39;s demise went. All of that was different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s certainly one of the most bizarre things I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I first read The Sorcerer's Stone when I was 6, and in the 16 years since then, I've reread it maybe 20-25 times.
