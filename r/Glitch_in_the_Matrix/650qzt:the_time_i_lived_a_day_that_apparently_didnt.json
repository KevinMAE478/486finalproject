My mother had a good friend who was my big sister&amp;#39;s best friend&amp;#39;s mother. My sister, her bf and me all went to the same school, and we used to go to the park near our school almost every evening. The setting of the park was like this: there&amp;#39;s a cafeteria, and separating the cafeteria from the play zone there&amp;#39;s an entrance to a parking lot, so we were told to always be careful before crossing because cars would come and go. So one of those evenings, we were at the cafe and my sister, her friend (her name is Alina) and I were about to cross to go play. My sister was already at the playing area and Alina and I were about to cross. And as we were standing making sure no cars were coming, Alina suddenly points at something near me with an amazed face. I turn around to see what she was pointing at and there were two blond women both dressed in white, and here comes what was outstanding about the scene: they were like perfectly coordinated not only with their outfits but with their gestures, they were walking side by side in unison, making the same hand gestures while speaking, but not in a casual way, just so you can picture what I mean, it was like a mirrored image (I hope you get what I mean). It looked so strange that it captured our attention, and we both laughed at it because we found it funny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the next evening we go to the park again. My sister, Alina and I were about to cross again to go play. Then suddenly, just when I&amp;#39;m about to cross, I see the two same exact women as the day before, and I notice this because it was like a replayed scene. They where walking by the exact same spot, at the exact same time as the day before, doing the exact same hand gestures at the exact same time while moving one leg after another at the exact same time, like a reflection. The only difference this time was that they were dressed all in red instead of white. So I say to Alina while still looking at them &amp;quot;Hey Alina! Look! It&amp;#39;s the same two women we saw yesterday here!&amp;quot; I tell her super excited because of how weird of a situation it was. And the fact that I pointed it out to her is what really tells that we were definetly shocked by the scene the day before. Okay, so if this wasn&amp;#39;t weird enough here comes what&amp;#39;s really strange. Alina looks confused at me and tells me thoughtfully: &amp;quot;Bebi (my nickname)...we didn&amp;#39;t come to the park yesterday&amp;quot;. As you can imagine I froze right there. I had that weird feeling all over my body as if suddenly nothing was real. But I knew I didn&amp;#39;t dream it. And it also wasn&amp;#39;t a deja vu sensation, as I&amp;#39;ve been having deja vus since I can remember and I knew it wasn&amp;#39;t the case. It&amp;#39;s not only weird the fact that I remembered seeing the two women, but also the fact that I vividly remembered going to the park. I mean, I suddenly had lost a whole day, as if it never happened, but it sure did because, I mean, I can&amp;#39;t imagine a whole day out of nowhere right? I thought she was playing a prank on me. So I decided to ask my sister, and also our moms. All three of them agreed that we hadn&amp;#39;t come to the park yesterday. I didn&amp;#39;t tell my mother because in the moment she said we didn&amp;#39;t I just had the feeling that it wasn&amp;#39;t right to tell anything. Like a gut feeling that something about the whole situation wasn&amp;#39;t right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s the story. It haunted me for years, and I always loved to tell all my friends. I never even once doubted that it happened but obviously as the yeara went by I slowly forgot about it and when it came to my mind again some years ago I started doubting myself because of how many years had past since it happened. I mean, the few following years of it happening I still remembered it vividly but with time it started getting more and more blurry. It&amp;#39;s obvious that after 13 years I&amp;#39;m not able to remember anything about those two days aside from the glitch, but I can sure remember how frustrated I was that the universe stole a day from me with no reason.\nSorry for the long story, as I said I&amp;#39;m prone to explain myself a lot and with many details, I really hope you can come with some conclusions. Although the memory kinda faded with time the feeling of it REALLY happening always stayed with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Okay so I've been reading this subreddit for a long time now because I was looking for some place to talk about this kind of life circumstances with no explanation (glitches basically) because I am somehow prone to them happening often since I was little, but it took me long before posting anything because english is not my language and I always need to tell my stories with a lot of detail so it seemed hard for me but I'm gonna give it a try, I hope I explain it as well as I can.\n\nSo this happened when I was about 6.
