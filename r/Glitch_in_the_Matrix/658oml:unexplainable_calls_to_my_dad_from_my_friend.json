So we decide to call this number to see who&amp;#39;s making these claims, and the when this number answers, my heart stopped, its my dad screaming at him to stop calling or he will call the police. I instantly close the call and we block the number, I checked his call history and he has never called my dad once! None of my friends have my dad&amp;#39;s number, none of their parents have his number, only I have my dad&amp;#39;s number but I don&amp;#39;t even have him saved as any contact so he doesn&amp;#39;t see my whatsapp pic and status and I never let anyone use my phone! So I get back home secretly use his phone, and he has been getting calls from my friend all day, like 20 calls! Some of these calls were while I was with my friend, so its impossible he called him. You also can&amp;#39;t find my dad&amp;#39;s number on any phone book or yellow pages.
