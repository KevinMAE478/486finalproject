This probably doesn&amp;#39;t belong here but I don&amp;#39;t really know what else to put it in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far only three things have happened, all within the space of a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, me and my mum were in the living room thinking of a movie to watch, we hadn&amp;#39;t turned on the tv yet and we were the only two people in the house. It was about lunchtime I&amp;#39;d say. We heard a woman&amp;#39;s voice say &amp;quot;hi, I&amp;#39;m here!&amp;quot; sounding as though they were just walking into the kitchen and coming towards where we were. It creeped us out as we weren&amp;#39;t expecting anyone so we quickly went to see who it was but there was no one there and the back door was shut still. We thought it was weird but brushed it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I was round a friends house sleeping the night when my mum texted me &amp;quot;Bloody hell I swear I just heard your voice in the kitchen saying &amp;quot;here you goooo&amp;quot; Ahhhh!&amp;quot; She seemed really freaked out and she definitely wouldn&amp;#39;t be one to lie as she&amp;#39;s sort of skeptical about it all in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: it&amp;#39;s weird ^ because on my most recent birthday (Jan 28) my family and I went out for dinner at a restaurant out of town and my grandma text my mum saying &amp;quot;are you having a nice McDonalds?&amp;quot; Which confused us because we obviously weren&amp;#39;t at McDonalds, we were in the car. So we texted back saying &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re not at McDonalds?&amp;quot; And she said &amp;quot;what, no I just saw you?&amp;quot; But she swears she did see me and my mum. Weird stuff is happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The latest thing could&amp;#39;ve been sleep paralysis but it definitely didn&amp;#39;t feel like it as I could move and everything and I was aware of my surroundings but I guess I could&amp;#39;ve been half asleep/hallucinating but I never have before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I woke up in the middle of the night (I was sleeping on the sofa and my mum was sleeping on the other sofa because we had people round upstairs) and I swear I saw my cousin standing next to where my mum was sleeping, smiling really freaky - wearing everything she usually does - and then she turned to me and looked confused that I could see her and then she proceeded to smirk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her face was so creepy that I turned over and tried to go back to sleep. I don&amp;#39;t know why I didn&amp;#39;t wake my mum up or try to talk to my &amp;quot;cousin&amp;quot; but I guess I was pretty spooked out. I guess you could rule it down to Sleep paralysis but as I said I could move and all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always felt I have a sixth sense/psychic so when I woke up I remembered what happened, still completely sure it wasn&amp;#39;t a dream and actually happened and told my mum and texted my cousin to make sure she was okay just in case and to be on the safe side in case it was a premonition. She texted back later that she was fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll update if anything else happens! Be sure to tell me if this is in the wrong sub and I&amp;#39;ll move it I just really didn&amp;#39;t know where to put it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: something happened about a year ago, I didn&amp;#39;t think it was really relevant to the other occurrences but thought I might as well mention it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had just gotten into bed so I wasn&amp;#39;t even tired yet but I had to get up early the next day so I thought id try to sleep early.
