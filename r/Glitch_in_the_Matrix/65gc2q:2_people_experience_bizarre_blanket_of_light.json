I am in that sort of half awake-half asleep phase, and I think my wife is too. Our eyes are closed. I have blackout curtains on the window, so it is very dark in the room. Suddenly in everything goes white. Like incredibly bright white. I wouldn\u2019t say blinding because I didn\u2019t feel that uncomfortable sensation that bright lights give you that make you want to squint. Just all-encompassing bright whiteness behind my eyelids. It lasted only as long as a blink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes and looked over at the curtains, which were still closed. So, I had a few ideas. The cat maybe walked behind the curtains, letting some light in? No, the cat is not around. Lightening? No, none in the area, no thunder, and the curtains would block it well. Crazy lamp malfunction. Possibly, but again this was so, so bright. Something malfunctioning in my brain? Yes, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I settled on my brain misbehaving, which, yes, was a bit concerning, but at least made sense. Then, about an hour later I am getting ready for work, the curtains are open now, and\u2026, FLASH, there it happened again! Everything goes bright white for like half second. All-encompassing and seemingly sourceless. Again, super bright, but didn\u2019t hurt my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go in the living room and ask my wife if see just saw a flash of light. She says, \u201cOh my god, yes. I\u2019ve been trying to forget about it.\u201d So, she saw the first one, but not the one I just saw again in the bedroom. I wasn\u2019t scared but I felt a bit tingly/chilled both times. Nothing spectacular about it, but it\u2019s just so strange to me. I think the most likely explanation is the lamp turning on and flaring way up, but, man, I can\u2019t really accept that due to the extreme brightness.
