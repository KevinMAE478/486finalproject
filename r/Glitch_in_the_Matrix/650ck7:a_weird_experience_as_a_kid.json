One I have never told anyone happened when I was 12 years old. It was the summer of 1993. I was friends with a few people in my neighborhood. I was more of a loner, got picked on on school a lot during those years. I did have some good neighborhood friends though. One of them was called Amy. She was kinda shy like me, we just hung out and talked usually. One day her brother comes home from boarding school. I was kinda surprised because she never mentioned a brother. Anyways, we started hanging out, Me, Amy, her brother Tommy which is my name too. I thought it was cool we had the same name. I go by Thomas now but it was cool then. Also a few other kids hung out with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We mostly played this game where you have 4 squares and a dodgeball and you bounce it in the squares. I forget the name of it, it was fun as a kid. We also rode bikes and other kid stuff. We did this all summer, 2.5-3 months everyday staying out till past dark. School started back that year and Tommy went back to boarding school. Anyways, about two weeks after school started I asked Amy how Tommy was doing. She said good he&amp;#39;s good, how do you know him. I was shocked, we spent all summer together the three of us. I explained it and she seemed puzzled. I said well tell him I said hi and miss him. About a week later she told me Tommy didn&amp;#39;t know me. I was absolutely flabbergasted and confused. I thought we&amp;#39;ll maybe he&amp;#39;s got a lot going on. The next week I asked her again about Tommy. This time she said she didn&amp;#39;t have a brother and asked who I was. The whole thing was really weird. I spent the whole summer with them. I still look back and wondered what happened. Sometimes I wonder if Tommy was a spirit and only I could see him.
