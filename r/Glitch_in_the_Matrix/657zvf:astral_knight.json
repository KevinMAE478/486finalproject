The main people I hung around that were older than me had powers, and the dreams were incredibly vivid. I could read in them, I can remember almost all of them, and I didn&amp;#39;t realize it, but they were going to effect me in ways I never thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Two: A Knight&lt;/strong&gt;\nIn the dreams, I&amp;#39;m a modern knight in shining armor, called - well - The Knight.  I have this symbol...three dots in the form of a triangle.  I liked the symbol so much I began drawing it on my wrist in real life like in the dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Three: Finding Her&lt;/strong&gt;\nA few years after the dreams were happening, I found a girl who recognized me, though we had never met before.  I had just moved to a new city, and she confronted me, telling me all about the dreams I was having, the place, and she had recurring dreams about me, but more specifically, a moment that I had in one of my earlier dreams.  However, there is a &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot; in the dreams. He found out about her and left &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; dreams and went to hers.  I found this out after she told me, because I never told her he disappeared from my dreams.  She started having nightmares about him, and her friends said she was acting differently. It got to the point where I had a conversation with him through her - basically possession. I had to leave her life so that he couldn&amp;#39;t get to me through her, and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was also just freaked out because I never believed something like that would be possible, so I moved on. But to be honest, for the year following I would have nightmares, panic attacks, etc. about what &lt;em&gt;could&amp;#39;ve&lt;/em&gt; happened, thought I wasn&amp;#39;t a believer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After moving on from that and getting better, the dreams continued, but I never told anyone anything...then this year happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Three: Revelations&lt;/strong&gt; This year, I felt something was coming. I ended up reconnecting with the girl a few years back, but before I moved here, I had a weird dream of a figure warning me that things were going to get worse, and they did. A month after I moved, the girl reached out and told me her nightmares were back. Coincidentally, the bad guy left the dreams again the night before. This time, I tried finding answers, because weird physical things were happening to me. For the first time, the girl and I interacted with him in the real world, sometimes he was an outline but other times he was physically there. Each time we both felt insanely weak and had headaches...however...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time I interacted with him and confronted him, I was on my knees in pain. But my left wrist (more specifically, the dots) were burning. Not a bad feeling, but a feeling that made me feel strong. That night I was meditating to get the feeling back, and when I did I had this inclination to reach out to this necklace I had hanging on my doorknob and try to &amp;quot;move it,&amp;quot; crazy - I know. But it moved. I freaked out and tried to convince myself it didn&amp;#39;t move. However, tests, videos, and 5 eye witnesses later, we were convinced I was beginning to move coins, and objects with my mind - a power I have in the dreams. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began reaching out to people of the paranormal field.  Everyone told me I might be doing this thing called &amp;quot;astral projecting.&amp;quot; It made since and felt liked it worked with my situation. Essentially, they theorized I was projecting to another universe, which was why I would be so exhausted even though I&amp;#39;d have a 14 hour sleep, and why there was insane continuity in the dreams.  I found out there were people at my school who casually talked about astral projecting, and a guy talked about an experience that lasted for 10 years.  I discussed with him my situation to prove to myself that mine just &lt;em&gt;couldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be real. However, we both witnessed similar events and aspects of the &amp;quot;astral realm/universe.&amp;quot;  It freaked myself, and my friends a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even reached out to a few scientists I found who were studying this phenomenon, and they told me it matched others&amp;#39; experiences.  Then I found friends who knew people who knew of people who could heal infections in minutes, or mess with electronics if they were a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still finding out more stuff to this day, and to be honest, I never believed in any of this stuff, so it&amp;#39;s been hard to accept since I&amp;#39;m looking for an answer that shows that none of this is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Main Theory&lt;/strong&gt;The theory my friends brought up was this:\nDuring one of my events, I &amp;quot;merged&amp;quot; with my Knight form, and that must be why I&amp;#39;m experiencing &amp;quot;abilities.&amp;quot; Recently I sprained my thumb and it stung like a bitch. I relaxed and began to think of my healing ability in the other place, and I shit you not, my thumb was immediately &lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt; for the rest of the day.  It was recent too, and it was a bad sprain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: There have been a LOT of experiences and stories/events in these dreams - this is literally the shortest I could get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, my goal is to reach out and find others like me - to see if anyone is interested in discussing their experiences, whether it&amp;#39;s Astral Projection craziness, or abilities. Because, IF this is real, a man I&amp;#39;ve been fighting for years is out and about trying to cross over, and he&amp;#39;s threatened those I care for, and has already shown he can affect others. Help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been astral projecting to another universe since I was 8 and have found two people who have gone to the same place, and have been experiencing weird abilities recently and am looking for others like me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Here&amp;#39;s a video of me moving a coin: &lt;a href=\"https://streamable.com/blx4r\"&gt;https://streamable.com/blx4r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: No, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s spirits - none of the people are dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Ok, I need help, but prepare yourselves for the short version of an almost 11 year long story...\n\n**Part One: The First Dream**\nIt started when I was nearly 8 years old - I started having a dream about this place - this city - a world much like ours, but the city, nor the people, ever exist.
