All of the events in the dream happened the same way they did in real life, except for one detail I\u2019ll mention later. The dreams all happened before the real events, and they include places I\u2019d never been before, people I\u2019d never met, and events I didn\u2019t know would occur. What the dreams and events share in common is not just a few details, but all details save for a few, like a painting instead of a TV. There were a number of people involved, maybe up to 10, and what makes me nervous is that there are possibly a couple of events that either haven\u2019t occurred yet, or that I don\u2019t remember occurring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years ago I was into lucid dreaming but haven\u2019t been for a long time. When I awoke after having the first dream, I was utterly shocked at how lucid it was, and how long it had been since I\u2019ve dreamt like that. I remember specifically thinking it felt more like a memory than a dream, and I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever had a dream like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the dreams I would visit people I knew and they would tell me about how a person, say Joe, was going around saying things about me. This was the primary topic of conversation in every dream, but the events differed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s been some time since those dreams, months. Recently I was angry about how those things Joe said had gotten around to my brother. I went to talk to a friend about it, a friend who had mentioned it to me in passing, but he didn\u2019t remember a single thing. We talked to a few other people about it, and no one knew what I was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized the conversations about Joe were part of the dreams, but the events of the dreams happened exactly the same way. I haven\u2019t been able to place it until now, months later, because I\u2019ve felt like the dreams and my memory of the events were one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one dream, a friend talks about what Joe said, and then invites me to his engagement party that I didn\u2019t know he was planning. I remember when he invited me in real life, and felt a very strong and strange sense of deja-vu. In both the dream and reality, we were in the exact same location. I mentioned to him that it sounded crazy, but I was having dreams that came true, as another event happened prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another dream, another friend talks about what Joe said, and then talks about a book he wanted to get. I asked him when he was getting the book, and he told me \u201csoon, like in a few weeks.\u201d A few weeks ago I met up with this guy and he had gotten that book. In both the dream and reality, we were in the car, parked in the same spot, with 3 of us sitting in the same location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a dream that my friend Mike had gotten in trouble, and I went to another friend Nick\u2019s apartment to help him out. Nick\u2019s girlfriend was at his apartment, we were sitting around the table. Nick mentioned what Joe had said about me, and I was embarrassed to talk about it in front of his girl, so I got up and left the table. I went and sat on my knees in the living room, where a friend Xavier called me to tell me Mike was in trouble. He also told me about what Joe had said, and again, I was embarrassed because Nick\u2019s girl was sitting at the table and could hear me, and I didn\u2019t know her that well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality, I had never been to Nick\u2019s apartment or even knew about his girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks later I got a phone call from Nick to tell me Mike was in trouble, could I come to his apartment. I told him, \u201cI know it sounds crazy but I had a dream this happened, but you didn\u2019t call me about it, Xavier did.\u201d I went to his apartment and outside I met his girl for the first time. We went into his apartment and I walked around, having the most insane, gutted feeling that I had been there before and knew the place. I mentioned out loud, \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d and he remarked that he thought I hadn\u2019t. I even remembered the puzzle on his table, and the miniature statue of the Eiffel Tower under his TV, only in the dream, it was a painting instead of a TV. I remembered because during Xavier\u2019s conversation I looked leftwards and noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat around the table until Xavier called and wanted to speak with me. I walked into the living room and sat on my knees, just like I did in the dream, but at the time I didn\u2019t realize it, I only felt the weirdest feeling. I told Xavier \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I had a dream you called me about this.\u201d We had a bit of a conversation. I told him, \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation before,\u201d and he told me, \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were other events and people, all telling me what Joe had said, but recently after talking to people not a single person knows anything about it. But still, all of the events in the dream have happened except for a couple. I\u2019m a bit afraid by talking to people about it I may have set certain events in motion, causing those conversations about Joe to come true, as that is pretty much the only difference between the events in the dream and in reality. I\u2019m hoping that those things are really just filler, or a theme to tie the events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve told a few people, I know some believe me due to their own experiences, and I know some think I\u2019m going crazy.
