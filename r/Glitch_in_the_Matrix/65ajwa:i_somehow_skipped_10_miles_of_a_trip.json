After the concerts, we&amp;#39;ve made it a habit of going to any nearby fast food place that does milkshakes, so that I can get a chocolate, and he can get a strawberry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we had recently visited a concert at a park, one with one of those huge ampitheatres with free admission for whatever reason, when we decided to drive home. Before I continue, I just want to say that this venue was close to our home at the time, and we both knew the streets like the back of our hands. \nAfter getting into the car, we went to a nearby JCW&amp;#39;s, getting our usual shakes, and began to head home. I looked at the clock, it reading 12:03 am. The fast food place was about half a mile from the main road that went through town, it&amp;#39;s one of those roads that you can literally just drive in the direction of, and it&amp;#39;ll pop up to let you know exactly where you are, and how to get home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turning the keys in the ignition, we started along a street that we both knew would get us to the main road I was just talking about. We knew this street, we had travelled down it countless times. After about thirty seconds of driving, my brother pointed out a nice house that we hadn&amp;#39;t seen before, saying that it must have recently been built, and he pointed out the eaves of the roof while talking about how much he admired it. We kept driving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, he pointed out another house, and then two more. As a side note, no alarm bells were going off at this point because our area is growing quickly and new developments like this are a common sight. The thing is... as we kept driving down the street, it started looking less and less familiar, not at all like the street that we had driven down countless times. Still, no alarm bells were going off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up ahead, my attention was shifted away from the houses, and turned to the traffic light that heralded the main road through town. I knew this traffic light because it had a subway at the corner that I would often visit to get after-work sandwiches. As we got closer though, I was confused by the fact that there was no subway. In fact, there weren&amp;#39;t any of the other stores that were usually there. Also, as we got closer, we both realized that this intersection turned onto a two lane street, rather than the six road that led through the town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at my brother, and he was just as confused as I was about what was going on, being that neither of us recognized exactly where we were. A car honked behind us, and I realized that I was going 10 under the speed limit because of my looking around at the intersection. I sped up and passed the light, thinking that it was possible that this was just an intersection before the main road, and that things looked different around here after dark for some reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we continued driving, things didn&amp;#39;t get better. The neighborhood we were in was not at all familiar, and to make matters worse, it didn&amp;#39;t even have the street lights so common to our area, and we couldn&amp;#39;t see the majority of the houses because of it. We kept driving. After cresting a hill, my brother and I both uneasy at this point, I heard my brother mutter &amp;quot;What the hell?&amp;quot; under his breath, and looked ahead to see what was possibly the most disturbing thing I have seen to this day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were looking at a strip mall nearly 10 miles away from where we should have been. Somehow, we had not only passed the six lane road leading through town, but had ended up ten miles ahead of where we had thought we were. We had to turn around to head home, and we encountered nothing out of the ordinary on the way. \nWe don&amp;#39;t go to that ampitheatre as often, and when we do, the street that we had gone down never pops up. To this day, I have no idea what happened, and can&amp;#39;t think of any explanation as to why we ended up 10 miles out of our way after ending up in a foreign neighborhood. The whole experience still gives me chills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, or have any experiences like this, please let me know.
