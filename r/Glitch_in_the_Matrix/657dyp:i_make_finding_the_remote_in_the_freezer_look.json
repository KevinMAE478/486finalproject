I misjudged how dry these were and waaaay over did it on my dosage and kinda broke my brain for a bit. Anyway while we were coming up we stopped by a convenience store and I went and bought us drinks to take with us on the nature trail we were headed too. My friend and I both remember me having my wallet at the store. Well after the next several hours and a fun bout of ego death, my wallet had disappeared. I scoured the several places we went and found nada. Today however, as I&amp;#39;m getting ready to do laundry and going through all my pockets, I just so happen to find MY WALLET in a pair of shorts. The thing is, I wore those shorts almost a week prior to the night we tripped, and they were at the bottom of my laundry basket. Now I confirmed my wallet was most definitely missing the morning after the shroom trip, but at that point I had still been 40+ miles away from that laundry basket since last seeing it. I have no clue how this happened. Now this isn&amp;#39;t the first time this kind of stuff has happened to me. So either I randomly black out and hide shit from myself, or I am a wizard/neo and my abilities solely consist of making small objects of importance to me disappear and reappear without any particular goal or trigger. Other examples are car keys teleporting to the back of my art supply drawer, under my paints and paint cup while on vacation. I once made my phone appear between one of the slats on the underside of my bed and the mattress, but not towards the edge of the bed, right in the middle. I also once got my keys inside a couch, but after removing the cushions we could not even find a seam that went farther into the couch, had to cut a hole in the fabric on the bottom of the couch and pull them out. Oh and once when I was around 12, I lost my hacky sack that I played with constantly, and didn&amp;#39;t find it till several years later when unpacking a storage bin of my old books that had been in the attic for longer than  I had that hacky sack.
