The first time this happened was about a week ago, when I was doing homework at my computer desk. I had my pencil and stuff, so I do my homework and pack the stuff up. My pencil is gone, I check everywhere (Hey it&amp;#39;s my favorite don&amp;#39;t judge me) and it&amp;#39;s nowhere to be found. Fine, whatever. Next morning, get my phone in there, bam. Pencil. I dunno what the deal is, but I think &amp;quot;Whatever&amp;quot; and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later that day, I get out some icebreakers, put them on my desk at school and talk to someone, fairly close to my desk. I check on them every once and a while to make sure nobody took any. Still there. Walk to my desk, they aren&amp;#39;t there. Now, while I look around, I move my backpack and bam. I hear them shake.

Trees, single house on the left after a while, trees, single house on right (Very big, usually a mansion or large lot) and then it splits two ways into a neighborhood. However, the trees are\nDying as I go through. I feel like if they all die I&amp;#39;ll stop going that route? It&amp;#39;s all so strange. Any explanations guys?
