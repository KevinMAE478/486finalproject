I went for a walk after my classes let out because it was nice out and I had a bad day. I use this app when I walk that kind of puts you in a really cool story and will only tell you the next part of said story after you&amp;#39;ve gone a certain distance. In between parts, you listen to your own music. Mine is a playlist I have for this specific app, set to shuffle, so I never know what song is coming next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I took a different route than I normally do. There&amp;#39;s a road that goes through a nature preserve that&amp;#39;s starting to get really pretty now that spring&amp;#39;s arriving, so I decided to go that way instead of through the subdivision near my apartment. Anyway, I was walking, the part of my story was just coming to an end, and up about twenty-ish yards ahead of me, there&amp;#39;s a kinda sharp curve, and the rest of the road is obscured by the trees. As I got closer, I looked down to answer a text. While my eyes are down, I hear tires squealing, so I jerk my head up and see this car just try to take the curve WAY too hard. I was at the curve at that point, and the car&amp;#39;s side mirror actually hit my arm near my shoulder and just ripped it out of its socket. To give you an idea of how fast this guy had to have been going, I have very loose shoulders that tend to mildly dislocate at random, and it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt anymore, if it ever did to begin with. But this hit caused pain so intense that it was easily the worst pain I&amp;#39;d ever felt (except MAYBE that time involving a door and my Achilles tendon). So I&amp;#39;m on the ground at this point, my arm totally limp and tingling and shooting with pain, and this car is out of control. It skids, tries to make the turn, and just slams into a tree. Massive wreck. Slim chance of survival. I&amp;#39;m crying and freaking the hell out and I think screaming. And then I just...black out. Like, it felt both like a long blink and like hours had passed. But when I opened my eyes again, my arm was fine, the car was gone, my eyes weren&amp;#39;t even wet, I was standing about 20 yards from the curve, and my app was just finishing up the last part of the story I heard before all that happened. It was like someone reset their game to the last save point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, that sounds totally made up or like, I don&amp;#39;t know, maybe I had a really really vivid hallucination for no reason at all but that&amp;#39;s not even the weirdest part, people. The weirdest part was the fact that, as I&amp;#39;m standing there, totally motionless, trying to figure out what in the actual fuck just happened, I hear tires skidding again over the exact same song I heard them last time (Back From the Dead by Skillet, by the way). My head jerks up, but instead of watching that guy totally probably die again, I see the EXACT same car instead just slow down really abruptly as it came into view and take the turn with very few issues.

It was the same car, I swear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if anyone can offer me an explanation that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I should be on all kinds of drugs, I would greatly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Okay, so I know that this is going to sound unbelievable and crazy and like I should be locked up somewhere on a whole bunch of drugs, but I swear on my life that this happened, and I'm freaking out.
