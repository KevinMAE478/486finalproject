I can explain the feeling though aside from the hazey light headedness. I felt heavy but not drunk or high heavy, I felt light heavy like I could feel my weight in space. It was quite the experience and made me ponder on the thought if I had changed anything else other than maias mind. Oh and I should mention that maia never ended up doing her homework.
