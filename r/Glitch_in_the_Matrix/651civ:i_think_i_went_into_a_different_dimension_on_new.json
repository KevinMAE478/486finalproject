My mom would always go to sleep before the ball dropped with the excuse that, &amp;quot;Whatever I&amp;#39;m doing on New Year&amp;#39;s Eve sets the tone for the rest of the year, and I want to get good sleep all year.&amp;quot; Haha, super boring. And I&amp;#39;ve never really had many friends, so I would just spend the night maybe with a couple people, not really doing much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This New Years, I went to a different city and met some new friends. I had a pretty amazing time. I got super drunk, went to two clubs, met a lot of great people. It was wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, I didn&amp;#39;t feel much different personally. But everyone around me felt different. My sister and I have never gotten along very well. We would always fight. We&amp;#39;re 10 years apart and just could never see each other&amp;#39;s side of things. My mom and I on the other hand were best friends. I told her everything, without any hesitation, no matter what it was. I was so open and honest with her. I felt that she was my sister in another life because we didn&amp;#39;t really have a mother daughter relationship. There weren&amp;#39;t any boundaries, which was good and bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New Year&amp;#39;s Day, I woke up and I couldn&amp;#39;t talk to her. I was desperate to. I wanted to tell her all about my night, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t. There was something strange. I looked in her eyes and my intuition told me, &amp;quot;that woman is not your sister from a past life&amp;quot;. I know I already sound crazy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then almost instantly, my sister and I, who rarely talk, were like best friends. She&amp;#39;s still a little standoffish just because that&amp;#39;s how she is, but she became extremely open with me. We get along so well now and can talk about so much. We never could before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then when I got back home from the trip (which I was on with my mom and sister), my best friend didn&amp;#39;t even tell me she was planning to move to a different state. She moved three weeks later and I found out only a week before it happened, which isn&amp;#39;t like her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who I hadn&amp;#39;t talked to for a few months and I reconciled and became much closer. And he&amp;#39;s very different. He never once mentioned the red hot chili peppers and now he knows all the lyrics to their songs. I asked him about it and he said he&amp;#39;s always loved them. He also talks about very deep things now, which he never did. Maybe it was the time apart? But it&amp;#39;s strange that he&amp;#39;s just changed so much as a person over the course of two months when I&amp;#39;ve known him for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A guy who&amp;#39;d never cared about me before started talking to me regularly and hanging out with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend from California decided to move in with me on New Year&amp;#39;s Day and we moved to a different city together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People mention names from high school all the time and I can&amp;#39;t remember almost anyone I went to school with. I graduated just three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a party and several people I&amp;#39;d never talked to knew my name, knew a lot about me and acted like we&amp;#39;d had conversations before. They said they went to high school with me. I remembered their names but they were much older than me and I&amp;#39;d definitely never interacted with them. I was also pretty unpopular in school and people acted like I&amp;#39;d been popular almost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also used to self harm in many ways and I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to anymore. Just all of a sudden, which is a very positive thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom doesn&amp;#39;t remember very specific things about my childhood that shaped me into who I am today. She doesn&amp;#39;t remember how close we were or the crazy conversations we&amp;#39;ve had. It made her cry when I was telling her that we&amp;#39;d talked about certain things she just couldn&amp;#39;t remember in any way. Our bond is so different now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And my dad who I never could talk to and who was always emotionally abusive, is now helpful when I need him and comforts me?? It&amp;#39;s insane. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of things are just so blurry to me. And also, my left index fingerprint, which I saved on my phone to unlock it, won&amp;#39;t be accepted now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory was that maybe I killed myself in another dimension on New Years and went to a dimension where I&amp;#39;m not always so depressed.
