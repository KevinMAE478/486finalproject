I look at her, and she looks.. strange. My white cat is kind of skinny and has short hair but this night her face looked really chubby and her hair looked really fluffy.She looked kind of blurry as well.. i thought maybe i was falling asleep so i rubbed my eyes and got a closer look at her but she still looked fluffy and blurry.
