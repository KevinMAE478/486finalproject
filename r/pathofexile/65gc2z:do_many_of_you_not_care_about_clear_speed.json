Efficiency is all that matters if you want lots o&amp;#39; money. In most games it&amp;#39;s finding a way to efficiently farm something or trading. In this game it&amp;#39;s how fast can you skip every...single...item...that isn&amp;#39;t currency or the right map. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean I love PoE so don&amp;#39;t get me wrong but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you have done fucked up when &amp;gt;90% of your population downloads third party files to not see the massive amounts of completely worthless bullshit on the ground. This bullshit takes up so much space you can&amp;#39;t see what you&amp;#39;re doing and will probably be a screen or more away from it&amp;#39;s actual pick up location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not every item needs to be good but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they all need to be pieces of shit either. This is a false dichotomy. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be one or the other. D3 is shit because everything is &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and you&amp;#39;re probably going to vendor it. The PoE system is shit because you KNOW the item is complete trash before you even pick it up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry...I got carried away there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/endrant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pathofexile", "name": "t1_dgard7i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492298670.0, "created_utc": 1492269870.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sf6m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gc2z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sf6m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gc2z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgasinm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rsKizari", "parent_id": "t1_dga6kzp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pathofexile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "+1 for ADHD turbo builds", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;+1 for ADHD turbo builds&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pathofexile", "name": "t1_dgasinm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492300294.0, "created_utc": 1492271494.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga6kzp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "spoobydoo", "parent_id": "t3_65gc2z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pathofexile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've found that, for me, the biggest contributor to \"clear speed\" is efficient mapping rather than some ADHD turbo builds.
