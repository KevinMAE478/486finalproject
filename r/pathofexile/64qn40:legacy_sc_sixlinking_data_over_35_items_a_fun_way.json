Great bow, but not super good market value. I 6l one in standard a while back for a few ex, barely broke even. Tried to 6l one this league, lost 10ex (earlier on in the league) and never saw a 6l. After that, I basically decided to never both linking anything non-meta. Even if you are lucky, you&amp;#39;ll only make a small profit. Get unlucky, and you just bleed exalts.
