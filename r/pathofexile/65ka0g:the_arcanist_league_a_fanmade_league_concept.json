only one option, imagine the more passive players).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-most master missions are &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; in concept, even more so now than they used to, it&amp;#39;s clear that the point is to do it on the fly while normally clearing, rare occasions need you to sidetrack, this suggestion in &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; occasions will have it as requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-RNG manipulation seems outrageous to me, essence already pushed it far, i really don&amp;#39;t think we need any more, and specially not the way you suggest, it makes maxing this aspect of your account/character ABSOLUTELY mandatory every league unless you expect to play very casually, and even then, you are very compelled to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-an entire set just to craft? i don&amp;#39;t like it but i guess some would, most of this is addressed in the point above, same with uniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-the new currency seems like essences on steroids, then you see the absurdity of the corrupted currency, fuck no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-daily challenges seems Cool, probably the only thing i&amp;#39;d keep from all this, adds a new &amp;quot; competitive&amp;quot; layer to the hardcore players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;overall, you miss a huge point of what GGG does on the league system, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; mechanics with not a huge amount of depth deliberately, it could be argued that it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;proving grounds&amp;quot; for adding new mechanics in the long run, and this certainly isn&amp;#39;t one, the amount of content this adds is that of an expansion ( new item slots for instance) and it&amp;#39;s not even a promising one, barraging players with crafting missions that require them to have at least a general knowledge on how to no fuck themselves economically seems irresponsible at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;very good job on the format
