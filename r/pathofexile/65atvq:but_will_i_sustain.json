Not gonna go into details (not that it&amp;#39;s top secret, but I don&amp;#39;t need any more competition), but it&amp;#39;s pretty damn cost-effective if you know what you&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mind that I didn&amp;#39;t engage much in breach-running (top $$$, but I&amp;#39;ve had enough of it duirng Breach so I let it go) or uber lab farming (also top $$$ if you have a build geared for it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, clearing one map took forever for me, but I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; maximised yield per map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMHO, it sounds pretty damn obvious to me, but it&amp;#39;s nothing special really. Maxkey uberlab speed-farming or shaped strand speed-farming would probably be much more profitable overall due to sheer volume/hr, but I play my games to have fun, not to be a hamster in a wheel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pathofexile", "name": "t1_dg93nje", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203944.0, "created_utc": 1492175144.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8zjey", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SoNyeoShiDo", "parent_id": "t1_dg8z39c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pathofexile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Assuming your endgame grinds are negligible, are you trying to say that you make almost an exalt per map?
