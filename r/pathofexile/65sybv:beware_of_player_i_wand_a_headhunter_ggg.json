And if buyer don't know the map you can post just ANY fucking picture with it. Probly wouldn't take longer than couple min to just pic in google so this method is pretty flaved if the seller is scamming a lot and knows this kinda stuff. \n\nEdit: And even if seller lets buyer see the map i don't think finding specific box in google would be too hard for many layouts...
