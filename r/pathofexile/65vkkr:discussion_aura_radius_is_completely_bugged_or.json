The primary thing that matters is the distance between the origin point of the skill and the target, and radius increased that reach linearly. Now that we have area scaling, increases to that distance is being penalized by diminishing returns that come from difference in total area covered, which is a worthless metric.\n\nWith an Aura, you don't care about the total amount of area you are covering.
