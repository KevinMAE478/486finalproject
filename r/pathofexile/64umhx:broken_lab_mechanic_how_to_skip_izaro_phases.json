At that point there were really only two places that I could shave off time: loading screens (and I was already at ~2-4s loading screens--for a total of 30-40 s or so depending on layout), and finding some way to decrease the first two izaro phases (I could already DPS him down in the third phase in like 2 seconds).\n\nI talked to you about how the #1 guy (hundertelf) must have figured out some way to get around the buggy izaro mechanics, or maybe figured out a way to get faster/instant load times, and you kinda shot that idea down--I assumed it was because you may have been working with some similar plan on your off-stream runs since you share slower runs on your stream.\n\nI was trying to figure out how to get around the buggy fight mechanics when I just eventually gave up and quit POE for a while--but I went back online today and a friend directed me to this reddit post.\n\nThere's probably still another 2-3 ways to abuse (or rather, overcome) his preparation/exiting mechanics during the first two fights.

You can maybe shave off a bit more time by having perfect server connection/ramdisk for load screens--but that can be corrected by GGG having the timer only run off some area load/exit grace period, so there would be the possibility of competition across various network connection/gaming system types (even regular hard disks).
