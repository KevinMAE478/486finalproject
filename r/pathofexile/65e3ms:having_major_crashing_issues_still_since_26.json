Here crashes randomly sometime 2,3 times per 3hrs, sometime like right now actually 1 in 8hrs, sometime none. The last crash was 10min ago till i spam in world chat staying in h/o, just game froze and i saw windows mouse cursor, ctl-alt-del and then i alt tab the game with usual msg - pathofexile.exe has stopped working. Im using AMD Crimson 17.3.3. Path of Exile is most bugged game I ever played. Not just crashes but sometime texture bugs similar like artifacts not on the screen but on the textures on the ground mostly. I feel so bad cuz I bought AMD RX video. I didnt expected to be so so bad performance, only in POE... tomorrow will reinstall windows 7 to win10, i hope to be better on 10. Every week i intall new video drivers but same shit. Terrible performance, crashes, texture glitches etc. just scream I want this nightmare to be over... sometime i want to crash the video card but its not AMD fault. Just GGG has amateurs programmers. Like 5 years they cant optimize the fuckin game on AMD.     edit: i tried almost all ofc. Im running on DX9ex too all the time.
