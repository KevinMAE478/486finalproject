It solves problems for one specific build, useful in that niche but not broadly powerful.  \nOccultist:  Useful stats for an ES chaos build, except for the pointless 20% inc damage.  People use Occultist!  \nAssassin:  Like a mini-Assassin, but it's unique because you can do mostly left-tree stuff instead of starting as Shadow.  \nDeadeye:  It is good and useful, but imo it's not actually well-designed, it's too broad.  \n  \n**The bad**:  \nGuardian:  Filler block and conduit.  \nInquisitor:  Filler generic stats with conditions attached.  \nNecromancer:  4% damage reduction, 15% increased damage, some cast speed.  Filler generic stats with conditions attached.  \nElementalist:  Weak generic bonuses, and one useful one with a too-restrictive condition attached.  \nSaboteur:  Basically just 20% trap recovery.  \nTrickster:  Some useful and unique stats, but tied to conditions, again.  \nPathfinder:  Worse than ranger Pathfinder, that's for fuckin' sure.  \nRaider:  Blood Rage + Silver flask, the ascendancy.  \nChampion:  Kinda tempting for a totem build b/c of the taunt on hit, but... nah.  The fortify stuff is wasted and bad.  \nGladiator:  15% Bleed chance... and filler.  \nSlayer:  Was briefly OP for vacuum farming builds lol, but then they changed \"stun on full life\" to \"stun on full life if you do damage\".
