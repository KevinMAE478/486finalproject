Assuming the Shield has a paltry 2 km thick shell the overall volume of the structure would equal 282 quadrillion km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material (which assuming it had a density of iron would weigh more than the sun itself); even if Didact began construction of the project immediately following the end of the Human-Forerunner war and it continued up until his exile in an 8,000 year time period as a lower limit the Forerunners would have to assemble 1,120,716 cubic kilometers of material per second. To put it into accepted SW-vs-ST parlance, that&amp;#39;s the equivalent of manufacturing the second Death Star every five minutes, non-stop, for nearly eight thousand years - or stripping away an Earth sized planet every nine days. And despite this gargantuan effort the Shield wasn&amp;#39;t the only of of its kind, many more were built and hidden across the galaxy - and to add insult to injury not only was this a secret project, it was swept under the rug by Faber because he preferred the Halo Array.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, pretty impressive no matter how you slice it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The combined hive fleets number more than the mass of a thousand stars....way way WAY More.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Show me your calcs then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let us take an estimate that there are 6.4 billion potentially habitable worlds in the galaxy.\nTake a typical Earth-mass and figure out how many tonnes you need to take out to reduce its volume by 4%... or fuckit, let&amp;#39;s just flat-out remove 4% of the mass for simplicity&amp;#39;s sake.\nSo that&amp;#39;s 5.97219 \u00d7 1021 - 96% x 6.4 billion.\n= 2.388876x1020 x 6.4 billion\n= 1.5288806e30\nThen divide that by assuming each Tyranid ship is equivalent to a Lunar-class Cruiser at 28 megatonnes.\n= 5.4602879e22 Tyranid ships from the resources of one galaxy.\nOne hundred sextillion is.... 1e23.\nAnd for the ultimate high end Tyranids, multiply that by 1000.\nFor a total of 10e26 ships, massing at a total of 10e33kg. This is a insane high end assuming that the tyranids take away 4% of an planet&amp;#39;s mass which they don&amp;#39;t. And it comes out to about a thousand suns, or the mass of a few billion earths.
