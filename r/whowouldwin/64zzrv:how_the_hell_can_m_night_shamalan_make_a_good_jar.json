Jar-Jar is the first creature in millennia to deliberately use writing, explains LOC9. Due to the rise of recorded holograms before the birth of the Republic, organics entirely forgot how to reading and writing. Everything was done with holograms and live transmissions. Even the Jedi couldn't write. At best, Galactic citizens in specialized jobs could roughly interpret two-dimensional hieroglypics that some droids kept as legacy code, but that was it.\n\nLOC9 explains that it has been trying to study Jar-Jar since before the rise of Palpatine to Chancellorship - since Jar-Jar \"made a mess\" that others chastised him for but which LOC9 recognized as drawing.\n\nLOC9 believes that Jar-Jar, in a state of almost quintessential ignorance, somehow became possessed of the ability to use writing, which no other organic can do. LOC9 wants to accompany Jar-Jar across the galaxy to recover ancient samples of true writing which may reveal the history of the Force and even the discovery of hyperspace. LOC9 will \n\nJar-Jar, astounded by the power of writing as explained by LOC9, agrees to accompany the droid, but only on condition that he is taught everything LOC9 knows. LOC9 accepts, and Jar-Jar, vowing to escape his ignorance and master writing, vows never to speak aloud again.\n\nTogether, Jar-Jar and LOC9 travel. Jar-Jar remains completely silent as he studies ancient scraps of writing. The two traverse ancient ruins, defeating alien guardians and bewildering traps. \n\nJar-Jar reverently studies writing, including hieroglyphs, alphabets, and cuneiforms. He puts his whole body into the motions of writing, discovering that he's creating a new form of martial arts based on the motion of script strokes. He practices with long \"writing sticks\" of his own design.\n\nAct III. LOC9 and Jar-Jar discover a great cache on an unrecorded planet, which contains what might be an entire written library. Eager to study it, they set off, not knowing they've attracted the attention of Imperial bounty hunters who are chasing LOC9, the last Jedi archive droid, to destroy him and harvest his secrets.\n\nOnce in the library, Jar-Jar and LOC9 study. The native creatures, squid-like and ink-spraying humanoids, curiously observe them. They have no understanding of the written rules that surround them. Together, Jar-Jar and LOC9 uncover an incredible secret: \n\nThere is a *second* dimension to the Force. It is not merely divided into Light and Dark. It is also divided into Fortune and Fate, the axis that divides luckiness (good or bad) from inevitability. \n\nJar-Jar is force-sensitive. His powers lie not in the light or the dark, but in both sensing broad destinies and in shifting the luck of himself and those around them. Jar-Jar has rediscovered a long-forgotten part of using the Force.\n\nBut upon this discovery, the bounty hunters set upon the library. Jar-Jar and LOC9 fight to protect the native and to escape, but they are being overwhelmed. A blaster shot flies right between Jar-Jar's eyestalks, barely missing him, only to strike LOC9 and disrupt his power cells. \n\nAs LOC9's power fades, he gives Jar-Jar one last gift: An ancient lightsaber. Jar-Jar claims and actives it, producing a thin blade, so deep blue as to be almost ultra-violet black. As the beam slowly extends, it produces no sound.\n\nJar-Jar, without saying a word, gracefully cuts his way through the bounty hunters, the lightsaber scorching the air as it moves, leaving fiery trails of written runes briefly in the air. With moments, Jar-Jar has slain them all, and he carries forth LOC9's inactive body to their ship.\n\nAfter laying LOC9 down respectfully, Jar-Jar opens the navigation computer. Meditating on the new axis of the Force, Jar-Jar relies on pure intuition and punches in coordinates, then launches his ship into hyperspace.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Act I.

Jar-Jar remains completely silent as he studies ancient scraps of writing. The two traverse ancient ruins, defeating alien guardians and bewildering traps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jar-Jar reverently studies writing, including hieroglyphs, alphabets, and cuneiforms. He puts his whole body into the motions of writing, discovering that he&amp;#39;s creating a new form of martial arts based on the motion of script strokes. He practices with long &amp;quot;writing sticks&amp;quot; of his own design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Act III. LOC9 and Jar-Jar discover a great cache on an unrecorded planet, which contains what might be an entire written library. Eager to study it, they set off, not knowing they&amp;#39;ve attracted the attention of Imperial bounty hunters who are chasing LOC9, the last Jedi archive droid, to destroy him and harvest his secrets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once in the library, Jar-Jar and LOC9 study. The native creatures, squid-like and ink-spraying humanoids, curiously observe them. They have no understanding of the written rules that surround them. Together, Jar-Jar and LOC9 uncover an incredible secret: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; dimension to the Force. It is not merely divided into Light and Dark. It is also divided into Fortune and Fate, the axis that divides luckiness (good or bad) from inevitability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jar-Jar is force-sensitive. His powers lie not in the light or the dark, but in both sensing broad destinies and in shifting the luck of himself and those around them. Jar-Jar has rediscovered a long-forgotten part of using the Force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But upon this discovery, the bounty hunters set upon the library. Jar-Jar and LOC9 fight to protect the native and to escape, but they are being overwhelmed. A blaster shot flies right between Jar-Jar&amp;#39;s eyestalks, barely missing him, only to strike LOC9 and disrupt his power cells. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As LOC9&amp;#39;s power fades, he gives Jar-Jar one last gift: An ancient lightsaber. Jar-Jar claims and actives it, producing a thin blade, so deep blue as to be almost ultra-violet black. As the beam slowly extends, it produces no sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jar-Jar, without saying a word, gracefully cuts his way through the bounty hunters, the lightsaber scorching the air as it moves, leaving fiery trails of written runes briefly in the air. With moments, Jar-Jar has slain them all, and he carries forth LOC9&amp;#39;s inactive body to their ship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After laying LOC9 down respectfully, Jar-Jar opens the navigation computer. Meditating on the new axis of the Force, Jar-Jar relies on pure intuition and punches in coordinates, then launches his ship into hyperspace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg766h3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088224.0, "created_utc": 1492059424.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zzrv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zzrv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg768kx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ubergorp", "parent_id": "t1_dg6nnl7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Boyhood", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyhood&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg768kx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088322.0, "created_utc": 1492059522.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6nnl7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thecowninja", "parent_id": "t3_64zzrv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Are we only allowed to use current (alive) actors in their current ages, or can we use actors in their \"prime?\" Makes a difference in how I respond.
