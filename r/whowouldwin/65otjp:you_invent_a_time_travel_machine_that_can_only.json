The other guy may know more or less than me.\n\nI'll address your second point first- ten cobblers in an assembly line can probably make shoes faster than working individually. Go to a guild or the king, show them this manufacturing technique, and get some pocket money to fund the next project.\n\nStart with batteries of a sort- get small wooden kegs filled with acid or saltwater (hoping that whoever is in this area can know the difference and get me actual acid and not a caustic substance, because IIRC those are a base most of the time), try using copper rods on one end and different metals (hoping for zinc) on the other. I've also seen those cardboard/saltwater/coin cell batteries, which could also do if I packed a bunch of them in a box.\n\n Later, move on to trying to work on generators. I'm a sophomore in high school, so I probably know less than that dude, But I know that rotating magnets and some other metal spinning around each other in some way create electricity in a generator. \"Lodestones\" were known at the time. A few weeks' worth of experimenting with all the possible variables involved (frame material, way they move around each other, using coils of metal wire) should be more than enough to learn how to generate electricity based off of my extremely limited current knowledge.\n\nMoving on to our final goal, light. I've put thin wire between battery diodes (that's the term, right?) before, and found out that it glows. I know from a research report in elementary school that Edison's big breakthrough was from taking most to all of the air out of lightbulbs (so that the filament doesn't burn through too quickly) and that he used carbon from lamps of some sort as a filament. I can get the carbon buttons he used from some oil lamp (probably) and connect either a carbon filament or extremely thin metal shaving (\"wire\") to a battery like I made before.\n\nI pay a glassblower of some kind to make me a small, thin, clear round vase- and detail what I need to to make the next ones of his better lightbulbs. Even one will be okay to practice on, though. I can make the \"bottom\" end of the lightbulb out of clay with a straw through it to suck out all the air I can and then close the ends around it to seal that off- it'll look rough, but hopefully it would have a low enough oxygen concentration that whatever's inside will burn bright and often. The alternative to this is heating up the air inside a lot, then sealing it with the wire and filament inside (and hoping it cools slowly enough that the glass doesn't crack or the bulb doesn't shatter because of a different air pressure- although I think that if the glass was handmade by a glassblower it would be thick enough that that wouldn't be a problem). The same principle of lowering air pressure was what the mythbusters used to crush a train car, and I tried the experiment out with a juice carton and my freezer a month ago).\n\nOur first goal (creating lightbulbs) is complete, although the second part about lighting streets with them would take at least twenty years of industrialization to have a chance of happening (with the prerequisite requirement of \"having generators to power streetlights or a city readily available\"). The good news, however, is that we can show the king this and have a chance at gaining really large amounts of funding in the name of science. Hopefully we can both with together with the church and avoid cries of \"witchcraft\", and we'll be able to get the king his weaponry we promised him*.\n\nSo, gunpowder. Idk if it was developed around where we're appearing, because I hope now. \n\nThe three ingredients I can remember in gunpowder are:\n\n- Sulfur. Easy enough to find, just pay people to bring me yellow rocks that smell like rotten eggs.\n\n- Charcoal. Probably cheap and easy as fuck to get at this time period. If for some reason I can't get it, I watch Primitive Technology so I can make it, no problem.\n\n- Saltpetre or potassium nitrate (I think that's the specific name, maybe it isn't). Get it from an apothecary of some sort OR get it from the king's pigeon roost thing or from some other bird keeper/farmer. Because I've heard it's in urea, the white stuff in bird crap. If not, I can try other parts of the bird crap or all of said crap. And if THAT doesn't work AND I can't get it from an apothecary or other shop in town, I'm fucked.\n\nAN alternative to guns would be to use my knowledge to prevent disease or something. The plague was big in Europe in the time period, and doctors had barbaric medicine practices with little success for their patients. Assuming that there are always sick people in a society that has no access to proper medicine, there are no end of test subjects once people know that I'm either from the future (if I make this public information) or a knowledgeable scholar of some sort- as long as I say I know how to help heal people. \n\nSo finding the right method of applying penicillin, the right method of concentrating it, and the right variety to use will all be found in due time. Telling everyone to start washing themselves will help almost more, once (as I said) everyone knows I'm a smartypants important dude (or a great healer of some kind, if this is after I'm done creating antibiotics).\n\n Don't get me even started on the printing press. Or even creating print blocks to copy words, as opposed to how bibles were copied *by hand* for literally hundreds of years in the European middle ages. Reading would no longer be an occupation of itself within a hundred years at most.\n\nI'm going to sleep after writing this comment now, but I have no doubt that I could improve the quality of life and jump industrial progress (where I landed) ahead by decades to centuries, depending on three things- whether or now I'm accepted as a legitimate scientist or time traveller by the local ruler (constituting funding from *someone* as well), whether or not local religious/community leaders denounce me as a witch or no-good, and at what time period I touch down (I would help much more in 11-1300's England than 1600's England, for example. But I couldn't help much in Berlin in the 1930's).\n\n**Edits**: I said the application part in my penicillin guide because I heard that it works in injections but previously thought that it was activated by consumption somehow.
