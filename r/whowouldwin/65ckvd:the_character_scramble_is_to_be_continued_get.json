At the beginning, everyone submits characters that meet the guidelines, then those characters are randomized and distributed evenly.

We\u2019ve just finished mopping up all the blood and guts of ScrambleWorld (MadScramble?) and finished painting colors onto all the black-and-white stuff, so now we can get on with Scramble 8! This is partially a hype post and partially a discussion of some of the things I\u2019d like to do in the next season. I want to keep what worked last time and ditch what I don\u2019t think worked this time, and there are going to be some changes next season, so I want to run them all by you first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme and Tier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Scramble has gone everywhere in the world. Your characters have competed in the Dark Tournament, been transported inside of a Super Smash Bros game, raced across America in the world\u2019s first cross-country horse race, worked together to pass the Hunter Exam, fought each other in the world of Pokemon, broke folding chairs over people\u2019s heads in royal rumbles, and slaughtered in the ruined cities of DeathWatch. But now, your characters will be facing off against the greatest threat they\u2019ve ever seen\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jail time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surprise! I hope y\u2019all are ready for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCX3TaiHqeY\"&gt;Scramble Ocean&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those not in the know, Stone Ocean is Part 6 of the acclaimed long-running manga known as Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to read or watch it to understand what\u2019s going on. Just know that it takes place in and around the cells of Green Dolphin Street Prison in Florida. The main character must battle against criminals with strange powers to escape from her \u2018stone ocean\u2019 and defeat an evil legacy that has been passed down through her family since the 19th century. For all intents and purposes, this is a prison break scramble. Have fun, Sorsby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to read Stone Ocean, you can find it in brilliant color &lt;a href=\"http://bato.to/reader#4c46f50e49e607d0\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (you have to make an account though). Although since this is Part 6 of a long-running manga series, I\u2019d recommend starting at the beginning (you don\u2019t have to, but you probably should). The anime begins &lt;a href=\"http://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and goes up to Part 4, and Part 5 is\u2026 skippable\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now for the tier, and I think we should go with something similar to what we had the last time we did a Jojo scramble: &lt;strong&gt;Being able to beat &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/3in3xe/respect_captain_america_earth_616/\"&gt;Captain America&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/3m63vw/respect_batman_bruce_wayne_pcn52/\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; 2/10 to 8/10&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now, onto the roles. I can hear the gears turning in your mind now, thinking about how you\u2019re going to cram whatever characters you like into these roles. Well, don\u2019t worry about it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no roles this time around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s right. You will submit four combatants. No managers or sponsors. No \u2018punch character, magic character, tech character, smart character\u2019 whatever. Pick whoever you want! Go nuts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for a few rules:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character &lt;strong&gt;must be researchable&lt;/strong&gt;. Either the character must have a respect thread (go check out &lt;a href=\"/r/respectthreads\"&gt;/r/respectthreads&lt;/a&gt; to see if they have one on here, but a good Comicvine RT or some other repository of feats is also acceptable), a CotW/Featured Character post, a spot in a TotM/Featured Team post, or a \u201cmini-RT\u201d in the comments of the post with at least 5 \u201cfeats\u201d in it. There were instances in the past where characters from unusually long series were submitted without any respect threads, forcing anyone who fought the character to slog through 100+ episodes just to see how strong the guy actually was. Don\u2019t do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character must be in-tier: 2/10 to 8/10 Batman or Captain America. Everybody knows Batman and Cap, so you might &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you know exactly what they\u2019re capable of, but you don\u2019t. No shame in that! If you don\u2019t know whether your character is a decent fight for Batman or Captain America, whip up a thread right here on &lt;a href=\"/r/whowouldwin\"&gt;/r/whowouldwin&lt;/a&gt; to ask!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No characters that are overly offensive or from porn, please. We\u2019ve had problems with this in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to the rules, here are a few suggestions to help you out. Credit to &lt;a href=\"/u/doctorgecko\"&gt;/u/doctorgecko&lt;/a&gt; for most of these:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would advise against choosing characters that cannot communicate with their team in some way, or character who are non-sentient. There is no rule against them, but due to the setting it may make things more difficult for the person who gets the character. Don\u2019t worry about it too much, though. Pick characters you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following off of the first suggestion, pick characters you LIKE. If you\u2019re picking a character just because you need to fill a slot, or because it\u2019d be oh-so-hilarious to get your favorite meme into scramble, just ask someone else if they have an extra character they\u2019d like you to submit for them, or take one of the backups. Scramble is supposed to be fun, don\u2019t make it an obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time playing, take a look at the kind of submissions other people are making. Plus, if someone submits, let\u2019s say Daredevil, this will help you not submit another Daredevil. Scramble used to be plagued by hordes of Spider-men, Ben Tennysons, and General Grievouses (three Spider-men ended up on the same team once!). Nothing wrong with any of those characters, but make sure you aren\u2019t submitting a character someone else already submitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know that you won\u2019t please everyone. I don\u2019t like Pokemon, but there are plenty of people out there who love Pokemon, for example. Don\u2019t worry about whether people don\u2019t like the character or the series, worry about whether the character is in-tier. Also, don\u2019t argue against a character being submitted because \u201cI hate [series the character is from]!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modifications. Sometimes, you have to edit a character a bit. Maybe they\u2019d be perfect for the tier if not for one or two feats, or maybe their power only works on people who have red hair or something and you\u2019d like it to work on everybody regardless of coiffure - that\u2019s perfectly normal. Just don\u2019t alter a character &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much, or it really won\u2019t be the same character anymore. This is hard to quantify, so just listen to what other people have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the final suggestion - &lt;strong&gt;listen to what other people have to say&lt;/strong&gt;. The people here want to help you out and create the maximum amount of fun for both you and the other players. If they have questions or concerns about characters you submitted, try not to feel attacked or offended - they\u2019re just trying to help you. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to blindly agree with people, feel free to argue their points - it\u2019s the point of the sub, after all! - but just keep your ears open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Works, What Didn\u2019t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, time to talk about what we\u2019re planning on keeping and what we\u2019re planning on editing this next scramble:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Liked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign-up Stories:&lt;/strong&gt; I like these. These are going to stay, just to make sure that people can put in the effort. We will also be keeping the non-writing prompts too, because they can be just as informative as the stories. We will be making a slight alteration, though - one of each player\u2019s submissions must be written as a story, not a non-writing prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tribunal&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh wow, &lt;a href=\"/u/kaioshin_\"&gt;/u/kaioshin_&lt;/a&gt;, you were fantastic last Tribunal. I want to thank everybody who contributed last season, but Kaio especially, because he put in so much effort. We want to keep this Tribunal just as good as it was last time, if not better, so everybody make sure to check over each and every character and help see whether they\u2019re in tier or not!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things We Want To Change A Bit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsors/Managers&lt;/strong&gt;: They were an interesting experiment, and we\u2019d like to see them come back sometime later, but this season we won\u2019t be having them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Roll&lt;/strong&gt;: I like the slow roll of characters, but it was just too friggin slow. If we can\u2019t find a way to speed it up a bit, we\u2019ll just can the idea and give you all your characters right out the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complicated Prompts&lt;/strong&gt;: The mook team round last season was overly complex. The Royal Rumble round in season VI was torturous. These are great to read, but are hard on the writers. We\u2019ll try to make the new rounds fun, but with less stuff going on in the background - the focus is on the two battling teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loser\u2019s Bracket&lt;/strong&gt;: We\u2019re bringing it back! Just kidding, that\u2019s never coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck everybody! Keep looking up at the stars!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNK5-tZ_OgA\"&gt;And that\u2019s why you can\u2019t hold me down.
