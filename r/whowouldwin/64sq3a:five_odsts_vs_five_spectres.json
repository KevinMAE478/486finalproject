If they were dominating in ground warfare, then coming up with a big supersoldier seems kind of like it&amp;#39;s aiming at the wrong spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure Spartans were going to be a thing because of the rise of Insurrectionists. Once they were ready, they&amp;#39;d use their &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; as a plan B to tell the colonies that ONI has super soldiers, stop shooting each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just seemed like the perfect tool to use against the Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spectres... certainly seem tougher (than Elites).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddy. Sangheili are naturally on-par with Spartans. They&amp;#39;re naturally on-par with the bio-augmented, power-armoured superhumans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Spectres are canonically built to compete with Pilots, they have the ratings to puncture through body armor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re talking durability? Alright then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/u1vwn0BbyqU?t=37m19s\"&gt;In Halo 3 ODST, Romeo is dealt enough concussive damage to send him flying into a pillar, and a nasty slash from the bladed backside of a slab of metal swung by an intelligent warchief of a gorilla.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 ODSTs are also able to take down said warchief gorilla by themselves, in melee combat. It&amp;#39;s a lot harder to hit things that are smaller than you. You&amp;#39;ve heard of Shadow of the Colossus, right? Titans aren&amp;#39;t even able to reach a single pilot doing a rodeo attack before they get their shit promptly wrecked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the brute&amp;#39;s size and strength is a lot closer to the ODSTs combined than a Titan&amp;#39;s, he was kept immobilized long enough by them to get his throat slit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/u1vwn0BbyqU?t=39m25s\"&gt;Romeo survives for 1-2 hours until needing medical assistance from a punctured lung. In a matter of minutes at most, he&amp;#39;s ready to fight again.&lt;/a&gt; Flesh isn&amp;#39;t a weakness for them. They have the physical conditioning and body armour to shrug off bullets, and survive being chopped by a huge blade on a massive hammer. They have the medical technology to get right back on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The ratings to puncture through body armour.&amp;quot; ...what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you mean the guns, then hell yeah, an assault rifle can circumvent body armour. But ODST armour is good enough to make that assault rifle circumvent it a lot less. It&amp;#39;s not like Titanfall assault rifles are all bolters now. They&amp;#39;re still the same rifles we humans can use, just with better design and ergonomics. The average person gets knocked flat on their ass when they fire a .50 cal, so there&amp;#39;s no way in hell that the ones they have in Titanfall are anywhere near that. The &amp;quot;ratings&amp;quot; for ODST armour make it so that the ODST&amp;#39;s ability to survive damage is based on their stamina and health - and they&amp;#39;ve got plenty of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you mean their targeting systems, well, not every gun is perfectly accurate. No matter how steady you hold your rifle, there is going to be some deviation because physics. And even then, biofoam saves lives easily. Romeo got sliced by a gravity hammer.

Starting with equipment.\n\nI would say, comparing the R101C and MA5D, it's a 6/10 for the R101C. The NATO 7.62 versus an 8.19 would have a slight hit advantage, as Titanfall actually still fields 7.62 and calls it a heavier bullet on the wiki. So I believe that the 8.19 probably has less powder behind it, which would make sense for CQC where velocity matters a little less than sheer impact strength. Where the R101C shines would be at mid and long range compared to the MA5D, as it is better at close to medium close range. MA5D makes up slightly for it's fire rate and mag size, but not enough to put it in favor.\n\nMastiff versus M90 however, I'm going to say 8/10 M90. The mastiff is a strong weapon, but with only 4 shots loaded, the M90 has a serious advantage when it comes to ability to sustain fire. In addition, the M90 is hitscan to the mastiff's projectile. ODST who have experienced combat with the covenant would more than likely be able to at least try and mitigate the damage by ducking out of the way. The M90 is also **8 GAUGE** which is enough lead to put down a MK2 spartan in one hit. They seem to have relatively close fire rates, so I believe this slots it firmly in the ODST favor when it comes to shotguns.\n\nNow for straight vitality. I'm going to say the spectres get it 6/10. They can take a pretty serious beating from titanfall weapons which speaks a lot about the durability of their construction. Why 6 instead of something higher? ODST can take some [pretty](https://youtu.be/U1d0EFmbb0A?t=200) [serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0nT3_WCcZo) [knocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGdhtDIVJzY) as well. And while romeo did get lucky with his rifle catching some of the force of the brute's hammer blade, it certainly isn't an insignificant hit, and the grav hammer slam a couple seconds before is a seriously dangerous attack that, while he narrowly avoided the kill radius of, would easily knocked a regular man square out.\n\nSo how about maneuverability? I'm going 5/10 for this. Spectre jumps and ODST jumps in game are relatively similar, with maybe a small disadvantage on ODST, but that would be negated by the setup time, leaving finally...\n\nTactics. 7/10 ODST. Spectres are excellent at sticking together and flanking, but don't seem to be very tactically adaptable. A lone spectre will press forward fighting even if its individual unit is no longer effective and it could regroup with other units instead. ODST on the other hand are practically kings of pulling random plans out of their asses and nailing it to enemies that have sheer number advantages. The ODST with their equipment would find somewhere defensible with choke points. This keeps whatever enemy they are facing at a disadvantage, and keeps them in a relatively cohesive unit that engages on their own terms.\n\nSo what do I think would happen? ODST would get a call warning of a slipspace drop missing UNSC IFF tags, and get a 5 minute warning, as well as the fact that the enemies are not regular humans (by your wording I think this means that the ship is ID'd as human construction, but contacts do not appear to be human, correct?). They have 5 minutes prep against an unknown enemy. They'll probably find a 2 story, set the MA5Ds on overwatch on upper floor windows and have the M90 at the door. Spectres get boots (or whatever you call their metal feet) on the ground and begin to sweep and clear, using a 5 meter spread column formation against a wall. Pretty standard formation for urban environments, and most definitely the formation they'd choose. R101Cs leading, mastiff on the rear. UNSC would be hiding in cover, and peeking as little as possible, so I imagine that they would get a very narrow drop on the spectres as they slow walk along the wall. UNSC open with concentrated fire first and get one of the spectres before they are almost immediately pinned to cover by the R101Cs, one of the spectres nailing an ODST who didn't duck in time. This is followed by profuse amounts of swearing and a bit of ineffective blind return fire. 4v4. Spectres break into staggered column and push up at a fast walk, with mastiff moving up front, with 2 R101Cs watching the windows. ODST warn each other that the contacts are dead accurate and can take a hit, so the M90 backs a bit from the doorway and one of the MA5Ds moves down into the stairway to cover another longer angle. the second floor team is now going to spread from the windows in case of grenades. This is where the fun begins. 2 R101C Spectres straight jump into the windows to engage the ODST, but they aren't where they initially expected them to be (these aren't the grunts from home, that's for sure). Both MA5Ds pop up from behind crates on opposite sides of the room which catches the spectres flat footed. Spectres kill one ODST and another takes a few hits before collapsing, and one of the spectres is toast from combined fire. The ODST that moved to the stairs flexes back and finishes off the spectre as it moves in and stomps on the gasping ODSTs chest. When the mastiff walks in on the M90 he catches him off guard as he was distracted by the sounds of fighting up stairs. The spectre gets off an early shot but the ODST hits the deck and throws lead downrange, shattering the spectre in 2 shots, but not catching the R101C when it comes quickly around the corner, and the M90 is killed from that mistake. Hearing what's going on downstairs, the ODST bursts back down and lays in a full auto burst at the Spectre before it can get it's weapon properly trained. Normally the spectre would have lived from a full mag of MA5D, but the trooper wasn't using the MA5D, he snagged an R101C off the ground after seeing it's strength.\n\nI'd put this 6/10 for ODST. With better flexibility, prep time, improved tactics and a willingness to use alien weaponry, I think the ODST pull through with a bit for margin of error. If they both dropped in and faced each other straight off, I'd probably say 6/10 for spectre, but prep time favors the ODST.", "edited": 1491981799.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is interesting, so I think I&amp;#39;ll break it down. Starting with equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say, comparing the R101C and MA5D, it&amp;#39;s a 6/10 for the R101C. The NATO 7.62 versus an 8.19 would have a slight hit advantage, as Titanfall actually still fields 7.62 and calls it a heavier bullet on the wiki. So I believe that the 8.19 probably has less powder behind it, which would make sense for CQC where velocity matters a little less than sheer impact strength. Where the R101C shines would be at mid and long range compared to the MA5D, as it is better at close to medium close range. MA5D makes up slightly for it&amp;#39;s fire rate and mag size, but not enough to put it in favor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mastiff versus M90 however, I&amp;#39;m going to say 8/10 M90. The mastiff is a strong weapon, but with only 4 shots loaded, the M90 has a serious advantage when it comes to ability to sustain fire. In addition, the M90 is hitscan to the mastiff&amp;#39;s projectile. ODST who have experienced combat with the covenant would more than likely be able to at least try and mitigate the damage by ducking out of the way. The M90 is also &lt;strong&gt;8 GAUGE&lt;/strong&gt; which is enough lead to put down a MK2 spartan in one hit. They seem to have relatively close fire rates, so I believe this slots it firmly in the ODST favor when it comes to shotguns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for straight vitality. I&amp;#39;m going to say the spectres get it 6/10. They can take a pretty serious beating from titanfall weapons which speaks a lot about the durability of their construction. Why 6 instead of something higher? ODST can take some &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/U1d0EFmbb0A?t=200\"&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0nT3_WCcZo\"&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGdhtDIVJzY\"&gt;knocks&lt;/a&gt; as well. And while romeo did get lucky with his rifle catching some of the force of the brute&amp;#39;s hammer blade, it certainly isn&amp;#39;t an insignificant hit, and the grav hammer slam a couple seconds before is a seriously dangerous attack that, while he narrowly avoided the kill radius of, would easily knocked a regular man square out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how about maneuverability? I&amp;#39;m going 5/10 for this. Spectre jumps and ODST jumps in game are relatively similar, with maybe a small disadvantage on ODST, but that would be negated by the setup time, leaving finally...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tactics. 7/10 ODST. Spectres are excellent at sticking together and flanking, but don&amp;#39;t seem to be very tactically adaptable. A lone spectre will press forward fighting even if its individual unit is no longer effective and it could regroup with other units instead. ODST on the other hand are practically kings of pulling random plans out of their asses and nailing it to enemies that have sheer number advantages. The ODST with their equipment would find somewhere defensible with choke points. This keeps whatever enemy they are facing at a disadvantage, and keeps them in a relatively cohesive unit that engages on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do I think would happen? ODST would get a call warning of a slipspace drop missing UNSC IFF tags, and get a 5 minute warning, as well as the fact that the enemies are not regular humans (by your wording I think this means that the ship is ID&amp;#39;d as human construction, but contacts do not appear to be human, correct?). They have 5 minutes prep against an unknown enemy. They&amp;#39;ll probably find a 2 story, set the MA5Ds on overwatch on upper floor windows and have the M90 at the door. Spectres get boots (or whatever you call their metal feet) on the ground and begin to sweep and clear, using a 5 meter spread column formation against a wall. Pretty standard formation for urban environments, and most definitely the formation they&amp;#39;d choose. R101Cs leading, mastiff on the rear. UNSC would be hiding in cover, and peeking as little as possible, so I imagine that they would get a very narrow drop on the spectres as they slow walk along the wall. UNSC open with concentrated fire first and get one of the spectres before they are almost immediately pinned to cover by the R101Cs, one of the spectres nailing an ODST who didn&amp;#39;t duck in time. This is followed by profuse amounts of swearing and a bit of ineffective blind return fire. 4v4. Spectres break into staggered column and push up at a fast walk, with mastiff moving up front, with 2 R101Cs watching the windows. ODST warn each other that the contacts are dead accurate and can take a hit, so the M90 backs a bit from the doorway and one of the MA5Ds moves down into the stairway to cover another longer angle. the second floor team is now going to spread from the windows in case of grenades. This is where the fun begins. 2 R101C Spectres straight jump into the windows to engage the ODST, but they aren&amp;#39;t where they initially expected them to be (these aren&amp;#39;t the grunts from home, that&amp;#39;s for sure).
