Even with memory wipe Batman would have by then found a way to drain Eminem&amp;#39;s odinforce. Then Eminem wiping his memory also adds to the depletion. Batman&amp;#39;s rhymes can be the most weakest. All he has to do is get Eminem to enter the Odinsleep once the date has been set to where Eminem sleeps through it.

Besides his dope rap and beat box skills on the mic Eminem's apparent omnipoetence is infact his downfall. In rap god Eminem says the following, \"So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent.\" Eminem reveals two truths that one he is omnipotent, and two the more important fact that he is in fact Odin. Him being Odin explains where he gets his omnipotence and powers of a rap god from. \"Well MegaAwesomeNerd who cares?,\" says the redditor or Lurker; to which I say Me, Batman, and so should you because this is where Eminem fucks up.

That transition there solidifies the comicbook Marvel version of Odin there since the transition from Krypton to Asgard would only make sense from an artistic stand point since both version would be of comicbook origin. However what makes this theory fact and definitive is the Walking Dead line which helps Thor and Odin get sandwiched between Zod and Walking Dead analogy all tied together seeing as all three of these materials he references are all of comicbook origin.

Also Eminem is cool enough to keep Batman's identity a secret until rap battle and Batman wants to keep it that way.) -&gt; Bruce and Eminem get fucked up together like kings -&gt; With Bruce and Eminem fucked up Batman throws down the date and time and venue (Batman being trained in a billion different things, maybe drunk but will keep his liquor down to do his fucking mission cause he's motherfucking batman. So the date Batman throws down will be the one he calculated to where Odinsleep will happen after Batman's or Eminem's first verse. Location being for time zone differences.) -&gt; Batman trains to come up with the most optimal dope verse and bars to drop during the week of prep time he has with the beats to come up with the longest non-suspicious verse -&gt; Rap battle happens (even if Eminem is aware Odinsleep draws near to back out after a date and time was set and agreed would give Batman the victory. So Eminem's like fuck it I'm going to go for it.) -&gt; Rap Battle starts Batman raps his verse (or if Eminem does doesn't matter all that'll change is Odin falling asleep during Batman's verse instead of before his own first verse.) -&gt; Batman does his verse Odin is asleep Batman wins, drops the mic!\n\nVersion two (Where Batman has only a week to find out about Eminem, learn the beats, and the date and time is already set)\n\nNo problem very similar plan. Batman this time during his prep time nudges Loki, Gotham villains, or others to attack Eminem. This does not break Rap Battle rules since 1.
