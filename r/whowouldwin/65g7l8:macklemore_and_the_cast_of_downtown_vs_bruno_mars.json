Also, top speed on a moped is likely slower than the top speed of a limo, given both are racing down a straight road. That said, mopeds won't have much weight on them but a crew of 6 or so people will be huddled into the stretch and weighing it down, causing it to possibly go slower. Close call, but for now I'll hand it to Macklemore. \n\nFor the next two parts I'll be judging more on Macklemore and Bruno than the rest of the crew, and I'll be looking at external shit aside from both videos, so assume that their crews are either really similar to their leaders or don't really affect the outcome at all. \n\nBruno takes the dance off, 100%. Have you seen that fucker dance? It's goddamn mesmerizing. Macklemore's got moves, sure, and you can look to the video of Dance Off for an example, but then look at Bruno's moves in Uptown Funk, 24K Magic, That's What I Like, etc etc. Blows Macklemore completely out of the water. Bruno takes it. \n\nDeathmatch is trickier to judge, but I'd maybe say Bruno takes that one too. Both guys seem similarly built aside from height, and being smaller therefore makes it easier for you to get on top of your opponent and fuck them up. With that in mind, Bruno is close to being a midget and is comparitively shorter than Macklemore. Bruno could climb all over the guy at his height. From that point onward though it really depends on who's got the strength to back up the agility, so who knows. In terms of weaponry, I doubt Macklemore could make any practical use of a moped in a fight, and I see very little in the way of props that Bruno could use, so it's safe to assume it'll remain a fist fight for the duration. Shame too, both have those funky suits on and they'll get all bloody from it. Drycleaners gonna charge extra for that. \n\nSo in conclusion, Uptown will almost certainly ~~fuck~~ funk you up.
