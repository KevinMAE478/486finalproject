If lets say Yamucha were to focus their energy into his punches Im sure he can destroy mountain ranges with just wind. either way I can&amp;#39;t take the character Saitama seriously because the whole point of it is that he can ko anyone with one punch. The show itself is new and refreshing but face it, its just the creator giving a likeable character unlimited plot armor without any explanation and when you compare the two, Dragon ball is an original masterpiece with more fleshed out characters and storylines.
