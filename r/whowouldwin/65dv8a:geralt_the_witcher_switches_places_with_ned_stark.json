He haggles and deals with spymasters, kings, and street gangs alike. He&amp;#39;s also very honest and loyal, even fighting a dragon to protect King Foltest (I know he had multiple motives to help Foltest but that was nearly a suicide mission). Robert is basically the Bloody Baron- Geralt can see past a person&amp;#39;s flaws and understand that they&amp;#39;re still good people at heart. He wouldn&amp;#39;t be thrilled to serve as Hand, but like Ned he would eventually accept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a capable investigator and will look into Jon Arryn&amp;#39;s death in the same way as Ned. He&amp;#39;ll probably figure out the details faster and go straight to Robert instead of confronting Cersei first. If Jaime tries to arrest him, Jaime&amp;#39;s toast, along with the men he brought with him. Assassins couldn&amp;#39;t really catch him unaware, arrow blocking reflexes aside, his meditation allows him to rest while fully alert, so no one could sneak up on him. Poison wouldn&amp;#39;t be effective- his healing potions alone are so toxic they kill humans. Unarmed, he would still win a fight against any human in Westeros.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Geralt ultimately  prevents the Lannister takeover of King&amp;#39;s Landing. After that, it&amp;#39;s hard to tell how the story would progress.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg9mv3b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492227609.0, "created_utc": 1492198809.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 260}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dv8a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dv8a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dv8a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahds9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MikeRat", "parent_id": "t1_dga1oip", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I added a grunt into the beginning of the monologue in my head", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I added a grunt into the beginning of the monologue in my head&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgahds9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492276540.0, "created_utc": 1492247740.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga1oip", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zold5", "parent_id": "t1_dg9o58z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I enjoyed reading this in Geralt voice.
