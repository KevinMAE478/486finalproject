The exact amount of armour would vary depending on how wealthy the knight was, but they&amp;#39;d most likely be in full maille. Weapons also varied, a knight would use whatever he wanted, though even if he didn&amp;#39;t use it, he&amp;#39;d carry a sword as it was a status symbol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the knights are mounted then I&amp;#39;d say 20 would be enough to rout a roman century. Heavy cavalry as seen in the middle ages wasn&amp;#39;t really much of a thing during the roman era, so horses of that size slamming straight into a formation like that is going to be a real shocker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dismounted, you&amp;#39;d probably need 30 or 40. The knights are far better equipped, but are also less well organised. An example is the French at Agincourt pushing and shoving eachother out of the way as they charged at the English.
