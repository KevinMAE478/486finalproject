So what I&amp;#39;m saying is that your Jets 1/10 should be somewhat given to the Saints if they end up with someone like &lt;a href=\"http://www.badassoftheweek.com/stmichael.html\"&gt;Saint Michael the Archangel&lt;/a&gt; for the curbstomp they&amp;#39;re about to perform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg8j9zu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160989.0, "created_utc": 1492132189.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7tf3i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BearGryllsGrillsBear", "parent_id": "t3_656ee7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Teams: Bills, Dolphins, Patriots, Jets, Ravens, Bengals, Browns, Steelers, Texans, Colts, Jaguars, Titans, Broncos, Chiefs, Chargers, Raiders, Cowboys, Giants, Eagles, Redskins, Bears, Lions, Packers, Vikings, Falcons, Panthers, Saints, Buccaneers, Cardinals, Rams, 49ers, Seahawks.\n\nThe standouts here are the Giants, Jets, Titans, and Saints.
