So what is our requirements? Your entrant must be able to do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Beat &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/5nyw9e\"&gt;Roronoa Zoro&lt;/a&gt; from One Piece 3/10 times at minimum&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Beat &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/4bp4l6\"&gt;Monkey D. Luffy&lt;/a&gt; from One Piece 7/10 times at maximum&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and finally&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Speed is Equalized&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, if your character can beat a speed-equalized Zoro / Luffy, you&amp;#39;re probably good for this tourney. &lt;strong&gt;As long as your character fits somewhere between those two points you&amp;#39;re fine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for equalizing speed is because there&amp;#39;s simply too much range between characters around this level, as well as One Piece speed being a rather hot debate in and of itself. Basically, the argument of &amp;quot;X is too fast, they are completely untouchable and stomp&amp;quot; is boring, and it&amp;#39;s hard to gauge just how fast this tier is as is. As for what gets equalized, &lt;strong&gt;all characters get their travel and reaction speeds equalized to Mach 300, (around lightning timing), however all projectiles retain their speed.&lt;/strong&gt; If a character shoots lightning, that lightning keeps its speed. Never forget that Aim-dodging exists. &lt;strong&gt;Also, Speed-Boosts are disallowed, while debuffs are allowed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, if your character falls within that range, you can safely enter them. Additionally, you must &lt;strong&gt;choose 3&lt;/strong&gt; entrants, as this will be a team match. I &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend giving RTs or at least a few feats with your entrants&lt;/strong&gt;, both for your opponent&amp;#39;s sake as well as your own. Please pay attention to the order you submit them as well for reasons elaborated on later. &lt;strong&gt;Additionally, like Scramble, we will host a tribunal sometime after this post so that excessively strong or weak submissions can be replaced.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result, please keep a couple characters in mind in case your characters get booted, so that you can replace them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Matches&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do the matches go down? At the start of each batch of matches, I will &lt;strong&gt;randomly determine if a match is a team match or individual 1v1 matches&lt;/strong&gt; Something like &lt;a href=\"https://gfycat.com/QuarterlyGreedyAndeancat\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a result is heads: The match is a team match, with all three of your characters fighting all three of their characters simultaneously&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a result is tails: The match is individual 1v1s, with all three characters each individually fighting one character of the opponents team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1v1 rounds are why your submission order counts. The first character you submitted will fight their first, your second against their second, and your third against their third. However, Team Matches also have their nuances. For one thing &lt;strong&gt;All characters are fully in-character, no exception&lt;/strong&gt;. Turns out if you have a goody two shoes hero and an unrepentant serial killer on the same team they may not cooperate with each other. The only limit to their characters is that they won&amp;#39;t attack their own teammates, regardless of how badly they may want to. Your characters are spawned knowing the rough backstory, personality, and powers of their teammates, and that they have to fight the enemy team to win. They do not know the enemy team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what about other stipulations? Well here&amp;#39;s the following&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight is to KO or Death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All fights start in the &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/YafkBlI.png\"&gt;Corrida Colisseum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/K8Ati9b.png\"&gt;has full range of the island to fight on&lt;/a&gt;. The island is uninhabited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All debate will last for roughly 3 days. After this, the debate is closed and voting commences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Voting&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important part, how you win and progress to the next round.
