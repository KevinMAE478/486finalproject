Their durability and arsenal matches up pretty evenly, so they&amp;#39;d be beating the shit out of each other to accomplish anything but... as long as there are no weapons, Omnidroid could take advantage of an Iron Giant that wants nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does the Iron Giant have motivation? He doesn&amp;#39;t have artificial intelligence. He has feelings and goals. He follows dreams. If he has no reason to want to destroy the Omnidroid, and he doesn&amp;#39;t get triggered to destroy, why would he fight?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And lastly, the Omnidroid has the luxury of feeling nothing.
