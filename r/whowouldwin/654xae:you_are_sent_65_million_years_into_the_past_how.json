Complex organisms are also chaotic systems; which means that we have 62 million years for one human ancestor to have a different sperm fertilize a differnt egg, and boom-every single human conception ever will result in a genetically different person. The same would be true of all complex life eventually-- extremophiles would last longer than the others; but eventually something would give. \n\nNow that \"History 1\" and \"History 2\" have no human beings in common, lets examine actual world history--which is pretty dependent on which human beings are born into which circumstances. It just takes one or two prehistoric people being born with more or less sensitivity to illness and maybe Ugg the cro-magnon wins his fight with Boog the cro-magnon and now the ancestor of all modern mankind is living in a cave on the other side of a hill and possibly gets buried in a landslide.

Let&amp;#39;s pretend that we have some kind of filter that shows anywhere that something is different between &amp;quot;History 1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;History 2&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the speed of sound, &amp;quot;difference&amp;quot; would propogate through the Earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere. 16 hours in, the entire atmosphere would&amp;#39;ve been replaced. Weather systems are statistical and chaotic, meaning that there is no telling what weather events might happen in one year, much less 65 million. Every single major weather event in human history is now different, possibly even gone or replaced by something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that the atmosphere is different, we can examine wvery living thing on the surface of the earth. They all exchange oxygen somehow, which means those differences are in their cells. Complex organisms are also chaotic systems; which means that we have 62 million years for one human ancestor to have a different sperm fertilize a differnt egg, and boom-every single human conception ever will result in a genetically different person. The same would be true of all complex life eventually-- extremophiles would last longer than the others; but eventually something would give. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that &amp;quot;History 1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;History 2&amp;quot; have no human beings in common, lets examine actual world history--which is pretty dependent on which human beings are born into which circumstances. It just takes one or two prehistoric people being born with more or less sensitivity to illness and maybe Ugg the cro-magnon wins his fight with Boog the cro-magnon and now the ancestor of all modern mankind is living in a cave on the other side of a hill and possibly gets buried in a landslide.

You might end up somewhere you didn&amp;#39;t expect if you try to teleport with the current continents in mind you might end up somewhere completely different. I for one am deathly afraid of the open ocean, I can just imagine trying to teleport somewhere and ending up in the open ocean next to some large predator that drags me screaming a trail of bubbles into the depths.\nThat being said I&amp;#39;d bring a map of cretaceous earth, as much food as I could carry, a car, some farming tools, hardware and supplies, and a palentological encyclopedia and go about seeing how many plants and insects and other quickly breeding organisms I could selectively breed into new species or as far as I could get with that. Then set the animals loose/scatter the plant seeds at the end of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg8tjjv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492177150.0, "created_utc": 1492148350.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654xae", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8tm6p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tag_ross", "parent_id": "t3_654xae", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My cousin works in a morgue so I could feasibley have access to dead bodies, all I would need is about a dozen dead bodies.\n\nI'd drop them off in a mosquito infested area that's close to a large group of proto humans.\n\nEither our super advanced diseases will wipe out the proto humans, wipe out the mosquitos, or the proto humans will be able to adapt to these diseases and change the future of humanity with the antibodies required to survive (perhaps even evolving over time into something completely different to humans as we know them today)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cousin works in a morgue so I could feasibley have access to dead bodies, all I would need is about a dozen dead bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d drop them off in a mosquito infested area that&amp;#39;s close to a large group of proto humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either our super advanced diseases will wipe out the proto humans, wipe out the mosquitos, or the proto humans will be able to adapt to these diseases and change the future of humanity with the antibodies required to survive (perhaps even evolving over time into something completely different to humans as we know them today)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg8tm6p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492177305.0, "created_utc": 1492148505.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654xae", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8urs6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jukeofalltrades", "parent_id": "t3_654xae", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would bring back a time capsule an put in all kinds of important stuff in it, like a history textbook for example, so that no matter who found it, they would gain incredible knowledge about the future.\n\nSo *I* wouldn't necessarily mess up the future, but someone else would.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would bring back a time capsule an put in all kinds of important stuff in it, like a history textbook for example, so that no matter who found it, they would gain incredible knowledge about the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily mess up the future, but someone else would.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg8urs6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492179909.0, "created_utc": 1492151109.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654xae", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91pus", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Freevoulous", "parent_id": "t3_654xae", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "plant weed everywhere.\n\nBlaze it with the dinos 'till the asteroid comes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;plant weed everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blaze it with the dinos &amp;#39;till the asteroid comes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg91pus", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492200143.0, "created_utc": 1492171343.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
