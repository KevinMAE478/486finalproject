His wife was one of the stronger members of Raizen&amp;#39;s nine friends but barely beat Yomi and only did so because Yusuke managed to wear Yomi out in the previous match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other big fish at the tournament Mukuro has her power tied to how much hate and anger she feels and lost half her power when she fought Hiei. She did have a brief flair up when she had a birthday she didn&amp;#39;t like coming up but then dropped off even further after Hiei got her the perfect gift. So she&amp;#39;s out of the running for a spot in a top less than ten EoS powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EoS Yusuke returned to Human World early because he is certain that if he fought Yomi again he could win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not too absurd to say that nine is less than ten or that EoS Yusuke is stronger than more than one of Raizen&amp;#39;s friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course zero is less than ten as well and it&amp;#39;s completely possible that Yusuke&amp;#39;s overestimating himself. Meaning even if there were the maximum of nine casual planet busters he wouldn&amp;#39;t make a top ten list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also there is indication of him being anywhere near planet level even before the Lower S to Upper S transition. Genkai telling him he can accidentally ruin the planet if he neglected controlling his powers as easily as neglect ruins a child&amp;#39;s toy or a lovers quarrel could ruin a relationship and by the same token nobody could stop him if he intentionally wanted to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgbk3ct", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338857.0, "created_utc": 1492310057.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbd5pz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iamwussupwussup", "parent_id": "t1_dgb5tos", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;If you take WoG into account Yusuke is bordering on vaporizing the planet by flexing.\n\nNo he's not, you're massively overselling the universe as a whole if you believe so.
