If I have some lore-inconsistencies forgive me. I do know a LOT about Marvel.\n\nHonestly, the Marvel guys have some ridiculous feats, this is a stomp in most rounds.\n\nWidowmaker, Hanzo, and Tracer are the only ones who stand a chance, and of those only Widowmaker and Tracer I think win more than lose. \n\nWidowmaker 8/10 - Snipes Natasha before Natasha knows she's there. Black Widow is REALLY good at what she does, but she's not superhuman and primarily CQC or midrange guns. Widowmaker's ability to see through walls is a huge advantage not countered by anything in Natasha's standard kit.\n\nHanzo-Hawkeye 5/10 - If Hanzo gets the jump on Hawkeye, or can hit him with a dragon arrow through walls, he wins. But Hawkeye can also do well if he gets the jump on Hanzo, and he has much more variety with trick arrows. The sheer power of the Twin Dragon arrow is what keeps Hanzo in the running here.\n\nPunisher 8/10 - Assuming incap is a win, Punisher has little trouble. He's dealt with way tougher shit before with just his standard kit. Caveat: if a kill is required, Reaper can't lose, at least not in lore.\n\nDeadpool 10/10 - Genji simply cant conquer the healing factor. this would definitely be a fun one to watch.\n\nCaptain America 8/10 - Shield is too good. 76 has to hit Cap around the Shield before Cap can get to him, and Cap is ridiculously fast. 76 stands no chance at close range.  Only reason this isn't 10/10 is because 76 is actually good at those lucky shots he needs.\n \nBullseye 10/10 - \"It's high..\" BLAM dead. McCree has good aim, but Bullseye's is the best. McCree takes too long to line up his shots whereas Bullseye doesn't need to, he's just that good.\n\nTracer 9/10 - Time Manipulation, even as limited as hers is, is a pretty OP power. She's also set up against the hero who is most easy to fool with her power. DD's Radar sense is really good, but unless he has a ton of prior knowledge Tracer zipping back and forth is gonna be too much for him to track eventually.  His only range is a thrown Billy Club. Tracer should have very little trouble dodging that and staying out of melee range.\n\nForge 7/10 - Anything Torb can build Forge can build better. All he has to do is see one of Torb's turrets and he knows how to disable it and how to make one that's more efficient or better. Torb's best chance is to rush Forge and just shoot him, which is the only reason he gets 3/10, but that would be super OoC.\n\nBeast 9/10 - Winston was heavily inspired by the trope Beast inhabits, but while Winston's gear is impressive, Beast's ridiculous feats win him the day more often than not.\n\nVison 11/10 - Vision could take on the entire Overwatch roster without breaking a theoretical sweat. He's one of the most dangerous Avengers for good reason.\n\nArchangel 10/10 - Mercy might stand a chance against standard Angel, but Archangel was made to be a Horseman of Death, and much like Vision could probably solo the Overwatch roster. High durability, some regen, ridiculous speed, and incredibly potent wing blades make him a force to be reckoned with.\n\nReinhardt 7/10 - You know, I didn't mention this up top but it's actually a solid win for Reinhardt. The MK1 Armor is gonna have trouble getting through his Shield and won't hold up to that hammer. The lack of truly controlled flight is also going to be a hindrance, though the flamethrower might actually be able to score him a few wins if he breaks it out early enough. MK1 is impressive for a suit built \"in a cave, with scraps,\" but it doesn't hold up to an engine of war like Reinhardt.\n\nIceman 10/10 - Mei literally just gives Bobby ammo. She can't do anyhting to him. She, however, doesn't share his immunity.\n\nWar Machine 10/10 - You know how slow Pharah's rockets are compared to what an Iron Man suit can do? Rhodey may not be as quick as the true Shellhead but he's fast enough, and has the firepower to take Pharah out fast. \n\nKlaw 10/10 - Klaw is made out of sound, and isn't disrupted by other sounds unless they're really intense. Honestly, Klaw's only real limitation is his lack of vision, he should be a high level threat in the Marvel universe but he limits himself to a silly sound gun and only fights people who use his singular weakness - vibranium.
