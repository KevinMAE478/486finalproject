Your laundry list is meaningless without links.\n\n- I'm well aware of China's modernization, but in the end, the troops coming on shore on Taiwan will not have benefited much from it. The vast majority of them will be light infantry. \n\n- If you think China can drop 462 main battle tanks amphibiously, then cite a source. The Chinese have about 4 type 71 amphibious assault ships, each of which can carry 4 hovercraft, and each hovercraft can carry ONE tank. That is a total of 4 tanks per ship. The tanks aren't even Type 99s because the 99s are too heavy. So that's 16 total tanks. They have 4 Zubrs that can carry 3 tanks each. That's another 12. So that is 28 total. They also have some LSTs, but these will be extraordinarily vulnerable. Where are you getting 462? The DoD report 2009 says that China can only sealift one infantry division. [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=GiMDs3NdgwoC)\n\n- Yeah, China doesn't have the ability to see everything in Taiwan at all times, so no, they aren't going to see the bunkers being built.\n\n- Artillery would be dug in individually and spaced so that a missile/bomb hit would only kill 1 of them. They wouldn't be stupidly bunched together. The DF-11A MAY have cep as low as 30m assuming everything in favor of China, but we don't know that, and it is highly doubtful. Even then, a cep of 30m isn't good enough. Let's say the warhead kill radius on dug in artillery is 10m. Let's say the aimpoint is perfect. That means only the inner 33% of the CEP zone is lethal. This is an area of 78.54m2 out of a total CEP area at 30m of 706.86m2. You can see that only about 11% of the CEP radius is lethal. The CEP is only 50% of hits. 50% of 11% is 5.5%. So you will need about 18-19 DF-11A to take out ONE artillery piece. Good luck with that!\n\n- The SAMs can cover the whole island pretty easily except for ballistic missile defense, which would only be needed for things like airfields.\n\n- Taiwan has a lot of smaller SAMs like Chaparrals and Antelopes firing sidewinders, and tons of stingers and stinger platforms.\n\n- Stop talking about 50x50 meter bunkers. That is a stupid and expensive design in this context. It is much cheaper and more effective to spread dug-in artillery out over a wider area to make missile/bomb near misses ineffective. Densely packed bunkers require a lot of reinforced concrete, and even then they present an obvious target.\n\n- The Chinese navy is not strong enough to control the waters east of Taiwan. Putting naval ships there other than submarines would only get them killed at a time when China needs to be focused 100% on controlling the Strait in order to protect its transports and supply ships.\n\n- Killing hardened targets requires specialized weapons and training that China hasn't demonstrated particular capability in. Even the famous Stukas in WW2 using highly accurate dive bombing, failed to destroy bunkers from the air the vast majority of the time. \n\n- If China can lock down Taiwan's airfields and airpower SO COMPLETELY as you claim, then the only logical thing to do would be to hide their aircraft and move all the critical infrastructure away. That way China gets to waste hundreds of expensive ballistic missiles hitting nothing. Then, after Taiwan survives the first week and China has wasted all or most of its missiles, Taiwan can restore its airpower and kill the weakened Chinese.\n\n- China's carrier would be a giant target, and it would be dead if it came anywhere near Taiwan. It doesn't matter if Taiwan gets 6+ fighters shot down in the attack, the loss of the Carrier would be a tremendous blow to Chinese morale and a boost for Taiwan. Taiwan has lots of effective anti-shipping missiles, far beyond what Argentina had, and yet Argentina still took out a UK carrier.\n\n- The SAMs know they will be priority targets. They are not going to sit there and wait to die. They are going to have a plan for how to survive the first week where they expect to get targeted dozens of times. Even Iraqi SAMs managed to survive US attacks plenty of times, and China isn't on America's level.\n\n- As I said before, if China can actually disable Taiwan's airbases so easily, then you move the aircraft and hide them, maybe throw some dummies in their place, and then let China waste all its most expensive, valuable weapon, blowing craters in dirt. China gets to keep the Taiwanese air force out of play for a little while, but only by paying a high price that it won't be able to duplicate when the Taiwan starts putting its fighters in the air 1-2 weeks later.\n\n- I did not say SAM batteries go in those bunkers. You assumed that, and it was silly. Taiwan has a lot of shorter range AA that could be deployed in the area, not necessarily INSIDE a bunker.\n\n- the S-400's 40N6 missile is \"laughably easy to jam\" because it can be thrown off its target at any point during a very very long flight over Taiwan, and it would be detected long before it got anywhere near a fighter. The guidance on board the missile is not going to be anything special for size and cost reasons, so even simple things like chaff will still work on it. Very long range missiles have never been effective at killing sophisticated targets (as opposed to dumb Iraqis running away in old soviet aircraft) and they still aren't.\n\n- Russia's air forces are superior to China's, and yet Georgia made a good showing against them and shot several aircraft down. China would fare a lot worse. Taiwan will be able to knock down dozens of Chinese aircraft in the first week alone, and that number will get a lot higher if the Chinese are aggressive and try to support the ground troops.\n\n- Yeah the US obviously doesn't know how active radar missiles work... it's not like we had the best one, the AIM-120, since more than 25 years ago. The problem with them is that the radar in the missile is not going to be large enough or expensive enough to see through countermeasures, so shooting them at long distances makes kills extremely unlikely. \"A 2011 RAND report noted that enemies successfully engaged beyond visible range after 1991 'were fleeing, non-maneuvering, and did not employ countermeasures.'\" BVR kills rates against aircraft are abysmal. The S-400 is not some magic unicorn that is going to change all that. Russia always says its systems are amazing, but they never live up to the hype.\n\n- Taiwan's aircraft and ships would KILL the PLAN ships operating in the east without question. The vast majority of China's power would be concentrated in the Strait. This would push Taiwan's forces east for safety. Whatever small fraction of Naval forces China might move east would be easy pickings for Harpoons and Hsiung Feng IIIs. \n\n- If China puts its air bases that far forward, they can absolutely be hit by missiles from Taiwan and shut down just as easily as you are claiming China can do to Taiwan. Any disruption would make it much harder for China to saturate Taiwan's air defenses.\n\n- The Chinese air force is not going to be able to break up Taiwan's ground forces. Any Chinese aircraft that try it, will get sidewinders and stingers shot at them constantly. Even the United States has stopped considering close air support to be viable. Air defenses are too cheap and too strong, and nothing can be done to make aircraft survivable enough to face them. US doctrine has been to fly super high and use PGMs. China doesn't follow that doctrine.", "edited": 1492131472.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I said cite some, I meant links to actual analysis, not some bullshit laundry list of names of people who you give no credentials for and no analysis from.

Putting naval ships there other than submarines would only get them killed at a time when China needs to be focused 100% on controlling the Strait in order to protect its transports and supply ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Killing hardened targets requires specialized weapons and training that China hasn&amp;#39;t demonstrated particular capability in. Even the famous Stukas in WW2 using highly accurate dive bombing, failed to destroy bunkers from the air the vast majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If China can lock down Taiwan&amp;#39;s airfields and airpower SO COMPLETELY as you claim, then the only logical thing to do would be to hide their aircraft and move all the critical infrastructure away. That way China gets to waste hundreds of expensive ballistic missiles hitting nothing. Then, after Taiwan survives the first week and China has wasted all or most of its missiles, Taiwan can restore its airpower and kill the weakened Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;China&amp;#39;s carrier would be a giant target, and it would be dead if it came anywhere near Taiwan. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if Taiwan gets 6+ fighters shot down in the attack, the loss of the Carrier would be a tremendous blow to Chinese morale and a boost for Taiwan. Taiwan has lots of effective anti-shipping missiles, far beyond what Argentina had, and yet Argentina still took out a UK carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAMs know they will be priority targets. They are not going to sit there and wait to die. They are going to have a plan for how to survive the first week where they expect to get targeted dozens of times. Even Iraqi SAMs managed to survive US attacks plenty of times, and China isn&amp;#39;t on America&amp;#39;s level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, if China can actually disable Taiwan&amp;#39;s airbases so easily, then you move the aircraft and hide them, maybe throw some dummies in their place, and then let China waste all its most expensive, valuable weapon, blowing craters in dirt. China gets to keep the Taiwanese air force out of play for a little while, but only by paying a high price that it won&amp;#39;t be able to duplicate when the Taiwan starts putting its fighters in the air 1-2 weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not say SAM batteries go in those bunkers. You assumed that, and it was silly. Taiwan has a lot of shorter range AA that could be deployed in the area, not necessarily INSIDE a bunker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the S-400&amp;#39;s 40N6 missile is &amp;quot;laughably easy to jam&amp;quot; because it can be thrown off its target at any point during a very very long flight over Taiwan, and it would be detected long before it got anywhere near a fighter. The guidance on board the missile is not going to be anything special for size and cost reasons, so even simple things like chaff will still work on it. Very long range missiles have never been effective at killing sophisticated targets (as opposed to dumb Iraqis running away in old soviet aircraft) and they still aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#39;s air forces are superior to China&amp;#39;s, and yet Georgia made a good showing against them and shot several aircraft down. China would fare a lot worse. Taiwan will be able to knock down dozens of Chinese aircraft in the first week alone, and that number will get a lot higher if the Chinese are aggressive and try to support the ground troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah the US obviously doesn&amp;#39;t know how active radar missiles work... it&amp;#39;s not like we had the best one, the AIM-120, since more than 25 years ago. The problem with them is that the radar in the missile is not going to be large enough or expensive enough to see through countermeasures, so shooting them at long distances makes kills extremely unlikely. &amp;quot;A 2011 RAND report noted that enemies successfully engaged beyond visible range after 1991 &amp;#39;were fleeing, non-maneuvering, and did not employ countermeasures.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; BVR kills rates against aircraft are abysmal. The S-400 is not some magic unicorn that is going to change all that. Russia always says its systems are amazing, but they never live up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;#39;s aircraft and ships would KILL the PLAN ships operating in the east without question. The vast majority of China&amp;#39;s power would be concentrated in the Strait. This would push Taiwan&amp;#39;s forces east for safety. Whatever small fraction of Naval forces China might move east would be easy pickings for Harpoons and Hsiung Feng IIIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If China puts its air bases that far forward, they can absolutely be hit by missiles from Taiwan and shut down just as easily as you are claiming China can do to Taiwan. Any disruption would make it much harder for China to saturate Taiwan&amp;#39;s air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese air force is not going to be able to break up Taiwan&amp;#39;s ground forces. Any Chinese aircraft that try it, will get sidewinders and stingers shot at them constantly. Even the United States has stopped considering close air support to be viable. Air defenses are too cheap and too strong, and nothing can be done to make aircraft survivable enough to face them. US doctrine has been to fly super high and use PGMs. China doesn&amp;#39;t follow that doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg85em5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143251.0, "created_utc": 1492114451.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7vqle", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FULLCAPSLOCK", "parent_id": "t1_dg7gepp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\nPart 1\n\n\n&gt;Cite some. \n\nEric Fogg, Michael J Lostumbo, David R.

If the Chinese are absolute anal about being as accurate as possible they can always use the DF-15B with a circular error probability of 5 meters to hit the bunkers.\n\n&gt;aa shooting at them while they're trying it \n\nDo you understand Taiwan's strategic air defence capabilities? They have at best 4 Patriot PAC-3 and 6 Skybow batteries. Unless Taiwan is going to only have 10 coastal bunkers in total all with one battery of either PAC-3's or Skybow's protecting them, which would leave the rest of Taiwan completely defenseless against ballistic missile strikes, \"aa shooting at them while they're trying\" is not going to happen. Taiwan's Hawk batteries aren't capable of intercepting ballistic missiles, nor is there accuracy anywhere near close enough to even stop a small cruise missile salvo.\n\n&gt;for you to even mention ballistic missiles and cruise missiles as viable weapons against a bunker is laughable. \n\nBecause it isn't like the US recently used Tomahawk missiles to penetrate hardened aircraft shelters at a certain Syrian airbase, nor did they ever in the past during the First Gulf War, Operation Allied Force or in the Iraq War, right?\n\n&gt;First of all, Taiwan has plenty of non-towed artillery and AA that would be mobile. \n\nI would hardly call 4 PAC-3 batteries and 6 Skybow batteries \"plenty\" of mobile AA. Nor are they mobile in the first place as they are dependant on fixed radar and launcher installations.\n\n&gt;Second, China is not the United States, and has nowhere near the ability to project air power against hardened targets that the US does. \n\nNever realised that projecting power against \"hardened targets\" was a specific thing. I hope you are also aware of the fact that we are talking about a 180km distance between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan, \"projecting power\" when your target is 180km's away is hardly an effort that requires 10 Aircraft carriers and the world's largest Airforce.\n\n&gt;China is not capable of duplicating what the US pulled off against Iraq. \n\nWhich nobody said or seems to think, except you.\n\n&gt;Third, Taiwan is not a desert, and it would be far easier to camo hardened sites. \n\nYes these 50x50 meter bunkers which will be deployed on Taiwans western coast, full of open fields, which also requires a large amount of resources and labour to build will not be noticeable at all.\n\n&gt;The US couldn't even find Saddam's SCUD missiles, yet you assume that China can magically pinpoint every bunker in Taiwan? Nope.\n\nUse your common sense, what is the difference between a *scud launcher vehicle* and a *bunker*? One is mobile and the other is static, not too mention it's a *50+ meter long and wide* bunker would draw a lot of attention and require a lot of military resources. Comparing a *bunker* and a *mobile launcher* is stupid. How come the US had no problem locating Serbia's static S-200 batteries, or above ground complexes?\n\n&gt;Hide in that context doesn't mean being invisible. It means sitting in a place that would be very difficult to attack. \n\nWhat makes it hard to attack? What's stopping China bringing surface groups around to the east of Taiwan and forcing the loitering F-16's back to Taiwan where they'll be destroyed by the superior Chinese Airforce and S-400 batteries in range?\n\nAnother question - What is your plan when the F-16's run out of fuel loitering east of Taiwan and are forced to return to the Taiwan where they will be destroyed by the superior Chinese Airforce and Chinese SAM's in range? Or even if they are able to return to there airbase what are they going to do next? There airbases logistical buildings will be destroyed, meaning they cannot carry out anymore sorties or what's stopping the Chinese bombing the airfields after the F-16's have landed? There's way too many things that can go wrong or don't make sense.\n\n&gt;China's ability to project force east of Taiwan is going to be very limited.\n\nWhy would that be? They have an combat ready carrier with a complement of 24 aircraft, they have tanker aircraft capable of refuelling fighters flying from mainland china over Taiwan into east Taiwan or other Fighters could fly from airbases north of the conflict zone down to east Taiwan. \n\n&gt;You are insane if you think ballistic missiles can be used to target air defenses like that. They lack the precision to reliably hit STATIC air defenses. Conventional ballistic missiles are a pretty shitty, inefficient weapon, and the only reason that people bother with them at all, is that they can be used offensively when you can't control airspace.\n\nYou do realise how much area a Patriot or S-300 battery takes up right?

People have speculated that China was trying to make carrier killers, but it is still pure speculation, and the technical requirements to pull it off are beyond any demonstrated capability. Even the United States, with enormous defense spending, hasn't bothered to try to make ballistic missiles that can do what you claim. \n\nIs a ballistic missile with a 30 meter CEP hitting a SAM battery disabling it's acquisition radar which is mounted on a tall mast that hard to believe for you?\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cite some. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eric Fogg, Michael J Lostumbo, David R.

Historically, most of the time air bases have been hit, they have been repaired within hours.\n\nIf China were to use its ballistic missiles with a CEP of 5 meters it would take approximately 45 of them to disable Taiwan's 12 fighter airbase runways for a few hours. In those few hours China could use PGM's to destroy aircraft within hardened air shelters, ammunition and fuel depots and maintenance hangars, making the amount of time until the base can be reopened to fully support combat air operations in days or weeks assuming the Chinese don't continue to bomb it. As the majority of Taiwan's SAM batteries would have been destroyed in the opening strike due to your choice of deploying them as static targets protecting bunkers, it would look like the Taiwanese would end up worse then if they followed there own strategy.\n\n&gt;They can feel free to try to engage them with limited fuel, after running the gauntlet of ground-based air defenses first. \n\n&gt;Then after they fight it out, they have to fly back to China and let the air defenses shoot at them again. The Taiwanese fighters will be operating much closer to their bases than the Chinese fighters, and can use their fuel to maintain an altitude advantage.\n\nWhat gauntlet would this be? Did you not say you would deploy the SAM's with artillery batteries in bunkers along the western coast? Which would be destroyed by China in there first strike since they are sitting ducks. Would Chinese attack and multirole aircraft not also be carrying out SEAD operations against any remaining Taiwanese SAM's? \n\nI mean really none of this makes any sense, apparently according to you Taiwan has enough strategic SAM's to protect all its new coastal bunkers, have some in reserve for a \"surprise\" attack and have enough to ensure that its airbases aren't damaged to the point that these Taiwanese F-16's loitering east of Taiwan can't land, refuel and rearm.\n\n&gt;Good luck trying to hit targets at extreme range with expensive missiles that will be laughably easy to jam or decoy at some point during their very long journey,\n\nFirst of all explain to me how you came to the conclusion that the S-400's 40N6 missile is \"laughably easy to jam\" second of all can you tell me how Taiwan would \"jam\" or \"decoy\" the 40N6 missile when they do not operate any dedicated EW aircraft or have any such \"decoys\". \n\nWhy I'm curious about the first point is because the 40N6 has an active radar seeker, which would mean that an enemy aircraft would not know that a 40N6 had been fired at it until the missile went active, which is usually only in the last 20km's of the interception path. So can you explain to me how you are going to \"jam\" a missile with an active radar homing seeker when you were only aware of its existence when it is only 20km's away from your aircraft and is homing in on you at almost 5,000 meters per second, giving you less then 4 seconds to respond? If you meant that Taiwan would jam the 40N6's mid course updates, which I seriously doubt as it is quite clear you didn't put any thought into your argument there or had no knowledge of it in the first place, how would they be capable of jamming the mid course updates when they would be 300+ km's away from the S-400's engagement radar and how would they be capable of jamming an S-400, which is widely acknowledged as being extremely hard to jam, without a dedicated EW aircraft in the first place?\n\n&gt;or to simply dodge as agile fighters are trained to do, and have proven they can do when used by the US. \n\nSorry to disappoint you mate, the US hasn't faced any double digit SAM's in combat like the S-300/400. I don't think they've even faced any SAM's which used missiles with active radar homing seeker, at best hey were SARH.\n\n&gt;S-400s aren't going to be effective at all east of Taiwan.\n\nNo but I imagine Chinese navy vessels deployed to the east of Taiwan with HQQ9's and S-300F's will be, as they would be within the theoretical no-escape zone. Wouldn't the Chinese firing SAM's at the F-16's loitering east of Taiwan cause them to jettison part of there payload as American pilots did when the Serbians fired on them with there SA-6's, even though they weren't intending on hitting them? If they jettison there external fuel tanks they'll have to return to base a lot sooner, over Taiwan where China would have air superiority and could shoot them down.\n\n&gt;As for China putting naval vessels east of Taiwan: sure thing if it wants them sunk. Go ahead and put the enemy fortress between you and anyone who can help you. Taiwanese aircraft or even ground based missiles could destroy Chinese ships at will if they want to try to control the east. \n\nThe HF-2 anti-ship missile fired by Taiwan's coastal anti-ship missile batteries has a range of 160km's, so what you're suggesting is that the Chinese Navy will come within 160km's of Taiwan's coast to shoot down Taiwan's F-16's loitering east of Taiwan, which makes no sense at all. \n\n[Using this shitty diagram to explain it] (https://imgur.com/gallery/jOaDR). The Chinese Type 052D's HQQ9 has a range of 200km's, shown as the red half circle around Taiwan, which means a Chinese surface group, the two red arrows in the picture, could push the loitering F-16's, blue dots in the picture, back into Taiwan where they would be destroyed by the Chinese S-400 batteries on the mainland, the Chinese Airforces fighters and the Chinese navy's vessels anti-air weapons. The surface group would be protected by the Chinese Liaoning's fighter complement plus other Chinese fighters from the mainland, the Taiwanese wouldn't be able to challenge the surface group directly at sea due to there Navy being technologically inferior to go toe to toe with it and there Airforce being largely grounded and destroyed or committed to air combat against the numerically and technologically superior Chinese Air Force.\n\n&gt;You do realize that is not the relevant statistic, right? The relevant number is the distance from the Chinese airbase to the ocean east of Taiwan where the Taiwanese fighter is loitering. \n\n&gt;This is going to be more like 500km+ even if the fighter stays pretty close. \n\n&gt;You are forgetting to count the fact that Taiwan is over 100km wide and the Chinese arent flying off of beaches. \n\nWell actually they are basically flying off of beaches, China has 7 airbases directly on the Chinese mainlands coast near Taiwan.\n\n&gt;China has limited airbase capacity in range of Taiwan.\n\n7 Airbases which could support the entire PLA's combat aircraft is hardly \"limited\".\n\n&gt;Naval ships can't do shit except try to provide weak artillery support that is nothing next to what Taiwan would have on hand. \n\nOh I'm sure.\n\n&gt;If Taiwan is going to attack a beachhead with several divisions supported by hundreds of tanks and hundreds of artillery, plus a few dozen attack helicopters, the light forces China puts ashore are going to get smashed.\n\nSo what happens when the counter attacking force is unable to organise and is dispersed when they're bombed by the Chinese Airforce?\n\n&gt;China isn't going to be able to provide close air support effectively with the large number of stinger missiles and other short range AA platforms Taiwan has. \n\nIf you believe the Taiwanese can dodge S-400's missiles no problem what is stopping the Chinese \"to simply dodge as agile fighters are trained to do, and have proven they can do when used by the US.\" as you said? Using your logic wouldn't Chinese Fighters not have a better chance \"to simply dodge\" these missiles due to Eastern aircraft being more manoeuvrable in general compared to Western aircraft?\n\nOn a more serious note what is stopping them from destroying the Taiwanese from 20,000 feet with PGM's where the Taiwanese can't reach? ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who said they need to be exposed? Historically, most of the time air bases have been hit, they have been repaired within hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If China were to use its ballistic missiles with a CEP of 5 meters it would take approximately 45 of them to disable Taiwan&amp;#39;s 12 fighter airbase runways for a few hours. In those few hours China could use PGM&amp;#39;s to destroy aircraft within hardened air shelters, ammunition and fuel depots and maintenance hangars, making the amount of time until the base can be reopened to fully support combat air operations in days or weeks assuming the Chinese don&amp;#39;t continue to bomb it. As the majority of Taiwan&amp;#39;s SAM batteries would have been destroyed in the opening strike due to your choice of deploying them as static targets protecting bunkers, it would look like the Taiwanese would end up worse then if they followed there own strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They can feel free to try to engage them with limited fuel, after running the gauntlet of ground-based air defenses first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then after they fight it out, they have to fly back to China and let the air defenses shoot at them again. The Taiwanese fighters will be operating much closer to their bases than the Chinese fighters, and can use their fuel to maintain an altitude advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What gauntlet would this be? Did you not say you would deploy the SAM&amp;#39;s with artillery batteries in bunkers along the western coast? Which would be destroyed by China in there first strike since they are sitting ducks. Would Chinese attack and multirole aircraft not also be carrying out SEAD operations against any remaining Taiwanese SAM&amp;#39;s? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean really none of this makes any sense, apparently according to you Taiwan has enough strategic SAM&amp;#39;s to protect all its new coastal bunkers, have some in reserve for a &amp;quot;surprise&amp;quot; attack and have enough to ensure that its airbases aren&amp;#39;t damaged to the point that these Taiwanese F-16&amp;#39;s loitering east of Taiwan can&amp;#39;t land, refuel and rearm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck trying to hit targets at extreme range with expensive missiles that will be laughably easy to jam or decoy at some point during their very long journey,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all explain to me how you came to the conclusion that the S-400&amp;#39;s 40N6 missile is &amp;quot;laughably easy to jam&amp;quot; second of all can you tell me how Taiwan would &amp;quot;jam&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;decoy&amp;quot; the 40N6 missile when they do not operate any dedicated EW aircraft or have any such &amp;quot;decoys&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;#39;m curious about the first point is because the 40N6 has an active radar seeker, which would mean that an enemy aircraft would not know that a 40N6 had been fired at it until the missile went active, which is usually only in the last 20km&amp;#39;s of the interception path. So can you explain to me how you are going to &amp;quot;jam&amp;quot; a missile with an active radar homing seeker when you were only aware of its existence when it is only 20km&amp;#39;s away from your aircraft and is homing in on you at almost 5,000 meters per second, giving you less then 4 seconds to respond? If you meant that Taiwan would jam the 40N6&amp;#39;s mid course updates, which I seriously doubt as it is quite clear you didn&amp;#39;t put any thought into your argument there or had no knowledge of it in the first place, how would they be capable of jamming the mid course updates when they would be 300+ km&amp;#39;s away from the S-400&amp;#39;s engagement radar and how would they be capable of jamming an S-400, which is widely acknowledged as being extremely hard to jam, without a dedicated EW aircraft in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or to simply dodge as agile fighters are trained to do, and have proven they can do when used by the US. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to disappoint you mate, the US hasn&amp;#39;t faced any double digit SAM&amp;#39;s in combat like the S-300/400. I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve even faced any SAM&amp;#39;s which used missiles with active radar homing seeker, at best hey were SARH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;S-400s aren&amp;#39;t going to be effective at all east of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No but I imagine Chinese navy vessels deployed to the east of Taiwan with HQQ9&amp;#39;s and S-300F&amp;#39;s will be, as they would be within the theoretical no-escape zone. Wouldn&amp;#39;t the Chinese firing SAM&amp;#39;s at the F-16&amp;#39;s loitering east of Taiwan cause them to jettison part of there payload as American pilots did when the Serbians fired on them with there SA-6&amp;#39;s, even though they weren&amp;#39;t intending on hitting them? If they jettison there external fuel tanks they&amp;#39;ll have to return to base a lot sooner, over Taiwan where China would have air superiority and could shoot them down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for China putting naval vessels east of Taiwan: sure thing if it wants them sunk. Go ahead and put the enemy fortress between you and anyone who can help you.

I would keep air defenses and artillery together in these fortified fire bases. Small fire bases would be about 4-6 miles from expected invasion areas, and equipped with 105mm artillery. Major fire bases would be 12-15 miles back, and equipped with 155mm artillery. \n\nSo what's stopping Chinese bunker busters, cruise missiles or ballistic missiles penetrating these bunkers and destroying them?

So Taiwan's Patriot and Skybow batteries get destroyed in the Chinese first strike, remaining batteries are destroyed through SEAD operations. Taiwan's Airforce is completely grounded after the first strike destroys Taiwan's runways and logistical facilities on its airbases because Taiwan is not willing to use its air defences for the one job they were produced for, defending strategic targets. These remnants of the Taiwanese Airforce that \"hide\" east of the Taiwan have already been identified and tracked by the Chinese the moment they take off and are destroyed by the Chinese Air Force.\n\n&gt;Of course air bases will be major targets, which is why no fighters can be exposed to be bombed on the ground in the first week.
