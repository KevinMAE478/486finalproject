Who knows, maybe a Joker and Harley get together and go on to form a real life supercouple.\n\nThe fallout cosplayer goes one of two ways. He fiddles with his PipBoy and figures out how it works, which will take a while but has a good chance of happening as most fallout cosplayers play the game. He then either accidentally crushes himself with a suit of power armor or manages to equip it as well as heavy fallout weapons such as the fat man or one of the gatling guns. If he can get legendary items, even worse. This all counts on him not dying in the vulerable minutes while he figures it all out. He's also very advantaged in this as fallout gear is made around average people, just more futuristic, so its easier to learn. I'm gonna count a 50% he survives to become dangerous.\n\nIron man suits probably end up overextending a movement, flying through a wall, killing themselves through sheer inexperience, you see suits with blood slowly pooling out from them, their bodies twisted in unrecognizable shapes. Some are still thrashing, still tearing themselves apart as their agonized screams echo through the hall. Probably 1 or 2 survive.\n\nThors and Batmen get the same fate as joker and harley: Many get killed by random fliers, grenades going off that weren't usually there, batmen have a whole utility belt on which to kill themselves in new, innovative ways. 1 of each survive the beginning\n\nHulks accidentally kill anyone who gets close to them (think Lenny from Of mice and men), then get shot due to their close proximity to the ground. The wailing screams of kids bleeding out as they accidentally kill the people around them join the chorus of pain. 1 survives the beginning\n\nNinja turtles slowly turn into real turtles. Most are caught in the crossfire, some see themselves and commit suicide. A couple are of normal mental health and shake it off after a few minutes. 2 survive the beginning\n\nBlack widows now all shoot themselves or are shot, or are clumsily stumbling around screaming and get taken out by a flier or baby hulk. I'm gonna say none have a good chance of surviving the beginning.\n\nCaptain Americas don't really have a way to kill themselves. A good number get taken out, but the rest are in a good position to assess what's going on. 2 or 3 survive.\n\nThe Juggernaut survives. He's by default placed in a spectator position, with almost no way to kill himself. His durability would allow him to survive for as long as he needs to figure the situation out.\n\nDarth Vaders are most likely flourishing their \"sabers\" when everything happens, end up cutting off something important and getting incapped by pain. bonus points for them falling on their saber and cutting themselves to pieces trying to escape. The rest accidentally trigger the force, killing other people and throwing everything into even more of a convoluted mess, then die to something else. \n\nGoku dies instantly. His wheelchair makes him effectively immobile, and with no bullet resistance, he is shot and bleeds out trying to crawl to safety. Or he tries to fly and incaps himself.\n\nDeadpools and Spidermen: the deadpools have their katanas or guns out. Spidermen start shooting web out randomly as they pose. guns go off, katanas slice, the surviving deadpools are either in agony as they regen, tied up with the dead bodies of the spidermen in a web, or are regenerating from the head as it was sliced off. either way, they get incapped. I'm betting none of these are able to fight after, as even if they survived, they would be stuck in a web.\n\nWeebs are one of the few to realize what's actually going on, but they also are the most likely to injure themselves or other people. they serve as a cleanup crew: roleplaying themselves as some sort of edgy hero, they kill people who have survived or are injured. Some even pretend to go insane because that's how anime portrays it when something like this happens. A large amount kill themselves on blades or by each other. 1 survives just by weeb nature.\n\nElvis superman is trying to do the leg shake dance that elvis does, accidentally shoots off into the stratosphere. We won't see him come down anytime soon. Other superman is in business, provided he doesn't get shot by a stray bullet or throws himself miles away like other superman does. This depends on where he is in the convention.\n\nMany of the cosplayers are not in a fighting mood. If you can sneak up to them or pretend to be amicable, you can catch many of the unarmored opponents off guard. Your AR-15 is also one of the only ranged weapons that can reliably hit someone from across the convention hall, so you can use that to your advantage, picking off mostly anyone, as no one is bulletproof. The last Weeb tries to zigzag charge you, but you shoot him as he wails that \"this will not be the end!\" Now, you only have those in suits of armor to contend with. the Iron Man suits, as stated earlier, are very advanced and likely to be misused, however, the few that have learned how to use them will now be on the hunt for you, as your bullets can't get through. Additionally, the fallout player will also be on the hunt, which is especially problematic. This now comes down to specifics, but I feel as though it plays out well for you.\n\nThe Fallout player is armed with heavy weapons and a pip-boy, with which you can get more heavy weapons such as a fat man. Basing his suit on the design of Fo4, you can remove his armor core as long as you get behind him unnoticed, which should be relatively easy considering the clunky nature of Fo4 helmet HUD. Now that you've armed yourself with a fatman, and a pipboy, sprint outside of the convention hall and nuke it repeatedly until it's made of ashes. This gives you a good run at making it out the lone survivor. \n\nThe whole plan also hinges on the Fallout player not being completely stupid and firing his MIRV 2 Shot fatman too close because there are no sights on it and he can't judge distance well. If that happens, no one wins. \n\nIn the end the best way to go is just to carpet bomb the place with nukes, and hope you don't die from rad exposure or some of the people turning into ghouls.

Peering out from the underside of the table, I see laser beams shooting every which way. I feel explosions rock the floor. Gunfire echoes in my ear. An aisle down from me I see a group of convention goers that didn't come in character. They... they had no chance.  Somewhere, amidst the chaos, I hear them. Their screams. Oh God, *their screams.* Time slows down as I see their demise unfolding. They're slowly torn apart by machine gun fire and a ricocheting Mj\u00f6lnir. I force my eyes shut and grit my teeth. This has to be a bad dream. \n\nA jolt strikes through me as I feel a bullet graze my shoulder. I look up and see a Deadpool rolling over the top of a twenty foot t-shirt stand, his dual pistols firing in random directions. He's yelling something, but I can't understand it with all that blood spurting from his mouth. Just before he lands against the concrete floor, he's tackled midair by an out of control Iron Man who's also screaming. They fly off in a zigzag pattern to the other side of the convention hall. \n\nAs I'm gathering my wits, somewhere inside me grows a fiery annoyance. I feel my anger rising as I feel the intensity of the nearby heat ray from the screaming Elvis Superman who's currently spinning in cartwheels and bouncing off walls like a glitched frisbee. I squeeze the grip on my AR-15. My finger wants to pull the trigger. I just need a target.\n\nI stand and take aim at the continuously tripping Black Widow two aisles away. Two shots and she stops tripping. I turn to my left and pop a \"sexy\" Ninja Turtle in the knee, making her drop. I follow up with a double tap to her head and keep moving with the AR held close to my chest. *Don't stop. Have to keep moving, have to keep killing, have to make it out of here.* I take quick cover behind a comic stand to scout the neighboring aisle; bodies are strewn about the floor. A Captain America and Spiderman are fighting but completely overthrowing their punches and launching themselves several feet. I stand, dash across the aisle, and continue watching. Figuring I could take out two for one, I pull an RPG from my belt and load into the launcher attachment on my AR. I steady myself and aim. **FWOOMP.** The shell flies out of the launcher, leaving a small arching smoke trail behind it. The fighing Cap and Spidey never saw it coming. \n\n\"BUT HULK WANT COMIC BOOK\" shouts a monstrous eight year old's voice. I turn and see the green kid being hurried away by his mother and father. \"No son! We gotta go!\" shouts the father. A whizzing sound zips through the air and a sudden ball of fire engulfs the young Hulk and his family. I look up to see an Iron Man flying in reverse who somehow accidentally activated his shoulder missiles. \"Oh SHIT. Sorry!\" The smoke clears, and all that's left is the kid Hulk. I turn and make a break for it. *If a missile won't put him down, I sure as hell can't.*\n\nI sprint across a few aisles, taking shots at potential targets. There's too much chaos to confirm kills, I have to fire and dodge bullets and random repulsor beams. I come to a quick stop behind a pillar where I drop to a knee and eject the empty magazine. I grab a fresh one from my belt strap (which strangely wasn't there before), shove it into the AR, and cock it. Just as I turn to peek down the aisle I'm next to, a rolling Juggernaut who's not able to stop himself barrels through a vendor stand, smashing dozens of priceless collectibles. He continues blasting through stands until he meets the wall, where he defies gravity and keeps on rolling up the wall to the ceiling. \n\nI glance down the partially destroyed aisle and see the Fallout guy firing his minigun into the air, trying to hit the spinning, still wheelchair-bound Goku. My eyes hone in on his weapon. *That's what I need*. I dart between stands, hoping to keep the Fallout guy unaware of my advance. I stop behind a freelance artist's table with various characters drawn in his style. They're all admittedly horrible. \"WOOooo!\" I heard from under the draped table. Out slides a Joker holding a beer in one hand. \"Whoa, HEY Prunisher...\" he says as he wobbles. Just as I reach for my Beretta to recreate the \"I got all the therapy you need right here, comedian\" scene, an obese Batman interrupts. \"That's enough, Castle!\" he shouts as he swats at my hand. His swats were mere sweaty pats against my fingerless gloves. He pulls out his grappling hook, swings it overhead and tosses it at me, completely missing by a few feet. A shot for each of them seems in order. **BAM. BAM.**\n\nI holster the Beretta and look down the aisle again. My target has become aware of me, those two mercy shots gave me away. I dive to the left behind a pillar as the Fallout guy's minigun comes to life. Bullets ricochet everywhere. *Blind fire. He's spraying bullets with no target*. I rise and bolt from cover, laying down suppression fire as I move from stand to stand. His barrage sways in a wide birth as he tries to keep the minigun pointed at me. I continue moving to keep his focus on me. It was enough to distract him from what I saw behind him. **WHUMP.** A steamrolling Juggernaut, still caught in his endless somersault, plowed right through Fallout guy. The minigun fell to the ground. \n\nThe coast was clear. My chance had finally presented itself. Hastily I moved from cover to cover, getting closer and closer to my prize. Finally, within just a few feet of it I come face to face with a Captain America. He's been roughed up quite a bit. \"No way, Castle! This one's mine!\" he shouts as he leaps forward with a cocked right arm. I drop to a knee and aim my AR up to hipfire as he moves in, but the force of his own punch sends him flying into the ceiling. I reach down, pick up the minigun, and turn to mow down all those remaining.\n\nBits of sheetrock and concrete sprinkle my shoulders. I look up. The combined destruction within the convention hall had weakened the building, and Cap's bodyslam into the ceiling shook something loose. I pull the trigger. The minigun barrels had only begun to spin when the ceiling met the floor. \n\n0.1/10 I survive the building's collapse.\n\n-----------\n\nSeveral minutes later, the handicapped Goku and t-shirt Superman push the rubble off of themselves. They both exhale and look at each other. \"Holy shit...\"\n\n\nOff in the distance, two F-35's pursue a confused and panicking Iron Man corkscrewing through the sky.

Peering out from the underside of the table, I see laser beams shooting every which way. I feel explosions rock the floor. Gunfire echoes in my ear. An aisle down from me I see a group of convention goers that didn&amp;#39;t come in character. They... they had no chance.  Somewhere, amidst the chaos, I hear them. Their screams. Oh God, &lt;em&gt;their screams.&lt;/em&gt; Time slows down as I see their demise unfolding. They&amp;#39;re slowly torn apart by machine gun fire and a ricocheting Mj\u00f6lnir. I force my eyes shut and grit my teeth. This has to be a bad dream. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A jolt strikes through me as I feel a bullet graze my shoulder. I look up and see a Deadpool rolling over the top of a twenty foot t-shirt stand, his dual pistols firing in random directions. He&amp;#39;s yelling something, but I can&amp;#39;t understand it with all that blood spurting from his mouth. Just before he lands against the concrete floor, he&amp;#39;s tackled midair by an out of control Iron Man who&amp;#39;s also screaming. They fly off in a zigzag pattern to the other side of the convention hall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;m gathering my wits, somewhere inside me grows a fiery annoyance. I feel my anger rising as I feel the intensity of the nearby heat ray from the screaming Elvis Superman who&amp;#39;s currently spinning in cartwheels and bouncing off walls like a glitched frisbee. I squeeze the grip on my AR-15. My finger wants to pull the trigger. I just need a target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stand and take aim at the continuously tripping Black Widow two aisles away. Two shots and she stops tripping. I turn to my left and pop a &amp;quot;sexy&amp;quot; Ninja Turtle in the knee, making her drop. I follow up with a double tap to her head and keep moving with the AR held close to my chest. &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t stop. Have to keep moving, have to keep killing, have to make it out of here.&lt;/em&gt; I take quick cover behind a comic stand to scout the neighboring aisle; bodies are strewn about the floor. A Captain America and Spiderman are fighting but completely overthrowing their punches and launching themselves several feet. I stand, dash across the aisle, and continue watching. Figuring I could take out two for one, I pull an RPG from my belt and load into the launcher attachment on my AR. I steady myself and aim. &lt;strong&gt;FWOOMP.&lt;/strong&gt; The shell flies out of the launcher, leaving a small arching smoke trail behind it. The fighing Cap and Spidey never saw it coming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;BUT HULK WANT COMIC BOOK&amp;quot; shouts a monstrous eight year old&amp;#39;s voice. I turn and see the green kid being hurried away by his mother and father. &amp;quot;No son! We gotta go!&amp;quot; shouts the father. A whizzing sound zips through the air and a sudden ball of fire engulfs the young Hulk and his family.
