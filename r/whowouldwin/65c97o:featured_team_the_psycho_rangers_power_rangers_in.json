The Power Rangers had never faced an enemy so strong, only willing through superior tactics, and the huge egos of the Psycho Rangers, who all focused on their own objectives. The Psycho Rangers returned in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, however they were defeated by a combination of the Space Power Rangers and the Lost Galaxy Power Rangers. Psycho Pink survived however and her survival led to the first death of a Power Ranger as she killed Hendrix, the Pink Lost Galaxy Ranger in one of the most shocking moments of the series.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 5 Psycho Rangers.

Their fighting styles were specific to their coloured ranger opponent, giving them a huge advantage against them. Also regarding monster forms, the Psycho&amp;#39;s were unique in that they could access their monster forms while remaining their normal size (albeit somewhat larger, but not growing to a giant size for a Megazord battle) and as such there are some feats at this size facing the Rangers and some at Giant size facing the Megazords.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/6/6d/Psycho-red.png/revision/latest?cb=20130227140834\"&gt;Psycho Red&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Psycho Red was the leader of the Psycho Rangers.

But she had more cards in her sleeve then they were expecting. Enter the Psycho Rangers. These big bad boys were the strongest enemies the Power Rangers in Space faced. The Power Rangers had never faced an enemy so strong, only willing through superior tactics, and the huge egos of the Psycho Rangers, who all focused on their own objectives. The Psycho Rangers returned in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, however they were defeated by a combination of the Space Power Rangers and the Lost Galaxy Power Rangers. Psycho Pink survived however and her survival led to the first death of a Power Ranger as she killed Hendrix, the Pink Lost Galaxy Ranger in one of the most shocking moments of the series.\n\n**Team Members**\n\nThere are 5 Psycho Rangers. One for each of the main colours (Red,Blue,Black,Pink,Yellow) of the Space Power Rangers. There was also a 6th Psycho Ranger, Psycho Silver, who was actually Zhane, the Silver Space Ranger in disguise, in an elaborate ruse to trick the Psycho Rangers.\n\n**Quick Notes**\n\nThe Psycho Rangers are believed to be copies of each other, all possessing the same abilities as the other. However this is also a NLF since just cause Psycho Red can do something, doesn't mean the others can, but it's up to you. They were portrayed as equals in strength and so, with their differences being their egos and their fighting styles. Their fighting styles were specific to their coloured ranger opponent, giving them a huge advantage against them. Also regarding monster forms, the Psycho's were unique in that they could access their monster forms while remaining their normal size (albeit somewhat larger, but not growing to a giant size for a Megazord battle) and as such there are some feats at this size facing the Rangers and some at Giant size facing the Megazords.\n\n---\n\n###**[Psycho Red](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/6/6d/Psycho-red.png/revision/latest?cb=20130227140834)**\n\n**Bio** \n\nPsycho Red was the leader of the Psycho Rangers. He wielded the [Psycho Sword](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/8/89/Psycho-Sword-psycho-rangers-4835337-320-240.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110224214700) and his monster form was a huge [Flame Monster.](https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/d/df/Mega-vi-nejiphantom.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170326054717) A hot head, his huge ego often made him clash with not only the other Psycho Rangers, but even his creator, Astronema.
