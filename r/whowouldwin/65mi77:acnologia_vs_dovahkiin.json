after the clash with Igneel and then without a arm.But here we have the Blood of Northern dragon aspect (what you see in the trailer) armor of dragon bones, each armed with Daedric artifact, every spell and cry of the dragon, also equipped bow and the shield of Auriel.The battle takes place on the world.ps.questo throat is lore Dovahkiin dragonrend and does not work on Acnologia because, in
