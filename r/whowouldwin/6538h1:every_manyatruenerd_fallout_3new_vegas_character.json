Especially ones that are equivalent to what you can get in the Fallouts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, PD Shoot and ON Again probably have the best chance -- they&amp;#39;ve got the most experience with careful planning and succeeding at it, and for the most part can handle tense situations very well (PD Shoot on the elevator in Lonesome Road not withstanding).  And their &amp;quot;no healing&amp;quot; trait wouldn&amp;#39;t really hinder them.  My personal vote goes to PD Shoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I guess I&amp;#39;d go with Jon Sawyer.
