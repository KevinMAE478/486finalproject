Kazama was also founder and runner of the Sunflower Orphanage, an orphanage largely composed of the children of people who were killed by the yakuza, to which Kiryu was adopted. Kiryu grew up seeing Kazama as his real father, and envious of his charisma and wealth, practically begged to be allowed to join the Tojo throughout his youth. At the age of 16 he and his best friend Akira Nishikiyama both joined under the Dojima Family. Throughout the next several years, Kiryu proved to be exceptionally skilled in fighting and shaking down low-lifes who hadn\u2019t payed the money they owed. He was so renowned that he became known as a dragon amongst the entire clan, and had a &lt;a href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/yakuza/images/6/62/Kazuma_Kiryu_ouryu_tattoo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130221165927\"&gt;sweet tattoo&lt;/a&gt; to match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that is merely the beginning of Kiryu\u2019s story, next comes the part about how Nishiki killed Dojima and Kiryu took the rap for it, spent the next 10 years in prison, a girl who was supposedly the niece of Kiryu and Nishiki\u2019s other childhood friend but turned out to be her daughter with the guy who stole the yen and the chairman of the Tojo died and left a will saying who would be next in line and it turned out to be Kiryu but then he retired after beating up a couple people on a roof and a lot of people died and that\u2019s just the first game. The story gets very convoluted but the long and short of it is: Kiryu is now retired and runs his own orphanage out on a beach in Okinawa, but every couple of years a new threat befalls the Tojo Clan, be it rival gangs, the CIA, zombies, or the Tojo itself, and Kiryu must don his grey and maroon suit once again and return to Kamurocho to beat the living hell out of anyone who stands in his way to save it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiryu practices a self-made fighting style appropriately called The Dragon of Dojima Style, which blends elements of various martial arts, wrestling, moves taught to him by a homeless man, and various things he learned by seeing weird events around Kamurocho. The style also utilizes heavy use of improvised weaponry and the environment. Kiryu can get a use out of almost anything he can find, from traffic cones to salt shakers, street lights to parked cars. It also emphasizes Kiryu\u2019s relentlessness, the style focusses on hitting the opponent\u2019s face and stomach in moment\u2019s of weakness, and if his enemy is down, Kiryu won\u2019t hesitate to curbstomp them to victory. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AWJYOGxDo\"&gt;This all can be seen in the largest compilation of his special moves to date.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect of Kiryu\u2019s fighting style, however, is heat. Heat isn\u2019t at all contextualized in game, and is never even acknowledged in story, but functionally it works as the game\u2019s super meter, and within the context of the world it can be thought of as something like ki or fighting energy.
