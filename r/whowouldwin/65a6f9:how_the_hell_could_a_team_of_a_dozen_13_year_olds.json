A batch of real low-down pseudo-sociopaths, people who aren't afraid to do some harm. A non-pyromaniacal enjoyment of fire is a plus.\n* The Wheelmen: Two, either able to appropriate their parents vehicles (vans preferrable) or able to steal them.\n* The Runners: Three. Some kids with sturdy backs and good speed.\n* The Drama Nerd: One. Someone with a decent amount of stage makeup experience. \n* The Heavy Wheelman: One. Someone with experience with larger trucks. AKA that kid who lives out in the boondocks whose dad lets them drive the truck to get him more chips. \n* The Brain: ONLY ONE. One kid who is the de-facto boss. You have more than one kid in charge, things are going to get fucky. \n\n**STAGE ONE: FORMATION**\n\nFirst things first, the Brain brings in the others, and briefs them on the plan. One of the heavies is going to get delusions of intelligence and attempt to take control of the outfit, or demand a larger cut, or otherwise act like a bitch. You act like a bitch, you bleed like a bitch, and the Brain bashes their fingers with a hammer until they act right; any mercy, and the crew is going to lose cohesion. We shall presume no further disruption of chain of command from here on out (at least until after the heist, but we'll deal with that later). \n\n**STAGE TWO: PREPARATION**\n\nThe team breaks into two distinct units:\n\n* Unit One: All four Heavies plus one Wheelman. Since the heavies are likely complete reprobates, the Wheelman is the de-facto commander of Unit One.\n* Unit Two: The Runners, the other Wheelman and the Drama Nerd. Anyone here is a candidate for commander, though the Wheelman and the Drama Nerd are the prime candidates. \n* Unit Three: The Brain and the Heavy Wheelman. \n\nUnit One prepares as many incendiary devices as their evil little hearts can manage, as well as a batch of starter pistols. Unit Two has the Drama Nerd work with the Runners on disguises; specifically, practicing running with lifts in their shoes and applying makeup to make them look both different and more mature. The Runners drill the Drama Nerd on running, to determine if he can physically keep up with them; if he passes, he stays on Unit Two during the Action Stage, otherwise he shifts to Unit Three. Unit Three acquires radio gear, both handheld units for coordinating the Units and police scanners, as well as a metal detector. They also source any materials Units One and Two need for their jobs (gasoline, makeup, disposable clothing, etc). The Brain also needs at least one firearm, a few incendiary devices of his own, a few extra money bags loaded with paper, and a third vehicle. \n\n**Stage Three: ACTION**\n\nMorning of, the Wheelmen acquire their vehicles and load their teams. The Heavies roll out first... as far away from the bank as they can go and still be in city limits. Now they start burning things, staying mobile on foot while the Wheelman waits in a parking lot with no security cameras, and popping off shots with the starter pistols so the police get a bunch of \"shots fired\" calls. Once the cops and fire department commit to dealing with Unit One's mess, Unit Two enters the bank in disguise and with the metal detector broken up and hidden on their bodies. They walk straight up to the counters, not bothering with the lines, and hand over notecards bearing the instructions, hand over the money, loose bills, etc.. \n\nModern banks don't really give a shit about trying to stop robbers at the counter, so they comply, likely doing stuff like A) pulling money out of a slot in their drawer that literally only exists because it's wired to a panic button, B) slipping tracking devices/dye bombs into the bags, and C) rigging the exit doors with auto-locks and bulletproof glass, trapping the robbers inside. The cops are all busy dealing with Unit One. The metal detectors sweep the bags for any non-cash items that could compromise the job. So the boys go right to the front door... and get locked in. Everyone at the bank breathes a sigh of relief...\n\nAnd then Unit Three shows up with a stolen tow truck and rips the doors right off their hinges. The Brain alerts Unit Two's wheelman (located at least a half mile away, on a route that cuts through residential areas unlikely to be wired for cameras) to prepare himself, the Runners start running with the bags of money (and bags of fresh clothing waiting on the back of the tow truck) before the police arrive. Evading on foot, the Runners reach the van and immediately start getting out of their disguises, packing all their heist clothing and disguise gear up for disposal.\n\n**Stage Four: Cleanup**\n\nThe Crew all meet up in an appropriate location (like a rock quarry or garage). The Runner's disguises, the radio gear, and any other appropriate hardware are stacked up in the tow truck, which will be lit on fire to get rid of the evidence. The Brain invites them to all gather around the fire, he's going to grab some beer he stole, so they can celebrate their victory. \n\nHis victory. He knows what he's working with here; it's a bunch of kids. They did a great job so far, but any one of these little shits would crack under questioning, or do something stupid like try to buy the entire inventory of Gamestop while the manhunt is still on. Fuck that. Reaching into the trunk of his stolen car, he pulls out the firearm and the incendiary devices and turns on the rest of the crew. Killing all but one, he forces whoever is still standing to help him load the money in his car at gunpoint. When it's all in, he blows the last kid's head off with a shot under the chin, leaves the gun and bolts for Mexico. \n\nWhen the cops show up and find the mess, the first assumption will be that the crew pulled the heist, got together to split the money, an argument ensued, a fight broke out, and the last kid committed murder-suicide rather than face jail. By the time they figure out the bags in the tow truck were just paper and piece together that one kid is missing, the Brain is in the wind. \n\nEDIT: Misread the prompt as thirteen twelve year olds, not twelve thirteen year olds.

The Brain also needs at least one firearm, a few incendiary devices of his own, a few extra money bags loaded with paper, and a third vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Three: ACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morning of, the Wheelmen acquire their vehicles and load their teams. The Heavies roll out first... as far away from the bank as they can go and still be in city limits. Now they start burning things, staying mobile on foot while the Wheelman waits in a parking lot with no security cameras, and popping off shots with the starter pistols so the police get a bunch of &amp;quot;shots fired&amp;quot; calls. Once the cops and fire department commit to dealing with Unit One&amp;#39;s mess, Unit Two enters the bank in disguise and with the metal detector broken up and hidden on their bodies. They walk straight up to the counters, not bothering with the lines, and hand over notecards bearing the instructions, hand over the money, loose bills, etc.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Modern banks don&amp;#39;t really give a shit about trying to stop robbers at the counter, so they comply, likely doing stuff like A) pulling money out of a slot in their drawer that literally only exists because it&amp;#39;s wired to a panic button, B) slipping tracking devices/dye bombs into the bags, and C) rigging the exit doors with auto-locks and bulletproof glass, trapping the robbers inside. The cops are all busy dealing with Unit One. The metal detectors sweep the bags for any non-cash items that could compromise the job. So the boys go right to the front door... and get locked in. Everyone at the bank breathes a sigh of relief...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Unit Three shows up with a stolen tow truck and rips the doors right off their hinges. The Brain alerts Unit Two&amp;#39;s wheelman (located at least a half mile away, on a route that cuts through residential areas unlikely to be wired for cameras) to prepare himself, the Runners start running with the bags of money (and bags of fresh clothing waiting on the back of the tow truck) before the police arrive. Evading on foot, the Runners reach the van and immediately start getting out of their disguises, packing all their heist clothing and disguise gear up for disposal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Four: Cleanup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Crew all meet up in an appropriate location (like a rock quarry or garage). The Runner&amp;#39;s disguises, the radio gear, and any other appropriate hardware are stacked up in the tow truck, which will be lit on fire to get rid of the evidence. The Brain invites them to all gather around the fire, he&amp;#39;s going to grab some beer he stole, so they can celebrate their victory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His victory. He knows what he&amp;#39;s working with here; it&amp;#39;s a bunch of kids. They did a great job so far, but any one of these little shits would crack under questioning, or do something stupid like try to buy the entire inventory of Gamestop while the manhunt is still on. Fuck that. Reaching into the trunk of his stolen car, he pulls out the firearm and the incendiary devices and turns on the rest of the crew. Killing all but one, he forces whoever is still standing to help him load the money in his car at gunpoint. When it&amp;#39;s all in, he blows the last kid&amp;#39;s head off with a shot under the chin, leaves the gun and bolts for Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the cops show up and find the mess, the first assumption will be that the crew pulled the heist, got together to split the money, an argument ensued, a fight broke out, and the last kid committed murder-suicide rather than face jail. By the time they figure out the bags in the tow truck were just paper and piece together that one kid is missing, the Brain is in the wind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Misread the prompt as thirteen twelve year olds, not twelve thirteen year olds.
