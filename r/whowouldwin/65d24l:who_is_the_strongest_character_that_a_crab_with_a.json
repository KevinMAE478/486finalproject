The cell is to be soundproofed and to have no windows. To prevent them from being affected by SCP-1500, no personnel are to be allowed into its containment cell under any circumstances, and no security cameras are to be placed in the cell.\n\nA false containment document for SCP-1500 is to be established, with the\nintent of discouraging further investigation or rescue attempts. In the event\nof an attempted containment breach, all involved are to be terminated. All\npersonnel experiencing persistent headaches or found to have been affected by\nSCP-1500 will be transferred away from Site 17.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1500 is a featureless humanoid with smooth greenish gray skin and a highly distended abdomen. Its limbs are long and multi-jointed. Its skin is metallic in texture and very durable, demonstrating a tensile strength of about 1.2 gigapascals. Though it has no visible sensory organs, it apparently possesses senses roughly equal to that of a human. It cannot speak, and does not need to eat, breathe, or sleep.\n\nAny human within line of sight of SCP-1500 experiences headaches, nausea, and\na feeling of fear. These gradually increase for an amount of time typically\nbetween 200 seconds and 530 seconds until the subject loses consciousness for\napproximately 15 seconds. Upon awakening, the subject retains no memory of\ntheir previous time exposed to SCP-1500, and thereafter perceives SCP-1500 as\na Caucasian human male named Zachary Callahan.\n\nSubjects' memories are altered to include SCP-1500, usually as a friend from\nchildhood or early adulthood. Subjects are also capable of communicating with\nSCP-1500. No attempts to reverse this change have proven effective to date.\nThough amnestics are able to remove memories of SCP-1500, albeit at a reduced\nsuccess rate, affected individuals continue to perceive SCP-1500 as human in\nany future interactions.\n\n**Addendum 1500-4:** Recent developments suggest that SCP-1500 is able to affect people over long distances. In a recent speech, Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 alluded to a fishing trip he went on in his youth with a Zach Callahan. A background check revealed no persons by that name of the appropriate age living near Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the nineteen sixties, and Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was reported as having suffered a crippling migraine at a dinner party the week before.\n\n**Addendum 1500-7:** Persons recently affected by SCP-1500 have placed it in a more prominent role in their memories than previously observed. Rather than an old friend, SCP-1500 has often assumed the role of a parental figure, a former love, or a long-lost relative. In all cases, affected individuals report that they associate SCP-1500 with protection and adoration.\n\n**Addendum 1500-20:** As of 8/1/20\u2588\u2588, an estimated 23,000 people across the world have been affected by SCP-1500.

Should SCP-983 be presented to or handled by any individual on the yearly anniversary of their birth, they should immediately follow the sing-along guidelines contained in Emergency Kit 135r located next to the door to SCP-983\u2019s containment chamber.\n\nIn the event the targeted individual fails to meet sing-along requirements,\ntheir remains are to be disposed of through standard methods. In the event the\ntargeted individual meets the sing-along requirements, the following pieces of\ndata are to be collected: Age, Color of Candy collected, Singing Accuracy\nobtained by the best judgment of those present, and the number of verses that\npassed before acknowledgment by SCP-983.\n\nNo candy obtained from SCP-983 is to be consumed by any staff without senior\nstaff-approved containment procedures in place and written waivers filed and\nstamped by the consumer. This requirement is waived in the case of Class-D\ncandy testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-983 is a vintage mechanical monkey with a faded date located on the bottom of the left foot, placing its manufacture at some point in the 1940s by an unknown person or company. The monkey is dressed in the remains of what used to be a popular vest design for circus ringmasters. In the monkey\u2019s left hand, there is a lightly tarnished brass bell. In the right hand, the monkey holds a small brass striking rod. The monkey is capable of emitting speech and sound, although examination of the object has revealed no seams, screws, or openings that would indicate a method of disassembly.\n\nSCP-983 is completely harmless and inert under most circumstances and may be\nhandled without special precautions so long as the handler is not experiencing\nthe 24-hour period considered the anniversary of his birth. Once SCP-983\nphysically comes into contact with an individual on their birthday, it will\nspring to life and do a single back flip before raising its bell and singing a\nsimple song.\n\n_A RING DING DING DING IT\u2019S YOUR BIRTHDAY!_\n\nThis single verse will be followed by the monkey striking its bell producing a\ntone that varies in pitch from quite high to rather low. SCP-983\u2019s singing was\nfound to vary slightly in pitch as well but maintained a very excited and\nhappy tone.\n\nSCP-983 will sing this song once every three to four seconds, pausing only to\nring its bell, until the new owner has died or met the sing-along\nrequirements, which as of yet are not completely understood but are believed\nto be based in timing the sing-along properly with SCP-983.\n\nEach verse sung by SCP-983 appears to age the \u2018owner\u2019 of the item by what is\nestimated at one year. By singing along with SCP-983, the \u2018owner\u2019 may\ndeactivate the monkey which, once done successfully, results in a triumphant\ndeclaration of _\u2019BIRTHDAY!\u2019_ from SCP-983, at which time it will ring its bell\nonce and produce a single gumdrop-style candy from the bell.\n\nThe approach of singing along with SCP-983 has a direct impact on the color of\nthe candy and the side effects of its consumption. Test groups instructed to\nfollow Document 135r to the letter have verified that a perfect sing-along\nresults in the production of crystal-clear candy with mildly luminescent\nqualities. A near-perfect sing-along produces the same candy minus the\nluminescence. Both of these candy types have been verified as restoring any\nage lost by the consumer due to SCP-983\u2019s song; however, the luminescent candy\nmay also grant additional time and youth, though as of yet this theory is\nunproven due to the low production rate of this candy.\n\nDue to the inconsistencies in attitude, tone, behavior, and approach when\ntrying to match SCP-983\u2019s song, a wide variety of candies have been produced.\nUnder absolutely no circumstances are black candies allowed to be consumed,\nalthough other colors may be consumed pending prior approval and containment\narrangements.\n\nThe initial activation of SCP-983 was in a highly uncontrolled environment, so\na \u2018retelling\u2019 is the best record available of the incident. Subsequent tests\nof interest in more controlled environments have been attached to this\ndocument as well as candy effects for those experiments.\n\n**SCP-983 First Activation**  \n---  \n  \nSCP-983 was purchased from a local flea market intended as a gift for a monkey\nadmirer as a joke. The seller of the monkey warned the purchaser that it was\nto be seen and never touched by anyone on the day of their birth, but was\nunable to give exact reasons why, stating it was a warning passed to them that\nwas well observed and may have been \u2018Gypsy legend or some other bull\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2019\n\nUpon the birthday of SCP-983\u2019s intended new owner, the gift was unwrapped and\nthe monkey handled, at which point it sprang into song. Staff attending the\nbirthday party of their coworker were amused as was the recipient at first;\nhowever, witnesses state the recipient became more and more agitated the\nlonger the monkey sang.\n\nAfter ten estimated verses, the recipient tried to find a way to turn the\ndevice off, to no avail. Attendees state that at this time several persons\nnoted streaks of silver within the recipient\u2019s hair. Following an estimated 8\nto 10 more verses from SCP-983, the grey was quite pronounced as were signs of\nwrinkling or stress on the recipient\u2019s face. Within five more verses, the\nrecipient returned the monkey to rest and complained of not having the\nstrength to deal with this nonsense, pleading for someone to turn it off.\n\nWith SCP-983 not being fully realized as a potentially dangerous object, there\nwas panic and sloth in the reactions of the attending staff, which led to\nSCP-983 being able to complete what can only be estimated at thirty or perhaps\nforty more verses before a containment crew could arrive at the party locale.\nBy this point, the recipient had long since expired due to aging, leaving only\na skeletal frame remaining in his chair with the skin clinging to it.\n\nWith confusion on how to approach SCP-983 safely, it was allowed to sing for\nroughly another minute before it ceased of its own accord, at which point\nnothing remained of the original recipient other than his purely skeletal\nremains. SCP-983's final verse consisted of the single word, \u201c_BIRTHDAY!_\u201d,\nwhich it announced joyously before doing a single backflip and ringing its\nbell once. From the bell fell a single candy resembling a gumdrop pure black\nin color. This candy was never consumed and was described as being moderately\nentrancing, drawing a person's gaze into it until an outside source distracted\nthem. With a number of individuals at the scene and the general chaos\ninvolving the incident, no single person was able to become too focused on the\ncandy and it was safely contained.\n\n**SCP-983 Controlled Activation #32**  \n---  \n  \nDuring test #32 regarding SCP-983 one test subject \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nvolunteered for testing as her birthday had approached and she displayed\nqualities unique in comparison to previous test subjects, specifically an\nexceptionally upbeat and excited approach to her birthday. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is referred\nto as \u2018the subject\u2019 for the remainder of this test.\n\nWithout explanation as to what to expect, the subject was given SCP-983 as a\nwrapped present with the prior warning that this object sings and it would\nmake for a great birthday video if she were to sing along with it. The subject\ndisplayed glee and acceptance of SCP-983 as a suitable gift when it was\nunwrapped, and required no guidance in singing along with the object as it\nbegan.  \nThe subject went above and beyond the singing requirements missing only the\nfirst verse to get the words and picking up immediately at the second then\ncontinuing for a total of forty-five (45) verses for a total of forty-six (46)\ncompleted.\n\nDuring the singing process the subject displayed the expected aging process\nwith each verse that passed, but displayed no loss of energy or enthusiasm in\ncontinuing the songs till their end. The subject remained completely unaware\nof her body\u2019s physical state throughout the experiment.\n\nUpon completion of the final verse SCP-983 announced the finale as expected\nwith stating _\u2019BIRTHDAY!\u2019_ loudly and performing a single backflip followed by\na ringing of its bell. The candy produced from the bell was recorded as being\na vibrant white color with vaguely luminescent properties. The subject noted\nit was the most beautiful confectionery that they had ever seen and observing\nstaff also noted admiration for the gumdrop. In keeping with the control of\nthe experiment the subject was allowed to consume the candy.\n\nUpon finishing the candy and following a one-hour period of monitoring there\nwas no indication that any side effect occurred from consumption. With the\nexperiment about to be declared finished the subject asked to leave and was\nexcused from the testing area, at which point she exploded with blinding light\nthat damaged the cameras monitoring the experiment and left all attendees\nblind for five minutes following the burst. Assisting personnel who rushed to\nthe scene described a faint lingering light that remained for at least two\nminutes in the place where the subject stood before it faded out.\n\nThe subject has not been located since this experiment and unusually high\nelectromagnetic activity has been noted within the area that was used for\ntesting. Replacement of light fixtures within this area has also risen\napproximately 70% from the norm throughout other areas of the facility;\nhowever, no decrease in lighting has been reported in any area affected by\nthis anomaly.\n\n\n---\nI am a~~n anomalous entity~~ bot.

Should SCP-983 be presented to or handled by any individual on the yearly anniversary of their birth, they should immediately follow the sing-along guidelines contained in Emergency Kit 135r located next to the door to SCP-983\u2019s containment chamber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the event the targeted individual fails to meet sing-along requirements,\ntheir remains are to be disposed of through standard methods. In the event the\ntargeted individual meets the sing-along requirements, the following pieces of\ndata are to be collected: Age, Color of Candy collected, Singing Accuracy\nobtained by the best judgment of those present, and the number of verses that\npassed before acknowledgment by SCP-983.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No candy obtained from SCP-983 is to be consumed by any staff without senior\nstaff-approved containment procedures in place and written waivers filed and\nstamped by the consumer. This requirement is waived in the case of Class-D\ncandy testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; SCP-983 is a vintage mechanical monkey with a faded date located on the bottom of the left foot, placing its manufacture at some point in the 1940s by an unknown person or company. The monkey is dressed in the remains of what used to be a popular vest design for circus ringmasters. In the monkey\u2019s left hand, there is a lightly tarnished brass bell. In the right hand, the monkey holds a small brass striking rod. The monkey is capable of emitting speech and sound, although examination of the object has revealed no seams, screws, or openings that would indicate a method of disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SCP-983 is completely harmless and inert under most circumstances and may be\nhandled without special precautions so long as the handler is not experiencing\nthe 24-hour period considered the anniversary of his birth. Once SCP-983\nphysically comes into contact with an individual on their birthday, it will\nspring to life and do a single back flip before raising its bell and singing a\nsimple song.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A RING DING DING DING IT\u2019S YOUR BIRTHDAY!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This single verse will be followed by the monkey striking its bell producing a\ntone that varies in pitch from quite high to rather low. SCP-983\u2019s singing was\nfound to vary slightly in pitch as well but maintained a very excited and\nhappy tone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SCP-983 will sing this song once every three to four seconds, pausing only to\nring its bell, until the new owner has died or met the sing-along\nrequirements, which as of yet are not completely understood but are believed\nto be based in timing the sing-along properly with SCP-983.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each verse sung by SCP-983 appears to age the \u2018owner\u2019 of the item by what is\nestimated at one year. By singing along with SCP-983, the \u2018owner\u2019 may\ndeactivate the monkey which, once done successfully, results in a triumphant\ndeclaration of &lt;em&gt;\u2019BIRTHDAY!\u2019&lt;/em&gt; from SCP-983, at which time it will ring its bell\nonce and produce a single gumdrop-style candy from the bell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The approach of singing along with SCP-983 has a direct impact on the color of\nthe candy and the side effects of its consumption. Test groups instructed to\nfollow Document 135r to the letter have verified that a perfect sing-along\nresults in the production of crystal-clear candy with mildly luminescent\nqualities. A near-perfect sing-along produces the same candy minus the\nluminescence. Both of these candy types have been verified as restoring any\nage lost by the consumer due to SCP-983\u2019s song; however, the luminescent candy\nmay also grant additional time and youth, though as of yet this theory is\nunproven due to the low production rate of this candy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the inconsistencies in attitude, tone, behavior, and approach when\ntrying to match SCP-983\u2019s song, a wide variety of candies have been produced.\nUnder absolutely no circumstances are black candies allowed to be consumed,\nalthough other colors may be consumed pending prior approval and containment\narrangements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The initial activation of SCP-983 was in a highly uncontrolled environment, so\na \u2018retelling\u2019 is the best record available of the incident.

When in my continuous presence for over two months, individuals begin to identify themselves as a toaster. Unless forcibly restrained, these people will ultimately harm themselves in their attempts to emulate my standard functions.\n\nI was discovered in the home of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family after the gruesome deaths\nof three of its members. I had been given to the younger Mr. and Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nas a wedding gift. No card or any other identifying markings had been found on\nmy box. Approximately two months after the family received me, fire crews were\ndispatched to the home due to an electrical fire. The younger Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\ndied from the electric discharge that she had caused when attempting to devour\nan electric socket. The other two victims had died shortly before the fire\noccurred. The elder Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had gorged herself with nearly 10 kg of\nbread before her stomach burst and she died of internal bleeding. The younger\nMr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died of severe blood loss after attempting [REDACTED] with me.\nThe sole survivor was the elder Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who was suffering from severe\nmalnutrition. He stated that he had inserted some bread a week prior and was\nstill waiting for the toast to pop out.\n\nI was confiscated by the Foundation after police noted my unusual properties.\nA Class C amnesiac was administered to the affected officers.\n\n**Experiment Log 426-1:**\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588  \n**Subject:** D-class personnel D/426/1  \n**Procedure:** D/426/1 was asked to describe what he believed was contained in my chamber. He was not informed about my identity or properties.  \n**Details:** D/426/1 stated, \"I'm probably some huge monster holed up in there. That's what you guys have all over the place, right?\" D/426/1 remained oblivious to his use of the first-person pronoun.\n\n**Experiment Log 426-2:**\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588  \n**Subject:** D-class personnel D/426/2  \n**Procedure:** D/426/2 was placed in my chamber and given regular meals through a dispenser. No communication with D/426/2 was permitted. Multiple cameras were situated in the chamber, positioned so that I was outside of their field of vision, but allowing constant observation of D/426/2. We remained sealed until my secondary effect manifested in the subject. I was bolted to the floor so that I could not be moved into a camera's view.  \n**Details:** After 45 days of isolation, D/426/2 wrapped his arm around me and began conversing with me, stating that we were brothers. D/426/2 never deviated from using the first-person plural when speaking with me. Subject was terminated one hour after this event. It is theorized that the isolation accelerated the progression of my secondary effect.\n\n**Experiment Log 426-3:**\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588  \n**Subject:** D-class personnel D/426/3  \n**Procedure:** A screw was removed from me and shown to D/426/3 who was asked to describe it. D/426/3 was not informed about my identity or properties.  \n**Details:** D/426/3 referred to it as \"my screw\". Consistent with Experiment 426-1, the subject was oblivious of his use of the first person in his description. This suggests that, even if I were destroyed, my effects would still be inherent in my remains.\n\n**Experiment Log 426-4:**\n\n**Date:** \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588  \n**Subject:** D-class personnel D/426/4  \n**Procedure:** D/426/4 was placed in isolation in a cell adjacent to my chamber, to be observed until my secondary effect manifests.  \n**Details:** No effects appeared. D/426/4 was terminated 90 days after the start of the experiment.  \n_Thank God there are some limits to my effects.

I had been given to the younger Mr. and Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nas a wedding gift. No card or any other identifying markings had been found on\nmy box. Approximately two months after the family received me, fire crews were\ndispatched to the home due to an electrical fire. The younger Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\ndied from the electric discharge that she had caused when attempting to devour\nan electric socket. The other two victims had died shortly before the fire\noccurred. The elder Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had gorged herself with nearly 10 kg of\nbread before her stomach burst and she died of internal bleeding. The younger\nMr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died of severe blood loss after attempting [REDACTED] with me.\nThe sole survivor was the elder Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who was suffering from severe\nmalnutrition. He stated that he had inserted some bread a week prior and was\nstill waiting for the toast to pop out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was confiscated by the Foundation after police noted my unusual properties.\nA Class C amnesiac was administered to the affected officers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment Log 426-1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; D-class personnel D/426/1&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; D/426/1 was asked to describe what he believed was contained in my chamber. He was not informed about my identity or properties.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; D/426/1 stated, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m probably some huge monster holed up in there. That&amp;#39;s what you guys have all over the place, right?&amp;quot; D/426/1 remained oblivious to his use of the first-person pronoun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment Log 426-2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; D-class personnel D/426/2&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; D/426/2 was placed in my chamber and given regular meals through a dispenser. No communication with D/426/2 was permitted. Multiple cameras were situated in the chamber, positioned so that I was outside of their field of vision, but allowing constant observation of D/426/2. We remained sealed until my secondary effect manifested in the subject. I was bolted to the floor so that I could not be moved into a camera&amp;#39;s view.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; After 45 days of isolation, D/426/2 wrapped his arm around me and began conversing with me, stating that we were brothers. D/426/2 never deviated from using the first-person plural when speaking with me. Subject was terminated one hour after this event. It is theorized that the isolation accelerated the progression of my secondary effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment Log 426-3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; D-class personnel D/426/3&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; A screw was removed from me and shown to D/426/3 who was asked to describe it. D/426/3 was not informed about my identity or properties.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; D/426/3 referred to it as &amp;quot;my screw&amp;quot;. Consistent with Experiment 426-1, the subject was oblivious of his use of the first person in his description. This suggests that, even if I were destroyed, my effects would still be inherent in my remains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment Log 426-4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; D-class personnel D/426/4&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; D/426/4 was placed in isolation in a cell adjacent to my chamber, to be observed until my secondary effect manifests.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; No effects appeared. D/426/4 was terminated 90 days after the start of the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Thank God there are some limits to my effects. A lot of us were really\nstarting to get worried about me.&lt;/em&gt; - Dr. C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a&lt;del&gt;n anomalous entity&lt;/del&gt; bot.

During the 19th of each month, the 'active' phase of\nSCP-1337, the system of roads known collectively as 1337-Alpha are to be\nconstantly patrolled for signs of SCP-1337. In the event said SCP is spotted,\na D-class is to be inserted into a remotely controlled vehicle, and guided to\nthe spot of its appearance. Upon acquiring SCP-1337, the vehicle is to be\ndriven to Site 1337-Delta, and the remains of the D-class disposed of. If\nSCP-1337 is not spotted, this anomaly must be immediately reported.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1337 is a Level 2 Humanoid Apparition, location bound, non-violent, corporeal Level 5 Humanoid Apparition, free roaming, corporeal, actively aggressive. It appears to be the wraith of one Mary Talish, who was abducted, ritually tortured, and executed on May 19th, 1952, in Muncie, Indiana. Starting 19 months after her death, SCP-1337 began to appear on the 19th of every month, walking down Mayflower Road (1337-Alpha), attempting to flag down any passing vehicle. It would tell anyone who picked it up that it had gotten lost, and was in need of a ride back to its home (1337-Delta). SCP-1337 would give directions in such a way as to ensure passing the graveyard where Mary Talish was buried (1337-Beta), and then encourage the driver to stop at the cemetery. Once out of the vehicle, SCP-1337 would vanish, leaving the driver to find her sweater (1337-Gamma). Anyone touching 1337-Gamma would then feel an urge to return the item to Site 1337-Delta, and Mary Talish's parents. Despite many attempts to secure 1337-Gamma, it would invariably vanish from containment at or around sunset on the 19th.\n\nSCP-1337 manifests as a female, blonde haired, blue eyed, 150 cm (5 feet)\ntall, approximately 59 kg (130 pounds). It is dressed conservatively, a mid\ncalf length red skirt, long sleeved button up shirt, and red\nsweater(1337-Gamma). It appears well groomed, in both body and clothing. See\nIncident 1337-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 for current physical description.\n\nWhen the Foundation moved in, it was found most beneficial to recruit the\nelder Talishs as E-class Agents of the Foundation, in order to prevent them\nfrom speaking out. The Agents were told the Foundation was working on a way to\nset their daughter to rest. Special agents were employed to pick up and\ntransport SCP-1337, as no means of permanently repositioning it were found.\nDr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was placed in command of Foundation resources governing SCP-1337.\n\n**Incident 1337-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** On 6/18/73, Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, acting without permission, had the E-class Agents executed, and Site 1337-Delta destroyed. His reasoning was that 'If she has no one to return to, she'll stop coming back.' Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was demoted to Junior Staff for his actions, but not reassigned, under the belief that if SCP-1337 were to form a new attachment, it would most likely be to him. An examination of Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588s journals revealed that he believed decommissioning SCP-1337 would lead to a promotion, and 'recognition of his brilliance.'\n\nOn 6/19/76, SCP-1337 was considered Decommissioned.\n\n**Incident 1337-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2:** On 6/19/83, Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 returned to Site 1337-Alpha, to ensure there were no remnants of SCP-1337. His last transmission consisted only of the words 'Wait, who the hell are yo-' When security arrived on the scene, Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was found deceased, his body mutilated in the same manner as Mary Talish's had been when she was found. Since that time, on the 19th of every month, SCP-1337 has returned, with a different method of operations. Recordings have shown that its physical appearance has changed. SCP-1337 still manifests with the same basic physical appearance, but now shows the wounds of its death. The eyes appear to have been gouged from their sockets, and its clothing is ripped and stained mid-chest, to reveal the empty cavity where its heart was removed.\n\nSCP-1337's range of movement has extended to all of the back roads of Muncie. If a vehicle stops for SCP-1337, it vanishes from view, to reappear on another road. Should a vehicle pass SCP-1337 by, it will then appear inside the vehicle, where it will re-enact the methods of its murder upon the driver of the vehicle. SCP-1337 will only appear for vehicles containing one person. This escalation matches those events observed following containment attempts of [SCP-973](&lt;http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-973&gt;). See internal research paper \"Apparition Escalation: Preliminary Research into Human Triggered Escalation of Apparition Hostility\" by Tamlin et al. for more details regarding this and other [similar](&lt;http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1401&gt;) [phenomena](&lt;http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2539&gt;).\n\n\n---\nI am a~~n anomalous entity~~ bot.

Anyone touching 1337-Gamma would then feel an urge to return the item to Site 1337-Delta, and Mary Talish&amp;#39;s parents. Despite many attempts to secure 1337-Gamma, it would invariably vanish from containment at or around sunset on the 19th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SCP-1337 manifests as a female, blonde haired, blue eyed, 150 cm (5 feet)\ntall, approximately 59 kg (130 pounds). It is dressed conservatively, a mid\ncalf length red skirt, long sleeved button up shirt, and red\nsweater(1337-Gamma). It appears well groomed, in both body and clothing. See\nIncident 1337-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 for current physical description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the Foundation moved in, it was found most beneficial to recruit the\nelder Talishs as E-class Agents of the Foundation, in order to prevent them\nfrom speaking out. The Agents were told the Foundation was working on a way to\nset their daughter to rest. Special agents were employed to pick up and\ntransport SCP-1337, as no means of permanently repositioning it were found.\nDr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was placed in command of Foundation resources governing SCP-1337.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident 1337-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:&lt;/strong&gt; On 6/18/73, Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, acting without permission, had the E-class Agents executed, and Site 1337-Delta destroyed. His reasoning was that &amp;#39;If she has no one to return to, she&amp;#39;ll stop coming back.&amp;#39; Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was demoted to Junior Staff for his actions, but not reassigned, under the belief that if SCP-1337 were to form a new attachment, it would most likely be to him. An examination of Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588s journals revealed that he believed decommissioning SCP-1337 would lead to a promotion, and &amp;#39;recognition of his brilliance.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 6/19/76, SCP-1337 was considered Decommissioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident 1337-L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2:&lt;/strong&gt; On 6/19/83, Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 returned to Site 1337-Alpha, to ensure there were no remnants of SCP-1337. His last transmission consisted only of the words &amp;#39;Wait, who the hell are yo-&amp;#39; When security arrived on the scene, Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was found deceased, his body mutilated in the same manner as Mary Talish&amp;#39;s had been when she was found. Since that time, on the 19th of every month, SCP-1337 has returned, with a different method of operations. Recordings have shown that its physical appearance has changed. SCP-1337 still manifests with the same basic physical appearance, but now shows the wounds of its death. The eyes appear to have been gouged from their sockets, and its clothing is ripped and stained mid-chest, to reveal the empty cavity where its heart was removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SCP-1337&amp;#39;s range of movement has extended to all of the back roads of Muncie. If a vehicle stops for SCP-1337, it vanishes from view, to reappear on another road. Should a vehicle pass SCP-1337 by, it will then appear inside the vehicle, where it will re-enact the methods of its murder upon the driver of the vehicle. SCP-1337 will only appear for vehicles containing one person. This escalation matches those events observed following containment attempts of &lt;a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-973\"&gt;SCP-973&lt;/a&gt;.

If the case becomes damaged by external circumstance, any container with dimensions of at least 1.25 x 0.75 x 0.50 meters will suffice as a replacement until a new display case is available. The Ethics Committee recommends that any long-term storage case contain enough space for SCP-1370 to move freely. Level 2 personnel and higher may remove SCP-1370 from its case at their discretion, but will face disciplinary action for failing to secure it properly afterward.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1370 is a self-aware artificial being constructed from various electrical devices and tools. It stands approximately one meter in height and is capable of moving its articulated joints despite the lack of any power source or motors. SCP-1370 communicates in a monotone voice via a speaker mounted in its chest.\n\nIts head is a voltmeter soldered upside down to a neck joint, giving the\nappearance of a friendly smile, but containing no active sensory devices.\nHowever, SCP-1370 will react to visual and audible stimuli, and its ability to\ndo so is hampered when the head is covered or otherwise restrained. Its design\nappears to give more importance to aesthetic concern rather than function, as\nevidenced by a poor center of gravity that hampers its ability to balance and\nwalk. It is therefore believed that SCP-1370 was created as an art object and\nlater imbued with anomalous properties, rather than designed with those in\nmind.\n\nIt can currently speak fluent American English, French, and Latin, and is\ncapable of learning new languages. Other facets of its intellectual capacity\nhave not been clearly outlined as SCP-1370 is invariably hostile in all\ninteractions with any being or object it interprets to be sapient; this\nincludes but is not limited to animals, Foundation personnel, civilians,\naudio-visual equipment and security cameras.\n\nIf SCP-1370 encounters an object it believes to be sapient, it will attempt to\nengage the object in combat while introducing itself with a variety of\nelaborate titles which appear to be selected at random. Examples include\n_DoomBot 2000_, _RoboLord the Destructor_, _Prime Minister Sinister_ and\n_Darth Claw Killflex_. SCP-1370 will often include variations to these titles\nbased on responses it receives from personnel; Foundation staff have\nsuccessfully introduced _Patheticon the Garglemost_ and _PesterBot_ to its\nlexicon.\n\n**Addendum:** Many tests on SCP-1370's combat prowess have been run, each confirming that SCP-1370 lacks the physical aptitude to cause damage to any living being. Test 1370-8239 exposed SCP-1370 to a common houseplant with a speaker hidden in the plant's pot. After SCP-1370 was provoked verbally, it attempted to fold and twist the leaves of the plant within its grasp before incapacitating itself. See log that follows:\n\n&gt; _Researchers L. Allans and T. Bausoom carry SCP-1370's case into the testing\nchamber. The case is set down one meter from a potted philodendron fitted with\na small speaker._\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; **SCP-1370:** Release me, insects.
