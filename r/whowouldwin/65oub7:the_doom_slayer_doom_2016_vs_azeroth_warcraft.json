So priests are basically only going to be able to heal up anyone who manages to survive more than one hit against him, unlikely as that may be. \n\nFunnily, Doom Slayer is pretty close to the Dark Portal starting at Stormwind. If he cuts through Elwynn Forest and to Deadwind Pass, he'll end up in the Blasted Lands and be able to walk right into the Dark Portal. If he simply marches out of Azeroth into Outland, he's gonna have a field day. Since this is pre-WotLK but post TBC, or at the very least at essentially the end of the expansion, Outland is looking relatively okay right now. The first thing he'll be greeted by is a platoon of demons. All of whom will likely be shredded to different pieces by his arsenal. If warcraft heroes can kill them with melee weapons and exceptional martial skill, there's no way they survive Doom Slayer for long. He starts off in Hellfire Peninsula. There's plenty of standard demons here although both the Alliance and Horde have settlements in HFP so the demons are relatively well controlled at this point. He can take out both Thrallmar and Honor Hold with little problems. Really he'll basically make Outland his personal playground. The Broken are still getting their lives back together after being under Illidan's heel for so many years. Shattrath will quickly run into Doom Slayer's path which may actually get interesting. Naaru are very powerful beings but frankly, we have basically no information on what they can actually do in combat, if anything. They are basically just able to gift power to mortals and they fight in their stead. As much as people joke that Khadgar is a shit wizard, he is quite powerful as far as mortals go. That being said, this is before he gets his redesign and actually has all of his real feats. At this point, he's just an old man who happens to basically be the head of Shattrath. It is *possible* that he will have some way of at the least containing Doom Slayer. Though very unlikely. I'd give the fight between them a 9.8/10 for Doom Guy to blast him to bits with no real fight. Sadly, this will be the second time that Shattrath is bathed in blood, but at least this time it's only one person so the People of the city are likely to be able to escape pretty well. \n\nThis pretty much happens in most places since it is much more difficult to get word to Azeroth from Outland. It's possible a scout runs back out the Dark Portal and warns their respective factions but honestly, I don't think the Alliance or Horde will want to help out much. They basically abandoned Outland once Illidan was \"killed\" and I imagine they'd just command retreats from Outland and to come back to Azeroth. The only exception might be Garrosh, since that's actually his home and where he grew up. I figure he'd be too hotheaded and try to fight Doom Slayer and then we'd all be happier without him ever even getting a chance to be considered for Warchief. \n\nShadowmoon Valley, Zangarmarsh, Blade's Edge Mountain all get torn asunder by Doom Slayer. He blasts apart anything that moves and really there's probably not much that's gonna stop him. The only thing that could possibly pose a threat is ghosts of sorts in Auchindoun but I'm gonna guess he has something for them too. \n\nI left out Nagrand and the Netherstorm because I'm not positive how they'd all interact. Ethereals are really hard to judge since there's basically no info on them. Nothing concrete at least. We know they're beings of arcane energy but arcane is inherently weaker than Fel and Doom Slayer has gone up against literal hells of whom I'd imagine he met multiple beings that used something at least akin to Fel Magic against him and he came out fine. The Ethereals *might* have something they can do against him but it's really hard to put anything definitive down. Realistically Doom Guy turns them into arcane dust and brushes it all out of his face while it floats in the air. \n\nNagrand is a very specific case though. Nagrand is home to the Throne of the Elements and they're probably the most powerful beings left on Outland after TBC. This is a hard argument to have here but it's very possible that the elements might have something to hold him back. It's a real hard call though. The elements are basically the manifestations of the remnants of Titan creations so they're quite powerful. But they're still relatively weak as far as Warcraft beings go. They might form the entire nature of the planet but the stronger beings they came from got their asses handed to them by a Collective Hive mind of massive plant Behemoths so I'm not too sure that they have the firepower to keep down Doom Slayer. But I'll be real lenient and say it's only 7/10 for Doom Slayer to win because the Elements are powerful beings, even if the Outland ones are relatively weakened with all the damage sustained from Ner'zhul's opening of so many portals.\n\nBy this time, I think the the Azerothians would be working tirelessly to close the Dark Portal, trying to insure that this demon stayed in Outland forever. And they'd probably succeed. For Doom Slayer to clear the entire planet would take a while. It is a planet after all, fractured and damaged as it might be. So basically Doom Slayer spends his entire life just killing more demons, these ones are just much more persistent. He'll probably run into Kil'jaeden or Archimonde at some point, I imagine they'll be annoyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's get to what happens if Doom Slayer goes South. This is both better, and worse for the Alliance and worse for the Horde though that's not saying much. Starting at Stormwind means the alliance are getting hit **hard** right off the bat and the only Horde strongholds on the Eastern Kingdoms are very far North comparatively. Silvermoon City and the Undercity are past Ironforge so there's little reason for him not to stop there first and kill everyone before the Horde even raises an eyebrow at his March of Death. If he marches South, that means the Alliance has a lot of time to properly assemble an army together and figure out other plans to deal with him. This means that they aren't going to take as many casualties off the bat, but there are a few Alliance settlements in the South like Darkshire and Westfall. Both are super dead, no way they properly evacuate in time with the insane level of stamina Doom slayer has to run around. \n\nThe Horde start to care when he reaches Stranglethorn Vale. It's very likely Vol'jin will communicate with the Loa at some point during this and he's got a very tight connection to Bwomsamdi and he'll be happy at all these troll deaths but annoyed they weren't sacrifices. This will alert Vol'jin but by then, it might be too late. \n\nWhen he gets to Grom'gol, the Horde suffers their first casualties. They get annhilated, a small outpost like that doesn't stand a chance. The goblins are pissed because their Zeppelin service has been disrupted and they're making more gold, the Horde now have only one way to reach the very Southern Tip of the Eastern Kingdoms and that's really alarming for them. Thrall asks Vol'jin to send out scouts to see exactly what the hell happened there and they send a ship to Booty Bay from Ratchet. The Boat will take a while to get there and Doom Guy will surely already be there. The Goblins take massive casualties, a few of the greediest ones will take all their gold and scram but there's nothing but a path of devastation in Doom Guy's wake. Heroes of both the Horde and Alliance will fall there, further enraging the Alliance and making the Horde get serious. Luckily, this might be a break for both sides. Despite how many casualties they'll suffer, there's no where else on the Southern Eastern Kingdoms for Doom Guy. He'll either have to somehow navigate a boat across the sea and pray he doesn't get sucked up by the Malestrom or hold a goblin at ransom to sail for him but I don't imagine negotiation or threatening like that is much his style. \n\nHilariously, the easiest way for Azeroth to beat Doom guy is to hope he sucks at sea navigation and crashes into the Maelstrom. But that's not as much fun, let's say that he does miraculously navigate to Ratchet from Booty Bay. At this point Thrall has sent an envoy to the alliance to speak with Jaina Proudmoore. Relations are a bit strained after Outland but Jaina and Thrall both know that they'll need to combine forces for this. Thrall will know exactly the devastation wrought at Stormwind and he's not going to take any chances. He'll probably even give Sylvanas some more free reign to use dangerous weapons if it means stopping this demon. Doom Guy gets off at Ratchet, it's likely completely abandoned at this point, no way in hell the goblins are risking their lives when there's still so much coin to be gained. Thrall has called every leader together to ask them to fight a grand fight as one. Every race gathers together to fight another dangerous foe that threatens Azeroth itself. A begrudging truth between Alliance and Horde for the moment but they all rally at Orgrimmar, Zeppelins shoddily bringing over troops and Horde magi opening portals for the Alliance to funnel in. The Army of Azeroth waits at Orgrimmar, the faction leaders themselves taking to the fields to protect the only home most of them know. Thrall is enraged at Garrosh's death, the Alliance enraged over the loss of Stormwind and loss of holds across the Eastern Kingdoms. Doomguy comes face to face with an army of mortals bigger than any demons' army he's faced. At this point, it'll play out like the original scenario. *Someone* will find a way to at least contain him, the elements will give Thrall their full might, Jaina will have the Council of Six aiding her with magical rituals and spells and all the classes will try everything they have to stop him. It'll work, but this scenario definitely has hundreds of casualties as well.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I figured he would have something against that but didn&amp;#39;t want to make assumptions.

Sadly, this will be the second time that Shattrath is bathed in blood, but at least this time it&amp;#39;s only one person so the People of the city are likely to be able to escape pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This pretty much happens in most places since it is much more difficult to get word to Azeroth from Outland. It&amp;#39;s possible a scout runs back out the Dark Portal and warns their respective factions but honestly, I don&amp;#39;t think the Alliance or Horde will want to help out much. They basically abandoned Outland once Illidan was &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; and I imagine they&amp;#39;d just command retreats from Outland and to come back to Azeroth. The only exception might be Garrosh, since that&amp;#39;s actually his home and where he grew up. I figure he&amp;#39;d be too hotheaded and try to fight Doom Slayer and then we&amp;#39;d all be happier without him ever even getting a chance to be considered for Warchief. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shadowmoon Valley, Zangarmarsh, Blade&amp;#39;s Edge Mountain all get torn asunder by Doom Slayer. He blasts apart anything that moves and really there&amp;#39;s probably not much that&amp;#39;s gonna stop him. The only thing that could possibly pose a threat is ghosts of sorts in Auchindoun but I&amp;#39;m gonna guess he has something for them too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left out Nagrand and the Netherstorm because I&amp;#39;m not positive how they&amp;#39;d all interact. Ethereals are really hard to judge since there&amp;#39;s basically no info on them. Nothing concrete at least. We know they&amp;#39;re beings of arcane energy but arcane is inherently weaker than Fel and Doom Slayer has gone up against literal hells of whom I&amp;#39;d imagine he met multiple beings that used something at least akin to Fel Magic against him and he came out fine. The Ethereals &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have something they can do against him but it&amp;#39;s really hard to put anything definitive down. Realistically Doom Guy turns them into arcane dust and brushes it all out of his face while it floats in the air. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nagrand is a very specific case though. Nagrand is home to the Throne of the Elements and they&amp;#39;re probably the most powerful beings left on Outland after TBC. This is a hard argument to have here but it&amp;#39;s very possible that the elements might have something to hold him back. It&amp;#39;s a real hard call though. The elements are basically the manifestations of the remnants of Titan creations so they&amp;#39;re quite powerful. But they&amp;#39;re still relatively weak as far as Warcraft beings go. They might form the entire nature of the planet but the stronger beings they came from got their asses handed to them by a Collective Hive mind of massive plant Behemoths so I&amp;#39;m not too sure that they have the firepower to keep down Doom Slayer. But I&amp;#39;ll be real lenient and say it&amp;#39;s only 7/10 for Doom Slayer to win because the Elements are powerful beings, even if the Outland ones are relatively weakened with all the damage sustained from Ner&amp;#39;zhul&amp;#39;s opening of so many portals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this time, I think the the Azerothians would be working tirelessly to close the Dark Portal, trying to insure that this demon stayed in Outland forever. And they&amp;#39;d probably succeed. For Doom Slayer to clear the entire planet would take a while. It is a planet after all, fractured and damaged as it might be. So basically Doom Slayer spends his entire life just killing more demons, these ones are just much more persistent. He&amp;#39;ll probably run into Kil&amp;#39;jaeden or Archimonde at some point, I imagine they&amp;#39;ll be annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s get to what happens if Doom Slayer goes South. This is both better, and worse for the Alliance and worse for the Horde though that&amp;#39;s not saying much. Starting at Stormwind means the alliance are getting hit &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; right off the bat and the only Horde strongholds on the Eastern Kingdoms are very far North comparatively. Silvermoon City and the Undercity are past Ironforge so there&amp;#39;s little reason for him not to stop there first and kill everyone before the Horde even raises an eyebrow at his March of Death. If he marches South, that means the Alliance has a lot of time to properly assemble an army together and figure out other plans to deal with him. This means that they aren&amp;#39;t going to take as many casualties off the bat, but there are a few Alliance settlements in the South like Darkshire and Westfall. Both are super dead, no way they properly evacuate in time with the insane level of stamina Doom slayer has to run around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Horde start to care when he reaches Stranglethorn Vale. It&amp;#39;s very likely Vol&amp;#39;jin will communicate with the Loa at some point during this and he&amp;#39;s got a very tight connection to Bwomsamdi and he&amp;#39;ll be happy at all these troll deaths but annoyed they weren&amp;#39;t sacrifices. This will alert Vol&amp;#39;jin but by then, it might be too late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he gets to Grom&amp;#39;gol, the Horde suffers their first casualties. They get annhilated, a small outpost like that doesn&amp;#39;t stand a chance. The goblins are pissed because their Zeppelin service has been disrupted and they&amp;#39;re making more gold, the Horde now have only one way to reach the very Southern Tip of the Eastern Kingdoms and that&amp;#39;s really alarming for them. Thrall asks Vol&amp;#39;jin to send out scouts to see exactly what the hell happened there and they send a ship to Booty Bay from Ratchet. The Boat will take a while to get there and Doom Guy will surely already be there. The Goblins take massive casualties, a few of the greediest ones will take all their gold and scram but there&amp;#39;s nothing but a path of devastation in Doom Guy&amp;#39;s wake. Heroes of both the Horde and Alliance will fall there, further enraging the Alliance and making the Horde get serious. Luckily, this might be a break for both sides. Despite how many casualties they&amp;#39;ll suffer, there&amp;#39;s no where else on the Southern Eastern Kingdoms for Doom Guy. He&amp;#39;ll either have to somehow navigate a boat across the sea and pray he doesn&amp;#39;t get sucked up by the Malestrom or hold a goblin at ransom to sail for him but I don&amp;#39;t imagine negotiation or threatening like that is much his style. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hilariously, the easiest way for Azeroth to beat Doom guy is to hope he sucks at sea navigation and crashes into the Maelstrom. But that&amp;#39;s not as much fun, let&amp;#39;s say that he does miraculously navigate to Ratchet from Booty Bay. At this point Thrall has sent an envoy to the alliance to speak with Jaina Proudmoore. Relations are a bit strained after Outland but Jaina and Thrall both know that they&amp;#39;ll need to combine forces for this. Thrall will know exactly the devastation wrought at Stormwind and he&amp;#39;s not going to take any chances. He&amp;#39;ll probably even give Sylvanas some more free reign to use dangerous weapons if it means stopping this demon. Doom Guy gets off at Ratchet, it&amp;#39;s likely completely abandoned at this point, no way in hell the goblins are risking their lives when there&amp;#39;s still so much coin to be gained. Thrall has called every leader together to ask them to fight a grand fight as one. Every race gathers together to fight another dangerous foe that threatens Azeroth itself. A begrudging truth between Alliance and Horde for the moment but they all rally at Orgrimmar, Zeppelins shoddily bringing over troops and Horde magi opening portals for the Alliance to funnel in. The Army of Azeroth waits at Orgrimmar, the faction leaders themselves taking to the fields to protect the only home most of them know. Thrall is enraged at Garrosh&amp;#39;s death, the Alliance enraged over the loss of Stormwind and loss of holds across the Eastern Kingdoms. Doomguy comes face to face with an army of mortals bigger than any demons&amp;#39; army he&amp;#39;s faced. At this point, it&amp;#39;ll play out like the original scenario. &lt;em&gt;Someone&lt;/em&gt; will find a way to at least contain him, the elements will give Thrall their full might, Jaina will have the Council of Six aiding her with magical rituals and spells and all the classes will try everything they have to stop him. It&amp;#39;ll work, but this scenario definitely has hundreds of casualties as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgcv5is", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419589.0, "created_utc": 1492390789.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrvua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wakka2462", "parent_id": "t1_dgce0c9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Be it shadow priests managing to manipulate his mind (not sure if he has feats against any of this)\n\nHe is immune to possession.

But, eventually someone would find a spell that'd work against him. Be it shadow priests managing to manipulate his mind (not sure if he has feats against any of this), mages polymorphing him, shamans hexing him, warlocks draining his very life force etc. Someone would eventually be powerful enough to at least stop him long enough to be able to at the very least, keep him contained.
