If they really need to pick up the pace, they can drop to all fours and start leaping and pouncing. Canon Alien has no numerical numbers of their speed, but a citation from AVP states they run comfortably at 30 mph and sprint at 60 mph.\n\nPredators like to stay high up. (High ground! Predators win!^^/s) In the Jungle, they'll swing and leap from tree to tree, and they have enough grip strength to stay on them. I would say both Aliens and Predators move considerably faster than normal humans in the Jungle.\n\n&gt;Prioritization is also a concern: who will attack whom first. The biggest conundrum I find is whether or not the Predators will focus on killing the Xenos or hunting down Chief first.\n\nThis *is* a tough question. Although not the case for main continuities, in AVP Predators deem Aliens as the ultimate trophies. Chief's SPARTAN armor will definitely be an eye-catcher for the Predators. If Chief fends off the first wave of Xenomorphs, the Predators are going to start harassing him. Does Chief have a way to bypass the Predators' cloaking ability? If so, then I'd say the Predators are in big trouble. For one, a Xenomorph Queen is an incredibly challenging foe for the Predators. They're going to need all four to down her. If they keep splitting up to see who can get Chief, they're in for some pain.\n\nStandard Predator loadouts are just Wristblades and Plasma Caster. You can add the Smart Disc if you'd like, but the Combi Stick is a straight sidegrade to Wristblades so...one or the other. Wristblades and Combi Stick are decent melee weapons, though I prefer Wristblades because they're easier to use and just as efficient. There's a variety of Plasma Casters. The Jungle Hunter had a Plasma Caster that could be charged, giving it near artillery-level explosive power. Normally, the JH's Plasma Caster is still pretty strong, putting a basketball sized hole in a man. Only antifeat is that Arnie took a shot to the shoulder, so maybe the other shots were charged a bit more.  The City Hunter had a Plasma Gauntlet. It was a lot weaker than the Caster, but was fast and great against humans. Failed to go through a Kevlar vest though. Then there's the Plasma-Gatler - basically a burst-machine gun type of Caster. Doesn't charge, but obviously has superior rate of fire. Smart Disc is stupidly sharp. It can cut through a ton and is just about as good at lopping off limbs as the guys from *Spamalot*.\n\n10 Aliens, I guess 5 active facehuggers and a Queen that will provide more and more facehuggers. The Aliens would probably try starting off by slowly picking off group members one by one without raising too much worry. 2 adults would probably be left to protect the Queen. Picking them off will probably be harder than usual, since Chief can set up some defense perimeters and traps. What matters is that the Aliens are taking more humans than they're losing. If they do that, then later on they could swarm the town and kill everybody. Aliens are unbelievably strong, so if they're not focused on him, and the town is unarmed or has civilian grade weapons, Chief is going to be hard pressed to protect 50 without some careful planning. Xenomorphs can easily ragdoll grown men without losing mobility and have no problem with weapons that don't surpass the raw firepower the Marines had.\n\n&gt;I'm not familiar with Yautja hunting tactics so this is a big unknown for me\n\nFrom what I've seen, Predators are glory hounds. If *Predators* is anything to go by, they'll split up so that they can claim more kills. They'd probably have 2 on Chief, and the other 2 would go separate ways to hunt for Aliens. The thing is, with only 4 here, losing anybody could be bad for them. Predators can take a lot of punishment but are so, so bad at tolerating getting shot, cut or punctured - things Chief and the Aliens will excel in doing to them if given the chance.\n\nI'm not gonna say any verdict. For me, it could go to any side, unless Chief has a way to nullify the Predators' cloaking in which I'd say Chief takes the highest amount of victories, Aliens are in the middle and Predators have the lowest amount of victories.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiya hiya.

If so, then I&amp;#39;d say the Predators are in big trouble. For one, a Xenomorph Queen is an incredibly challenging foe for the Predators. They&amp;#39;re going to need all four to down her. If they keep splitting up to see who can get Chief, they&amp;#39;re in for some pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standard Predator loadouts are just Wristblades and Plasma Caster. You can add the Smart Disc if you&amp;#39;d like, but the Combi Stick is a straight sidegrade to Wristblades so...one or the other. Wristblades and Combi Stick are decent melee weapons, though I prefer Wristblades because they&amp;#39;re easier to use and just as efficient. There&amp;#39;s a variety of Plasma Casters. The Jungle Hunter had a Plasma Caster that could be charged, giving it near artillery-level explosive power. Normally, the JH&amp;#39;s Plasma Caster is still pretty strong, putting a basketball sized hole in a man. Only antifeat is that Arnie took a shot to the shoulder, so maybe the other shots were charged a bit more.  The City Hunter had a Plasma Gauntlet. It was a lot weaker than the Caster, but was fast and great against humans. Failed to go through a Kevlar vest though. Then there&amp;#39;s the Plasma-Gatler - basically a burst-machine gun type of Caster. Doesn&amp;#39;t charge, but obviously has superior rate of fire. Smart Disc is stupidly sharp. It can cut through a ton and is just about as good at lopping off limbs as the guys from &lt;em&gt;Spamalot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Aliens, I guess 5 active facehuggers and a Queen that will provide more and more facehuggers. The Aliens would probably try starting off by slowly picking off group members one by one without raising too much worry. 2 adults would probably be left to protect the Queen. Picking them off will probably be harder than usual, since Chief can set up some defense perimeters and traps. What matters is that the Aliens are taking more humans than they&amp;#39;re losing. If they do that, then later on they could swarm the town and kill everybody. Aliens are unbelievably strong, so if they&amp;#39;re not focused on him, and the town is unarmed or has civilian grade weapons, Chief is going to be hard pressed to protect 50 without some careful planning. Xenomorphs can easily ragdoll grown men without losing mobility and have no problem with weapons that don&amp;#39;t surpass the raw firepower the Marines had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not familiar with Yautja hunting tactics so this is a big unknown for me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;#39;ve seen, Predators are glory hounds. If &lt;em&gt;Predators&lt;/em&gt; is anything to go by, they&amp;#39;ll split up so that they can claim more kills. They&amp;#39;d probably have 2 on Chief, and the other 2 would go separate ways to hunt for Aliens. The thing is, with only 4 here, losing anybody could be bad for them. Predators can take a lot of punishment but are so, so bad at tolerating getting shot, cut or punctured - things Chief and the Aliens will excel in doing to them if given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna say any verdict. For me, it could go to any side, unless Chief has a way to nullify the Predators&amp;#39; cloaking in which I&amp;#39;d say Chief takes the highest amount of victories, Aliens are in the middle and Predators have the lowest amount of victories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgang8v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292431.0, "created_utc": 1492263631.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgazi07", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "8fenristhewolf8", "parent_id": "t1_dgaesxv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I'm assuming of course you just meant the weapons and not the whole kit.\n\nYes, just weapons.\n\n&gt; Now, let's talk about the town itself.

With the cooling gel-layer and metal plates of his armor, I would say Chief might be very difficult to spot for Predators because his heat signature doesn't bleed through the armor. If it doesn't, this becomes a very interesting hunt, as neither party can see each other.\n\nNow for the Xenos. Ten Xenos in a small town with little defense is a goddamn massacre. Chief will have to get there quick if he has any chance of saving the town.

Honestly, this may have to end in a draw. \n\nChief and Preds make their respective ways to town. Yautja are highly competetive so they'd likely go towards the place with most potential trophies first. However, it is dishonorable to attack something that cannot defend itself, and downright heresy to kill unworthy foes.

Cortana would know they were there before Chief even suspects it. But I'm assuming he doesn't have her. So Chief will take a plasma hit before ducking down and opening fire to where the first plasma shot came from, and kill a Pred. Once he sees they have cloaking devices, this becomes much more even. Then the Xenos begin to attack again. Chief's best chance is to funnel the Xenos towards the Predators and start an all out battle between the two Aliens, evacuating citizens while they duke it out. I'd say at this point, we're down to one Pred, four Xenos, and about 60-70 citizens. But if Chief does a successful brief evacuation, then the citizens should have about 30-35 in relative safety in the jungle.\n\nThis gives Chief a huge step up in tactical advantage, as the Xenos will go straight for the citizens and he can co-ordinate where exactly their attacks are coming from. Killing a Xeno or two wouldn't be much of a problem for Chief. In fact, if he's quick enough, he might even kill the remaining first wave of Xenos. \n\nNow its a hunt for the Queen. The remaining Predator watches Chief and lets him follow the breadcrumbs to the Queen, who is the ultimate prize in Yautja culture. The Pred follows Chief into the nest. Now the Xenos are on defense mode. I'd say they have some pretty substantial numbers in the nest by now, maybe 15-20 recently matured Xenos, so the Chief and Pred may have to use each other to even stand a chance. \n\nKilling the eggs is a sure-fire way to piss a Queen off, so thats what Chief does. Once the Queen rips herself from the nest, she comes straight for the intruders, and the Predator is counting on it. Chief can't do much against the Queen with a standard loadout, so running is his best option now.\n\nPred does the same, but not before a couple traps get set off and briefly immobilize or distract Queeny.

Tricking the Queen by winding through the caves is Chief's best bet, and he escapes before the bomb goes off, killing any remaining Xenos, Queens, and Eggs.\n\nChief's hardest day on the Job comes to a close when he mercy-kills the Predator who is so wounded and showered in acid that its just plain gross.

The town foolishly believe there were two heroes that saved them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Chief wins, but after dealing with some delightful bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgalm4n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492288720.0, "created_utc": 1492259920.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbatf7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Maggruber", "parent_id": "t1_dgaylpc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Fear the mighty M6D!](http://i.imgur.com/UZ415fq.jpg)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/UZ415fq.jpg\"&gt;Fear the mighty M6D!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgbatf7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492325501.0, "created_utc": 1492296701.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaylpc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ColdBeef", "parent_id": "t3_65hl7b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If Chief gets the magnum from Halo 1 he solos.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Chief gets the magnum from Halo 1 he solos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgaylpc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492308664.0, "created_utc": 1492279864.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbm61w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Maggruber", "parent_id": "t1_dgbkqc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Master Chief defeated the Didact who overpowered restraints made out of hardlight that's durable enough to protect Chief from a nuke he detonated in his hands.\n\nThat's some...interesting powerscaling.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Master Chief defeated the Didact who overpowered restraints made out of hardlight that&amp;#39;s durable enough to protect Chief from a nuke he detonated in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s some...interesting powerscaling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dgbm61w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492341942.0, "created_utc": 1492313142.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hl7b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkouq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MonteDoa", "parent_id": "t1_dgdax3k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I think Chief wins too, but not because of the didact fight.
