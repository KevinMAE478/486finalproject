The Orks upon seeing such crazy strength will pretty much hail Saitama as their new king/ War Boss. No contest, Saitama takes this round.\n\nRound 2- Pretty much the same conclusion Saitama either goes planet buster mode of figure out where the hive mind is using his insane speed. Saitama is capable of traveling from the moon to earth in about a second, that is when Saitama was using his strength conservatively to prevent destroying Earth when landing. Which means that his true speed is unknown at the moment but nothing less than 384,400km per second; to put in perspective speed of light is 299,792km per second. No contest, Saitama wins.\n\nRound 3- Saitama might lose here if Tau manages to somehow trick Saitama into attacking a space fleet and somehow traps Saitama in vaccum. As Saitama isn't capable of flight, losing momentum and getting trapped in space is a very real threat to Saitama. Other than that I'm not sure if there is any other way Tau can hurt Saitama. Due to Saitama's strength and speed, he'd probably travel as fast as Tau's lasers and one shot just about any spacecraft Tau throws at him.\n\nRound 4- I am not certain about what the wrap is capable, but in my opinion most of the warp is filled with Daemon which again is nothing to Saitama. The only one that would even catch Saitama's attention would be a Bloodthirstier. Even then Saitama would be able to one punch it. Bloodthirstier's speed is no match when compared to Saitama. No way he can hurt Saitama in a physical sense. The only other weapon The Warp has against Saitama is their psykers/ corruption.
