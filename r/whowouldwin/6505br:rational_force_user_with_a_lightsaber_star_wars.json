And the people involved in the past just took control of giant hives as sorta work forces and force power amplifiers..... but then Darth Krayt and Luke were the ones who handled that problem. Which is important to note as we only got 3 or 4 books of full Caedus, but based upon what it took to take him down he was int he same ballpark as the abomination he unwittingly unleashed which fought what were almost certainly the strongest Jedi (prime Luke) and the sith who totally shat on Caedus's plotline (it's a long story, but basically the last book or two of that plotline was painful as they were struggling with writing several major characters all of a sudden, presumably because they were suddely stuck setting up what was planned to be a series bigger than NJO while also making it so an on-going comic series about another Caedus-like dude set 100 years in the future didnt' have major problems).\n\nAnyways, I guess if you want to understand Caedus's feats it's a bit tricky because he's Jacen then later Caedus and the limitations on his powers were often based upon his own choices. Like, he did crazy illusions and probably could ahve illusioned up an entire battle fleet, but he had his own damn battle fleet so no need. He developed his own version of battle mediation/melding where he didn't use the Empire's subjugation precisely but rather he used teh more direct sith techniques to fuck up enemy forces while using something halfway between the jedi meld and battle meditation on his own forces. Most major force feats are either incredibly refined or massively powerful and both are generally enhanced by local force nexuses and what not, but Jacen/Caedus was so in-tune with the force he didn't need such things really (technically he's in-tune with the living force, but it was kinda like he himself became a force nexus with how much power he theoretically could call upon). Like the final result was Luke had to use all his power form afar just to try to block prescience, force sensing, etc. as much as possible from Jacen/Caedus (who was conflicted and thus even weaker as he coudln't decide how to use his powers which may have allowed him a way out) while his sister Jaina Solo with the force-influenced title of \"Sword of the Jedi\" who trained with Boba Fett and the Mandalorians just to have a chance agianst a Caedus who had been weakened by Luke.\n\nBasically, the problem is that the last few books went heavily into the facets and history of the force and what it actually is and shit which meant not coming up with retarded bullshit like Sidious's random wormholes (that was a dark age of Star Wars indeed).... super weapons also mostly take a back seat except as moral dilemnas.... it's an overall mor emature and pretty nice change and being continued in the new Disneyverse but I've only read a few books in that and am still watching Rebels and TCW.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, we don&amp;#39;t actually know how strong caedus and luke were by the end, but Caedus&amp;#39;s fall to the dark side was basically the full power of the skywalker bloodline on display - the timeline gets tricky here, but the last time such a huge shift in the force happened was at least 20,000bby as that&amp;#39;s the latest the Killiks were on Alderaan and it may have been 100,000bby last when such an event happened (which is old enough we don&amp;#39;t actually know much). And the people involved in the past just took control of giant hives as sorta work forces and force power amplifiers..... but then Darth Krayt and Luke were the ones who handled that problem. Which is important to note as we only got 3 or 4 books of full Caedus, but based upon what it took to take him down he was int he same ballpark as the abomination he unwittingly unleashed which fought what were almost certainly the strongest Jedi (prime Luke) and the sith who totally shat on Caedus&amp;#39;s plotline (it&amp;#39;s a long story, but basically the last book or two of that plotline was painful as they were struggling with writing several major characters all of a sudden, presumably because they were suddely stuck setting up what was planned to be a series bigger than NJO while also making it so an on-going comic series about another Caedus-like dude set 100 years in the future didnt&amp;#39; have major problems).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I guess if you want to understand Caedus&amp;#39;s feats it&amp;#39;s a bit tricky because he&amp;#39;s Jacen then later Caedus and the limitations on his powers were often based upon his own choices. Like, he did crazy illusions and probably could ahve illusioned up an entire battle fleet, but he had his own damn battle fleet so no need. He developed his own version of battle mediation/melding where he didn&amp;#39;t use the Empire&amp;#39;s subjugation precisely but rather he used teh more direct sith techniques to fuck up enemy forces while using something halfway between the jedi meld and battle meditation on his own forces. Most major force feats are either incredibly refined or massively powerful and both are generally enhanced by local force nexuses and what not, but Jacen/Caedus was so in-tune with the force he didn&amp;#39;t need such things really (technically he&amp;#39;s in-tune with the living force, but it was kinda like he himself became a force nexus with how much power he theoretically could call upon). Like the final result was Luke had to use all his power form afar just to try to block prescience, force sensing, etc. as much as possible from Jacen/Caedus (who was conflicted and thus even weaker as he coudln&amp;#39;t decide how to use his powers which may have allowed him a way out) while his sister Jaina Solo with the force-influenced title of &amp;quot;Sword of the Jedi&amp;quot; who trained with Boba Fett and the Mandalorians just to have a chance agianst a Caedus who had been weakened by Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, the problem is that the last few books went heavily into the facets and history of the force and what it actually is and shit which meant not coming up with retarded bullshit like Sidious&amp;#39;s random wormholes (that was a dark age of Star Wars indeed).... super weapons also mostly take a back seat except as moral dilemnas.... it&amp;#39;s an overall mor emature and pretty nice change and being continued in the new Disneyverse but I&amp;#39;ve only read a few books in that and am still watching Rebels and TCW.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg7a76b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492097389.0, "created_utc": 1492068589.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7604g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blue_waffle_eater", "parent_id": "t1_dg74x54", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As someone with little knowledge of Star Wars beyond the movies, what in particular are Caedus's OP feats/why is he so far above Palpatine?
