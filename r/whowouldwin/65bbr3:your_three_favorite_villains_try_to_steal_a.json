That ends now though my dear.\" Lysandre Mega Evolves Gyarados to renew the fight. Pyrrha now decides that she should start using her Semblance and makes Gyarados fly into Lysandre.

Pyrrha looks back and sees that Lysandre and Gyarados are both gone.\n\nLink and Ganondorf are both still fighting when Link get a strike in on him.

Sombra appears behind him and knocks him out. Ren tries to use his Semblance (Invisibility) and disappears out of Honchkrow&amp;#39;s view. Honchkrow throws feathers in a wide berk hoping to hit Ren. Mienshao and Nora are countering and attacking each other when she gets hit by the Pokemon in her swinging arm. Her arm goes limp, and she drops the hammer. Mienshao moves in and uses Swords dance as it walks up. It jumps, almost hitting the roof of the building, and brings down its knee. Ren unstealthed and shoots Mienshao as it comes down and knocks it off course. Mienshao crashes and is fainted. Honchkrow takes this moment to use Retaliate and also Super Luck activates. Ren is knocked down, and Nora is left standing against Honchkrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jaune is still fighting against Pyroar when it uses Fire Blast. The shield goes flying and Jaune is left without a defense. Jaune takes this opportunity to attack the Pyroar with all he has. The Pyroar jumps out of the way and hits him with a Hyper Voice. Jaune goes flying into a wall. but gets back up. Pyroar uses Hyper Voice again, and Jaune goes flying through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pyrrha has done serious damage to Gyarados, but Lysandre appears next to him. &amp;quot;Well now my dear it seems you are  stronger than I first anticipated. That ends now though my dear.&amp;quot; Lysandre Mega Evolves Gyarados to renew the fight. Pyrrha now decides that she should start using her Semblance and makes Gyarados fly into Lysandre. Pyrrha runs to help Nora, but Honchkrow is nowhere to be seen. Pyrrha looks back and sees that Lysandre and Gyarados are both gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link and Ganondorf are both still fighting when Link get a strike in on him. Ganondorf falls and Link prepares a thrust into his head, when a shot rings out. Widowmaker has shot the sword out of his hands. Ganondorf uses this opportunity to slam Link into walls till all of his Fairies are gone. Then he punches him through a wall so that he&amp;#39;s down for good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Widowmaker and Ganondorf move into the main room and find Sombra already there. She hacks open the laser grid and Ganondorf punches through the glass and grabs the Diamond. Pyrrha and Nora jump down to stop the 3 of them. Ganondorf decides to go Full Gannon mode to deal with them while Widow and Sombra escape. They head back to the Shipping Depot and grab Reaper. Lysandre is already there and the 3 of them leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jaune and Link get up and Fight off Ganon. Then they chase after the truck. The truck however is already long gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "name": "t1_dg9lngi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492226150.0, "created_utc": 1492197350.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bbr3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgap1qd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheWTFuser", "parent_id": "t3_65bbr3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Favourite villains:\nSentry\nThanos\nSuperboy prime\n\nHeroes:\nGoku \nSaitama \nCaptain America \n\nVillains blitz.
