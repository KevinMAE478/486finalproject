Even though CP9 are supersonic by scaling, Korosensei's speed is basically toonforce level.

Blueno's doors give him an enormous advantage in terms of spying on and ambushing people.  The others might have to rely on taking Class 3E hostage in order to force Korosensei into a corner, but, being both ruthless and comfortably superhuman, they probably wouldn't have any trouble with that.
