His strength is roughly equal to MCU Thor's, as shown in the deleted fight scene from Avengers AoU where the two fought after Vision's \"birth.\" Superman has been knocked around by high-caliber bullets and falling debris and he was knocked unconscious when the oil rig tower collapsed on him early in MoS, so, despite his great durability, there are limits to how much punishment he can take. \n\nVision's body is partially Vibranium and can tank a city bus kicked by Giant Man without budging. He also took a hit from Mjolnir upside the head and bounced back to his feet within seconds in the previously-mentioned AoU fight scene. Assuming Vision's body is equal in durability to Ultron's Vibranium-reinforced body, as they're both composed largely of the same material, his body should be able to take physical hits on par with a hit from Mjolnir, previously shown to be true, and a punch from Hulk. Vision's durability is aided considerably by his ability to phase through attacks, as nothing in Clark's arsenal should be able to touch him. The only thing that Vision hasn't been able to phase through was Hawkeye's force field trap and that only slowed him down for a few seconds.\n\nThe biggest mark against Superman, IMO, is his lack of experience. He's not a smart fighter nor is he especially skilled. When Batman dropped a smoke canister on the rooftop to set up the Kryptonite gas grenade attack in BvS, Superman used his super speed to pass through the smoke cloud instead of using his X-ray vision to see through it, which probably would have kept him out of harm's way if he had the sense to try. He also got hit by the same slow gas grenade attack again later in the fight, deciding to blindly charge Batman instead of doing just about anything else. Given how much time Batman had to slowly reload his grenade launcher for the attack, Clark really should have seen that one coming...\n\nSpeaking of a lack of experience, there are times when Clark takes hits that he should have been able to dodge with his power set. The gas grenades for one, plus all the times he gets shot in MoS, whether that be bullets or a shot from one of Zod's ships that he just stands still and takes. An egregious example is when he gets hit by the thrown locomotive during the Smallville fight, because there was plenty of time to super speed out of the way or to fly up and catch it, or to do anything other than just stand still like a deer in headlights and get hit but that's exactly what happens.\n\nIn a nutshell, Vision should win because he has the strength to hurt Clark and the ablity to avoid all of his attacks virtually at will.
