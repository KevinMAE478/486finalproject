As far as Mass Effect Andromeda, there are 3 SAM units (a Turian, human, and Asari with a disassembled Salarian one probably able to be rebuilt). They are built with little actual power and multiple blocks on programming. Each SAM has the processing power of a quantum computer and do learn and research in closed databases but their only way of action is through recommendations. A SAM has no corporeal form and no way to physically interface with the world. Each is bound to an implant which essentially acts as a Bluetooth headset. By default, it allows the SAM to message/advise an implanted person via quantum entanglement and receive sensory input from the person like sight, sound, touch, taste, etc. The implant can be overridden by a person to allow the SAM to control other functions such vitals assuming other implants/devices that affect those qualities are present.

That gives us 200 years of planning with an artificial mind way smarter than any of us to come up with a solution to the reaper problem.\n\nI normally hate this phrase, but in this case it seems relevant, GG-EZ. \n\nUnless we run into the very real problem of creating a [\"Paperclip Maximizer\"](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer), I have absolutely no doubt that within 300 years our level of technological advancement will be well past that of the Reaper invasion.  And, if we include the prompt, we have a varying number of people across the globe calling for unification, which would definitely tip the scales in our favor in that regard.\n\nLook at the lore of Mass Effect. The Reapers were invented for the sole reason of preventing A.I., and here we are inventing it at least a good 200 years ahead of time. Yes, they steal the most advanced technology of each species they wipe out, but they also ensure that they travel down the same evolutionary tree technology wise by offering the citadel and other forms of Reaper tech. And again, they make a point to arrive just before A.I. pops up, so we will be one of the few races to have this advantage against them. Perhaps the only one.\n\nI honestly don't think they're capable of going up against a civilization with 200 years of ASI powered advancement. Imagine if everyone on Earth had a SAM implant, making them several thousand times smarter than they were initially? *And* we're given 200 hundred years of advancement? ***And*** we know they're coming?\n\nThat's not to mention the fact that, if we go off of the \"Green Explosion\" ending of Mass Effect 3, if we infuse ourselves with this technology, as leading AI expert Ray Kurzweil believes we will, we'd have already won. Apparently fusing with our technology is all we have to do for the Reapers to say, \"Oh, well, I guess the robot uprising isn't happening. Carry on then.\"\n\nEven if they do decide to go forward with the invasion, I don't think their biggest weapon, indoctrination, would work on us. Look at the Geth. The Geth that allied with the Reapers didn't do so because they were indoctrinated, they did so because they were bribed with a Dyson Sphere. This leads me to believe that AI don't have to worry about indoctrination. If we all have fused with our own AIs, I believe this would be enough to protect us.\n\nThen they just have conventional warfare on their side. And, if you look at the Reapers feats, they aren't *too* impressive. They use conventional lasers, and can be damaged by the same. Also, if a Thresher Maw could bring a Reaper down, I'm pretty sure we would be able to come up with something far more impressive given this head start.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why we wouldn't just be able to hack into them, like SAM can with Remnant technology. I imagine the most likely scenario is we would just make our own version of The Catalyst, giving us the Control or Destruction ending. We know their technology isn't too far ahead of our own, we were able to backwards engineer it to create EDI, and the Protheans were able to overwrite their signalling process to trigger the Citadel's mass relay, which is what gave us our fair start in the games.\n\n***Even if*** everything goes their way, I still don't think we'd be totally wiped out. We could simply download the consciousness of all of humanity into a few probes, and send them out into the far reaches of space to wait out the invasion and start rebuilding as soon as the Reapers have had their fun. We know this could work because in the \"bad\" Mass Effect 3 ending, Liara does the exact same thing with her probes, the ones that warn the next, upcoming generation of species about the Reapers.\n\ntl;dr: If we don't kill each other before inventing AI, (which each of these rounds would help with) and if we don't accidentally create an AI which completely wipes us out (in which case the Reapers are the least of our worries) then I have no doubt we could single-handedly solo the Reapers using human tech alone within this timeframe.
