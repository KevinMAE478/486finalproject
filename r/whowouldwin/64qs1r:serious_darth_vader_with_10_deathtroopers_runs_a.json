Even a standard squad can field a wide variety of weapons that can easily curbstorm Vader and his retinue.\n\nRound 1: Grenade isn't a mandatory equipment for Guardsmen, so the possibility of Vader ending the fight before it starts is eliminated. One sergeant wielding bolt pistol along with 9 Cadians operating heavy mounted Bolters firing from multiple directions would end the fight fairly quickly. The Guardsmen suffer some casualty due to Vader force choking, but it is impossible for an adult human to die quickly enough from suffocation to completely wipe out the Cadians before they open fire. Vader, tries as he might, will not be able to safely deflect bolt rounds, they would explode upon contact with the Lightsaber, grievously wounding or killing Vader. Deathtroopers may attempt to take cover, but no cover in a forest would be able to withstand constant explosions.\n\nRound 2: Catachan Jungle Fighters are masters of guerrilla warfare and espionage. They can ambush Vader, or simply use 9 men and the Sentinel to confront Vader as a distraction, meanwhile a single Catachan infiltrate behind the line and catch the entire enemy force off-guard with a meltagun. No armor can withstand the heat that reaches tens of thousands of degree centigrade.\n\nRound 3: Same as round one. Hellguns that Kasrkin often use fire too rapidly for even Vader to deflect effectively. Ordinary Lasguns are capable of tearing limbs apart, Hellguns are even stronger than that. 10 Kasrkin would be able to complete devastate Vader's force as soon as they are in sight.\n\nRound 4: Ogryns are incapable of using any kind of tactics more complex than \"smash 'em until they stop moving\", even with a bonehead. So Vader can win this round, Ogryns often just use their guns to smash enemies instead of using them as intended.\n\nRound 5: Same as round 1, except minimally better, because Yarrick is there to command the force.\n\nRound 6: Vader wins, most definitely. Chenkov is a incompetent hack whose only tactic is to drown the enemy with men until the problem goes away. He can't attempt that here, because he has only 40 men. The Valhallan Ice Warrior are only effective when deployed in massive number, like the Soviet Red Army in the early stage of WWII. 40 would not even be able to fight back the Deathtroopers.
