Will go and take another look at RAM with that in mind, thanks for the tip! I&amp;#39;d originally picked out 8GB but then my eye was taken by the 16GB for only \u00a320 extra, but I didn&amp;#39;t really consider speed. I just saw a bigger number and got excited, oops :)\n2. I know they&amp;#39;re becoming obsolete in the age of digital downloads, but I still use mine a fair amount for music, some older games and other bits and bobs. My laptop&amp;#39;s ODD pooped the bed a while back, so I had to include it.\n3. Very true, I picked out the M.2 just to help reduce cable clutter in such a small case but I&amp;#39;m open to other options, will be having another look before making a purchase on that.\n4. Good to hear, thanks!\n5. Ditto above :)\n6. Will do, shall probably purchase that last, potentially after already building the system and getting it up and running.
