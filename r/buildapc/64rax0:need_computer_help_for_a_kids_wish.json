The 1400 has 4 cores, 8 threads and is very good for gaming. If you can speare 50$ more, the 219$ Ryzen 5 1600 is even better with 6 cores, 12 threads. A real monster for graphics design and games alike, for a relatively small budget (relative to Intel, which cost more than double for simialr 4/8 and 6/12 chips).\n\nCPU fan: included. Pretty good, especially the one included in the 1600, which is very good.\n\nMotherboard: fantastic value for the money, allows overclocking and has all the features available today that he could want\n\nRAM: 16GB of fast DDR4 RAM. The sweetspot for gaming, graphics and rendering.\n\nStorage: fast 240GB SSD for Windows and programs. Slower mechanical hard drive to store games, movies, songs, graphics and 3D models.\n\nGPU: Radeon RX 480, the best GPU in its price category, can run everything at 1080p, 60fps and gives very good performance across the board.\n\nCase: one of the best looking cases out there, and it's also cheap.\n\nPSU: 80+ Gold Seasonic, a real treat. Very reliable and will keep the computer safe.\n\nMonitor: 1080p, 75Hz with FreeSync for the smoothest experience when paired with a Radeon RX GPU\n\nKeyboard + Mouse: Cooler Master Devastator II is a very good kit with back-lighting and some of the best membrane keys out there (they call them mem-chanical. The caps are Cherry MX compatible)\n\nSpeakers: I put in one of the best 2.1 I found for the price, but I'm not an audiophile, so maybe further input from someone more knowledgeable is required.\n\nRemember that at BestBuy they do price-match on most of these things, so keep an eye out for similar components so you can save some money along the way. Also give a call before going in making sure they ahve some Ryzen 5 and B350 motherboards in stock (and maybe also other components, like the FreeSync monitor). You don't want to have to go back many times.\n\nAs for software: \n\n* Contact Microsoft for a Windows key, I'm sure they'll be happy to provide one for charity ;)\n\n* for 3D modeling Blender is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) that can do 3D modeling and 3D rendering really really well (professional level). Otherwise you could try to contact Autodesk and ask for a Maya license.\n\n* for 2D art, I guess that contacting Adobe for a license for their suite would be the best idea.

The 1400 has 4 cores, 8 threads and is very good for gaming. If you can speare 50$ more, the 219$ Ryzen 5 1600 is even better with 6 cores, 12 threads. A real monster for graphics design and games alike, for a relatively small budget (relative to Intel, which cost more than double for simialr 4/8 and 6/12 chips).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CPU fan: included. Pretty good, especially the one included in the 1600, which is very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motherboard: fantastic value for the money, allows overclocking and has all the features available today that he could want&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RAM: 16GB of fast DDR4 RAM. The sweetspot for gaming, graphics and rendering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Storage: fast 240GB SSD for Windows and programs. Slower mechanical hard drive to store games, movies, songs, graphics and 3D models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GPU: Radeon RX 480, the best GPU in its price category, can run everything at 1080p, 60fps and gives very good performance across the board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case: one of the best looking cases out there, and it&amp;#39;s also cheap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PSU: 80+ Gold Seasonic, a real treat. Very reliable and will keep the computer safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monitor: 1080p, 75Hz with FreeSync for the smoothest experience when paired with a Radeon RX GPU&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keyboard + Mouse: Cooler Master Devastator II is a very good kit with back-lighting and some of the best membrane keys out there (they call them mem-chanical. The caps are Cherry MX compatible)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speakers: I put in one of the best 2.1 I found for the price, but I&amp;#39;m not an audiophile, so maybe further input from someone more knowledgeable is required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that at BestBuy they do price-match on most of these things, so keep an eye out for similar components so you can save some money along the way. Also give a call before going in making sure they ahve some Ryzen 5 and B350 motherboards in stock (and maybe also other components, like the FreeSync monitor). You don&amp;#39;t want to have to go back many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for software: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact Microsoft for a Windows key, I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ll be happy to provide one for charity ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;for 3D modeling Blender is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) that can do 3D modeling and 3D rendering really really well (professional level).

It would definitely be a better deal to buy parts for a computer, and it makes the computer have more of a sentimental value for the child you are working with. Your mileage may vary. \n\n**Edit: Some BestBuy computers are actually a decent deal.**\n\nDo you have a Micro Center in your general area? That store is great for computer parts and accessories, and they have very good deals (I bought my $350 CPU for $280 there). You said that he wanted to go on a \"shopping spree\" and Micro Center is great for that. They also sell prebuilt computers.\n\n&gt; What kind of computer will he need to run games and graphics programs well?\n\nYou said that he mainly plays League of Legends, and that is not a very demanding game. If he does also play more demanding titles (Witcher 3, Arkham Knight, etc.), then those will need a better GPU. \n\nAiming for the $200 to $300 range for the graphics cards is best. This gets you great cards like the GTX 1060 and RX480.

If you build I would recommend the r5 over the i5, but it is a decent machine and should accomplish your goals. It is a pretty decent gaming rig that will play most modern games at 60fps at high/ultra and should be able to do graphic design work without much issue. A r5 or i7 might do it a bit faster, but for most prebuilts they start jacking up the prices after that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dg4z5fh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975802.0, "created_utc": 1491947002.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rax0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rax0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rax0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4idlz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KrisBook", "parent_id": "t1_dg4h0b4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I second this.
