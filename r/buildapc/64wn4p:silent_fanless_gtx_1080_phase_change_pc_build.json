So allegedly (prototype tests by &lt;a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.fr/articles/calyos-loop-heat-pipe-refroidissement,2-2548-5.html\"&gt;Toms&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PJOrfpiVwE\"&gt;Linus&lt;/a&gt;) you get performance &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/GD89i#2LkMGXU\"&gt;comparable&lt;/a&gt; to water cooling without worrying about maintenance/leaks and most importantly without using energy on pumps/fans which means no noise.

But furthermore to use that pcie slot with my sound card I think I&amp;#39;ll need some kind of 90 degree adapter as it won&amp;#39;t fit in standard orientation given the limited space between the glass and mobo.

Lastly there aren&amp;#39;t a ton of options when it comes to fanless PSUs but I&amp;#39;m willing to pay more for the most efficient, (I pay a lot per Kwh here), but most importantly I want one free from any electrical noise I&amp;#39;ve heard thats a common issue with certain models and it would be especially noticeable on a build with no fans or HDDs.
