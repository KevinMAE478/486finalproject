I replaced it with an $85 CAD used AMD HD 7950 3GB, which has been a massive improvement.   \n\n\nWhat I love about the build is that I managed to sell the RAM stick for $40, and then bought a pair of 8GB sticks for $70.  \nI have added a 3.5\" 100GB HDD that I got out of a computer being recycled, which I store games like CSGO on.   \nThe i5-4590 still handles everything I throw at it, Battlefield 1 included.  \nThe SSD is small, but still plenty big for me.  \n\nBut what I am MOST pleased with is my motherboard choice. I've added an SPDIF bracket, a firewire card, a wifi card, and five case fans (including molex from CPU). I've been able to experiment with whether 8, 16 or 24GB of RAM is right for me.  The case is big enough that I have my three hard drives and a disk drive in there easily. My HD 7950 sits around 45C UNDER LOAD. That's crazy!   \nBut I lucked out.

I replaced it with an $85 CAD used AMD HD 7950 3GB, which has been a massive improvement.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I love about the build is that I managed to sell the RAM stick for $40, and then bought a pair of 8GB sticks for $70.&lt;br/&gt;\nI have added a 3.5&amp;quot; 100GB HDD that I got out of a computer being recycled, which I store games like CSGO on.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe i5-4590 still handles everything I throw at it, Battlefield 1 included.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe SSD is small, but still plenty big for me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what I am MOST pleased with is my motherboard choice. I&amp;#39;ve added an SPDIF bracket, a firewire card, a wifi card, and five case fans (including molex from CPU). I&amp;#39;ve been able to experiment with whether 8, 16 or 24GB of RAM is right for me.  The case is big enough that I have my three hard drives and a disk drive in there easily. My HD 7950 sits around 45C UNDER LOAD. That&amp;#39;s crazy!&lt;br/&gt;\nBut I lucked out. I didn&amp;#39;t research the connectors on the motherboard, and have only been able to add all that stuff for cheap because of that one purchase accomodating it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dg535xf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491980928.0, "created_utc": 1491952128.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s6m6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kkmv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BmanUltima", "parent_id": "t3_64s6m6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My CPU cooler.
