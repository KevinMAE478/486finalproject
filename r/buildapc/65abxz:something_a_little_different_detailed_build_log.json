The machine has 2x 8-drive RAID-Z2 arrays: one array with 8TB WD Red drives and one with 4TB WD Red drives for a total of ~60TB of usable space. The drives are connected to 2x IBM M1015 cards which I re-flashed to run in IT mode. The boot volume is stored on 2x Intel 540s 120GB SSDs in RAID 1. The server is housed in a SuperMicro SC846 chassis with two 920W redundant PSUs. The system is built on a SuperMicro X10SRL-F LGA2011-v3 motherboard. I\u2019m using an Intel Xeon E5-1630v3 CPU (4 cores/8 threads @ 3.7GHz) and 4 modules of 16GB DDR4 Samsung ECC/registered memory for a total of 64GB of RAM. I\u2019m using a Noctua cooler on the CPU and I replaced the noisy stock chassis fans with quieter Noctua fans. I got an APC 1500VA Smart-UPS and stuck both it and the file server in a LackRack Enterprise Edition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set my primary dataset with recordsize = 1MiB to account for data block placement in an 8-drive Z2 array. All the data is shared via SMB/CIFS. The system hosts about ten Debian-based bhyve VMs to run various services I use on a day-to-day basis (including nginx, an OpenVPN server, and an rclone client I use to back up my data to an Amazon Cloud Drive). I have scripts set up to send SMART and zpool status reports to my email address on a weekly basis and scrubs/SMART checks scheduled every 2 weeks.
