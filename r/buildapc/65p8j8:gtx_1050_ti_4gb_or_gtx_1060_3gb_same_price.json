Typically that&amp;#39;s the sort of process that the CPU can offload onto extra cores/threads, so for CPUs with a limited number of cores/threads, the lighter-impact Nvidia drivers will presumably cause less of a hit when it comes to CPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, that seems to be most true in DX11. Now that games are using new-gen APIs like DX12 and Vulkan, those APIs seem to be helping with the driver overhead issue a bit. With that in mind, real in-game performance is still a toss-up between the 480 and 1060 with an G4560:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0dbJeT0jFo\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0dbJeT0jFo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d probably go for the 480 and its larger VRAM pool, but either one will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dgdhgh6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492465113.0, "created_utc": 1492436313.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5qf6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ERR11CC", "parent_id": "t1_dgd1m1k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What does this mean??

However, this is based on what I've seen discussed, not pure numbers, so it could be wrong.\n\nThe 470 is favored in less games since very few games tested were DX12. My post clearly indicates that the 1060 is better for DX11 and the 40 is better for DX12. I'm basing my conclusion on the idea that is you dont mention what games you currently play, I will simply mention that you need to consider if you play more DX11 or DX12 games to make your decision, and that assuming you play equal numbers of DX11/DX12 games then you should look to what is likely to happen in games that will be released over the next few years. The 470 seems to have an advantage here, since these will likely use DX12 and are more likely to benefit from more VRAM.\n\nLooking over my post I admit I could do a better job indicating that, since DX12 is new, many current games dont use it, and that you need to look at how many DX11 vs DX12 games you play to determine which will be better for you.

There are 2 differences though:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The rx 470 is clocked lower than the rx 480, while the 3gb and 6gb 1060&amp;#39;s are clocked the same. This gives the 3gb 1060 a small advantage at stock speeds, but if you overclock this difference can be (mostly) made up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The difference between 3gb and 4gb of VRAM is potentially important (just look at the whole 3.5gb issue with the 970&amp;#39;s...), and is more likely to matter than the 4gb vs 6gb vs 8gb cases in the 480 vs 6gb 1060 discussion. This gives the advantage to the 470, and this cannot be made up by things like overclocking (memory overclocking might help slightly, but wont come close to making up the difference).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dgc9fdp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390693.0, "created_utc": 1492361893.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcb8ae", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SideHug", "parent_id": "t1_dgc8dad", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Doubt it, from what I've heard and seen the 500 are just a refresh with like a 30-50mhz speed boost on the card speed.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubt it, from what I&amp;#39;ve heard and seen the 500 are just a refresh with like a 30-50mhz speed boost on the card speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dgcb8ae", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393068.0, "created_utc": 1492364268.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8j8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcednb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrTechSavvy", "parent_id": "t1_dgce5xm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I was going to get Freesync but my R9 270 doesn't support it :/ But I'll definetly upgrade my monitor when I upgrade to an i5-4570 or whatever Haswell i5 I can get my hands on for around $100, and a 470/570.
