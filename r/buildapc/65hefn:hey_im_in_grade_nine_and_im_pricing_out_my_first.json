The Ryzen 5 1600 offers great gaming performance for the price, having 6 cores and 12 threads, and it will get even better with game optimizations (of which around 3 already did) and BIOS updates. It comes with a stock cooler you can even overclock on. The savings here on the CPU will be used to upgrade the GPU.  \n*  This motherboard from Gigabyte contains many useful features like DualBIOS and it supports overclocking. It usually has good BIOS support, so any bugs/issues will be stomped out quickly.  \n* I upgraded the GTX 1060 to a GTX 1070. It's much better than a GTX 1060 and lasts longer.  \nSo here you have it. It offers much better value than your original build while maintaining the same price point.
