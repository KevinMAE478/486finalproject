List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I built the system listed above around mid-2016, intending to use it as a dual-boot Hackintosh. It started up perfectly the first time, and I got both Windows and macOS installed and running flawlessly. After about four months, the Windows install crapped out - would no longer boot reliably. I checked the SSD Windows was on, an old drive of mine, and found it was failing badly, so I switched to using just macOS. The system ran flawlessly under macOS, no performance issues whatsoever. After another few months, I needed to do some work in Windows-only programs, so I picked up a 120GB Intel SSD and installed Windows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It ran like absolute crap - Explorer would randomly hang and crash when opening new windows, and so would any other program. I chalked it up to issues with the PC being a Hackintosh, and just kept using macOS. Recently, though, I inherited a second PC, and migrated macOS over to that PC, intending to set my main machine up as a pure Windows gaming PC. I removed the macOS drives, picked up a new 850 Evo 500GB for Windows, cleared CMOS/updated the BIOS, and installed Windows from absolute scratch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surprise, surprise, the PC is still running badly. Not as badly as before, and the system never hangs completely, but even things like dragging windows around the screen or the highlighting of context menu items on mouseover are extremely laggy. The CPU and GPU are both running at full, normal clocks, but games run nowhere near as well as they should on a 6700K/980 Ti - Mass Effect 3 on normal settings @1440P is a laggy mess. I&amp;#39;ve run MemTest86 to rule out RAM issues (passed with 0 errors), run a SMART assessment of the SSD, and double-checked that everything is running at the expected frequencies in BIOS - does anyone have any clue what could be wrong? The key issue for me is that when the system was running under macOS, it was fine - fast, smooth, etc, as one would expect. It seems to be a Windows issue, but what could possibly be going wrong on a completely fresh install? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List anything you&amp;#39;ve done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As above, I&amp;#39;ve completely reset the PC - cleared CMOS, completely formatted the Windows drive, and ensured all frequency settings are normal in BIOS. Yet the system just isn&amp;#39;t running smoothly at all. The damn Start menu lags upon opening, sometimes taking a second or two to even show up. I&amp;#39;ve run Cinebench (CPU and GPU) and those scores came back approximately normal for my setup (790 CPU, 141FPS GPU). I&amp;#39;m completely clueless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Just ran Cinebench again to test &lt;a href=\"/u/puns_n_irony\"&gt;/u/puns_n_irony&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s suggestion about checking P-states, and the 980 Ti only scored 86FPS, much lower than my last run (140FPS). No other 3D applications were open. Absolutely bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Just reset Windows entirely using the built-in recovery options, so effectively a complete reinstall - lag seems to be gone, for now at least. Last time, it was there from the start, so something&amp;#39;s changed (though I&amp;#39;ve no clue what).
