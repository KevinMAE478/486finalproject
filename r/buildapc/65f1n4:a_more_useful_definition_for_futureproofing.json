You might, for example: only have $700 to spend, you could stretch to an i5 7600k and a bronze psu and bitfenix nova or you could get a g4650, EVGA g3 and a case with better airflow/other features, you can spend more on the system such as the case and power supply as he said and game comfortably for a while until you can invest in a better system. This would in op&amp;#39;s view on &amp;quot;future proofing&amp;quot;, be viable because later when you save up money again, you would already have a working computer and could still buy an i7 or i5 and spend less to increase your performance (g4650&amp;gt;i5 cheaper than i3&amp;gt;i5), as he mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By using your initial $700 to prioritise buying  better parts of the computer that don&amp;#39;t need upgrading as often (case, power supply, hdd, ssd, wi-fi card, maybe even a nicer monitor), you elect to spend less money initially and think about the big picture, to spend a bit more a year later and upgrade at a more elongated pace. As opposed to buying the whole thing in one go, then changing most of it 5 years later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You two are clearly fighting a similar point in this discussion, and there isn&amp;#39;t a large distinction in the first place but OP seems to be losing it by trying to change the preconceived definition of future proofing, instead of focussing on explaining the choices facing new builders&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Message me if parts are written sub-optimally, its quite long and a little late at night&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dga0fbd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245011.0, "created_utc": 1492216211.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1n4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1n4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1n4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1n4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1n4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1n4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rod4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Devballs", "parent_id": "t1_dg9rh0v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 1, "body": "The advice i'll give them is not to use the term future-proof lol.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice i&amp;#39;ll give them is not to use the term future-proof lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dg9rod4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233463.0, "created_utc": 1492204663.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rh0v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_Crucified_One", "parent_id": "t1_dg9r9pw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Exactly, so if someone asks you to future-proof their build, I'm saying this is the advice to give them no matter what you call it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly, so if someone asks you to future-proof their build, I&amp;#39;m saying this is the advice to give them no matter what you call it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dg9rh0v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233208.0, "created_utc": 1492204408.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9r9pw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Devballs", "parent_id": "t1_dg9r3qw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's why people keep the base system such as ram, cpu and mobo for the 4-8 years (or whatever it is) and only upgrade the GPU in this time.
