However I would like to piggy back off of u/straighttoplaid and say you don't necessarily need watercooling for Ryzen to perform well. You also don't need to watercool the GPU.

Sure you can choose between a Z or H line intel chipset but really there is no choice. Your budget and experience puts you well within then casual overclock group at least.  Be sure to get a K series cpu and a Z series chipset and you are good to overclock.  If you choose Ryzen you can ogle at the x370 chipset but at your budget you don't need extra PCIE lanes so just get a B350 instead.\n\nAlso from your build list you have a SATA SSD but there is a new technology.  Look for an m.2 SSD.  The mobo listed has 2x m.2 ports for an SSD, comperable motherboards will have 1 or 2.  This will be WAY faster than a SATA SSD which really is yesterday's tech.\n\nIMO your list is overspending on the mobo, case, RAM, PSU.

Your monitor is 2560x1440 so you actually will get a use out of a strong video card.

Money could be shaved off with minimal reduction to performance in terms of RAM and SSD capacity should you wish to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To save ordering from a bunch of different sites, you can check &lt;a href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wThXNN/by_merchant/\"&gt;price by merchant&lt;/a&gt; which currently shows Amazon has 7/8 parts and only 3 of them are cheaper elsewhere (by a total of $3), so you would order them 7 parts from amazon and the 8th (CPU) get from the cheapest site. The 9th (case) you could find on amazon or which ever site you order your CPU from, to keep it at only 2 sites for all your parts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dgb6d9w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319220.0, "created_utc": 1492290420.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jmov", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbjpuq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CommandoSnake", "parent_id": "t3_65jmov", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Spend 1K on a ryzen and polaris build, and spend 2K on a hooker", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend 1K on a ryzen and polaris build, and spend 2K on a hooker&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapc", "name": "t1_dgbjpuq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338292.0, "created_utc": 1492309492.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jmov", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbbuu9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xXiDominateXx", "parent_id": "t3_65jmov", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Z8KmvV) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Z8KmvV/by_merchant/)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [Intel Core i7-7700K 4.2GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VKx9TW/intel-core-i7-7700k-42ghz-quad-core-processor-bx80677i77700k) | $338.44 @ OutletPC \n**CPU Cooler** | [Corsair H100i v2 70.7 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/CrDzK8/corsair-cpu-cooler-cw9060025ww) | $117.49 @ OutletPC \n**Motherboard** | [Asus MAXIMUS IX HERO ATX LGA1151 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/HHbkcf/asus-maximus-ix-hero-atx-lga1151-motherboard-maximus-ix-hero) | $214.99 @ SuperBiiz \n**Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance LED 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7PFXsY/corsair-vengeance-led-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-3000-memory-cmu16gx4m2c3000c15) | $124.89 @ OutletPC \n**Storage** | [Samsung 960 Evo 500GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Ykbkcf/samsung-960-evo-500gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-mz-v6e500) | $248.98 @ NCIX US \n**Video Card** | [Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB Founders Edition Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/8MQRsY/gigabyte-geforce-gtx-1080-ti-11gb-founders-edition-video-card-gv-n108td5x-b) | $689.99 @ SuperBiiz \n**Case** | [Phanteks ECLIPSE P400S TEMPERED GLASS ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/tBWrxr/phanteks-eclipse-p400s-tempered-glass-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-ec416pstg_bk) | $99.98 @ Newegg \n**Power Supply** | [EVGA SuperNOVA P2 850W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zhgPxr/evga-power-supply-220p20850x1) | $137.99 @ OutletPC \n**Monitor** | [Acer Predator X34 34.0\" 3440x1440 100Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WDcMnQ/acer-monitor-umcx1aa002) | $1020.38 @ Amazon \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $3013.13\n | Mail-in rebates | -$20.00\n | **Total** | **$2993.13**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2017-04-15 19:16 EDT-0400 |\n\n\nYou will love the Acer Predator X34 ultrawide monitor and the 1080 ti will be the perfect card to power it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Z8KmvV\"&gt;PCPartPicker part list&lt;/a&gt;
