And the fact mountain project data is inconsistent will not change. If every user of mountain project would take a picture of just one route the data in First Ascent would equal the amount of data of Mountain Project ... and far exceed its consistency. I would rather do something to contribute to the climbing community than sit tight, and I just don&amp;#39;t think using a MP is the way to do it efficiently. Also when talking about the new app having 1% of data of MP you have to think about what percent of data in mountain project is actually useful. From my experience it is just a few percentages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "climbing", "name": "t1_dgaxrzy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307555.0, "created_utc": 1492278755.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavt27", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "milesthemilos", "parent_id": "t1_dgatxj0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/climbing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree that the UI could be better but the data is most important.
