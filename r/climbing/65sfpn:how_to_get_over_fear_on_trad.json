Once you&amp;#39;re to the point where 5.8 cracks feel as secure 5.8 sport climbs, you won&amp;#39;t be as worried about falling and consequently won&amp;#39;t be as worried about a piece failing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, depending on where you are, a 5.8 isn&amp;#39;t necessarily an easy trad climb.  In the RRG, a 5.8 put up in the 1970&amp;#39;s or early 1980&amp;#39;s can be SERIOUSLY intimidating.  I&amp;#39;ve onsighted my share of hard 5.11 sport routes and haven&amp;#39;t fallen on a sport route under 5.10 in ages.  Still fell on a 5.7 trad route last year.
