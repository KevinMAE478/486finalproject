I met my husband climbing, and we married and moved to an area that is great for climbing but we have two kids now and it is really hard to get out and go climbing regularly. We still go occasionally, but we&amp;#39;ve transitioned into other sports that are easier to do as a family (hiking, skiing) and we do solo sports like running/cycling for our own personal enjoyment and health. The kids are sort of emerging out of the baby larva stage now so we might start climbing more, but getting out for long days of climbing just isn&amp;#39;t as feasible for us right now. Even before we had kids, I have always enjoyed dabbling in other sports to prevent burnout, so I did stints with triathlon, trail running, road cycling etc. I think it&amp;#39;s fine to shift attention away from climbing and onto other things you are passionate about. You don&amp;#39;t have to spend all your life doing one sport just because you really enjoyed it at one point in time, and you can always go back to it when you are ready!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "climbing", "name": "t1_dgdlsso", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470995.0, "created_utc": 1492442195.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qk72", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qwo2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdne91", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "narfandahalf", "parent_id": "t3_65qwo2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/climbing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a little late here, but thought I would throw in my thoughts.
