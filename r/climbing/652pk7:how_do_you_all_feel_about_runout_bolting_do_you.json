As far as most routes being bolted safely though... At some of the crags I climb at there might be one 5.6 or 7 route on a 9 or 10 multi. Usually the easy pitch will be run out like 40 ft + many just have one or two bolts. Personally I believe they should be bolted more safely to account for things like falling rocks , lose holds, etc. I&amp;#39;m not saying there should be a bolt ladder all the way up but on many of these pitches there are spots where if you fell you would likely face serious injury/ death&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "climbing", "name": "t1_dg7smo1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129526.0, "created_utc": 1492100726.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gqic", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DurangoClimb", "parent_id": "t3_652pk7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/climbing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\nIt happens in sport climbing because bolts are expensive, and at a given grade I.E. 5.12, the crux should be bolted enough to work it, but the 5.9 leading up to the crux will probably end up runout because you should be a master of 5.9 before getting on 5.12.\n\nI find it super rare that something is actually dangerously runout.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happens in sport climbing because bolts are expensive, and at a given grade I.E. 5.12, the crux should be bolted enough to work it, but the 5.9 leading up to the crux will probably end up runout because you should be a master of 5.9 before getting on 5.12.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it super rare that something is actually dangerously runout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "climbing", "name": "t1_dg7gqic", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492114894.0, "created_utc": 1492086094.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qk72", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652pk7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qk72", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652pk7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7saua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "average_ass_climber", "parent_id": "t1_dg7kf06", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/climbing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I totally agree on the trad aspect, all of the crags I frequent have adopted that standard and I appreciate that.

There are a ton of routes in the 5.7-5.9 range in the Needles (South Dakota) that I absolutely will not climb at this time because a fall at the wrong time would result in serious injury or worse. I respect the FA&amp;#39;s who bolted these routes ground up on lead. It would be completely unreasonable for me to expect that every climb is brought down to my level.
