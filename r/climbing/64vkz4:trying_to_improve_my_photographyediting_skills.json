I'm not 12c climber, still pushing through the 11's, but heck that was a tense route, I talked with some people and it should be rated 10a.

Only Photoshop (which is pretty much indispensable if you're getting into photography anyway!) has it. The auto-align is only in PS too I think.\n\nThe spot selection (equivalent is the healing brush in PS) takes a sample of the original location and tries to blend it with the location you brush over. It also 'blends' the colours at the edges of the brush heavily. If you have light-to-dark patterns (think zebra), such as the rock behind the rope, this tool is not going to give you good results as it will blur the contrast differences and look ridiculous. I guess this is what you experienced. This tool is great for removing something like a spot on a face (hence the name) because skin is generally very 'consistent' and the sampled area will generally look like what the spotty area *should* look like. The colour sampling is often important because, for example, due to the curvature of your face the light levels may have changed so it's good to try and normalise them.\n\nThe clone tool is a similar concept but it takes the sampled area and doesn't mess around with it. It's a direct copy from one area to another. As I said before, something like the rock and clouds in the sky are fairly random, so you can sample similar places and draw over the ropes without having to be too accurate. Sometimes though you have to be careful to sample the right areas to make it look natural.\n\nHDR = High Dynamic Range. Dynamic range essentially means the range between the darkest and lightest part of the image. In a single exposure you're physically limited by how a camera works. You can either under-expose shot and have really dark areas, or over-expose and get really bright areas. HDR is the name given to a technique where you blend multiple exposures to get the best of both worlds and 'increase' the dynamic range (combing both exposures you now have detail in the dark and light regions). It's (generally) not a camera setting. It's a post-processing technique available in Lightroom, PS and other software but you usually have to take multiple exposures to do so. Haloing is a common artifact of the algorithms most programs use, which leaves me intrigued why you have haloing if you've not used a HDR tool. How did you process this exactly?\n\nFor the multiple exposures, you're correct you wanna get multiple different exposures. Most cameras allow you 'exposure bracketing' - I guess check your manual on how to do it. Basically you set the normal exposure (aperature, shutter and ISO) then take multiple shops in sucesscion. The camera automatically adjusts the settings to take over/under exposed for the photos after the first (the number depends on the settings in your camera).

If you have light-to-dark patterns (think zebra), such as the rock behind the rope, this tool is not going to give you good results as it will blur the contrast differences and look ridiculous. I guess this is what you experienced. This tool is great for removing something like a spot on a face (hence the name) because skin is generally very &amp;#39;consistent&amp;#39; and the sampled area will generally look like what the spotty area &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; look like. The colour sampling is often important because, for example, due to the curvature of your face the light levels may have changed so it&amp;#39;s good to try and normalise them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clone tool is a similar concept but it takes the sampled area and doesn&amp;#39;t mess around with it. It&amp;#39;s a direct copy from one area to another. As I said before, something like the rock and clouds in the sky are fairly random, so you can sample similar places and draw over the ropes without having to be too accurate. Sometimes though you have to be careful to sample the right areas to make it look natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HDR = High Dynamic Range. Dynamic range essentially means the range between the darkest and lightest part of the image. In a single exposure you&amp;#39;re physically limited by how a camera works. You can either under-expose shot and have really dark areas, or over-expose and get really bright areas. HDR is the name given to a technique where you blend multiple exposures to get the best of both worlds and &amp;#39;increase&amp;#39; the dynamic range (combing both exposures you now have detail in the dark and light regions). It&amp;#39;s (generally) not a camera setting. It&amp;#39;s a post-processing technique available in Lightroom, PS and other software but you usually have to take multiple exposures to do so. Haloing is a common artifact of the algorithms most programs use, which leaves me intrigued why you have haloing if you&amp;#39;ve not used a HDR tool. How did you process this exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the multiple exposures, you&amp;#39;re correct you wanna get multiple different exposures. Most cameras allow you &amp;#39;exposure bracketing&amp;#39; - I guess check your manual on how to do it. Basically you set the normal exposure (aperature, shutter and ISO) then take multiple shops in sucesscion. The camera automatically adjusts the settings to take over/under exposed for the photos after the first (the number depends on the settings in your camera).

Personally I kinda like the bright colours, but that's just me.\n\nTo help you out, however, here's a few things I would do:\n\n1. Remove the things hanging from the top and your rope! They kinda distract from the scenery and the climber. You could keep the rope if you wanted to show you were hanging whilst shooting, but definitely get rid of the stuff at the top. Rock and sky is usually suitable random, so this literally took me 2 minutes using the clone tool in Photoshop: http://imgur.com/a/6zhxv. (I also cropped in a bit, but again, composition is personal preference)\n\n2. I don't know how you balanced the exposures of the rock and background, however, haloing is usually indicative of an automatic HDR tool. Whilst these tools can do a decent job, Luminosity mask blending is by far the best way to get really natural blend between exposures. This guy explains the process (with and without his tool) incredibly clearly and it shouldn't take you long to get proficient at it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igNlbo5U80g\n\n3. Normally in landscape photography (I would consider this mostly landscape photography) you would take a series of photos to get a complete set of shots with the right exposure and focus with which you would blend later. A tripod is absolutely necessary though. Considering you're on a rope (presumably no tripod!) and your friend is unlikely to have sat still to get multiple exposures, my guess is you've used a single photo where you exported a 'bright' and 'dark' exposure. This works very well for dynamic (moving) scenes and I use it a lot, but you can't always get natural information from the sky using this method (hence usually the need for a second/third photo with a lower exposure). Again, you can use luminosity masks to blend a single exposure and this guy goes over this very well here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4OiFYXhoKg\n\n4. As a solution to point 3, you can bracket two/3 shots (above/below your set exposure) and use Photoshop to 'align' the images (edit&gt;auto-align is godly) as usually there'll be some slight difference between two hand held shots.\n\nHope this helps, nice shot!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a good shot, but it could be great!
