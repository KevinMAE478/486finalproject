Its pretty interesting, and not very long. Summing it up, loaded at the nose end of a biner, it broke at 10 Kn. That is a loading scenario you could have with 3 or 4 biners clipped into a master biner. Lets say the biner biner on the end has a rope through it. On one end of the rope is a climber, on the other a belayer. Knowing that the force applied to the climber is doubled at the top anchor, you need a force of 5kn acting on the climber to break that biner. That is very much within the range of force from a normal, low-on-the-route, high fall factor fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it the most likely thing? No. But it is a very, real possibility. A few too many biners at an anchor, someone not paying as much attention to things as they should, clipping the anchor in an unfortunate place, and then falling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not saying you should never use a master biner ever because you will die every time. I&amp;#39;m just saying that it opens you up to very easily, without noticing what you&amp;#39;re doing, loading a biner in a way it wasn&amp;#39;t meant to, and then having an accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "climbing", "name": "t1_dgdyinr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492485298.0, "created_utc": 1492456498.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qk72", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t1jm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeb4uj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GregorMcTaint", "parent_id": "t1_dgdw5sm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/climbing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When biners get loaded in strange ways they can and do break.

You could run into some organization issues trying to fit more carabiners into the clove hitch,  and clipping more biners to the first locker isn&amp;#39;t that great either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My shelf generally has two locking carabiners, one for each climber to clove hitch to. The nice thing about the shelf in a typical anchor is it is up and out of the way of master point where you can use an atc guide or grigri. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With level bolted anchors you can just keep a double length prettied with an overhand knot.
