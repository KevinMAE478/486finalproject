Those weren&amp;#39;t good even back then!  Back in the early-mid 90&amp;#39;s, 5.10 made better shoes than Sportiva, and this is a great example of that.  It wasn&amp;#39;t until the Miura and Mirage from Mariacher that Sportiva had truly special shoes.  Razors and Anasazis just crapped on these.  Put them on a shelf.
