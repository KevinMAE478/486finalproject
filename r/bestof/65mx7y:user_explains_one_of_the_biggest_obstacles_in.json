And the religious ideologies of course aim to keep it that way - for example, for the vast majority of average Muslims, a muslim-raised women marrying a non-muslim is unthinkable - because the children &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be raised muslim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there aren&amp;#39;t many Muslims who stop short of advocating any anti-egalitarian, anti-progressive, anti-liberal measures - but the average is far more conservative than many appear to think (somewhat understandably, from our mostly liberal, secularized lives). Plus, as with Jehova&amp;#39;s Witnesses, they might be fine with letting &amp;quot;other people&amp;quot; do their thing... but still enforce very strict norms against people in their social circles and especially children (for Witnessess: Strictly controlling what texts are allowed to be read, what cultural products are allowed to be consumed, which social interactions are allowed ... oh, and raising them to deny blood-transfusions).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this excuses just being an asshole to people - and for all I care you can identify as whatever you like, I care about your judgements and actions... but yeah, self-identitification with an ideology does give a few clues. Regional and temporal differences abound, of course - so do worrysome averages and tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bestof", "name": "t1_dgbz8up", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492374631.0, "created_utc": 1492345831.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 106}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbydno", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wobblyweasel", "parent_id": "t3_65mx7y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "body": "that user describes the obstacle, not explains it", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;that user describes the obstacle, not explains it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bestof", "name": "t1_dgbydno", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492372388.0, "created_utc": 1492343588.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mx7y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcmtkk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Satafly", "parent_id": "t1_dgchmnk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Er no shit?
