There were some days when I had suicidal ideation, which was frightening because I wasn't actually suicidal. I hadn't been in that dark of a place in a long time and it was a struggle to keep going through the motions.\n\nNow I'm two months into a new job that pays more than I've ever made in my life and aligns with my chosen career path. I've paid off the survival credit card debt I'd started to build up in those last few months. I'm still working on my overall mental health, but I'm doing better and better and I made my first therapy appointment this week. My outlook is completely different and life feels more manageable.\n\nI just wanted to provide a positive story related to your situation. If you have any interest in a few words of advice, here are a few recommendations:\n\n 1) Look for something outside of work-related things for your self esteem or sense of purpose or whatever. I decided I might be shitty at everything and life might be garbage, but I could do my best to show the people I love that I love them and make their lives a little bit better. It helped. \n\n2) Ask for help. So generic, I know. Specifically, ask for help doing things like going for walks (or whatever exercise you like, since it's hard to start exercising alone), dealing with whatever part of the application process trips you up most, or just hanging out/generally doing things that make you feel like a person. If you don't have friends nearby in real life, ask the internet.\n\n3) This one is hard, but try to find something that you can do and talk about when people ask what you're up to - literally anything. It's so fucking depressing to say you're still unemployed. At first I downplayed my side projects because I didn't think much of them, but later I invested more of my (limited) energy into them so I could talk about something other than job-hunting. I know this is tricky and might come across as unhelpful since doing anything is hard right now. I do think that this can help with self esteem and depression, though.\n\n4) When you apply for things, don't just hit one channel. It's easy to get discouraged or stuck or tell yourself only one method is likely to get you anywhere ('why even apply when I don't have a connection?). Some options are easier than others, but potentially less effective - that's OK. Little wins still help you keep momentum. Examples of methods, starting with easy ones: \n\n* reach out to recruiters \n\n* call some temp agencies\n\n* apply to jobs through that one-click function through LinkedIn and Indeed (no cover letters for the one-click ones, unless it's your dream job or you find cover letters easy - you're depressed and probably not able to do much, and doing something is better than doing nothing)\n\n* apply with tailored cover letters to regular postings, ideally with a referral from someone you know but even if you don't have one\n\n* reach out to people in your network\n\n* ask for coffee with people in the field you're interested in and build relationships\n\nI didn't believe the LinkedIn spray-and-pray method would work, but it felt great to submit them (tiny wins) -- and I actually got a job offer through one of them! It was a great offer that I would've been happy to accept, and it allowed me to give an ultimatum to the company I ended up going with (their budget had been stalled and they even told me a competing offer would help). I didn't even get another interview from the rest, though. I think I applied for 26 my first evening, for reference - you start to see the same ones a lot once you've exhausted the ones remotely related to your field, so that pace isn't sustainable in a small market, but it honestly feels great and helped me keep from getting too attached to the applications I was spending more time on. I kept getting overly invested but doubting myself, ruining a few referral opportunities by not following through. This helped.\n\nI took a long long time to reach out to recruiters because I didn't think they'd help a career-changer, but I actually got an offer that way too. It didn't pay amazingly well or align with my career goals, but the people were nice and it happened quickly with very little work from my end. (Turning this down was scary, but I was interviewing elsewhere.) If you work with a recruiter or a temp agency, make sure to reach out regularly to remind them you're still interested.\n\nThe job I ended up taking was one I found through networking - someone reached out after meeting me for coffee the year before. He'd changed companies, but needed to fill a role and wondered if i was interested. This is how I expected to find a job, and I did a TON of networking, especially at first -- but it's also exhausting if you're depressed. I thought it was interesting that the three offers I got were all from such different sources, including two I'd rejected early on.\n\nKeep your chin up, friend.
