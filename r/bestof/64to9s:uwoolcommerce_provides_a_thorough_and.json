I like using \"undocumented\" because it illustrates the issue best: it's much easier for a person who doesn't exist on paper (and likely doesn't have a support structure in place) to slip through the cracks, to be held hostage (or even prisoner) by immoral employers, to be forced to work for less under the threat of reporting, or to exist in the fringes outside of the law.

Whether or not the government *can* do something being separate from whether they *should* is an argument that goes both ways.  Just because they *can* refuse to deport illegal immigrants doesn't mean they *should*.  Further, calling deportation the \"harshest\" penalty is completely subjective, especially considering that multiple offenses can result in a felony charge, a substantial fine, and jail time.

It actually granted amnesty to illegal aliens who entered before 1982. Yet this legalization did not result in a tidal wave of crime. In fact, it appears that the OPPOSITE occurred...\n\nIf this isn't the perfect example of correlation not implying causation, I don't know what is.  There is just as much proof for OP's argument that amnesty somehow *lowered* the crime rate than there is to say that amnesty prevented the crime rate from falling *even further than it did*.  Further, looking at the US as a whole, the crime rate did not begin falling after 1986.  In fact, from 1985 to 1991, the nation crime rate increased almost 11%.  Only after 1991 did the crime rate begin its steady decline.  Also, the study that OP and so many like to herald as proof that the crime rate among illegal immigrants is lower than the rate among citizens looks at the foreign born population, not simply the illegal immigrant population.  Again, you cannot look at the whole and then use that to make a blanket statement about a part.  Especially when there are very large demographic differences between legal and illegal immigrants.  Finally, the study itself mentions, however briefly, the fact that an illegal workforce displacing low-skill native workers can indirectly increase the crime rate as those displaced workers fall deeper into poverty.  \n\nPoint five is more of the same.  The a) bullet point again conflates legal and illegal immigration, and uses data for the former to describe the later.  Calling the studies EMPIRICAL and VERIFIABLE proof is laughable considering there is no empirical or verifiable data on the illegal population.  Additionally, the studies cited *once again* use data on the entire immigrant population to make specific claims about the illegal population, which you *cannot do*.  Further, the quote he used claiming that higher skilled workers see increased wages due to the low skilled jobs being taken by illegal immigrants is absolute garbage.  First, there is no data given that demonstrates that the low-skilled jobs that supposedly increase high-skilled wages are taken by illegal immigrants vs legal, so there is no way to determine if it is legal or illegal labor which bestows this alleged boon for high-skilled laborers.  Second, even if it were due to the illegals doing those jobs, how is that a *result* of illegals doing the work and not citizens?  If having a couple of low-skilled positions supporting a high-skilled worker increases that worker's earnings, isn't it the *job* which gives the benefit, and not who the employee is?  There is no reason that a citizen could not do the same job and provide the same alleged benefit.  So to say that illegal immigrants are somehow the cause is putting the praise in the wrong place.  That is, of course, unless you grant that the high-skilled worker's earnings are increased because he or she can pay those low-skill support position peanuts when filled by illegal immigrants vs when they have to pay fair wages to citizens.  \n\nWhich leads to his horrible logic in stating that \"if we are becoming more educated (and so arguably higher-skilled), then the undocumented laborers will be a further economic boost.\"  Moving from a manufacturing-based economy to a service economy means that there are fewer and fewer low-skilled jobs available for low-skilled citizens.  And if they have to not only compete with more citizens for fewer jobs, but also with a steady if not increasing illegal labor force, what do you think the end result will be for those people?\n\nHe then moves on to say that \"When the evidence is reviewed, it turns out that undocumented immigrants are not a drain. In fact, they are an added benefit to the treasury.\"  Their tax and Social Security contributions aren't proof that they are a benefit.  They pay far less than citizens would with the same employment, and they add to the cost of social services.  Additionally, displacing citizens who would otherwise hold the jobs they take means that those citizens now consume much more social safety net funds as they would were they employed.  Finally, as the statement he quote says, the vast majority of the financial and logistical burden falls upon state and local governments.  It's convenient for his argument to just brush that aside by comparing that issue to leaky windows in a house.  But illegal immigrants cost states billions each year, in addition to taking up resources which could be used on citizens, and dramatically increasing the strain on government infrastructure.  \n\nFinally we have his \"culture\" argument.  Which, who gives a fuck?  What they bring to the table culturally has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not one should have to accept illegal immigration.  Legal immigrants from the same countries bring exactly the same culture with them.  We don't need illegals to bring it in order to experience it.  This is just a red herring to bolster his strawman of those who staunchly oppose illegal immigration as racist, xenophobic blowhards.  \n\nReally, I can't believe that so many people are so willing to accept these arguments just because they confirm their biases.  You *constantly* see the conflation of legal and illegal immigration in studies and headlines, and self-proclaimed educated, critical thinkers absolutely eat it up without a second thought.  In fact, they double-down when the conflation is pointed out to them.  Trump went from calling some illegal immigrants criminals to calling all illegal immigrants criminals to calling all *immigrants* criminals to calling all *Mexicans* criminals.  And that spin was accepted and spread over and over and over.  And using that as a dishonest smear tactic isn't only used against Trump.  Sessions got the same treatment yesterday in that post, when him calling Mexican cartels operating within our boarders \"filth\" became him referring to *immigrants* as filth.This is the type of intellectual dishonesty that you accept when you lie down with the liberal left and their illegal immigration apologists.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His other points are nowhere near solid.

Legal immigrants from the same countries bring exactly the same culture with them.  We don&amp;#39;t need illegals to bring it in order to experience it.  This is just a red herring to bolster his strawman of those who staunchly oppose illegal immigration as racist, xenophobic blowhards.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, I can&amp;#39;t believe that so many people are so willing to accept these arguments just because they confirm their biases.  You &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; see the conflation of legal and illegal immigration in studies and headlines, and self-proclaimed educated, critical thinkers absolutely eat it up without a second thought.  In fact, they double-down when the conflation is pointed out to them.  Trump went from calling some illegal immigrants criminals to calling all illegal immigrants criminals to calling all &lt;em&gt;immigrants&lt;/em&gt; criminals to calling all &lt;em&gt;Mexicans&lt;/em&gt; criminals.  And that spin was accepted and spread over and over and over.  And using that as a dishonest smear tactic isn&amp;#39;t only used against Trump.  Sessions got the same treatment yesterday in that post, when him calling Mexican cartels operating within our boarders &amp;quot;filth&amp;quot; became him referring to &lt;em&gt;immigrants&lt;/em&gt; as filth.This is the type of intellectual dishonesty that you accept when you lie down with the liberal left and their illegal immigration apologists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bestof", "name": "t1_dg6732a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046404.0, "created_utc": 1492017604.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5rc1r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FakeBagel", "parent_id": "t1_dg5php2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That appears right!
