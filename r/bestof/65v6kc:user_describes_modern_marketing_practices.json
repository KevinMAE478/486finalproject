This would be done by one person in a call centre confirming the update for the software, a very cheap, and profitable upgrade for Tesla. If there were different battery sizes then an upgrade would mean a drive to a Tesla garage for a mechanic to physically install a larger battery module. This would be expensive due to different size battery modules having to be manufactured (point 1) increasing cost along with the cost of more potential garages and the wages of the mechanics.
