Before the weekend was over, I binged both seasons and I&amp;#39;m already itching to re-watch them again.  There&amp;#39;s just so many jokes, layers upon layers, I missed so much just while laughing. The character development is outrageous, development you&amp;#39;d expect from an AMC drama, not a cartoon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might not seem like anything special during the first few episodes you watch, another oddball Adult Swim concoction.

They have completely contrasted and clashing personalities and tend to do almost everything they can to sabotage each other when they're upset.\n\nOn the other hand, they're also utterly miserable without each other. There is something about they way they interact and complement each other that makes their existence be consumed by the other's. Jerry can be out doing cocaine and hanging with Johnny Depp and staring in Oscar winning movies while he bangs movie stars, models and porn stars all day, but in the back of his mind he's still obsessed with Beth. Beth can be a successful surgeon at the top of her field and yet at home her life is still a spiral of depression and horror that she fills with pets and alcohol. They may not always think they need each other, but they do. They both need and want each other on a deep level.\n\nAt the end of the day, Beth likes having someone who is both unintelligent and spineless enough to put up with her glaringly awful behavior and still eventually come back to her and be taken care of by her. Jerry likes someone who is so awe-inspiringly awful at human interaction and emotional capacity that it makes him look like a genius at something when he's a fuck-up in every other area of his life. They're perfect for each other in the most tragic, fucked up kind of way, where they revel in each other's faults to build up their own self-esteem. You'll notice it's when this dynamic gets challenged that they really start digging at each other: Jerry trying to be assertive about Rick, for instance, tends to set Beth off, not because she even agrees with Rick's behavior(in fact she frequently gets just as upset with him as Jerry does), but because it comes as a challenge to her. *She* let Rick into this house, and if he's going to leave, it will be at *her* command, because *she* is in control of this relationship and that's the way it's supposed to be, ad finitum. Likewise, Jerry clashes with Beth over the inclusion of Rick for the obvious superficial reasons, but also because Rick is someone who actively supports and builds Beth up. He gives her another source of social praise and self-worth, which diminishes Jerry's value in the one place that he's always felt like he consistently achieves something. Note that the only friend that Beth has ever had on the show outside of her father is Davin, who Jerry also despised and assumed wanted to steal her away from him. He ultimately proved correct there, but I think it says a lot that we never see Beth positively interacting with anyone else.\n\nLike the therapist says, these two are co-dependent on a horrifying level. Their entire sense of self-worth, their entire sense of being, is wrapped up in each other, specifically others key faults that are so compatible with the worst parts of themselves. What makes this relationship so terrible, so abominable in his eyes is that it's built on nothing but the absolute worst parts of both of them.
