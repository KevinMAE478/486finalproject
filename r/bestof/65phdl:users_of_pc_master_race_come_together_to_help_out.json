At the time I was 22, my friend (we'll call him M), was 23.\n\nMy sister graduated college with a degree in animal science, and we were talking about a business that we passed on the way to our friend's house.  Basically the place was in the business of providing ways for cattle to breed with little to no risk.  If you had an animal you wanted to stud out, you could provide the place some samples and they'd freeze it [in straws](http://equine-reproduction.com/articles/images/straw.jpg).  Part of why this fascinated me is that, at the time, I worked for people that bred black angus cattle, and I wondered if they stored their own specimens or if they used a third party like the place we passed.\n\nAs my sister and I are discussing this, M pops up and asks, \"*So they just draw blood for that, right?*\"\n\nA few things run through my mind.  I realize that the majority of us grew up in the Bible Belt and might be considered a little sheltered, but he's a guy.  I feel like a guy should know about guy parts, right?  I mean, if he were a girl and had never had a boyfriend, I could understand if she were a little hazy on the details.  But a guy asking if they draw blood to get a semen sample just stopped me in my tracks.  I wanted to ask so many questions that probably would have been inappropriate for our friend group at the moment.  \n\nLike you, I didn't judge, but I just wondered.  I knew he hadn't had sex, but had he ever masturbated?  Did he watch porn?  Did he know how things worked, ie the basic mechanics of it?  If he doesn't masturbate, what does he think wet dreams are?  Does he have those?  Part of it stems from the societal stereotype that all men are ravenous when it comes to sex.

At the time I was 22, my friend (we&amp;#39;ll call him M), was 23.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister graduated college with a degree in animal science, and we were talking about a business that we passed on the way to our friend&amp;#39;s house.  Basically the place was in the business of providing ways for cattle to breed with little to no risk.  If you had an animal you wanted to stud out, you could provide the place some samples and they&amp;#39;d freeze it &lt;a href=\"http://equine-reproduction.com/articles/images/straw.jpg\"&gt;in straws&lt;/a&gt;.  Part of why this fascinated me is that, at the time, I worked for people that bred black angus cattle, and I wondered if they stored their own specimens or if they used a third party like the place we passed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As my sister and I are discussing this, M pops up and asks, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;So they just draw blood for that, right?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few things run through my mind.  I realize that the majority of us grew up in the Bible Belt and might be considered a little sheltered, but he&amp;#39;s a guy.  I feel like a guy should know about guy parts, right?  I mean, if he were a girl and had never had a boyfriend, I could understand if she were a little hazy on the details.  But a guy asking if they draw blood to get a semen sample just stopped me in my tracks.  I wanted to ask so many questions that probably would have been inappropriate for our friend group at the moment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like you, I didn&amp;#39;t judge, but I just wondered.  I knew he hadn&amp;#39;t had sex, but had he ever masturbated?  Did he watch porn?  Did he know how things worked, ie the basic mechanics of it?  If he doesn&amp;#39;t masturbate, what does he think wet dreams are?  Does he have those?  Part of it stems from the societal stereotype that all men are ravenous when it comes to sex.
