At this point the internet was not yet commercialised and the only websites available were basic email and news websites. Although women were in the minority they used the internet to connect with each other. An electronic mailing list called Systers began in 1987 and connected technical women in computing. A quote from Kramarae and Taylor (1992) suggests society\u2019s attitude about what use those other than white men may have had for the internet at this time, \u201cwomen and other marginalized people use the internet to connect with kindred souls.\u201d12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2014 the gender gap has almost been bridged with women making up almost half of all internet users. Those with degrees still outweigh those without but there has been a rapid increase in internet users of all education levels. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From your own source.
