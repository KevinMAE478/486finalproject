So it&amp;#39;d quite easy ordinarily for the airline to control which rule would apply at any given time, meaning they are in control of the rules not being contradictory. In an oversold situation, all they have to do is sort it out at the gate to assure Rule 25 applies. But once you start letting confirmed reservation holders in and letting them take their seat, then it&amp;#39;s reasonable to believe that now they are covered under Rule 21, and having done so on their volation, the airline intended the passengers to be covered by Rule 21. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the boarded or not is a red herring as far as the Rule 21 applicability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bestof", "name": "t1_dg50ubg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491977913.0, "created_utc": 1491949113.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qayr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qayr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ncgo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Panaka", "parent_id": "t1_dg4n4xt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's a legal defenition in the FAR AIM and FAA case history.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a legal defenition in the FAR AIM and FAA case history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bestof", "name": "t1_dg4ncgo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962667.0, "created_utc": 1491933867.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4n4xt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JyveAFK", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ja8c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is that listed in UA's terms and conditions?

The most likely outcome is far and away a settlement, simply because this set of facts is fairly unprecedented and nobody wants to go to trial if the outcome is too unforeseeable. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bestof", "name": "t1_dg4v81e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971218.0, "created_utc": 1491942418.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qayr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52iod", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xela88", "parent_id": "t1_dg4f1sb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You seem to know what you're talking about and I have questions because I just don't get this situation.\n\n1) Are people right in implying that once you board a plane that hasn't taken off, you have a legal right to be there?

(\u201cADA\u201d), \u201cintroduce[d] more competition and less regulation of the airline industry on a gradual, controlled basis.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1211, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 4, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3737, 3740.\n\n\n&gt; Another concern of the legislature was that the existing act contained no provisions on State jurisdiction \u201cover airlines which provide both intrastate and interstate service.\u201d *275 Id. at 15, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, at 3751.2 Congress enacted the preemption provision, codified at 49 U.S.C., App., \u00a7 1305, to clarify the government's role in regulating carriers and to alleviate uncertainties and conflicts. H.R.Rep. No. 1211, supra, at 15\u201316, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, at 3751\u20133752. Although the House Report, in its brief discussion of this provision, focuses on problems caused by conflicting State and Federal regulations regarding air fares, the report evinces an intent to prevent states from regulating the routes, the rates and the services of any carrier subject to the Act. See id. The statute, in its final form, broadly prohibits States from enacting or enforcing \u201cany law, rule, regulation, standard or other **608 provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier\u201d authorized to provide air transportation by the Act. 49 U.S.C., App., \u00a7 1305(a)(1).\n\n\n&gt; The language in the preemption provision, along with the scope of the Act's regulatory scheme, make it clear that States may not regulate travel routes or passenger fares. Plaintiffs' claims in the instant case would have to be preempted, if at all, based on their relation to services, however; and, the Act does not provide equally effective guidance regarding this issue. Not surprisingly, past courts have adopted inconsistent interpretations of the provision as it pertains to services. Compare Anderson v. USAir, Inc., 818 F.2d 49 (D.C.Cir.1987) (reviewing contract claim but finding preemption of tort claims arising out of airline's refusal to accommodate seating requirements of blind passenger); Howard v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 793 F.Supp. 129 (S.D.Tex.1992) (all State claims relating to airline's treatment of decedent preempted because of their relation to services); and Miller v. Northwest Airlines, 253 N.J.Super. 618, 602 A.2d 785 (1992) (both tort and contract claims arising out of plaintiff's wrongful detention and confiscation of his property were attenuated to airline services and therefore neither was preempted).\n\n\n&gt; As specifically pertains to boarding practices, the Fifth, Eleventh and D.C.Circuits have generally dismissed lawsuits based on Section 1305. See O'Carroll v. American Airlines, Inc., 863 F.2d 11 (5th Cir.1989) cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1106, 109 S.Ct. 3158, 104 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1989); Anderson v. USAir, Inc., 818 F.2d 49 (D.C.Cir.1987); Von Anhalt v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 735 F.Supp. 1030 (S.D.Fla.1990) (Eleventh Circuit). *276 Both O'Carroll and Von Anhalt involved the ejection of disruptive passengers from their flights during the boarding process. In each instance, the court relied on the language in Section 1305 and held that the claims were expressly preempted. O'Carroll, supra, 863 F.2d, at 13, Von Anhalt, supra, at 1031 (relying on O'Carroll ).\n\n\n\n&gt; In addition, the O'Carroll Court pointed out that Section 1511 of the Act \u201cvests an air carrier with broad discretion with respect to whom will be granted or denied passage.\u201d O'Carroll, supra, 863 F.2d, at 12. That section states: \u201cSubject to reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the Administrator [Secretary of Transportation], any ... carrier may also refuse transportation of a passenger or property when, in the opinion of the carrier, such transportation would or might be inimical to safety of flight.\u201d 49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1511[a]. Reading Section 1305 in light of Section 1511, the O'Carroll Court concluded that Congress intended boarding procedures\u2014including the decision to eject passengers during boarding\u2014to remain the province of the agency regulating interstate carriers.3 O'Carroll, supra, 863 F.2d, at 12\u201313. In a case not triggering a preemption analysis, the New York Court of Appeals also viewed Section 1511 as one conferring broad discretion upon air carriers covered by the Act. See Adamsons v. American Airlines, Inc., 58 N.Y.2d 42, 46\u201347, 457 N.Y.S.2d 771, 774, 444 N.E.2d 21, 23\u201324 (1982) (citations omitted), reargument denied, 58 N.Y.2d 971, 460 N.Y.S.2d 1029, 447 N.E.2d 89 (1983), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3540, 77 L.Ed.2d 1390 (1983).\n\n\nHirsch v. American Airlines, 160 Misc.2d 272\n\n\nThis is just preliminary research on the matter that I remember from writing a brief on this topic my first year of law school concerning the removal of a passenger that has already boarded. \n\nWhat I remember finding is that this never really works out in favor of the plaintiffs because the Airlines get a lot of deference in these matters.

(\u201cADA\u201d), \u201cintroduce[d] more competition and less regulation of the airline industry on a gradual, controlled basis.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1211, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 4, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp;amp; Admin.News 3737, 3740.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another concern of the legislature was that the existing act contained no provisions on State jurisdiction \u201cover airlines which provide both intrastate and interstate service.\u201d &lt;em&gt;275 Id. at 15, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp;amp; Admin.News, at 3751.2 Congress enacted the preemption provision, codified at 49 U.S.C., App., \u00a7 1305, to clarify the government&amp;#39;s role in regulating carriers and to alleviate uncertainties and conflicts. H.R.Rep. No. 1211, supra, at 15\u201316, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp;amp; Admin.News, at 3751\u20133752. Although the House Report, in its brief discussion of this provision, focuses on problems caused by conflicting State and Federal regulations regarding air fares, the report evinces an intent to prevent states from regulating the routes, the rates and the services of any carrier subject to the Act. See id. The statute, in its final form, broadly prohibits States from enacting or enforcing \u201cany law, rule, regulation, standard or other *&lt;/em&gt;608 provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier\u201d authorized to provide air transportation by the Act. 49 U.S.C., App., \u00a7 1305(a)(1).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The language in the preemption provision, along with the scope of the Act&amp;#39;s regulatory scheme, make it clear that States may not regulate travel routes or passenger fares. Plaintiffs&amp;#39; claims in the instant case would have to be preempted, if at all, based on their relation to services, however; and, the Act does not provide equally effective guidance regarding this issue. Not surprisingly, past courts have adopted inconsistent interpretations of the provision as it pertains to services. Compare Anderson v. USAir, Inc., 818 F.2d 49 (D.C.Cir.1987) (reviewing contract claim but finding preemption of tort claims arising out of airline&amp;#39;s refusal to accommodate seating requirements of blind passenger); Howard v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 793 F.Supp. 129 (S.D.Tex.1992) (all State claims relating to airline&amp;#39;s treatment of decedent preempted because of their relation to services); and Miller v. Northwest Airlines, 253 N.J.Super. 618, 602 A.2d 785 (1992) (both tort and contract claims arising out of plaintiff&amp;#39;s wrongful detention and confiscation of his property were attenuated to airline services and therefore neither was preempted).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As specifically pertains to boarding practices, the Fifth, Eleventh and D.C.Circuits have generally dismissed lawsuits based on Section 1305. See O&amp;#39;Carroll v. American Airlines, Inc., 863 F.2d 11 (5th Cir.1989) cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1106, 109 S.Ct. 3158, 104 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1989); Anderson v. USAir, Inc., 818 F.2d 49 (D.C.Cir.1987); Von Anhalt v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 735 F.Supp. 1030 (S.D.Fla.1990) (Eleventh Circuit). *276 Both O&amp;#39;Carroll and Von Anhalt involved the ejection of disruptive passengers from their flights during the boarding process. In each instance, the court relied on the language in Section 1305 and held that the claims were expressly preempted. O&amp;#39;Carroll, supra, 863 F.2d, at 13, Von Anhalt, supra, at 1031 (relying on O&amp;#39;Carroll ).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the O&amp;#39;Carroll Court pointed out that Section 1511 of the Act \u201cvests an air carrier with broad discretion with respect to whom will be granted or denied passage.\u201d O&amp;#39;Carroll, supra, 863 F.2d, at 12. That section states: \u201cSubject to reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the Administrator [Secretary of Transportation], any ... carrier may also refuse transportation of a passenger or property when, in the opinion of the carrier, such transportation would or might be inimical to safety of flight.\u201d 49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1511[a]. Reading Section 1305 in light of Section 1511, the O&amp;#39;Carroll Court concluded that Congress intended boarding procedures\u2014including the decision to eject passengers during boarding\u2014to remain the province of the agency regulating interstate carriers.3 O&amp;#39;Carroll, supra, 863 F.2d, at 12\u201313. In a case not triggering a preemption analysis, the New York Court of Appeals also viewed Section 1511 as one conferring broad discretion upon air carriers covered by the Act. See Adamsons v. American Airlines, Inc., 58 N.Y.2d 42, 46\u201347, 457 N.Y.S.2d 771, 774, 444 N.E.2d 21, 23\u201324 (1982) (citations omitted), reargument denied, 58 N.Y.2d 971, 460 N.Y.S.2d 1029, 447 N.E.2d 89 (1983), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3540, 77 L.Ed.2d 1390 (1983).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hirsch v. American Airlines, 160 Misc.2d 272&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just preliminary research on the matter that I remember from writing a brief on this topic my first year of law school concerning the removal of a passenger that has already boarded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I remember finding is that this never really works out in favor of the plaintiffs because the Airlines get a lot of deference in these matters. I also do not know the full context of the story and haven&amp;#39;t seen any video, so i have been hesitant on asserting liability on either party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should mention that what this is basically saying is that many state based tort claims are pre-empted by the Federal Act and the airline will get a lot of deference when it comes to the removal of a passenger.
