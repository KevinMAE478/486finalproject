Cheap aluminum pans have never lasted me more than 6 months.

I have cast iron pans that are literally over 100 years old and still serviceable.\n\nI'm the OP from the linked post, and I'll be the first to admit...some people take cast iron too far. I say that as someone who has restored over a hundred pans and currently has 2-3 dozen in the garage. \n\nBut it's not the be-all, end-all of cookware. I have a few different pans I regularly use. I have a set of stainless that I just love for things like sauces, saute dishes and candies. I have a few anodized aluminum pans I use pretty much exclusively for scrambled eggs (I don't care what anyone says...cast iron SUCKS at scrambled eggs. I'll fry eggs in cast iron all day, but if I'm scrambling them, it ain't going in the iron). \n\nOther problems with cast iron...it is probably one of the worst in terms of evenly-heated cooking surfaces. This is contrary to what a lot of evangelists believe, they'll tell you it's great for even-heating...it ain't. You can take an IR thermometer to a heated cast iron pan and *easily* get at least a 30 degree swing in different spots on the pan. \n\nStainless and copper, those are great for even heating. Aluminum isn't bad. Cast iron? Nah. \n\nBut cast iron DOES have a *much* higher emissivity rating (.95)  than stainless (.15 or so) or standard nonstick aluminum (.30) and a bit higher than anodized aluminum (.77) , which means the interior of a cast iron pan will be much hotter than the interior of a stainless steel or standard aluminum pan, even if the surface temps are pretty close to the same. That makes cast iron much better at searing a thick steak, or making a grilled cheese, or cooking pancakes. All of these dishes which benefit from more infrared heat bouncing around the pan will cook more evenly in cast iron and will better avoid the problem of a burnt outside and an undercooked inside (granted, you can still avoid it on stainless...it's just a little less forgiving). It's also why cornbread baked in a cast iron pan beats anything else...the conductive heat creates a perfectly browned crust while the IR heat bakes the inside evenly. \n\nCast iron is also a little more reactive in terms of changing the temp than either stainless or aluminum. That said, it's *not* as good as copper...but it's also a tenth of the price, so not a bad trade all things considered. \n\nAs far as work, the cast iron evangelists blow this out of proportion as well. It's INCREDIBLY hard to go wrong with cast iron. If you go to Walmart and buy a lodge pre-seasoned skillet off the shelf, it'll likely last you the rest of your life without you having to reseason it or do any sort of maintenance beyond rinsing it off. You can fry an egg in a brand new Lodge without a worry (older cast iron needs to be seasoned a little more, but since Lodges are pre-seasoned...you don't have that worry).\n\nYou can't put it in the dishwasher, sure (but you probably shouldn't be putting aluminum in it either...unless you're using expensive anodized aluminum pans instead of dirt-cheap generic nonstick).

Been using cast iron for YEARS now. While I do own a nice non-stick cooking set, I cook in my cast iron whenever I can. \n\nAs to your question about if it's OK to wash your cast iron...It is absolutely **fine** to wash cast iron WITH WATER ONLY. The reason you don't \"*wash*\" cast iron is because usually, people wash things with soap/detergent. Soap and detergent will break down and remove the seasoning you put on it.\n\nSeasoning is what makes cast iron \"nonstick\". To understand how it works, you have to understand that iron is a very porous metal.  \nWhen you season a cast iron pan/pot/skillet/whatever, you cover it in a fat or oil (some people swear by flaxseed oil but I use lard for initial seasoning and it has always served me well), then heat it up (usually in an oven), and let it sit there. The pores open up and draw that fat into the pan.\n\nYou know that oil and water don't mix, right? Washing a hot cast iron pan with water is the best way to get it clean.  \nDo you know what happens when you mix soap or detergent with fats and oils? It does what it's designed to do...it breaks down the fats/oils and makes them more water soluble. That's why you're able to wash greasy stuff with soap and that soap and grease will drain out with the water.\n\nThe problem is that this process completely destroys the seasoning you built up. That's why you ONLY wash with water.\n\nThe other thing you can't do with washing cast iron is let it soak in the water or leaving excess water in the cast iron. It's IRON. Iron + Water = Rust. You will destroy your pans by leaving water in them. \n\nThe proper way is to rinse it out when it's hot, get the excess oil and foods out of the cast iron, dry it off (you can use a towel, paper towels, or just toss it back on the hot burner), and finally put a bit of oil in it and coat the inside of it.\n\nTL:DR - Washing cast iron is important but should only be done with water. Hot cast iron into the sink &gt; get rid of excess oil and food &gt; dry it off completely &gt; put a light coat of oil or fat on the inside.\n\nPeople who learn to use cast iron correctly don't go back from it because of how effective it is at cooking and how easy it is to clean.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey OP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, good call on cast iron.
