The basic premise is that it is your job as the parent to make healthy and palatable meals. That's it. Your kids can choose to eat or not, but you do not make special meals. You don't bribe or cajole or praise or threaten. Also, toddlers are picky! They are trying to assert independence. They also need a *LOT* less food than you think. 1 tablespoon per year of age is normal.

Maybe it&amp;#39;s a day to go to the library and pick out a stack of books for the week. Grocery store trip - kids get to pick a new fruit and vegetable each trip. Go to Home Depot and get seeds to plant for a spring herb garden. Go on a neighborhood scavenger hunt. Have a picnic somewhere. Go to a gymnastics class. Go to a mom play group meetup. etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a mid-morning snack they get every day at 10am to avoid getting hangry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come home, have lunch at noon. Kids go down for a nap/quiet rest at 1pm,no exceptions. They can quietly read library books or sleep but will get silently walked back to bed ad infinitum until they stay there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After rest time, kids have art time. They can color, use play-dough, water colors, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put on some fun kids music or a kid&amp;#39;s podcast and everyone helps cook dinner. Kids can tear lettuce or wash carrots. Someone can fold napkins. Everyone gets a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids watch ONE TV show while you finish up dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sits down together to eat. Everyone clears their own plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bath, pajamas, the play time until bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories, kiss goodnight, the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as your kids hating food, I recommend Ellyn Satter&amp;#39;s books. The basic premise is that it is your job as the parent to make healthy and palatable meals. That&amp;#39;s it. Your kids can choose to eat or not, but you do not make special meals. You don&amp;#39;t bribe or cajole or praise or threaten. Also, toddlers are picky! They are trying to assert independence. They also need a &lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt; less food than you think. 1 tablespoon per year of age is normal. As long as they don&amp;#39;t drop off the growth curve stay strong and offer healthy, fresh meals!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg80iux", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137931.0, "created_utc": 1492109131.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65585w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg92qrj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pinglenook", "parent_id": "t3_65585w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Definitely eat at set times!
