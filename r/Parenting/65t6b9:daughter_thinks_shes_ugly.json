I was not \"put together\"; I was *obese*, not merely chubby, didn't take care of myself or care about being well groomed or dressing well, where as this guy was *literally* on the football team and two and a half years older than me. He was *the* definition of a manly hunk (now he's *fabulous*).\n\nAnd according to him, he fell in love with *me* even before the time I fell for him.

But he told me he loved me in spite of me not being \"attractive\" because he loved my personality like I loved his, and that more than made up for it. My appearance didn't even register to him when he admitted to himself how he felt about me. As cheesy and corny as it sounds, love truly doesn't discriminate on looks and has no boundaries on circumstance.\n\nThe same will be true for her, and she needs to know that.\n\nAs for things to actually *do* to make her feel better, you have a few different options.\n\nYou say she's chubby, and that was precisely where most of my issues came from.

I felt like super-man after a good workout. I'm not saying your daughter isn't beautiful as she is or that she needs to change, but going to the gym, even if it doesn't change her actual appearance is a great way for her to boost her confidence. She'll feel like she's on top of the world. Or at least, she will after the initial \"oh my god this treadmill can go and fuck itself\" phase.\n\nAnd speaking of self-esteem, if she has confidence in her appearance and carries herself like she's owning it, that actually will make her seem more attractive, because *confidence* is attractive (to a point of course - nobody likes cockiness or a superiority complex either).\n\nYou can also maybe, say, take her out and get some new trendy clothes. Or maybe she can get her hair done or something.

You don't want to be the girl that can't wear a two piece because she'll get made fun of. You try to grow a thick skin so that you're confident enough to do some of those things anyway - like asking a guy out - but it's hard because your mom is ALWAYS there, being pretty and you just can't shake the icky feelings that brings up. \n\nWhat helped me was moving out for college. I love my mom, really I do, but not having to see her (and having friends that had never seen her) every day REALLY helped me develop a new idea of pretty because I was finally able to break away from the old one. \n\nWhat also helped me was feeling like I had real control over how I looked.

(He makes beautiful music and directs movies with his friends and no one finds these uninteresting, on the contrary those who know them find it meaningful. ) Now he is refusing going to therapy.

She was worrying about probable side effects also. But I argued that a suicide danger is worse than any potential side effect /like impotence/. It was not easy to agree and decide.

He complains about being too skinny (which is true - he has a problem with eating enough) - and he also feels to be &amp;quot;uninteresting&amp;quot; /and feels life in general has no &amp;quot;worth&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;/. (He makes beautiful music and directs movies with his friends and no one finds these uninteresting, on the contrary those who know them find it meaningful. ) Now he is refusing going to therapy. As he kept claiming to be depressed and even having suicidal fantasies I had to put him on serotonine-reuptake drugs (and he says he feels hopeful now). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was also similarly disharmonic/distonic when in my twenties and was also put on anti-depressants but it has passed with age and could stop taking them. (I think medically prescribed drug-taking is only dangerous for addicted types /who have other childhood wounds too/. We did have intense debates over it with my wife and this has been my argument. She was worrying about probable side effects also. But I argued that a suicide danger is worse than any potential side effect /like impotence/. It was not easy to agree and decide. But basically it was my son&amp;#39;s decision.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway I feel sorry for kids feeling unhappy - especially in such a general way and without any power to influence these seemingly real traits like &amp;quot;uglyness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;being &amp;quot;uninteresting&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In your place if it is a constant or recurrent depressive feeling I would explain to my child the possibilities : therapy or prescription drugs to re-evaluate her (fantasy) situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that forced or even sincere praise can work. (I am 100% sure my son is an extremely interesting person and not only from a parental viewpoint - but he dismisses such arguments).

Kids need to recognize how lucky they are...it helps to put things into perspective.  Understanding that she&amp;#39;s one of the privileged few will help.  Help her to understand that having access to education, clean water, accessible food, a home, parents, etc...makes her extremely lucky.  That she&amp;#39;s healthy both mentally and physically...something so many people don&amp;#39;t have...will help her understand that the way she looks is the least important thing about herself.  She needs to focus outward...and you can help by providing her with perspective on how lucky she is.  I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of volunteer and charity work with my girls and it really helps focus them on what&amp;#39;s important...to look outside themselves...and to concentrate on the real reason why they&amp;#39;re on the planet.  Its not to worry about how pretty they are...its to live a fulfilling life and help/serve others.  Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dge6m0m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492494602.0, "created_utc": 1492465802.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
