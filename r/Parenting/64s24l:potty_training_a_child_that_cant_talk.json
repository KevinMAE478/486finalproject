The trick we used was have a small kids potty wherever he was and just let him run around naked. No pants at home, no underwear, just completely naked. Every time he had a little accident or whatnot, we would just put him on the potty and explain that&amp;#39;s where he needs to go. Eventually he just kind of picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At school, they wouldn&amp;#39;t believe us that he was potty trained because he was mostly non-verbal at 3. On his 3rd birthday we forced them to let him wear boxers to school, and in the 3 months he has only had 3 accidents. Non-verbal kids are full of surprises, and a lot smarter than you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg9f2c2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492218370.0, "created_utc": 1492189570.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
