There are moments in life, where every person will have to deal with something hurtful, or embarrassing, and it&amp;#39;s important to move on, and not get stuck, in that moment.&amp;quot;   as a Young boy, he&amp;#39;s starting to feel a little like the &amp;quot;Man&amp;quot; of the house I&amp;#39;m sure,  and to have what little &amp;quot;Manhood&amp;quot;  no pun intended taken away from him like that, can be devastating to his self-worth and esteem.  Find ways for him to do things that you can edify him with around the house, and make him feel like he matters, and will always matter like that.   in a way that he can understand, and is not overtly &amp;quot;Mom-ification&amp;quot;  what I mean by that is the coddling and overly-smootchy stuff.  Also, if you have a strong Male role model in your life for him,  Uncles, Grandfathers, etc,  engage them to help talk to him, and build him back up.    /rantoff  Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg9srpv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234864.0, "created_utc": 1492206064.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 119}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ep1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga476p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hawkinsst7", "parent_id": "t1_dga2nqd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, don't feel conflicted. it's not victim blaming at all if handled right.

But I don't think teaching him to pretend not to care is actually protecting him from bullying, it's just teaching him to internalise the process, which is just as painful, but much more pernicious because by the time he's 20 or 30 or 50 he won't even notice he's doing it, and it won't seem abnormal to tell himself he can't show weakness, he can't feel hurt, etc.\n\nLike, would this boy's Monday be easier if he just pretended not to care?
