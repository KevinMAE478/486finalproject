We don&amp;#39;t have a colour printer so the other kid said he would print it. He didn&amp;#39;t show up Thursday. They had English right after homeroom. The teacher yelled at my daughter, blamed everything on her, then told her that if she couldn&amp;#39;t hand in the project by lunch she would fail. Apparently, she told my daughter that she had been overly controlling, refused to let the boy do any of the work, couldn&amp;#39;t handle it herself and was blaming him so she could get an extra 4 days to finish it with the Easter weekend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter left the class sobbing and called me from the office.
