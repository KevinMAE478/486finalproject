Only in the last few years have I come to understand my mood swings mainly stem from anxiety.\n\nI'll preface this with my parents are good people. They are nothing but kind and loving individuals who care for my siblings and I. That being said they were not disciplinarians by any means. We were all very poor students, homework was barely an idea in my home. Cleaning up after ourselves was not an idea instilled in us until we were much older and made bigger messes, but it was much too late to change anything. I still struggle with caring about a messy environment. I was straight up lazy about these things.\n\nPre-Teen angst played a large role as well in why I acted the way I did. I was under the impression my parents barely cared about me, that my siblings hated me and the few friends I had were the only people that I could trust. I was always overweight and was teased mercilessly for that. My anger issues were intensified by this and I was always quick to lash out in defense. Middle school is an extremely harsh environment, especially if you're reactionary. Bullies thrive on that.\n\nI needed far more structure than I was given. I needed proper counseling (not school counselors, they were terrible and I doubt that's changed). Though I would have hated and fought these things at the time I genuinely think they would have helped me get to a healthier mental state much earlier in life.\n\nI don't know if this helps at all, obviously circumstances are going to be different but she sounds alot like the way I treated my family at that age and beyond.

I am much more aware of my issues now than I was at that age obviously. Only in the last few years have I come to understand my mood swings mainly stem from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll preface this with my parents are good people. They are nothing but kind and loving individuals who care for my siblings and I. That being said they were not disciplinarians by any means. We were all very poor students, homework was barely an idea in my home. Cleaning up after ourselves was not an idea instilled in us until we were much older and made bigger messes, but it was much too late to change anything. I still struggle with caring about a messy environment. I was straight up lazy about these things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-Teen angst played a large role as well in why I acted the way I did. I was under the impression my parents barely cared about me, that my siblings hated me and the few friends I had were the only people that I could trust. I was always overweight and was teased mercilessly for that. My anger issues were intensified by this and I was always quick to lash out in defense. Middle school is an extremely harsh environment, especially if you&amp;#39;re reactionary. Bullies thrive on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I needed far more structure than I was given. I needed proper counseling (not school counselors, they were terrible and I doubt that&amp;#39;s changed). Though I would have hated and fought these things at the time I genuinely think they would have helped me get to a healthier mental state much earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this helps at all, obviously circumstances are going to be different but she sounds alot like the way I treated my family at that age and beyond. I wish my parents had done more about it, they mostly let me steamroll them and that never helped me in the long run. I wish I was better to them but anger is hard to contain when you have so much of it so young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg8d4xd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492152671.0, "created_utc": 1492123871.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6581wk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg87abd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lovelight_shine", "parent_id": "t3_6581wk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is this new or a big change in behavior for her?

A few thoughts:\n\n1. At 12, you daughter can eat the food that has been prepared for her, or she can make her own from what is in the fridge/pantry. Do not otherwise engage. If she throws a fit, she throws a fit. If at any point you feel her health is affected, discuss with her pediatrician. Also consider offering to let her come on grocery trips to pick out a few food items that she likes. She doesn't get to make you a list or anything like that, she must go with to the grocery store. You're not a servant. \n\n2. She doesn't get any \"screen time\" (so no phone or ipad) until her homework and chores are done. And back to the eating issue, she must sit at the table even if she chooses not to eat. No phones at the table. \n\n3. Its going to appear like the last thing she wants, but try instituting more family outings where phones aren't allowed. At first she probably won't talk to you, but eventually she might. You might try signing you guys up for some volunteering as well. If she likes horses, maybe you can volunteer at a horse stable or sanctuary, a pet shelter, a soup kitchen, or your local food depository. \n\n3. Lastly, you really can't be walking on egg shells around her. Like a toddler, you have to ignore her tantrums. You can't let her run the house, otherwise you get into a situation like you are. If you don't see any improvements after a few months of instituting these tips, therapy is the next step. She might need the help of a professional to help process her feelings.

A few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 12, you daughter can eat the food that has been prepared for her, or she can make her own from what is in the fridge/pantry. Do not otherwise engage. If she throws a fit, she throws a fit. If at any point you feel her health is affected, discuss with her pediatrician. Also consider offering to let her come on grocery trips to pick out a few food items that she likes. She doesn&amp;#39;t get to make you a list or anything like that, she must go with to the grocery store. You&amp;#39;re not a servant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She doesn&amp;#39;t get any &amp;quot;screen time&amp;quot; (so no phone or ipad) until her homework and chores are done. And back to the eating issue, she must sit at the table even if she chooses not to eat. No phones at the table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its going to appear like the last thing she wants, but try instituting more family outings where phones aren&amp;#39;t allowed. At first she probably won&amp;#39;t talk to you, but eventually she might. You might try signing you guys up for some volunteering as well. If she likes horses, maybe you can volunteer at a horse stable or sanctuary, a pet shelter, a soup kitchen, or your local food depository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you really can&amp;#39;t be walking on egg shells around her. Like a toddler, you have to ignore her tantrums. You can&amp;#39;t let her run the house, otherwise you get into a situation like you are. If you don&amp;#39;t see any improvements after a few months of instituting these tips, therapy is the next step. She might need the help of a professional to help process her feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg9aop5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213451.0, "created_utc": 1492184651.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6581wk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9foiy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "angry_pecan", "parent_id": "t3_6581wk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Take stuff away if she can't act like a reasonable human being.
