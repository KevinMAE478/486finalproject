[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Parenting", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly I just want to complain about this situation, but I&amp;#39;m also desperately hoping somebody else has been through something similar and has advice for what to do, because I&amp;#39;m completely lost. Probably going to be a long post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my daughter is 16. For most of her life, she was fine. She was shyer than most people (e.g. wouldn&amp;#39;t play in a park with other kids she didn&amp;#39;t know well, even as a toddler; hated talking to strangers and would sometimes just not respond if somebody talked to her because she was so shy), but still played outside on our street, had friends at school, volunteered in school plays, etc. She was perfectly happy playing on her own, and I would&amp;#39;ve described her as generally quiet and shy. She has a 3-years-younger sister, who is the opposite, generally loud and outgoing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even with her shyness, there was no hint of any depression, she was almost always very cheerful, had positive thoughts, and would bring herself out of a low mood, and her shyness didn&amp;#39;t seem to hold her back from anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting at around 13, she grew to be more and more shy, and became very anxious about what other people were thinking of her. She stopped playing outside with other kids in the neighborhood. She stopped going into shops on her own. If you shopped with her, she would not select a garment from the rack by herself; she said she was anxious she would drop it and be laughed at, or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gradually had less and less friends at school. She worried that the friends she did have actually didn&amp;#39;t like her, and were only pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At age 14 she started having panic attacks. Sometimes it would be about something (watching a scary movie), and other times brought on seemingly by nothing, like just sitting in class. They started out a few months apart, but became more frequent, probably weekly. But still she was (at least outwardly) happy. She had plenty of interests (mostly solitary). She enjoyed reading, writing, playing videogames, baking, fashion design, playing her guitar, and keeping a hamster. She also generally got along well with her younger sister, they played together a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she started doing her GCSE exams, things got worse. For non-English people, GCSEs are subjects you choose and then take exams in, you then leave high school at 16 with your qualifications from those GCSEs. GCSE grades are important to the schools (they&amp;#39;re ranked nationally against all schools), and the schools really drum it into you the importance of them, tell you to be thinking about a career, what you want to do for the rest of your life, etc. She felt really anxious about the future, and she had no idea what she wanted to do. She said everyone around her at school was doing well and knew what they wanted to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She still enjoyed school, and was always enthusiastic about her subjects. But when it came to exam time, she was having panic attacks more or less daily. She started saying she couldn&amp;#39;t get out of bed. She would lay awake at night worrying about things. She struggled through, passed 5 GCSEs with good grades and stayed home for a further 2 exams so she failed them. It was a really stressful time for all of us. Then it was summer vacation, and things were fine. She turned 16 and decided to stay at the same school for sixth form (for Americans, this is like midway between high school and college). In sixth form you get to choose all of your subjects, and you get about 10 hours of school less each week than in high school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went to the doctor and got her a prescription for an anti-anxiety medicine, which doesn&amp;#39;t stop you being anxious but damps down the symptoms (heart rate, sweating, breathing) so it doesn&amp;#39;t spiral into panic attacks. That helped some, and she didn&amp;#39;t have any panic attacks while on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the first week of school, she missed a day and said she couldn&amp;#39;t get out of bed. She said she needed a break from school. She said she couldn&amp;#39;t do it. Things carried on like that for a month or so, with her missing one or two days a week. Then it moved to three days a week. We tried all kinds of punishments and rewards, to no effect. Eventually she was missing four days a week. We talked to the school, they said she could go to a special room on her own in school, that she could change her classes, reduce her classload, get her schoolwork sent home some days, etc. but it gave no improvement. A couple months into the new school year, she dropped out of school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got her a therapist, who she saw I think four times. The therapist said she has depression. The first three times, she lied about things and said what she thought the therapist wanted to hear. The fourth time, after we talked about that, she was honest about her feelings, and she said it was a good session and that she felt hopeful about the future. Then she stopped going. First she said she didn&amp;#39;t want help, that she didn&amp;#39;t want to get better. Then she said that she would get better on her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s been out of school for four months now, but things are just getting worse. She started harming herself. Cutting her arms, burning herself on the radiator, clipping her skin with nail clippers. She&amp;#39;s applied for paid apprenticeships in fields she&amp;#39;s interested in, but even when they&amp;#39;ve told her she will definitely get the position, she has not contacted them back because of anxiety. She&amp;#39;s been staying up later and later, often until 6 in the morning just before everyone else gets up, and then sleeping until mid-afternoon. She isn&amp;#39;t fat, but she says she is, and tries to eat less. But when she has allowance money, she spends almost 100% of it on stuff like ice cream and chips. It&amp;#39;s common for her to have a pint of ice cream every day if she has the money for it. She&amp;#39;s very, very down on herself. She asks why I&amp;#39;m being nice if I tell her I love her. She says she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve it if I give her a gift. She says she has no skills and there is nothing interesting about her. She asks why we don&amp;#39;t just give up on her. She will sometimes do some baking (if one of us is helping her), but the whole time she&amp;#39;s saying things like &amp;quot;This is going to be terrible,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m doing this wrong,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve messed it all up,&amp;quot; even though basically everything she makes is great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her shyness continues to get worse. She&amp;#39;s completely fine with us and her sister, but absolutely nobody else. Her grandparents visit every few weeks, but she won&amp;#39;t even come out of her room to see them. If I ask her to come out and see them, she says she can&amp;#39;t. She rarely goes out of the house. She won&amp;#39;t go into our corner shop (literally 50 feet away from the house), and actually pays her sister to go buy things for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a month ago she tried to kill herself by overdosing on her anti-anxiety medicine while she was alone at home. After she took the overdose, she changed her mind (or didn&amp;#39;t really want it in the first place), then she called the police and they saved her at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a couple months she carried on saying she didn&amp;#39;t want help (even after the suicide attempt), that she didn&amp;#39;t want things to change. She still refused to see the therapist. I told her I thought that she did want change, but that she was afraid of it, that she was afraid of getting better because she would have to do uncomfortable things for it (i.e. things outside her comfort zone). She cried and agreed, which felt like a major breakthrough even though it didn&amp;#39;t change anything. She sabotages herself in lots of ways. Recently we tried triple chronotherapy, a 4 day treatment for depression which involves resetting your circadian rhythm with a SAD light daily, restricting your sleep, and going to bed and getting up at prescribed times. She was hopeful about it before we started, although also worried and said she was anxious that if she got better she would have to do things. It went graet the first two days, but on the third day she intentionally stayed up past the prescribed sleep time so that the whole things was ruined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here we are. My daughter is depressed, anxious almost beyond belief, and refuses or sabotages anything that could possibly help. Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Mainly I just want to complain about this situation, but I'm also desperately hoping somebody else has been through something similar and has advice for what to do, because I'm completely lost.
