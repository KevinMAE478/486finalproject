My kid is 2, so my feedback is not pertinent to your age group, but hopefully it's still somewhat useful. I think it's perfectly healthy to have boundaries on when you are available for play. Do not drop things you are involved in to play, but give guidelines on when you will be available. \"I'm busy with x, I'll be free in 5 minutes and then we can do y.\" I also think it's fine to have limits on how long you will do something. I indulge my daughter(2) in those \"again, again\" activities until I feel tired and then I say, \"ok, one more time!\" Then stick to it, despite any whining, maybe use distraction or suggestions to redirect kid to a new activity. Your son is probably not still in that \"again\" phase, but I imagine you could instead give him ample warning on when your involvement will end. \"Oh, I have to do x, so I'll do y for 5 more minutes with you and then I need to stop.\"  I also think it's okay to say \"gee, I'm too tired for y, right now.\" and suggest something else for them to do alone.\n\n Also,  I try to involve my kid in things I'm doing if possible. So.. if I'm cooking and she wants attention, she can help me measure or stir or set the table. It slows things down, but she enjoys the interactiveness and learns from it, and I get to keep doing my activity. \n\nBasically, I guess I feel that it's important for kids to realize that parents are people too and have their own lives and feelings, and are not always available. I do try to play with my daughter, when I have energy and time. It's important for her growth and imagination to have that interaction. And plus, it's lovely to see that childish joy that won't last forever. Ultimately, though, I abide by the philosophy that a happy parent makes for a happier parent/child relationship. And my happiness is contingent on having healthy boundaries.\n\nEdit: I see that I didn't really answer your specific questions, more so responded based on your answers to other comments.. oh well! My husband and I don't really \"engage\" our daughter in play, but we will play if she asks and if we are not busy.
