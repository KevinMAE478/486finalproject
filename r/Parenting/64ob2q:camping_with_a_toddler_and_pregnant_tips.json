I have a 23 month old, a 3 year old and am pregnant. Here are my tips!\n\nBring all the bedding to keep you warm and comfortable. Don't skimp on bedding. We have those little fold out kid couches for beds for our kids. They love them and are something familiar from home. Last camping trip I didn't bring all the bedding and DH and I were freezing all night! This time we were snug. It made a huge difference. I didn't bother with sleeping bags for the kids. We camp in Spring and Autumn (cold at night, fine during the day, campfires allowed, low chance of rain, not too hot, not too cold).\n\nOver pack clothes for kids. They get dirty very fast! Related, we had a rule of no shoes in the tent and shoes must be worn outside the tent. Our tent is quite big and has a large covered entrance. We put down some foam mats and a tarp and used that area for a bath, shoes, suitcases etc. It was an excellent in between space for the kids to feel protected and safe, without being in the sleeping area of the tent. They mostly wore their gum boots, which were great at keeping their feet clean and dry. They can take them on and off easily themselves.

I have a 23 month old, a 3 year old and am pregnant. Here are my tips!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bring all the bedding to keep you warm and comfortable. Don&amp;#39;t skimp on bedding. We have those little fold out kid couches for beds for our kids. They love them and are something familiar from home. Last camping trip I didn&amp;#39;t bring all the bedding and DH and I were freezing all night! This time we were snug. It made a huge difference. I didn&amp;#39;t bother with sleeping bags for the kids. We camp in Spring and Autumn (cold at night, fine during the day, campfires allowed, low chance of rain, not too hot, not too cold).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over pack clothes for kids. They get dirty very fast! Related, we had a rule of no shoes in the tent and shoes must be worn outside the tent. Our tent is quite big and has a large covered entrance.
