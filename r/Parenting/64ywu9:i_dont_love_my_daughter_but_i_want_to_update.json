As others have said, even with more traditional roads to parenthood, that googly love doesn&amp;#39;t always happen immediately. Newborns and toddlers can sometimes be hard to love. Also, love alone doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee good parenting. So what you are doing sounds amazing and fantastic. You sound like an incredibly strong person. I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;ve been able to acknowledge the resentment and difficult emotions you are feeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish you and your family the best as you continue growing together. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg75occ", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087377.0, "created_utc": 1492058577.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ywu9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7dfaq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arwynfaun", "parent_id": "t3_64ywu9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am so happy for you and that you've been able to clear your head!
