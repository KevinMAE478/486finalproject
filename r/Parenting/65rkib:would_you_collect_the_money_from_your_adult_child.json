The problem is, the deal with him being in college was that he could live at home and go to community college and then state university. His grades were always not good at all. But he had high SAT scores so he was offered a scholarship to a small liberal arts college. He wanted to go there. I actually did all the paperwork and applying for various financial aid and for scholarships. Because his grades in high school were so bad, we said we would not pay for college. He is the oldest child and we are not wealthy people who can just throw money at a situation like that. Plus, my husband and I are still paying off our own student loans. Student loan interest rates were about 8.5% when we went through college so our principal more than doubled before we were making payments equal to more than the interest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Son also has ASD. He is intelligent and a computer science major, but he makes poor decisions quite often. He decided to just not get a job during the summers. He has a work study at college. However, due to the fact that we paid his bill at the beginning of the semester, he was able to pocket the work study money. I had told him to save the money for the next term when it would be due for classes then, but he did not. He spent it going out and also on video games. Additionally, he had to take summer classes because he flunked classes and had to maintain minimum progress toward a degree. ALSO, he lost one of his scholarships twice so we had to cover that cost.

BUT, now we realize how bleak the situation is financially for the younger kids to go to college, as well as need to pay off the student loans. AND, my husband got laid off several months ago. He did agree to pay us back long ago. And fact is, he should be entering the job market soon and he will be living with us so he will have no bills other than minimal student loans. His student loans were kept to a minimum, less than the max for subsidized, because we kept paying. I think he has about $12K in student loans. He never had to take out unsubsidized (which I had to when I was in college). He was supposed to help to the best of his ability to pay for school, but then did not get jobs. I STUPIDLY paid his bill off before spring break thinking he needed that in the clear for graduation. But then, turned out, his college refunds the enrollment deposit we put down years ago when they graduate. So now he is getting a refund for that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I just ask him to pay me back? It was agreed in advance that he would pay me back. But now, the college cut the check for the refund of the excess I paid on his schooling to him. And since he had the refunds, he is now simply receiving his work study money again rather than it going toward his bill. I feel like I need to ask for the money, especially the refund of the deposit I made, but then I feel like a schmuck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please help me handle this in a kind sweet way. Thank you.
