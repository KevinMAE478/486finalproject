For a great kid friendly challenging game look no further than Ducktales Remastered and Shovel Knight for the PS3/PS4.

Its an awesome adventure game with some minor cartoon violence (watch gameplay videos to see if you're okay with her playing it, theres no blood but there are swords and such thing)\n\nAnd of course I have to recommend Kingdom Hearts which is a Disney RPG adventure crossover with Final Fantasy. If she loves Disney and Adventure games shell love it and its very kid friendly of course (instead of swords the weapons are keys and the bad guys aren't technically killed by you).  I have no idea if they're on PS3 or PS4 since I'm personally not a fan of the game but I know lots of girls love the series. \n\nThe PS3 also has the awesome kid friendly platformer collections such as the Sly Cooper Collection and the Jak and Daxter collection (and the previously mentioned Ratchet and Clank Collection) these each have 3 games a piece and kids (and adults) love em!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a mom and pop video game shop around you (or are willing to pay slightly more on amazon for convenience) you should look into retro games.

The graphics are mostly hand drawn so they don&amp;#39;t look too ugly and she might enjoy the graphics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can look for a copy of either Mickey&amp;#39;s Castle of Illusion or Mickey&amp;#39;s World of Illusion as these are AMAZING games in their own right even for people who don&amp;#39;t like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the PS3 there are many good titles to play as well. The Little Big Planet Series is really fun and the two of you could play together building levels and whatnot. The lego games others mentioned are apparently really good but I haven&amp;#39;t played them myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although because she&amp;#39;s young you might be tempted to only suggest easy games for her make sure to give her challenging games too since the earlier they get into these types of games the better they&amp;#39;ll be at perseverance (playing the same part over and over until they complete it teaches patience and the importance of practice) and some kids love the challenge. For a great kid friendly challenging game look no further than Ducktales Remastered and Shovel Knight for the PS3/PS4. These games have fun controls beautiful artwork and although they can be difficult they don&amp;#39;t have you lose very much progress so kids who appreciate a challenge will be hooked in. The games are also very inexpensive so don&amp;#39;t be afraid to take a chance on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ratchet and Clank for PS4 is another excellent game and also the original trilogy collection is on PS3.  Don&amp;#39;t forget Final Fantasy X remastered on both PS4 and PS3 as well. Its an awesome adventure game with some minor cartoon violence (watch gameplay videos to see if you&amp;#39;re okay with her playing it, theres no blood but there are swords and such thing)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course I have to recommend Kingdom Hearts which is a Disney RPG adventure crossover with Final Fantasy. If she loves Disney and Adventure games shell love it and its very kid friendly of course (instead of swords the weapons are keys and the bad guys aren&amp;#39;t technically killed by you).  I have no idea if they&amp;#39;re on PS3 or PS4 since I&amp;#39;m personally not a fan of the game but I know lots of girls love the series. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The PS3 also has the awesome kid friendly platformer collections such as the Sly Cooper Collection and the Jak and Daxter collection (and the previously mentioned Ratchet and Clank Collection) these each have 3 games a piece and kids (and adults) love em!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg67y65", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047263.0, "created_utc": 1492018463.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64spwv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg50u2z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "merganzer", "parent_id": "t3_64spwv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heh.
