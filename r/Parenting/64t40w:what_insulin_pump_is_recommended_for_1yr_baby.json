Mainly we like how it has a low BG check stop since our daughter gets quite low during the night. Our endocrinologist also recommended it. The Medtronic rep did say that the 670 CGM will be as accurate as the dexcom. Omnipod is nice too, but we did notice that since babies are so small there is certainly less real estate for insertion. Omnipod rep did say they are  also working on an integrated CGM maybe available in 2019. We&amp;#39;ll have to see how it goes with the minimed for now and strap it on. We&amp;#39;ll see what is better as she grows up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg7zwu5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137272.0, "created_utc": 1492108472.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6x9yu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PapillonMom", "parent_id": "t3_64t40w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have been on several pumps including the Omnipod, T-slim and now the Minimed 630g (waiting for 670 release and upgrade option).
