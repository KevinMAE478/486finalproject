I was offered on-call last year in November to which I said I wanted to wait until after my son was a year old and that I needed to discuss it with my husband first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the following 4-5 months I spoke with my husband on and off about what on-call means and we weighed the Pros and Cons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pros: \nAn extra $400 a month to be on call every 5th week.\nWe both went to private college and are now sitting under $120k worth of student loan debt (not including house, credit card, etc). I have always been the breadwinner in our family and I enjoy the ability to support most of our financial obligations.  It also makes me feel that if we start to run into a &amp;#39;living paycheck to paycheck&amp;#39; scenario that I should be the one to try to resolve it. It has taken several years (and lots of hard work to move up in my company). We spent $1057 a month to send our son to daycare for 12 full time days out of the month (3x a week because we can&amp;#39;t afford more than that and I asked work to let me be off Monday and Tuesday to accommodate) and I submitted enough financial paperwork to get a 10%price reduction to $951 a month now. When I initially started to really consider working an on-call week every month I thought it would help us save an emergency fund if one of us lost our job and then use the money to pay extra on our debt in the long run and $400 isn&amp;#39;t anything to snort at when you have debt like ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cons: 1. on-call 5pm - 7am. I work in IT for a hotel company and would be the acting &amp;#39;3rd tier support person&amp;#39; (1st - property management, 2nd - IT person in the office at the moment).\n2. Potential middle of the night phone calls/lack of sleep\n3. Calls may also wake my husband up.\n4. Need extra help from husband on the on-call week if son is waking up multiple times a night due to whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided the additional funds would help significantly in the long run and provide us with a better and more stable financial environment for our little family. This would give us an additional $4,200 a year to put straight to debt or into savings as long as 5 on-call rotation is still in tact or about $4,800 if it drops down to a 4 person rotation. Plus I get to deduct $40 from my phone bill every month (additional $480 annually)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that my on-call week is here and active... Husband has been very upset. He claims he didn&amp;#39;t know on-call was overnight. He thought it was just until 8pm. He has decided to have high expectations of my being on call and has decided to not have a positive light about the situation. I don&amp;#39;t know why he decided to wait until it was already here to do this...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband and I have been together for 16 years now. Married for almost 5 years. He has seen me at my best and at my worst. He has tried to get me to work on doing things for myself and my health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to do a few things in the past two years to shake up my priorities in life.\nI got a big promo into IT from previously working on property.\nWe decided to have a beautiful little baby boy.\nI switched to 10 hour shifts so I would have a day off with both my son and my husband at the same time.\nI finally invested in a personal trainer (my weight has been an issue for a long time - 240lbs as of last Monday) and husband has always worried about my health and I have too.\nAnd I now work on-call to help with debt relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these things, in my mind, are helping me be a better me. A provider, a mother, a wife and to be healthier so I can be all of these things longer for the three of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was trying to have a serious conversation with him about on-call he was quite hostile and would not take a neutral stance. He has now told me I only focus on work. That I don&amp;#39;t spend enough time with my family because I drop my son off at daycare Wed-Fri\u200b then come home after 6:30pm and then go to work out with my trainer those 3 days at 7:30pm. On Saturday I work from 8-6 and my son is at home with my husband. I am off Sunday with them both and then Monday/Tuesday I am at home with my son. Now I&amp;#39;m on-call for 1 week every 5 weeks and after the very first call I received on my very first night on-call he thinks he is going to go sleep on the couch for the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way he said these things now makes me feel like a bad mom. That I don&amp;#39;t spend enough time with my son and that the decisions I made are wrong. That I am going to damage my relationship with my husband. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be on-call, he felt pressured into accepting it and that my health is not something I should be worried about. I have tried explaining to him that he is being negative and that I am trying to help us and our family in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up walking out of our bedroom in tears and went to sleep on the couch where I have been typing this up.
