I can barely cook dinner some days because she&amp;#39;s mad that I can&amp;#39;t play.  I thought this was normal toddler behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading the responses here makes me believe it&amp;#39;s not.  So is it not, or to a degree?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because I feel bad some days when I&amp;#39;m about to go insane by the time hubby gets home and just want to run, he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to understand why I&amp;#39;m frustrated, and looks at me like I&amp;#39;m crazy to be annoyed by my own child because I can&amp;#39;t sit for five minutes without her begging for something.  I mean I have Forest Whitaker eye at the end of the day and just want to be left alone by everyone.  I don&amp;#39;t want to give my husband any attention because I&amp;#39;m absolutely drained and he gets upset.  I am trying to teach her more independence and will take some suggestions from here, but now I&amp;#39;m wondering if I&amp;#39;m doing enough?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it literally took 30 minutes to write this after 1600 interruptions....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg6rgcj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068741.0, "created_utc": 1492039941.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zga6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zga6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zga6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zga6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zga6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6depq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bpadair31", "parent_id": "t1_dg6dbib", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 1, "body": "&gt;And if you're a decent parent, they still want to give you affection and hang with you past adolescence.\n\nOf course they will.
