Don't do it with her because it will make her feel uncomfortable just tell her to practice in front of a mirror talking to herself. It sounds goofy but it really helps. And also give her tips such as to consciously tell her self (in her head) what to say the first few times until it becomes natural. So for example when she's approaching a cashier have her think in her head (okay they might ask me how I'm doing just say \"good how are you?\" and \"ok I should smile and make eye contact to make the cashier know I'm not upset with them\"). This may sound goofy but this is how shy people have to train themselves to get around these things. I also highly encourage you to encourage her to get into sports or just working out in general. Some light weightlifting and cardio will do wonders for confidence levels since not only do they work out your body but also release \"feel good\" chemicals in your brain that gradually help you feel more confident all the time even before you start to see results. \n\nAlso make sure she watches a little bit of fictional drama television or maybe Vlog videos as these have recently been shown to increase a person's \"emotional intelligence\" and I found this to be a good way for me to work on eye contact and just getting used to listening to people. Shy people tend to be thinking too much inside their own head and this helps a lot. Especially a v-log video where the person is essentially making \"eye contact\" with the camera so you can practice your eye contact very well (this seems to be the first thing one needs to get over the awkwardness)\n\n\nThats a ton of advice so feel free to pick and choose just giving you some tips from a former shy kid with a shy family who is trying to break the mold after all these years.

So for example when she&amp;#39;s approaching a cashier have her think in her head (okay they might ask me how I&amp;#39;m doing just say &amp;quot;good how are you?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ok I should smile and make eye contact to make the cashier know I&amp;#39;m not upset with them&amp;quot;). This may sound goofy but this is how shy people have to train themselves to get around these things. I also highly encourage you to encourage her to get into sports or just working out in general. Some light weightlifting and cardio will do wonders for confidence levels since not only do they work out your body but also release &amp;quot;feel good&amp;quot; chemicals in your brain that gradually help you feel more confident all the time even before you start to see results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also make sure she watches a little bit of fictional drama television or maybe Vlog videos as these have recently been shown to increase a person&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;emotional intelligence&amp;quot; and I found this to be a good way for me to work on eye contact and just getting used to listening to people. Shy people tend to be thinking too much inside their own head and this helps a lot. Especially a v-log video where the person is essentially making &amp;quot;eye contact&amp;quot; with the camera so you can practice your eye contact very well (this seems to be the first thing one needs to get over the awkwardness)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thats a ton of advice so feel free to pick and choose just giving you some tips from a former shy kid with a shy family who is trying to break the mold after all these years. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg68iio", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047832.0, "created_utc": 1492019032.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64unb2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64unb2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg649xt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheL0nePonderer", "parent_id": "t1_dg606sc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, my sister did these at Macy's as a kid.
