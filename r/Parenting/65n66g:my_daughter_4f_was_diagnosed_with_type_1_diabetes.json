I'm a type 1, diagnosed at about the same age as your daughter more than 30 years ago. I know it all seems overwhelming and scary right now, but I assure you it all becomes normal and much easier. Also, technology has come such a long way; when I was your daughter's age, my diagnosis came with my parents being told I probably wouldn't live past 30 and would absolutely have severe complications by my 20s. Thanks to some amazing improvements, I'm well into my 30s and completely healthy (other than this lazy pancreas). I've run marathons, had a baby, backpacked, etc. Your daughter is diagnosed at a time when T1D is no longer expected to have a significant impact on life expectancy and complications are rare thanks to much better tools. \n\nYou'll probably figure out quickly that the shots really aren't a big deal. The frustrating part is the managing of blood sugar levels. First, get a Dexcom if you can. They are amazing tools and can help much figuring out how to time insulin, food, activity, etc. Of all the improvements I've seen over my lifetime, the Dex is by far the most amazing and life-changing. The G5 model works with iPhones (so you will need to get your daughter an iPhone) but this will allow you to see her blood sugar all the time. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this tool is. \n\nA pump is also a really good option, especially for a small child who is insulin sensitive. Talk to your endo and be aggressive. They may want you to wait a bit before moving to a pump and that's fine, but there's no reason to wait on the Dex. \n\nCheck out The Juicebox Podcast. Scott is a father of a T1 girl and he's done an amazing job at managing her diabetes. \n\nIf you're able to get a Dexcom, I would also get the book sugar surfing. It's a book about using the Dex to manage T1 in a more dynamic fashion. This is the approach I use and it's really helped me, both in achieving a better a1c and living more \"normally.\" \n\nKeep in mind that her numbers are going to be crazy for awhile. It will take some time to figure out how to use insulin, plus there's the honeymoon period, etc. \n\nThere are TONS of people online who are ready and able to help you at any time. The \"Diabetes Online Community\" (DOC) is huge and wonderful. There are forums, Facebook groups, /r/diabetes, etc. Use these resources. \n\nYou'll encounter a lot of idiocy around diabetes in general, especially type 1. Get used to educating people. \n\nWhen you get scared, remember that people like me grew up in the diabetes dark ages (rarely checking blood sugar, old insulins, not knowing carb counting, etc) and most of us are still alive and pretty healthy. And your daughter is going to have way better care than we did! \n\nTake care of yourself. Seriously. Caregiver burnout is a thing but also remember that T1D does have a genetic component (along with some sort of environmental trigger). The genetic component is believed to be paternally associated so make sure to watch out for your own health. I know two fathers now who were diagnosed with T1D right around the time their children were diagnosed. T1D can develop in adults!

And it comes with a really cool community of people!! \n\nDon't hesitate to PM me if you have any questions. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I&amp;#39;m a type 1, diagnosed at about the same age as your daughter more than 30 years ago. I know it all seems overwhelming and scary right now, but I assure you it all becomes normal and much easier. Also, technology has come such a long way; when I was your daughter&amp;#39;s age, my diagnosis came with my parents being told I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t live past 30 and would absolutely have severe complications by my 20s. Thanks to some amazing improvements, I&amp;#39;m well into my 30s and completely healthy (other than this lazy pancreas). I&amp;#39;ve run marathons, had a baby, backpacked, etc. Your daughter is diagnosed at a time when T1D is no longer expected to have a significant impact on life expectancy and complications are rare thanks to much better tools. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll probably figure out quickly that the shots really aren&amp;#39;t a big deal. The frustrating part is the managing of blood sugar levels. First, get a Dexcom if you can. They are amazing tools and can help much figuring out how to time insulin, food, activity, etc. Of all the improvements I&amp;#39;ve seen over my lifetime, the Dex is by far the most amazing and life-changing. The G5 model works with iPhones (so you will need to get your daughter an iPhone) but this will allow you to see her blood sugar all the time. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this tool is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pump is also a really good option, especially for a small child who is insulin sensitive. Talk to your endo and be aggressive. They may want you to wait a bit before moving to a pump and that&amp;#39;s fine, but there&amp;#39;s no reason to wait on the Dex. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out The Juicebox Podcast. Scott is a father of a T1 girl and he&amp;#39;s done an amazing job at managing her diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re able to get a Dexcom, I would also get the book sugar surfing. It&amp;#39;s a book about using the Dex to manage T1 in a more dynamic fashion. This is the approach I use and it&amp;#39;s really helped me, both in achieving a better a1c and living more &amp;quot;normally.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that her numbers are going to be crazy for awhile. It will take some time to figure out how to use insulin, plus there&amp;#39;s the honeymoon period, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are TONS of people online who are ready and able to help you at any time. The &amp;quot;Diabetes Online Community&amp;quot; (DOC) is huge and wonderful. There are forums, Facebook groups, &lt;a href=\"/r/diabetes\"&gt;/r/diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Use these resources. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll encounter a lot of idiocy around diabetes in general, especially type 1. Get used to educating people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get scared, remember that people like me grew up in the diabetes dark ages (rarely checking blood sugar, old insulins, not knowing carb counting, etc) and most of us are still alive and pretty healthy. And your daughter is going to have way better care than we did! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take care of yourself. Seriously. Caregiver burnout is a thing but also remember that T1D does have a genetic component (along with some sort of environmental trigger). The genetic component is believed to be paternally associated so make sure to watch out for your own health.

My husband was diagnosed over 30 years ago and lives a 100% normal existence. We eat a very balanced diet and he checks his sugars, but he&amp;#39;s very healthy, has a great career, we have one healthy kiddo and another healthy one on the way, lived abroad for years when he was younger by himself - he did whatever he wanted and was never any worse for the wear! Definitely look into getting a 504 plan for school just for your peace of mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dgcs20m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415401.0, "created_utc": 1492386601.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
