Where I grew up, there were a couple immersion programs, Spanish and French.  There's now many more in the same city, including German and Mandarin.  \n\nAs a child who's entire exposure to foreign language was Sesame Street and the polyglot of languages in my home community (26 last time I heard it was counted), I may have been confused going to a school where I didn't understand a word the teacher said (on the other hand, it's not like I wouldn't have been confused being dropped off at school even if I was fluent in whatever language the teacher spoke).  But the point is that the kids don't, and they just pick up more and more from being immersed in it.  The best way to learn a language is immersion, and the best time to learn a language is as a child.  So I love the idea behind immersion schools.\n\nAnyway, in immersion schools, it's not expected that the parents know the language the child is being taught in.  The kids got their foreign language at school, and mother language at home, and easily switch between the two.

But the point is that the kids don&amp;#39;t, and they just pick up more and more from being immersed in it.
