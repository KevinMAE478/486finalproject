We needed to find a place rather quickly and this place seemed pretty perfect for us. It was presented to us as very kid friendly. We didn&amp;#39;t find out till we moved out that most of the people who live here are either elderly or oilfield workers. We have an elderly person living next to us and an oilfield worker on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 1 month we&amp;#39;ve lived here we&amp;#39;ve been told by management that they have had complaints about our infant crying. Now I will say my son rarely cries and if he does it&amp;#39;s for a minute or two tops. It&amp;#39;s usually when I leave the room to do something or at night because we use the Ferber method. He goes to bed at 7 so even on the nights he cries for &amp;quot;long periods&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s well before the quiet time for our complex. At most he&amp;#39;s cried for 10 minutes, I know because I keep count. What I&amp;#39;m getting out is my sons crying is very, very minimal. Not to the point he should be interrupting anyone&amp;#39;s life. I&amp;#39;m fairly certain it&amp;#39;s our left hand neighbor because they have actually banged on the wall between them and my sons room, to the point of frightening my son. I&amp;#39;m not confrontational otherwise I&amp;#39;d have gone and knocked on their door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time the manager notified us about the issue was only a few days after moving in. I explained that we use the Ferber and my LO only cries then and when I leave the room. The landlord straight up told me to stop using Ferber and to not leave my son alone. I&amp;#39;m sorry but that&amp;#39;s not realistic. If my son was actually crying all day and night I would take responsibility for bothering those around me. But like I said his crying is minimal. What I don&amp;#39;t understand is my sons wall is attached to our neighbors upstairs BATHROOM. If they can hear his crying it would have to only be heard in their bathroom when he&amp;#39;s upstairs in his room or their living room during the day when he&amp;#39;s downstairs. Our walls aren&amp;#39;t paper thin either. I&amp;#39;ve heard zero noise inside my home from either neighbors and one has a dog, maybe there just really quiet but still. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now since I&amp;#39;ve moved in I have had my landlord come to me about complaints 1-2 times a week. Finally today, on Easter of all days, he came to me and said I was considered a nuisance and I would need to switch apartments to an end apartment that shares walls with the office so I have no attached neighbors. Okay, that&amp;#39;s fine if it makes those around me more comfortable. However that&amp;#39;s an upgraded unit, meaning it costs $100 more a month. Which I can&amp;#39;t do. I&amp;#39;m recently divorced hence why I&amp;#39;m living here. I work from home and I make just enough income to live comfortably for me and my LO. I said I&amp;#39;d move if I could maintain my same rent, that was a firm no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my landlord I couldn&amp;#39;t do that and he told me that left him no choice but to evict me for being a nuisance. From what I&amp;#39;ve read, he can do just that because it&amp;#39;s a he said she said type thing. I don&amp;#39;t have the money to fight him and I don&amp;#39;t have them money to pay the rest of my rent and leave. But I also can&amp;#39;t afford an eviction on my rental history. I already have a negative rental history from nearly 10 years because I was 18 and trusted my apartment manager and got screwed and that almost stopped me from getting this place but I was able to explain my situation. But with two negative rental histories I&amp;#39;ll never find another place. I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I can say with 100% certainty that my child&amp;#39;s crying may be able to be heard but it&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;d considered a nuisance.

My guess is that they are just bluffing hoping you will move on your own. Further I&amp;#39;d guess that these complaints are exaggerated or even fictional, I&amp;#39;m guessing they want to fill that end unit pretty badly, so they are trying to force you into it. It&amp;#39;s probably hard to rent out at $100 more and they are thinking you are an easy target being newly divorced with an infant. If it&amp;#39;s all old folks and oil rig workers, who is the easiest to bully around? You. You are the most desperate in appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They knew you had a baby when they rented to you and you can prove that. All babies cry, so they don&amp;#39;t really have a leg to stand on.
