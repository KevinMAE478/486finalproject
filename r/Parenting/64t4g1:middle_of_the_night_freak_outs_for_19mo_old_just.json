I also never turn on any lights or move him from his room unless I take him to sleep in guest room with me but still always in dark and no talking unless I say shhh and night night time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you tried white noise instead of music?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dg587kj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491987687.0, "created_utc": 1491958887.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t4g1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t4g1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg58vx2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "latormus", "parent_id": "t1_dg572wm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, that's the sippy cup he's got now.
