I avoid 95%of her tantrums if I tell her what&amp;#39;s going to happen. For example: ok baby, we are going to eat a snack, then watch an episode of paw patrol, then bed for nap time, ok?  I ask for confirmation at the end and I might get it or not, this is also ok. After snack:ok baby, one episode of paw patrol, then bed for nap time, ok?. Before the episode ends: after this episode, nap time. After the episode everything gets turn off and to bed. I have a high success rate and she sometimes cry because nap time is not fun but gets over it quickly. Maybe narrating your babies day might work for you. Also, try to do an out door thing with your kid a day. They get cabin fever a lot quicker than we do and affects their mood.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Parenting", "name": "t1_dgb9s1e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492323972.0, "created_utc": 1492295172.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kssq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgdxl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "littleln", "parent_id": "t3_65kssq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you are worried take her to a developmental pediatrician or child psychologist.
