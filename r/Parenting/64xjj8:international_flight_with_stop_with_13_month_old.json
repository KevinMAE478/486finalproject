A morning flight is tough as they are going to be awake the whole time (minus naps) and it will be evening when you land.  When you get on the plane, start acting like it is local time at your destination. Wen you hit the ground, immediate move into routine. If it is dinner time, feed them and move toward your evening routine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our flights were a red eye over, so everyone slept and we acted like it was morning (even though it was 4 am for us ) and it worked fine.

We might have to go to the airport by public transport. Or is a cab better?\"\n\nThe cutest thing in the world is a baby in pajamas at the airport. Give him his lovey/pacifier/blanket, wrap him up and put him in the car/train. Bring extra sets of clothes and change him at the airport/on the plane when he would normally wake up.\n\nA cab would be easier for sure, but then you have the carseat, which is a pain. The train isn't bad, just keep him in a stroller/soft carrier. Stroller is also a pain at the airplane, unless you need it on the trip. Sometimes you can check these as you arrive, sometimes you have to gate check. Find out before you leave for peace of mind.\n\n\"How do we keep him as happy as possible on the flights? He's not super into videos or books, only entertained by it for 10 minutes or so and will not accept headphones (which I understand - but are the other people in the plane just gonna have to deal with nursery rhymes and Disney cartoons?)\"\n\nNumber one...never worry about anyone else on the plane. Everyone has been a baby. Most everyone has travelled with small children. It sucks. Do your best.\n\nKeep two bags...fill one with dollar store junk, toys, books...stuff he has never seen before. Puzzles, coloring stuff, stickers, cheap stuff you don't mind getting lost or thrown out.\n\nBag two, fill with every possible food thing he would want. Crackers, fruit, new things he hasn't tried before. You are going to pull things from bag one, then bag two, then when that gets old you are going to walk the aisles, meet people. Then explore the bathroom. Then explore the seat pocket. Then back to the bags. And you will be exhausted, but you will make it.\n\n\"On the way back we have 6 hours in Iceland, it's gonna be late evening. How do we get him to not be a fuzzy mess and sleep with airport noise, speaker announcement and beeping luggage carts?\"\n\nDo dinner, change him into his pajamas. Read some stories, keep the routine the same. Run around if need be. If he falls asleep with you, great. Otherwise, wait til the plane, get him settled in his seat with a blanket and he will crash.\n\n\"Is he gonna experience Jetlag? How bad is it gonna be?\"\n\nJet lag is the devil. Just keep sliding bedtime and eventually he will adjust.\n\n\"Buy diapers and formula there or take with us?\" Bring formula, unless you can buy the same kind in NYC. It will taste different and you want as much the same as possible. Make sure you have bottles made up for the plane. Diapers are made around the world, just bring plenty on the plane. And wipes. So many wipes.\n\n\"Diaper changes on the plane? I never paid attention if the bathrooms have a changing table\"\n\nThe wall above the toilet folds down into a changing table.\n\n\"He's gonna want to move on the plane. Can I walk with him or is that disrespectful to the other passengers? He'll likely try to grab all the things he passes by.\"\n\nThis will happen. Some people will think its cute, other people will hate you and your kid. Hang out with the first, ignore the second.\n\n\"What else is important/helpful? What is a stupid idea?\" \n\nBring LOTS of changes for him and YOU. Don't fly covered in vomit/poop/pee/spilled food, etc. This has happened. It's not pretty.\n\nGood luck!

Some advice, and then to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he will accept it, keep him in a soft carrier for as much of the transit to the airport and security as possible, especially when you have the quick layover. That way you can deal with luggage and yourself, and it will keep him calmer in a new environment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Should we just go about his usual routine?
