There is so much to explore with Killer Frost and, as we&amp;#39;ve seen over the past three seasons, not much past one-off love interests with Caitlin Snow. I hope her death scene was actually her death scene; I&amp;#39;ll miss Caitlin but to be honest I don&amp;#39;t see the character going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope they finally bring back Earth-1 Ronnie and we get to see them be the Fire-Ice duo they were in the comics. It&amp;#39;d be cool if they incorporated it into the show how Killer Frost needs to feed off of heat to survive and Ronnie is the only one who can provide it due to him being Firestorm (an endless supply of heat).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dgaid3b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492279716.0, "created_utc": 1492250916.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h3ih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h3ih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h3ih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h3ih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbu2ek", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheInverseFlash", "parent_id": "t1_dgbq3qp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's a good one and sounds like a Cisco name.
