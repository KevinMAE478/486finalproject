But I suggest going back and not skipping any episodes because each one builds up to the final few episodes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dg7706v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089710.0, "created_utc": 1492060910.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65075k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg773my", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Conneron", "parent_id": "t1_dg74r6r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You should start from Season 1 ep 6.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should start from Season 1 ep 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dg773my", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089896.0, "created_utc": 1492061096.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65075k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76txb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cbildfell", "parent_id": "t1_dg74r6r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "2", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dg76txb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089375.0, "created_utc": 1492060575.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74r6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FriendlyBatman", "parent_id": "t1_dg7363t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've enjoyed the Flash, except for Cisco this season :(, but I think they should have spaced the speedster villains out to every other season. \n\nBut yeah AoS, if I didn't want to start from all the way at the beginning, which season would be a good 'jumping on' point?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed the Flash, except for Cisco this season :(, but I think they should have spaced the speedster villains out to every other season. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah AoS, if I didn&amp;#39;t want to start from all the way at the beginning, which season would be a good &amp;#39;jumping on&amp;#39; point?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dg74r6r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492085883.0, "created_utc": 1492057083.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65075k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg83mgl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "slocke200", "parent_id": "t1_dg7363t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd go as far as saying with the last few episodes of agents of shield it may be the best tv thats out weekly at the moment, maybe designated survivor or broadchurch.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d go as far as saying with the last few episodes of agents of shield it may be the best tv thats out weekly at the moment, maybe designated survivor or broadchurch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dg83mgl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141295.0, "created_utc": 1492112495.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7363t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 45, "report_reasons": null, "author": "F1uffyTurtle", "parent_id": "t3_65075k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "AoS no question about it, hell AoS is having a stronger season than the flash right now.
