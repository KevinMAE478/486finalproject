Episode ''0'' will start on monday and end on thursday and it will fill the timeslots of all the shows. This special cross-over episode will even change the title of the shows. They'll all use the ''Flashpoint Paradox'' logo.\n\nThe first episode introduces us  to this new world. Only Barry is noticing he's in a different world. A world where Superman is active on Earth-1, Supergirl is nowhere to be found, Robert Queen is Arrow, some Legends are either dead, filling in different roles, are evil or have no powers. Let's say the Tanagarians have taken over the world and Hawkman and Hawkgirl are brought back with a good script written for them. They are the badguys in this universe and they've conquered the world. They are fighting a war against humanity. Superman is being controlled by them and he follows their orders. Supergirl is locked up and exposed to Red sunlight in her prison. When she's eventually freed she'll fight Supes. \n\nBarry will have to deal with Eobard who's alive and well in this reality. The Rival is his ally. He mentored him and gave him powers through a particle accelerator. The Rivel is basically filling in the footsteps of Barry, but this guy is more evil. Eobard knows what's going on and he's delighted about it. He's aiding the Thanagarians but he has his own plan. He knows this reality is a fake one and he knows about his death back in season 1. He will try to permanently bring himself back. So he has to take Barry out because he knows Barry would want to fix things. That's why he has trained the Rival. He knows Barry has grown and he needs back-up. \n\nAt the end of this cross-over we'll have Barry discover that the other reality where he's from still exists, however it is slowly being erased from time itself if Barry doesn't fix it soon.. But when barry discovers the other reality is still in place we'll get a transistion to the real timeline and the next week will pick up with Supergirl ep1, arrow ep 1, lot ep 1 etc. and tell all their stories with cadmus/prometheus etc. While Barry is doing his thing in the Flashpoint Paradox. With new roles for Cisco, Caitlin as killer frost, Iris as a powered hero, Joe is in charge of a peacekeeping force that's put in place by the thanagarians.. At the end midseason finale Barry manages to stop Flashpoint, he gets back to his reality but it will have consequences. Because of this he created Savitar and it is directly revealed (we are not going to drag this out) that Savitar is barry from the future. The next arc of the season will have Barry fight his inner demons and at the end of the arc he'll overcome his biggest fear: becoming Savitar. He defeats him and sets things straight.\n\nI feel it has taken too long and it has become a gimmick. The masked villains.

It&amp;#39;s pretty common for shows to start off well before going downhill, AoS is just the other way around.  There&amp;#39;s no teen drama to get in the way of alien/mutant punching, each episode advances the main plot, each main plot feeds into the next half-season&amp;#39;s main plot without retreading ground, the characters really grow (both in the show and on you), and the characters are a real team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;What If?&amp;quot; scenario has &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more impact if you&amp;#39;ve watched the show from the beginning, and it&amp;#39;s certainly worth everyone&amp;#39;s time to do so (but again, the first ~10 episodes aren&amp;#39;t the best).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FlashTV", "name": "t1_dg6kz1h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492060798.0, "created_utc": 1492031998.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y6bs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xrez", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6tflk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChrisSuperDude", "parent_id": "t3_64xrez", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FlashTV", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Personally I wanted Flashpoint to be a season long event lasting the entire final season.
