Quests should probably be City wide at the least.\n\n- timer mechanics and prioritization would have to be key for any kind of difficulty. (Do you defuse the 8 bombs or do you save x person, or do you run across the city to stop y theft).\n\n- quest limits? A normal civilian can't be interacted with beyond x speed without killing them, and ramp up until you're dealing with high durability targets?\n\n- gameplay and power scale should be based on technique's more than raw speed. Start at Mach 1, unlock Mach 2, then phasing, then auto phasing, then wall running, then water walk, etc. I'm not sure how you'd do that. Eventually you can steal speed which damages surrounding civilians but increases effectiveness?\n\nIt'd be a very weird game, where most of it is spent in a world that seems at the most, frozen, and at the least, like bullets are barely moving. I don't know how far you could play that out. Maybe have a tracker that replays everything when you complete a segment in crazy real time? I dunno about this... The problem is that once you put the comics into an engine that's codified, he's either incredibly weak or a God. \n\nEdit. Maybe the entire game takes place with big enemy speedsters siphoning speed force so the flash is limited to a bullet timer for the majority of the game?
