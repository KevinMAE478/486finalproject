He tries to plead with Cold to stop, that he knows Snart can be better than this, but Snart freezes Barry&amp;#39;s legs and straight freezes a kid in front of Barry, then mocking him. Barry then angrily confronts Eabord about why he&amp;#39;s losing his powers, why he couldn&amp;#39;t save those people, that kid. Eabord laughs in Barry&amp;#39;s face, telling him that this timeline is starting to cement, taking him with it, making him into this timeline&amp;#39;s Barry. Barry says that he needs his powers to stop Cold and Plastique. Eabord says that the only way he can do that is to let him go so he murder his mom. Barry blows him off and goes to Cisco. Without realizing that Cold placed a tracker on and is watching Barry leave the building Eabord is in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barry heads to Ramone Industries, where he&amp;#39;s confronted by Iris and Wally, who has been gaining financial help from Cisco, whose an arrogant business owner. Cisco has peaced out on helping though, saying that there&amp;#39;s no benefit to him in this anymore. Barry tries to convince him, but he says that he&amp;#39;s sorry and that Barry and the brother-sister crimefighting duo are on their own. Suddenly Iris and Wally get a text from Joe, the captain of the police, to stay away from the station, because Cold&amp;#39;s #1 lackey Heatwave has swept in and is attacking it. Barry and Wally go as Flash and Kid Flash to confront him, Wally is burned and knocked down and Eddie steps up to help, Barry telling him to step back. But Eddie pulls his talisman out, using it to absorb Wally&amp;#39;s speed force, then igniting his blue flame powers. Barry&amp;#39;s shocked but accepts Eddie&amp;#39;s help and they&amp;#39;re able to defeat Heatwave.

Snart starts to tell him about his sister who died due to Plastique killing her.

Snart tells him that he knows what speedsters are capable of, that he is one, he has a scientist in his employ to figure that out, the same person who made his cold gun in this timeline, whose had a device sensing the energy spike from Kid Flash that has been sensing 2 more, him and Barry and he wants him to go back and save his sister, pull her out of time and bring her to him. Eabord asks him if he doesn&amp;#39;t want to prevent all of this. Snart says that he still wants the city of freaks to pay and nothing can change that. He&amp;#39;s committed to his goal.
