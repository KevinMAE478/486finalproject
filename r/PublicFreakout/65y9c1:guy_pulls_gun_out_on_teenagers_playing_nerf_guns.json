You will let them talk stuff about your lady friend. You will let them call your mother a witch and a hooker, your dad a punk. \nYou have no ego. You do all this because if you are the one to start a fight, by default that fight now has a gun in it, and if you start losing, you&amp;#39;re going to pull it and kill him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t go to jail because you could convince the jury that it was self-defense, you&amp;#39;re going to have to live with the fact that you took someone&amp;#39;s life in defense of your pride and ego not your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are not the police, so don&amp;#39;t act like them.
