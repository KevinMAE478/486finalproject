From there (even if nothing else happened after the arrest) all his problems get worse and he&amp;#39;s more likely to be in contact with police again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can look at it and think &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t stand for that!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d be furious if someone talked to me like that, you can&amp;#39;t be disrespected&amp;quot; which is fine, but Police have to be professional and can&amp;#39;t allow themselves to be controlled by words and insults. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy was extremely distressed by something, did you figure out what it was?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody did, because nobody asked him or tried to reassure him that he didn&amp;#39;t need to be scared or angry. He obviously displays emotions differently than the average person. Just ignoring his words and looking at his actions, all he did was walk away (as commanded) get on an elevator to leave, then pop out to say something again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the (apparently superior) cop lost his patience. That was his fault. He was standing at one end shouting orders to an autistic-idiot to get on a closed elevator at the other end of the hall. If autistic-idiot want to ask a question (which he &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have the right to) he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to get off the elevator and shout back!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cop could have talked to autistic-idiot like someone who cared, walked with him away from everyone else to separate things, calm everyone down, and get the story from his point of view. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk and talk him to the elevator, put him on it, problem solved.
