The officer has some white belt skills, but when he moved to full mount to just beat down on the guy, that was 100% a personal attack. But it's a rookie move to do a police officer with **A FUCKING GUN BELT ON!!** Being in full mount is a fairly aggressive move to hold and basically means your doing it so you can free your hands to punch someones face in which is exactly what happened. Normally you move from this to a knee on belly, a triangle or something more like a submission/hold and not a fucking beat down after he's done about nothing to fight back but hold his hands in front of himself. That's generally the sign that someone wants nothing to do with the punches coming at them. \n\nNothing the officer did showed he had any regard for public safety other than the initial idea to stop the guy which escalated beyond what was necessary.

So I understand the need to at least say something to the guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The legality of a particular jaywalking incident can be argued in a court fairly easily, and you can be voided of the charge and if you feel like a true violation occurred then that&amp;#39;s the time to bring it up. So when the cop first walked over and said something like : &amp;quot;Stop walking and get your hands out of your pockets.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s your cue to stop walking away and get your hands visible. Which he did but kept walking away and into the street, and in front of another car which can mean nothing or something..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moment before he started walking into the street, the cop should have immediate moved to just talking to the guy and bring the temperature back down. Instead, he decides to pull a high school white belt bully move and grabs his throat before doing the worst take down I have ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides all that here is the most telling thing to me that the cop had made the decision to do this before he moved towards the guy. The officer has some white belt skills, but when he moved to full mount to just beat down on the guy, that was 100% a personal attack. But it&amp;#39;s a rookie move to do a police officer with &lt;strong&gt;A FUCKING GUN BELT ON!!&lt;/strong&gt; Being in full mount is a fairly aggressive move to hold and basically means your doing it so you can free your hands to punch someones face in which is exactly what happened. Normally you move from this to a knee on belly, a triangle or something more like a submission/hold and not a fucking beat down after he&amp;#39;s done about nothing to fight back but hold his hands in front of himself. That&amp;#39;s generally the sign that someone wants nothing to do with the punches coming at them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing the officer did showed he had any regard for public safety other than the initial idea to stop the guy which escalated beyond what was necessary. There seemed to be a billion and one choices the officer could have made but he decided to escalate the entire situation way more than was needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit":
