City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974) the United States Supreme Court held invalid, because violative of the first and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution, a very similar ordinance which declared it unlawful and a breach of the peace for any person \"wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to any member of the city police while in the actual performance of this duty.\" Relying upon Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972), the United States Supreme Court found that the statute under consideration, by its terms, was not limited to words which \"by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\" 415 U.S. at 132, 94 S.Ct. at 972. Since the proscribed conduct was not limited to fighting words, it was found overly broad and constitutionally impermissible.\n\n&gt;The statute now under consideration, Section 42-24(5) refers to \"obscene, abusive [and] insulting\" language which, similarly, is broad enough to cover words which do not \"by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\" The words uttered by defendant, when analyzed in context, were protected speech. There was no evidence to show, nor does the context herein suggest, that defendant's remarks tended to incite the police officer to an immediate breach of the peace. In fact, when such words are addressed to an officer, one would normally contemplate the need for a stronger showing that the words tend to incite the addressee to an immediate breach of the peace.2 Thus there was lacking in this case the clear and present danger necessary in order to justify the state's interference with defendant's right to speak freely. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919).\n\n&gt;In the case at hand the only action of the defendant which prompted her arrest was\n[342 So.2d 199]\nher use of derogatory language toward the policeman when he attempted to question her. She was not prosecuted for public obscenity and there is no indication that her language had any tendency to cause a fight or public disturbance.\n\n&gt;We are bound by the first amendment of the United States Constitution which prohibits \"abridging the freedom of speech,\" and by the specific jurisprudential precedent of Lewis v. City of New Orleans, supra. Thus we are required to declare unconstitutional because overly broad and facially invalid this ordinance, Section 42-24(5) of the Code of the City of New Orleans, which makes criminal simply using language, albeit obscene, abusive or insulting, to or in the presence of a police officer performing his duty. Independently, we reach the same result by interpreting Article I, section 7 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 which proclaims that \"[n]o law shall curtail or restrain the freedom of speech. . . .\"\n\nAnd while we're doing fun facts of Louisiana let me continue this story.\n\n&gt;Having concluded that defendant was arrested for the unquestioned violation of an ordinance we now for the first time find unconstitutional, we turn now to whether we must let stand her conviction and sentence for a battery which the trial court found she committed. Our decision must turn upon whether or not a citizen may reasonably resist arrest for the violation of a criminal statute unconstitutional on its face but not yet then declared so. We find from the record that defendant did indeed commit a battery upon the police officer, but that same was done in a reasonable effort to resist arrest for violation of Section 42-24(5).\n\n&gt;Louisiana has long held to the rule of law that a citizen has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. This Court declared in City of Monroe v. Ducas, 203 La. 971, 14 So.2d 781 (1943) that:\n\n&gt;The right of personal liberty is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen, and any unlawful interference with it may be resisted. Every person has a right to resist an unlawful arrest; and, in preventing such illegal restraint of his liberty, he may use such force as may be necessary.\nInvolved in Monroe v. Ducas, supra, however, was not an appropriate arrest for violating a suspect criminal statute, but a blatant arrest for conduct not criminal.3\n\n&gt;Efforts in this country to change that rule of law and deny the right to resist arrest which the person being arrested knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful, have succeeded in a few states, but not in Louisiana.4 Instead, the right to resist an unlawful arrest is **codified in the Louisiana Criminal Code and the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure**. Article 108 of the Criminal Code, R.S. 14:108, makes a crime the resistance to an individual \"acting in his official capacity and authorized by law to make a lawful arrest,\" and Article 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that a \"person . . . submit peaceably to a lawful arrest.\" [emphasis added]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yawn.

Ducas, supra, however, was not an appropriate arrest for violating a suspect criminal statute, but a blatant arrest for conduct not criminal.3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Efforts in this country to change that rule of law and deny the right to resist arrest which the person being arrested knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful, have succeeded in a few states, but not in Louisiana.4 Instead, the right to resist an unlawful arrest is &lt;strong&gt;codified in the Louisiana Criminal Code and the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;. Article 108 of the Criminal Code, R.S. 14:108, makes a crime the resistance to an individual &amp;quot;acting in his official capacity and authorized by law to make a lawful arrest,&amp;quot; and Article 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that a &amp;quot;person . . . submit peaceably to a lawful arrest.&amp;quot; [emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "name": "t1_dg9zsbl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492244172.0, "created_utc": 1492215372.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9r00q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iamseventwelve", "parent_id": "t1_dg6zydm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PublicFreakout", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Let's change this up a bit...\n\nYou know how being naked in your house is completely legal?

He encounters and confronts Bodie, who matches the description of the seller. Bodie yells and swears at Haulk. He attracts a crowd of onlookers. He then encourages the crowd to join in his protest of Officer Haulk, screaming that this situation is similar to the LA Riots. Officer Haullk is justified in arresting Bodie for disorderly conduct because the latter\u2019s actions were likely to cause violence. (Chemalali v. D.C., 655 A.2d 1226 (D.C. 1995).)\n\n\n&gt;Example: Haulk, stationed in the subway, sees Bodie jump the turnstile. He stops him and issues him a ticket for not paying. Bodie yells and curses at Haulk. A crowd gathers, and Bodie continues to curse. Haulk arrests Bodie for disorderly conduct, **but the reviewing court finds the arrest illegal** because there wasn't evidence to suggest that Bodie intended to incite the crowd; he didn\u2019t interact with it, nor did it become agitated.

He encounters and confronts Bodie, who matches the description of the seller. Bodie yells and swears at Haulk. He attracts a crowd of onlookers. He then encourages the crowd to join in his protest of Officer Haulk, screaming that this situation is similar to the LA Riots. Officer Haullk is justified in arresting Bodie for disorderly conduct because the latter\u2019s actions were likely to cause violence. (Chemalali v. D.C., 655 A.2d 1226 (D.C. 1995).)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: Haulk, stationed in the subway, sees Bodie jump the turnstile. He stops him and issues him a ticket for not paying. Bodie yells and curses at Haulk. A crowd gathers, and Bodie continues to curse. Haulk arrests Bodie for disorderly conduct, &lt;strong&gt;but the reviewing court finds the arrest illegal&lt;/strong&gt; because there wasn&amp;#39;t evidence to suggest that Bodie intended to incite the crowd; he didn\u2019t interact with it, nor did it become agitated.
