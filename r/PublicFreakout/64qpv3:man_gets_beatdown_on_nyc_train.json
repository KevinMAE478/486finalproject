Provocation is statutorily defined by each state and this varies by jurisdiction. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean my knowledge of this comes from my law school classes and not just from Google but the fighting words doctrine was created in the 1942 Chaplinsky case and refers to free speech restrictions, not a defense to assault. Chaplinsky said that certain &amp;quot;fighting words&amp;quot; are not protected free speech under the 1st amendment, but that&amp;#39;s been significantly narrowed in the decades since and there haven&amp;#39;t been any other cases that have upheld a restriction on &amp;quot;fighting words&amp;quot; under 1st amendment scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re confusing this 1st amendment doctrine with the concept of provocation as a mitigating factor against battery/murder charges in criminal law. Provocation is similarly narrow and difficult to prove. Essentially it means that the person was sent into such a &amp;quot;heat of passion&amp;quot; rage that they can&amp;#39;t legally be held fully accountable for their actions and thus if proven mitigated the crime to a lesser charge, but is not a defense in and of itself.
