MTG is so much worse than Hearthstone in this regard, it's not even funny. \n\nIf Blizzard is greedy with its customers, WOTC is fucking PREDATORY. It is so much worse for consumers than Heartstone. Purchasing a Standard deck for MTG costs about double or triple what it costs for a standard deck in Hearthstone. A lot of standard decks in MTG have historically been priced around 300 to 500 dollars, but people allow it because they view the cards as an 'investment'. But if you actually plan to use your cards for the last 6 months before they rotate, there is no way you will gain anywhere close to your original cash value because the demand goes down near rotation time. \n\nIn reality, MTG is NOT an investment. Or if it is, it's a really bad one that is taking advantage of you. If cards are strong enough to hamper a meta, they are banned with no compensation to you (these cards also tend to be the most expensive to purchase in the first place). And sometimes the release of an incredible hoser card can render the cards you spent your money on to be more or less worthless. You can avoid this by playing eternal formats if you are willing to shell out more than the average person's monthly rent/mortgage payment for a single deck (and heaven forbid that you use a proxy while you are waiting to get your hands on a legitimate copy). Even then you'd better hope that none of your cards face the ban hammer. One thing I truly appreciate about HS is that it never tries to pretend that its cards are an investment. You may be able to decrease the overall cost if you are an average player and pay attention to the MTG 'economy', but it's still going to be a significantly more expensive game than Hearthstone or any of the online competitors unless you are able to earn your cards through other means than directly purchasing them.\n\nIf you want an investment, purchase a stock, a bond, or a mutual fund - those are actual investments and are designed to provide a return on the product. If you are purchasing MTG cards, you are a customer and NOT an investor. And if that's what you're interested in, that's fine. Don't get me wrong, if it was priced reasonably, I'd be playing the shit out of MTG. It is incredibly well designed and an absolute pleasure to play. But it's pricing model is WAY worse than Hearthstone's and I can barely justify playing even playing HS based on the cost. \n\nIf you are going to make comparisons, please look at alternative CCG's than both MTG and Hearthstone.

I play on my phone every now and then, and I just don't want to drop any real cash into the game. It's just something I do occasionally when I'm in public transit or have a few minutes to kill. However, as any casual f2p player will tell you, we all run into the same issue in fairly little time. \n\nAllow me to illustrate with a screenshot I took after a game: http://i.imgur.com/M2FhBYj.png\n\nAs you can see, by turn three my opponent had **30 attack on the board** while I, on the other hand, had just managed to play a single Crocolisk. There was literally not a single thing I could have done to prevent this crushing victory.\n\nThat game taught something very important: basic decks were just not going to cut it. I'd saved up some gold here and there, and had drawn two legendaries so far (Antonidas and Patches), so I started looking for a budget deck that would let me have a fighting chance. And that's when I built a Pirate Warrior. It cost me about 1k dust, with all the cards I already had. I had to dust a massive number of good cards to build it, and it's still not quite complete, with some Wolfriders for instance in place of better cards in the future, but it works. I can actually fight back.\n\nPirate Warriors get a very bad rep for being unfun to play against, and for good reason. When the Warrior starts rushing pirates at you, there's very little you can actually do to fight back unless you are specifically specced against them or have very good luck with your early draws. But let me tell you something: *they are even less fun to play as*. I don't enjoy rushing my enemy and winning in a few turns, but it's the only option that was within my reach to start going into ranked with the f2p means at my disposal.\n\nF2P players fall into a Catch-22 very quickly, especially casual ones. To build a good deck, you need packs or dust (which you'll get from packs anyway). To get enough packs, you need a lot of gold. To get a lot of gold, you need to win a lot. And of course, to win a lot, you need a good deck. That, or *a lot* of time for grinding as best you can.\n\nLet's do some basic math here:\n\nLet's say you log in every single day and spend about 20 minutes doing your new quest, if you're lucky and get easy opponents. Of course, this assumes you have a decent basic deck for all nine classes, or the generous twenty minutes I quoted can easily become an hour, or more, especially if you keep landing monsters like the one I pictured.\n\nAnyway, at 40-60 gold per quest, with let's say an additional 10 gp from three wins, that's 50 to 70 gold a day. At 100 gold per pack, you'll get about 1.5 packs per 3 days, 2 packs if you get nice rewarding quests. Each pack gives 5 cards, one of which will be rare or higher, the rest of which will typically be common. That's 40 dust guaranteed from each pack. Assuming you don't get very lucky with your packs, you can expect to be able to craft a single rare card after a week of playing *every single day*, by disenchanting *every single card* you've drawn. Hope you didn't want any legendaries.\n\nSaving up to my budget pirate deck took me about five months of on-and-off play.\n\nThere's a point where Hearthstone stops being a game, and starts being a chore. For F2P players, we are well past that point. I'm only still playing because I like the feel of the game itself, and because I managed to save up to a very cheap decent deck.

Fixed.", "edited": 1492029181.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Rant Ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: I&amp;#39;m a Pirate Warrior and I hate it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fairly casual, somewhat new player. I play on my phone every now and then, and I just don&amp;#39;t want to drop any real cash into the game. It&amp;#39;s just something I do occasionally when I&amp;#39;m in public transit or have a few minutes to kill. However, as any casual f2p player will tell you, we all run into the same issue in fairly little time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allow me to illustrate with a screenshot I took after a game: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/M2FhBYj.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/M2FhBYj.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, by turn three my opponent had &lt;strong&gt;30 attack on the board&lt;/strong&gt; while I, on the other hand, had just managed to play a single Crocolisk. There was literally not a single thing I could have done to prevent this crushing victory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That game taught something very important: basic decks were just not going to cut it. I&amp;#39;d saved up some gold here and there, and had drawn two legendaries so far (Antonidas and Patches), so I started looking for a budget deck that would let me have a fighting chance. And that&amp;#39;s when I built a Pirate Warrior. It cost me about 1k dust, with all the cards I already had. I had to dust a massive number of good cards to build it, and it&amp;#39;s still not quite complete, with some Wolfriders for instance in place of better cards in the future, but it works. I can actually fight back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pirate Warriors get a very bad rep for being unfun to play against, and for good reason. When the Warrior starts rushing pirates at you, there&amp;#39;s very little you can actually do to fight back unless you are specifically specced against them or have very good luck with your early draws. But let me tell you something: &lt;em&gt;they are even less fun to play as&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy rushing my enemy and winning in a few turns, but it&amp;#39;s the only option that was within my reach to start going into ranked with the f2p means at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F2P players fall into a Catch-22 very quickly, especially casual ones. To build a good deck, you need packs or dust (which you&amp;#39;ll get from packs anyway). To get enough packs, you need a lot of gold. To get a lot of gold, you need to win a lot. And of course, to win a lot, you need a good deck. That, or &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time for grinding as best you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s do some basic math here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you log in every single day and spend about 20 minutes doing your new quest, if you&amp;#39;re lucky and get easy opponents. Of course, this assumes you have a decent basic deck for all nine classes, or the generous twenty minutes I quoted can easily become an hour, or more, especially if you keep landing monsters like the one I pictured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at 40-60 gold per quest, with let&amp;#39;s say an additional 10 gp from three wins, that&amp;#39;s 50 to 70 gold a day. At 100 gold per pack, you&amp;#39;ll get about 1.5 packs per 3 days, 2 packs if you get nice rewarding quests. Each pack gives 5 cards, one of which will be rare or higher, the rest of which will typically be common. That&amp;#39;s 40 dust guaranteed from each pack. Assuming you don&amp;#39;t get very lucky with your packs, you can expect to be able to craft a single rare card after a week of playing &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt;, by disenchanting &lt;em&gt;every single card&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ve drawn. Hope you didn&amp;#39;t want any legendaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saving up to my budget pirate deck took me about five months of on-and-off play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a point where Hearthstone stops being a game, and starts being a chore. For F2P players, we are well past that point. I&amp;#39;m only still playing because I like the feel of the game itself, and because I managed to save up to a very cheap decent deck. But if I were a more reasonable person, I&amp;#39;d have dropped off a long time ago. I already have one job, I don&amp;#39;t need a second one as gold farmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I forgot to mention that this was all with the state of the game &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to Un&amp;#39;goro.

There's a few additional key points I'd like to mark for this thread:\n\n**Hearthstone is a constantly evolving game.** The rate at which the meta is refined increases each expansion release, people get better and better at finding the good and bad decks. This also means bad cards are far more quickly identified and packs quickly lose \"value\" due to bad cards *just not being playable* in constructed's competitive matchmaking. With other words, it's become real easy to open a pack and get nothing but \"trash.\"\n\n**The content you get isn't worth the price anymore.** A lot of people have been comparing the identical price of a Hearthstone pre-order to a fully-fleshed out game like the Witcher 3. And it's not that the pre-order prices have changed, but that the content of the packs dwindles faster with each expansions as explained above. So even if other card games manage to pull off higher prices, Blizzard still has to deal with the reality that a product sold in that price range has a higher expectancy of its lasting value.\n\n**Team 5 shot themselves in the foot with the legendary = unique mechanic.** It's fairly obvious that they have been using the legendary \"one card deck restriction\" as a mechanic for card design. E.g. it would have been impossible to print a card like Patches if you could run two copies. This has only become more problematic with quests, where you now have a ton of deck-defining cards that are all legendary just for the sake of restricting the number of copies you can put into your deck.\n\nBut, most importantly:\n\n**People are saying they want cheaper packs because they actually would want to buy more packs then.** Like, that's the bottom line. I think most fans has fond memories of opening lots of Hearthstone packs and enjoying it. And they would likely be able to continue doing so if they didn't feel like they were vastly overpaying for the product nowadays.

There&amp;#39;s a few additional key points I&amp;#39;d like to mark for this thread:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearthstone is a constantly evolving game.&lt;/strong&gt; The rate at which the meta is refined increases each expansion release, people get better and better at finding the good and bad decks. This also means bad cards are far more quickly identified and packs quickly lose &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; due to bad cards &lt;em&gt;just not being playable&lt;/em&gt; in constructed&amp;#39;s competitive matchmaking. With other words, it&amp;#39;s become real easy to open a pack and get nothing but &amp;quot;trash.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The content you get isn&amp;#39;t worth the price anymore.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people have been comparing the identical price of a Hearthstone pre-order to a fully-fleshed out game like the Witcher 3. And it&amp;#39;s not that the pre-order prices have changed, but that the content of the packs dwindles faster with each expansions as explained above. So even if other card games manage to pull off higher prices, Blizzard still has to deal with the reality that a product sold in that price range has a higher expectancy of its lasting value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team 5 shot themselves in the foot with the legendary = unique mechanic.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s fairly obvious that they have been using the legendary &amp;quot;one card deck restriction&amp;quot; as a mechanic for card design. E.g. it would have been impossible to print a card like Patches if you could run two copies. This has only become more problematic with quests, where you now have a ton of deck-defining cards that are all legendary just for the sake of restricting the number of copies you can put into your deck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, most importantly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are saying they want cheaper packs because they actually would want to buy more packs then.&lt;/strong&gt; Like, that&amp;#39;s the bottom line. I think most fans has fond memories of opening lots of Hearthstone packs and enjoying it. And they would likely be able to continue doing so if they didn&amp;#39;t feel like they were vastly overpaying for the product nowadays. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg6y7kd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077006.0, "created_utc": 1492048206.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zzcq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7bmny", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Snicsnipe", "parent_id": "t3_64zzcq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So this is where the thoughts on overpricing goes.

There is making a profit and there is excessive Greed. Hearthstone has turned from profit to excessive Greed in my view. THE NEW PLAYER COST IS TOO DAMN HIGH!!!!\n\nI started playing this game back right before Blackrock Mountain and I enjoyed a well constructed deck for not paying much of anything. I bought like 10 classic packs.  I bought Naxx because of the card quality and how important the set was. I felt that the money I spent made my decks amazingly better and allowed for me to play several decks I did not have key cards from Naxx. That value for price got me more into the game and I bought Blackrock Mountain. These two great adventures encouraged me to end up buying a significant amount on classic like 150 dollars worth and 50 dollars every expansion. I bought LOE and Karazan cause I knew the value was there. I had never been disappointed with the 50 dollars I spent every expansion because I always got enough in value to play 1 or 2 competitive decks and enjoy the new game mechanics of the expansion. Overtime I would get enough dust to craft and play what I wanted but not necessarily have a complete collection from a set. Un'Goro has changed that significantly due to quests being legendary, ard quality overall increasing with higher rarities, and drop rates not changing. \n\nI got 4 legendary cards out of 108 packs(50 I bought the rest rewards and banked gold) 2 elise, Tyrantus, and Kalimos and no quest cards. I do not look at the 2nd elise as a legendary I can craft. I have to look at it as an epic due to dust costs. 400 dust does not become 1600 dust. Could I spend my dust from the hall of fame on quests? Sure but please remember to take this from the perspective of the player that is looking to start in this game not a seasoned veteran with a collection I have already spent a significant amount of money on. If Ungoro is going to be the model for the new sets and drop rates/cost/ingame drop amounts dont change then I see no reason to spend my 50 dollars an expansion or the money I spent on classic. The value I get for the money spent is not worth it. Ill go play overwatch, BF3, and go play DN for free to get my card game fix.  If I put myself in the same shoes today as when I started and if I bought Karazan then it would not have the same effect due to card quality and power creep. If I did the same model of buy preorders every expansion and same amount of classics then I will be worse off long term given the status quo. Adventures provided so much value for my dollar but now Blizzard wants me to spend 50 more dollars a year to be worse off playing a game I enjoy. I do not get the guaranteed stability of collection and playability that I got in the past.  Ill pass on that and spend 50 bucks on a new fully fledged game where I get to enjoy all the aspects of it. All this has led up to the point where I cannot recommend this game to my friends without being upfront with with them about how much it will cost them to enter it, maintain, and not be worth it to them. My money and their money is better spent elsewhere on entertainment.     \n\nHow does Blizzard go about fixing this then? I have never liked people that throw shade but show no solutions to the problem. I think blizzard has a few options to solve this issue. Not all of these should be implemented to fix the problems but even doing just 2 will solve problems and breath some life into this game for new players and existing discouraged players.\n\n1) There needs to be 2 Adventure style sets a year. This model is what expanded the player base the most in my view and encouraged players like me to spend money on classic and on new sets. It reduced the barrier to entry massively. If the next two sets you have are already in the works then change them to an adventure format. Preorder and you get the entire set or guarantee a certain % of completion for that amount. I get that Blizzard needs to make money as a company but I really would like to keep this game healthy for new players. 150 dollars a year with 2 guarantees of card pool is required. \n\n2) Drop rates need to increase dramatically. 1/20 for a legendary not 1/40 to even think of keeping the status quo of 3 expansions per year. No repeats unless golden versions of the cards.\n\n3) Dust rates need to change. Let the dust amount equal the card rarity. If I pull a golden legendary but do not want it then I should be able to craft another gold legendary that I want in the set. It should go all the way down for epics, rares, ect.\n\n4) I get that Blizzard wants to keep the golden version of cards to be iconic. Though the work of their artists are only really enjoyed by a small amount of the community that is fine. Change the preorder to get every card in the set or something like the first X number of packs guarantees the entire set in regular edition but to get the full golden collection you have to buy a substantial amount more of packs. The fact that players like Kripp can open 1K of packs and still not have the entire set in both rarities is insane and it highlights how screwed up the current system is.      \n\nIf you took the time to read my long post then I say thank you. =)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is where the thoughts on overpricing goes.
