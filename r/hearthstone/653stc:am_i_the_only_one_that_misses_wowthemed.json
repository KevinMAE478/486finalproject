If we're discounting all of them, **~~Zavas, Tyrantus and~~ Sherazin** should be considered Hearthstone originals as well. (Edit: Zavas and Tyrantus were in WoW early on).\n\nPersonally I think it's awesome that they're branching out with original legendaries. They always feel like they're still living in the same world and I think the devs have generally done a good job of building some character and story simply with the blog posts, art, voice lines and animations. I think Hearthstone has done enough to earn exploring new IPs and heroes a little, and if the circumstances fit, the characters could (and have) become WoW canon.\n\nIt's more important to design characters that fit the expansion than famous lore ones. Cool expansion ideas that excite them and allow them to explore interesting themes and ideas should take precedence over \"let's try to fit in a quota of WoW characters for the sake of it\".\n\nOnce in a while there'll be some prominent WoW characters that fit the expansion, and we'll get them, but I prefer this approach of not being limited in their choice of legendaries. We're getting six Hearthstone expansions to each WoW one, I'm sure we'll see some big names in good time. \n\nFYI **Gadgetzan's count was 15/20 Hearthstone originals**.

If we&amp;#39;re discounting all of them, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;del&gt;Zavas, Tyrantus and&lt;/del&gt; Sherazin&lt;/strong&gt; should be considered Hearthstone originals as well. (Edit: Zavas and Tyrantus were in WoW early on).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I think it&amp;#39;s awesome that they&amp;#39;re branching out with original legendaries. They always feel like they&amp;#39;re still living in the same world and I think the devs have generally done a good job of building some character and story simply with the blog posts, art, voice lines and animations. I think Hearthstone has done enough to earn exploring new IPs and heroes a little, and if the circumstances fit, the characters could (and have) become WoW canon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more important to design characters that fit the expansion than famous lore ones.
