With that, I got Edwin as my class legendary and opened a golden Nozdormu as well as Grom Hellscream (my 2nd fave character after Arthas). I dusted the gold Nozdormu and cashed in on Sylvanas, getting that sweet dust with that rotation (thanks to everyone who gave me the advice). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, I was sitting on 4k dust and was wondering which deck to play when I chanced upon RayC&amp;#39;s Warrior Quest deck. Since I had Grom, I decided to craft the deck! I was pretty excited about getting to play my first competitive deck I could ladder with when I realised I couldn&amp;#39;t craft The Curator. I got pretty upset for a while when I researched how to get him because he was locked behind a 2100 gold/20 bucks paywall. I have been grinding quests and such while trying to ladder with a SMOrc Hunter deck I put together with some of the cards I got from boosters as well as saving dust so I was preeeeetty disappointed when I realised I couldn&amp;#39;t just craft him. After some hesitation, I decided to shell out the 20 bucks and see what adventures were all about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And oh boy! It was a blast! I had so much fun playing through the adventure and laughing at some of the really funny lines the characters say during the cutscenes. The visuals and plotline were amazing too to say the least and I really enjoyed crafting decks with my limited collection to beat each boss. I am currently at the 3rd wing and already regretting not purchasing the adventure sooner. And there are still class challenges to play through! Heroic!

Please Blizzard, don&amp;#39;t take away this marvelous feature!!!

Blizzard didn&amp;#39;t go into detail on what they are doing with the new adventures, only that they would still be coming out, much smaller and free. They also said there won&amp;#39;t be any card rewards, &lt;a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/16/14630330/hearthstone-year-of-the-mammoth-standard-format-classic-cards-removed-expansions-adventures\"&gt;they will come out WITH expansions and the only way to get those cards will be from packs.&lt;/a&gt; MAYBE completing them will give you some free packs, but that is speculation and far worse than the old adventures which gave you guaranteed LEGENDARIES.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I loved plaaying them too, but I also loved the VALUE of actually getting strong cards to add to my collection. It was worth the $20 for that. The loss of them as we know, and the gain of it being F2P isn&amp;#39;t worth it since we won&amp;#39;t get guaranteed cards from it anymore. That is why people are unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They think that just letting us keep a few single player missions will make up for their greed, but it doesn&amp;#39;t. They upped the amount of expansions, thus upping their income per year and lowered the value of getting cards by removing those sweet, sweet adventure cards we always had to look forward to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are skating a dangerous line right now. This game is still huge and pulls in RIDICULOUS cash for the low effort put into the game with bare bones features and lots of optimization bugs etc. AND they still have the fucking audacity to push more greed while not fixing anything. Give it one year, they will start regretting how bad the game is spiraling, give it two years, the game will be damn near dead IF they keep doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel bad for the dev team. They are working hard trying to balance 9 fucking classes, which is hard as fuck to do, and doing a good job considering. They are just trying to make a good game and have fun, but Blizzard is setting the prices for packs too high, forcing out too many expansions when the current way to get packs for those expansions costing way too much time and money to get reasonably, and when you do get the packs, nothing worth a shit is inside because of the pull rates. It&amp;#39;s just a fucking nightmare and I am sure the dev team is just as sad about it as we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgawze8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492306474.0, "created_utc": 1492277674.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaq9cg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tarplicious", "parent_id": "t1_dgaoll0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for giving some actual information unlike the rest of these jokers who are making little snide comments about something they clearly have no clue about.

It really sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order from most important to least I&amp;#39;d say I dislike adventures because..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer cards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggered release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-immersive meme pander humor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasting a good hour or 2 of my time doing something I hate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there are plenty of others who share my dislike of adventures, but just aren&amp;#39;t vocal about it. I know value is a bigger deal to most people. I&amp;#39;m not wealthy by any means, but entertainment money is sort of trivial in comparison to stuff like utility bills, food, rent, gas, etc and just not worth getting worked up over for me. I care about content far far more than I care about what that content costs. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgb6nzb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319638.0, "created_utc": 1492290838.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivje", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaxvrl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Autismprevails", "parent_id": "t3_65ivje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "not your blog", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;not your blog&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgaxvrl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307700.0, "created_utc": 1492278900.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivje", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb35d1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KingGio", "parent_id": "t3_65ivje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WHY THE FUCK IS SHIT LIKE THIS ON THE FRONT PAGE\nGO MAKE A BLOG", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY THE FUCK IS SHIT LIKE THIS ON THE FRONT PAGE\nGO MAKE A BLOG&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgb35d1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314798.0, "created_utc": 1492285998.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivje", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivje", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivje", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbd606", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TosyV1", "parent_id": "t1_dgaze4y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;You're the definition of toxic.\n\n&gt;Kill yourself.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re the definition of toxic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kill yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgbd606", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328876.0, "created_utc": 1492300076.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaze4y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dyelonnn", "parent_id": "t1_dgaz8cy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're the definition of toxic.
