It was always a good place to come for a roundup of any news and to discuss with people passionate about this sport and mostly knowledgeable about soccer as well. You don't often get that in an online community. The biggest thing that /r/soccer used to be compared to most social media &amp; forums, was inclusive &amp; respectful of all soccer fans - those from Europe &amp; those from America, those who became fans in the 70s and those who became fans after the last World Cup. One of the only rules, one that everyone enforced as a community &amp; abided by, was essentially \"don't be an asshole\". Everybody respect everybody's opinion, disagree but respect. That's just no longer the case anymore. And this isn't about anyone getting the downvote brigade because they're from America. There isn't any feeling of good humored banter anymore. It's gone to a very anti-foreigner, xenophobic atmosphere, particularly towards Americans - myself included, but many others as well. Downvotes don't really matter, but the amount of \"most American thing I've heard today\" and the like are just beyond silly ignorance. Many of the good-natured fun people have gone, but many of you are still here, yet you do absolutely nothing to combat this, not like you used to anytime someone was being a dick for no warranted reason. Your mods may not have the role of policemen, but they are certainly guilty of standing by and enabling this behavior just like everybody else. I guess at the end of the day, this sub is a microcosm of reddit as a whole. This isn't really a message \"fuck off\" to the people who are saying the anti-American bullshit, as much as it is a message to those of you who aren't to make it unwelcome, because at this point, Americans aren't welcome here. There's a mild tolerance for Americans, but as soon as opinions disagree, the anti-American ignorance flows freely and is clearly the primary point in the counter-argument of the American commentor. How did this subreddit become so exclusive, xenophobic, even apologetic for anti-Americanism &amp; more against those offended by it, etc.? This just doesn't seem like a place for me. Downvote away. Fill the comments with more \"chill out\", \"why are you offended by anti-Americanism?\". This is purely a message to the community I used to enjoy to encourage those who feel the same way to either do something or just go somewhere else, as I'm doing.
