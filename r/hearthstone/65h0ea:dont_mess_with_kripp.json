I guarantee blizzard cares far more for promoting a game that doesn&amp;#39;t have people acting consistently as assholes towards streamers by specifically sniping and roping than banning the people who exhibit that behavior. This isn&amp;#39;t an uncommon behavior for snipers against a top tier streamer and Blizzard probably cares more about the high-visibility streamer and his few thousand viewers than one player. Behavior like roping every turn for no reason should be reportable to begin with, so I have little sympathy for people who choose to consistently act that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dga9b81", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257878.0, "created_utc": 1492229078.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 238}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgac0ko", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dorwyn", "parent_id": "t1_dgabi8z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "More than one.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgac0ko", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492262724.0, "created_utc": 1492233924.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgabi8z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 50, "report_reasons": null, "author": "post_tap_syndrome", "parent_id": "t1_dga8cf0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I believe he already had a roper banned maybe 1 or 2 years ago", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe he already had a roper banned maybe 1 or 2 years ago&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgabi8z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261741.0, "created_utc": 1492232941.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 50}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgad9i7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sinkie12", "parent_id": "t1_dga8cf0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "RIP shadowswill, never forget.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIP shadowswill, never forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgad9i7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492265389.0, "created_utc": 1492236589.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h0ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgawjj7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ArcanePretext", "parent_id": "t1_dgaiqtp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you never played wild?
