It runs in a t2 deck and only really gets any value with 2x radiant elemental on the board, and it cant be played on curve or relied on for any constant effects. It gets value, but has like a 1/4 chance of getting an un-playable card (kills your own minions/combo/is generally not a useful card), a 1/3 chance of ending your spell combo (turn 10, 2 elements and lyra).&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd even after that you need to hope you can play the card as many priest spells require specific targets (Pain, death, silence, shadow madness, potion of madness etc).    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience (About 50 games on ladder with lyra)  the card is simply not consistent enough to play in a competitive deck.

Shareholders will not give a single shit about what reddit thinks if the profit keeps up and everything indicates future growth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They might have a significant increase in profit this year JUST because they&amp;#39;re dropping adventures. Adventures get $20 or so per player, NEVER more, while pack expansions get $10-$1000 per player, with some like Kripp getting more than that. Adventures require MORE work due to all the shit that the solo content needs (AI, cool fights, tons of extra voice lines and art and cards that won&amp;#39;t even be &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; outside of the expansion) that a normal expansion didn&amp;#39;t need. Even if like 1/3 of the paying players quit they might end up making more money off of the higher profit margins and the new players, but of course 1/3 of the players aren&amp;#39;t quitting because the people that complain in places like this come back to complain over and over again, they rarely actually quit yet still complain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgc2m6o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381169.0, "created_utc": 1492352369.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc2e4s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dontuforgetaboutme23", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1u5e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think this is the worst I've seen of P2P players complaining about a paywall.
