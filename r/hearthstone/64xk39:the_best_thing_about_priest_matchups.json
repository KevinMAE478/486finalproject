The core identity of Blue is using reactive cards to counter your opponents moves (in mtg you can play cards on your opponents turn. Counterspell is a increadibly powerful card that basically immediately removes the card your opponent just played, the downside being that you have to use it as your opponent is playing his card, if you let the card &amp;quot;hit the board&amp;quot; it can no longer be counterspelled).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mindcontrol is basically the same as the priest card: &amp;quot;Take control of a enemy minion.&amp;quot; The difference is that you can &amp;quot;silence&amp;quot; the mind control to get your minion back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when playing a 4 man ffa, everyone would just sit on their card without daring to play something since it would just get stolen or countered, also if you played anything you would end up using up your &amp;quot;mana crystals&amp;quot; which meant you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to cast counterspell to counter your opponents moves. A classical mexican standoff, whoever fires first dies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg5y6lb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036840.0, "created_utc": 1492008040.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xk39", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xk39", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xk39", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6h7w8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CayceLoL", "parent_id": "t1_dg6gcuy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm currently working on it that way.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently working on it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg6h7w8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056760.0, "created_utc": 1492027960.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6gcuy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "imrooniel", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ysei", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The only way to win is not to play", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to win is not to play&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg6gcuy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055872.0, "created_utc": 1492027072.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ysei", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CayceLoL", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wxr2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Each player is waiting for the other one to make the first move, since both have powerful reactive spells.
