You advocate stealing as long as it&amp;#39;s not a lot.  You keep saying all.  It&amp;#39;s not about all.  In the end Kripp loses revenue when people do these kinds of things.  You say it&amp;#39;s ok as long as it&amp;#39;s not a lot.  You advocate theft depending the popularity of the person&amp;#39;s content and popularity of the video being stolen.  Argue all you want that is what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the video is at about 20k now.  It also will prevent someone posting Kripp&amp;#39;s video here/getting it upvoted and possibly getting him more views since people will not upvote it because they already saw it.  That would be a really large percentage of that 20k (and growing).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg862po", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143979.0, "created_utc": 1492115179.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7y93k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dovahchriis", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qi8a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 1, "body": "**Variables:**\n\n - All viewers must keep up with Kripps youtube channel and watch every video he posts (all 14k).\n\n - All viewers who are subscribed to Kripp must not be interested in the higher quality of content produced by Kripp and assume the video he posts has nothing more to offer (this videos quality is pretty poor).\n\n - All viewers who are subscribed to Kripp don't have a desire to support Kripps youtube channel (some people just watch because they like the guy and want to support him).\n\n - All viewers automatically assume the videos purpose is the 2:30 seconds represented here (unlikely as Kripps videos tend to range from 10-30 minutes so he will be capturing a lot more content).\n\n\nAssuming all these variables are true I suppose Kripp will lose some revenue.
