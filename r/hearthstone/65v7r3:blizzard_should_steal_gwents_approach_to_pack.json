I&amp;#39;ve only played hs and duelyst (tried shadowverse but the ui is terrible imo) and duelyst does a lot of cool things too: for example u can &amp;quot;tip&amp;quot; a player at the end of a match to send them 5 gold, and generally gold is much easier to gather. I feel like hs would improve a lot if it got some of these ideas implemented.

Shadowverse gives away tons of packs because they absolutely need to attract players with large collections away from HS and get them attached to a collection in SV as soon and as early in the adoption phase as possible. Same with Gwent. I&amp;#39;d love to have this option in HS, but there&amp;#39;s a reason it&amp;#39;s not just straight forward pack opening in those other games. They can&amp;#39;t afford it. HS can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgdkinu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469404.0, "created_utc": 1492440604.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 121}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v7r3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v7r3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v7r3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdtfje", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Angrybear52", "parent_id": "t1_dgdt1nd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yes", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;yes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgdtfje", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479601.0, "created_utc": 1492450801.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdt1nd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tethula", "parent_id": "t1_dgdkbzc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "New to Faeria but if you have 2 epics for instance you get to choose which one you re-roll correct?
