I enjoy deck building more than playing, but unless I want to drop $300+ per expansion, I can&amp;#39;t get most of the set to do that with. And even though I don&amp;#39;t get mad at not getting Legend, I do get VERY bored with my 1-2 &amp;#39;good&amp;#39; decks I was able to make, and don&amp;#39;t want to climb or play to grind more because I am so demoralized with these facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Winning isn&amp;#39;t everything, but losing more than half the time to 10k+ dust decks while playing cheaper, less fun decks is not... fun. When adventures came out, we had that to look forward to. They printed way less cards than an expansion, but they were all good and you could make great decks with them that were also fun. Now that they are removing that, we have nothing to look forward to but more expansions as we fall more behind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game is going to die a slow death over the next 2 years, nothing but whales will be left to play against each other. Adventures were the only thing keeping the game alive, imo. They were cheap, guaranteed that most players would get to play Legendaries and were also great fun for the people who didn&amp;#39;t like PvP. With them going, so will a lot of other people over time when they realize that they will be able to afford far less cards each expansion, to the point where it&amp;#39;s not worth it to play as a F2P and not worth it to spend $300 to play against the few other people who paid $300. It will take at least 2 years to kill this game, but if they stay down this path, it WILL die.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg4nzg8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963378.0, "created_utc": 1491934578.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qo7f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52s6z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bibikis", "parent_id": "t3_64qo7f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also, to add.
