It was as if they all wanted to scream, but didn't have the capacity to do so (which was very much true considering that they had been disconnected from their bodies at some point). The dripping of blood from their torn necks seemed to hint that these prized noggins were fresh.. I still couldn't make out the beast's face, but his puffy white undershirt seemed like an odd choice, considering the fact that it was soiled by the heads knocking into each other, spurting blood clumsily all over their new owner. And that's when I saw it... It was her ... My love.. Well what was left of her anyway.. The long brown wavy hair, the freckled cheeks, the carefully groomed eyebrows and the amber eyes that were now staring at me.. Lifeless.\n\nMy knees buckled at once. I fell to the ground and let my body go limp. What does one do when seeing the one person they cherish impaled and left as nothing more than a key chain on an over sized hooded beast? I couldn't think. I had fully shutdown. My family all stayed put.. Frozen. No one moved.\n\nThe monster took his first step... *THUD* .. And another *THUD* .. And two more *THUD* *THUD*\n\nIt felt like ages had passed, but in reality, mere seconds later the mysterious creature finally spoke. The hood stayed in place, but from behind the dark silhouette, he asked in a gravely, deviant voice, \"Do you know why I have come?\"\n\nNo one spoke.. I was still lifeless on the ground. Unable to think. I opened my eyes at this point to understand why no one was speaking. I looked around and saw no one standing.. Where was everyone?\n\nWhen my gaze finally went back to the ground I then saw the rest of my family.. Grandpa, my brother, mother and father.. The thuds were not steps at all but the sounds of bodies hitting the floor. The creature had taken more victims, but why?!\n\nWith tears rolling down my face, my brain and thoughts mixing into one large cluster of incoherent mash, I finally looked back at the beast.\n\n\"DO YOU KNOW WHY I AM HERE BOY?!\" ... I cried and sobbed out, \"Don't... Who are... Parents.. Heather.. Killed...\"\n\n\"Better get your thoughts straight boy. I don't make these trips just for any old chum. You have to be quite the special subject to have me visit you and all those who you love.\" The thing was mocking me. It had killed everyone I cared about and now it stood there, taking jabs.\n\n\"I.. I have done nothing to deserve such a punishment,\" I whimpered out, finally forming a coherent sentence.\n\nThe large man moved closer at this, leaned in and laughed jovially at my attempt to undermine his past energy spent on disposing of my now deceased family members. \"Is that right? Can you think of nothing?\"\n\n\"NO! NO I DON'T DESERVE THIS!\" I yelled in defiance. \"I KEEP TO MYSELF, I DON'T HARM OTHERS! I'M A GOOD PERS..\"\n\nThe creature cut me off there. \"Oh I'll be the judge of that. You see, I am a sort of decision maker for those who are not deemed worthy. Worthy of what you ask? Well... Worthy of the most precious of thing of all.. life itself.\"\n\nI grew impatient, \"WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ME!?\"\n\nThe hooded man took a step back now, relieving me of his sour stench. \"Tell me.. What was the last thing you did that meant something?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"You heard me.. What was the last thing you did that meant something?\"\n\nI felt my brain rolling around inside my head at the question. It made perfect sense what he wanted me to contemplate, but I hadn't the slightest clue as to the why. \n\nThe hooded man took a seat on the chair where my father had previously been perched. He seemed to grow calm and be willing to be patient while I thought of the best answer for his question... I better make this response as good as I possible can. \n\nThe stress of the situation certainly didn't help, but it took me a few minutes to realize myself, \"when was the last time I actually had done something meaningful?\" I walked through my life during those terrifying moments, thinking about how I had spent the last few years. Every day, waking up, going to work, grabbing dinner, coming home, sleeping, getting up again, rinsing and repeating.. And what were weekends other than moments of recharging for the same, monotonous cycle, over and over? He had me at a mental standstill... I had no answer for him... My life had failed to find meaning and I knew it.\n\nAt that moment, the man broke into a sympathetic chuckle. \"It's always at these moments of revelation that make my job easier. You've lived a life of self indulgence and self pity for too long. When was the last time you reached out and helped another? When was the last time you decided to live a day to tend to the needs of the sick and less fortunate? When was the last time you did something for anyone but yourself?\"\n\n\"You see... I am the Judge of Life and as a arbitrator of your 28 years of existence, I can see that you have wasted your chance in this world.\"\n\nMy eyes no longer had the juices necessary to produce tears. I stared, without blinking into the abyss of the darkness of this man's cape... I knew he was right.\n\n\"Do you remember what even happened today? Why it is that your family was so upset before I arrived?\"\n\nIt took a second, but I realized that I had seen this moment before. Deja vu if you will.. \"I.. I.. I've lived this moment before haven't I?\"\n\n\"HAAA HAAA HAAA.\" That response got a real good laugh out of him this time. \"Why my boy.. You're finally starting to catch on. You and you're family have been deemed guilty of the worst offense of wasting one's life on meaningless, superficial, and quite pointless motivations. As a result, you have all been cursed with the eternal punishment of having me visit your home each and everyday, having me brandish this cane against your necks, and wearing your heads as a souvenir. Once I leave here today, you will all be alive again tomorrow, reliving the horrors that have occurred for the past 4000 years in this home.\"\n\n\"No.. No.. No no no no no.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. And yet, I knew it was true. This all felt too familiar. I begged him.. \"PLEASE. PLEASE give me just another chance. A chance to prove that I won't waste my life. To live it as it was meant. Helping others. Progressing societies. Living.. Meaningfully.\"\n\nAt that moment, the man stood himself up by his cane. \"That my boy, is exactly what you should have done the first time.\" And with a swift motion, the metallic cross made it's way towards my neck and...\n\n\"Woah.. What a dream.\" I woke up from the nightmare with sweat rolling down my forehead. I had fallen asleep in front of my computer monitor.. The glow of the screen bounced around the bedroom and now left me feeling eerily uncomfortable. I looked up at the screen and saw that my client was still running Hearthstone, but with a notification from Blizzard stating that the, \"Servers are now back online! We apologize for the delay and inconvenience.\"\n\n\"Finally,\" I whispered to myself.. I clicked \"OK\" on the notification and the game started running.. \"Find a seat if you can!\" .. I stared into the screen... That dream.. That horrific dream and the mysterious man.... He... He was right.\n\nI closed out of the application and shutdown the computer. I went downstairs, put on my tennis shoes, and departed my house. For the first time in a very long while, I set off for the local food bank with the goal of helping someone other than myself. Today was the first day that I lived my life for a purpose, and thanks to a very strange, dream invading killer deity, it gave me a sense of purpose and warmth that I had never felt before.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I open my mouth to scream at what I can only describe as a mix of surprised looks coming from the heads dangling from the large mans belt.

I stared, without blinking into the abyss of the darkness of this man&amp;#39;s cape... I knew he was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you remember what even happened today? Why it is that your family was so upset before I arrived?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took a second, but I realized that I had seen this moment before. Deja vu if you will.. &amp;quot;I.. I.. I&amp;#39;ve lived this moment before haven&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HAAA HAAA HAAA.&amp;quot; That response got a real good laugh out of him this time. &amp;quot;Why my boy.. You&amp;#39;re finally starting to catch on. You and you&amp;#39;re family have been deemed guilty of the worst offense of wasting one&amp;#39;s life on meaningless, superficial, and quite pointless motivations. As a result, you have all been cursed with the eternal punishment of having me visit your home each and everyday, having me brandish this cane against your necks, and wearing your heads as a souvenir. Once I leave here today, you will all be alive again tomorrow, reliving the horrors that have occurred for the past 4000 years in this home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.. No.. No no no no no.&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was hearing. And yet, I knew it was true. This all felt too familiar. I begged him.. &amp;quot;PLEASE. PLEASE give me just another chance. A chance to prove that I won&amp;#39;t waste my life. To live it as it was meant. Helping others. Progressing societies. Living.. Meaningfully.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the man stood himself up by his cane. &amp;quot;That my boy, is exactly what you should have done the first time.&amp;quot; And with a swift motion, the metallic cross made it&amp;#39;s way towards my neck and...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woah.. What a dream.&amp;quot; I woke up from the nightmare with sweat rolling down my forehead. I had fallen asleep in front of my computer monitor.. The glow of the screen bounced around the bedroom and now left me feeling eerily uncomfortable. I looked up at the screen and saw that my client was still running Hearthstone, but with a notification from Blizzard stating that the, &amp;quot;Servers are now back online! We apologize for the delay and inconvenience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Finally,&amp;quot; I whispered to myself.. I clicked &amp;quot;OK&amp;quot; on the notification and the game started running.. &amp;quot;Find a seat if you can!&amp;quot; .. I stared into the screen... That dream.. That horrific dream and the mysterious man.... He... He was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed out of the application and shutdown the computer. I went downstairs, put on my tennis shoes, and departed my house. For the first time in a very long while, I set off for the local food bank with the goal of helping someone other than myself. Today was the first day that I lived my life for a purpose, and thanks to a very strange, dream invading killer deity, it gave me a sense of purpose and warmth that I had never felt before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgd0kem", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426950.0, "created_utc": 1492398150.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p2mh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p2mh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0l4p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BayaArea8989", "parent_id": "t1_dgcw74f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Done.
