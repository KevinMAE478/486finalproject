You can 100% build a deck around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the much maligned Ultrasaur seems to have found a spot in some Druid decks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that at first I had some massive issues making any working decks, coming straight from the pre-Un&amp;#39;Goro meta with its Azure Drakes, Rags and Sylvanases (I had zero standard valid decks after the rotation thanks to these three), but after seeing people play some of the new cards, I finally started to manage with some decks of my very own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;#39;t unpacked or crafted any Un&amp;#39;Goro Legendaries or Epics yet, but I&amp;#39;ve still been having some good results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Handbuff Paladin&amp;#39;s been pretty good fun, but the deck I&amp;#39;m most surprised of getting to work even semi-reliably was my &lt;em&gt;Razorpetal Token Burn Rogue&lt;/em&gt; -thingy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With flipping Illidan!&lt;/strong&gt; And hoo-ee, ain&amp;#39;t no one prepared for him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No Quest or Auctioneer though, since screw that crap! Instead I try to continuously flood the board with Violet Teacher/Illidan + tons of cheap spells. And in a pinch I can try to finish the opponent off with a surprise 10+ points of burn from the hand with a pair of Evolved Kobolds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, burn isn&amp;#39;t quite my style, being rather uninteractive and all, but the Razorpetal cards were among my most interesting cards of the set, and it&amp;#39;s way cheaper to put together than some Sherazin decks I&amp;#39;ve seen (at least for someone that&amp;#39;s unpacked two Illidans thus far, that is).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should still be getting way more mileage from the set if I ever get to crafting those Epics and Legendaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgbdlhv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492329463.0, "created_utc": 1492300663.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j83t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbdry0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ras-Al-Ghoul", "parent_id": "t3_65j83t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I couldn't disagree more.
