Back burning reduces the amount of fuel that&amp;#39;s available to the main fire by the time that it reaches the burnt area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back burning is utilized in controlled burning and during wildfire events. While controlled burns utilize back burning during planned fire events to create a &amp;quot;black line&amp;quot;, back burning or backfiring is also done to stop a wildfire that is already in progress. Firebreaks are also often used as an anchor point to start a line of fires along natural or manmade features such as a river, road or a bulldozed clearing.[8] It is called back burning because the small fires are designed to &amp;#39;burn back towards the main fire front&amp;#39; and are usually burning and traveling against ground level winds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgboh8a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492345696.0, "created_utc": 1492316896.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb1c6u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zhlandir", "parent_id": "t3_65k6oe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Hey, hey, guys - how do we fight fire?

I'm literally 28-2 against Druids with priest and many of those wins were when they had that start. It's scary, but not unbeatable (pyro, coin, potion of madness clears most of it), and that start requires the absolute perfect starting hand with innervate. If it is answered, you're very unlikely to come back because you've literally used up your entire hand. \n\nContrast that with a perfect pirate warrior hand which is essentially unbeatable without specifically weapon removal. You can't interact normally and win, because the damage output through their weapons is just too high. Even if you do somehow weather the initial onslaught, you have to deal with the fact that they can simply topdeck a 5 damage weapon, and upgrade it to have 18 more damage coming your way.\n\nI'll rather face the average \"good\" draw from druid over the average \"good\" draw from pirate warrior any day. \n\n&gt;Also, saying that you need to have weapon removal, taunts and healing to win against Pirate Warrior is funny. You're basically saying that every meta deck loses to pirate Warrior, because no one runs all of those.\n\nI said that to beat their best draws, that's what you need. Which is absolutely true, short of somehow racing them, and funnily enough aggro druid is probably the only deck that has a chance of doing so, or rogue with an enormous edwin. \n\nThat in no way means it's an unbeatable deck, obviously. They *can* have clunky draws too, though it's rare.
