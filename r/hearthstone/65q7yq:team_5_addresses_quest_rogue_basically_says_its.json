This isn't a case of \"1 simple number can change everything\", 4 seems to be the lowest of low requirements for this quest. I just can't see why it isn't 5.\n\nI think we've pretty much established that it loses to any decent aggro deck, and wins against most control/greedy decks other than taunt warrior, would any of these 2 facts change if the ability for the rogue to finish the quest ended up being 1 turn later than it is now?\n\nHell, they'd probably still have a good win-rate against control if the quest was set to 6 minions of the same name, we'd just see more of the elemental quest rogue variety than we are now and they'd be playing the quest on turn 5-7 instead of 4-6, and it would still be as equally draw reliant as it is now.\n\nI think what people complain about is the bullshit like:\n\nTurn 1: Quest\n\nTurn 2: Novice Engineer + Shadowstep\n\nTurn 3: Mimic Pod (Shadowstep) &gt; Novice Engineer &gt; ST &gt; NE &gt; ST\n\nTurn 4: Novice Engineer &gt; Prep + Quest &gt; Stonetusk + Pirate w/ Patches for 15 face damage\n\nTurn 5: Bouncebacks/chargers/prep+evis/prep+vanish or whatever other things they can pull out of their ass for lethal\n\nDoes that happen every time? Of course not, but there are 100 other just as shitty scenarios for the opponent, and a bunch more that are even worse than that. I stopped playing Quest Rogue because it didn't even feel good to win with it, it wasn't as if I really did anything other than be lucky enough to have a Novice Engineer and 2 Shadowsteps in my hand by Turn 2.\n\nEdit: It's just insanity that the Rogue quest is play 4 minions of the same name while the Paladin quest is play 6 spells on your minions, the Pally quest is basically what the Rogue is already doing except the spells he is using cost 0 mana and instead of creating a body on board they generate value through draws or card generation. \n\nThen the reward for finishing the Pally quest is a single minion that can be countered by a metric shitload of things including itself if you don't get the right adaption choices:\n\nDidn't get Stealth? Oh well you lose to any of the minions that can Silence, Destroy, or Nerf like Aldor Peacekeeper.\n\nDidn't get Divine Shield? Oh well you lose to pyro+equality and other board clears.\n\nDidn't get Not Targetable? Lose to any removal.\n\nGot the perfect everything? Still lose to Deadly Shot, Twisting Nether, Deathwing, Volcano etc.\n\nDidn't play it the same turn you completed the quest? Lose to Dirty Rat.\n\nWhat are the counters for a completed Rogue quest? Basically nothing.. hope you have enough taunts? Silence doesn't work, CC doesn't work, board clears don't work (or very few of them do, and if you only have 1 they just refill the board the very next turn), hard removal doesn't work because they completely flood the board.\n", "edited": 1492379059.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t see how they landed on such a low amount to complete their quest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the games I&amp;#39;ve played as quest rogue, and most of the games I&amp;#39;ve played against quest rogue wouldn&amp;#39;t have turned out any differently if it was &amp;quot;play 5 minions with the same name&amp;quot;, the amount of free/cheap bounce-back and/or elemental generation would&amp;#39;ve allowed me/the opponent to play the quest on exactly the same turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how did it end up at 4? This isn&amp;#39;t a case of &amp;quot;1 simple number can change everything&amp;quot;, 4 seems to be the lowest of low requirements for this quest. I just can&amp;#39;t see why it isn&amp;#39;t 5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;#39;ve pretty much established that it loses to any decent aggro deck, and wins against most control/greedy decks other than taunt warrior, would any of these 2 facts change if the ability for the rogue to finish the quest ended up being 1 turn later than it is now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hell, they&amp;#39;d probably still have a good win-rate against control if the quest was set to 6 minions of the same name, we&amp;#39;d just see more of the elemental quest rogue variety than we are now and they&amp;#39;d be playing the quest on turn 5-7 instead of 4-6, and it would still be as equally draw reliant as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think what people complain about is the bullshit like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn 1: Quest&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn 2: Novice Engineer + Shadowstep&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn 3: Mimic Pod (Shadowstep) &amp;gt; Novice Engineer &amp;gt; ST &amp;gt; NE &amp;gt; ST&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn 4: Novice Engineer &amp;gt; Prep + Quest &amp;gt; Stonetusk + Pirate w/ Patches for 15 face damage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn 5: Bouncebacks/chargers/prep+evis/prep+vanish or whatever other things they can pull out of their ass for lethal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that happen every time? Of course not, but there are 100 other just as shitty scenarios for the opponent, and a bunch more that are even worse than that. I stopped playing Quest Rogue because it didn&amp;#39;t even feel good to win with it, it wasn&amp;#39;t as if I really did anything other than be lucky enough to have a Novice Engineer and 2 Shadowsteps in my hand by Turn 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: It&amp;#39;s just insanity that the Rogue quest is play 4 minions of the same name while the Paladin quest is play 6 spells on your minions, the Pally quest is basically what the Rogue is already doing except the spells he is using cost 0 mana and instead of creating a body on board they generate value through draws or card generation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the reward for finishing the Pally quest is a single minion that can be countered by a metric shitload of things including itself if you don&amp;#39;t get the right adaption choices:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t get Stealth? Oh well you lose to any of the minions that can Silence, Destroy, or Nerf like Aldor Peacekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t get Divine Shield? Oh well you lose to pyro+equality and other board clears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t get Not Targetable? Lose to any removal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got the perfect everything? Still lose to Deadly Shot, Twisting Nether, Deathwing, Volcano etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t play it the same turn you completed the quest? Lose to Dirty Rat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are the counters for a completed Rogue quest? Basically nothing.. hope you have enough taunts?
