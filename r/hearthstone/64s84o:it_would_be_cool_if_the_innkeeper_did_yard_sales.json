Factor that in along with players realizing that investing $50 in packs now might last them a few months, but when the next expansion releases, these cards may be obsolete if new mechanics are introduced and the current meta decks aren&amp;#39;t strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg5437m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982186.0, "created_utc": 1491953386.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s84o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s84o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54agg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrMathbot", "parent_id": "t1_dg4unmn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tavern Brawl, spectator mode?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavern Brawl, spectator mode?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg54agg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982454.0, "created_utc": 1491953654.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s84o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s84o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg510ay", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OnlyRoke", "parent_id": "t1_dg4vkdo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We.. didn't get any deck slots.. they kinda just enabled the Basic Deck slots and made those ones customizable, hence why we have 18 deck slots (9 old ones and 9 for the 9 Basic Decks) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We.. didn&amp;#39;t get any deck slots.. they kinda just enabled the Basic Deck slots and made those ones customizable, hence why we have 18 deck slots (9 old ones and 9 for the 9 Basic Decks) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg510ay", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978127.0, "created_utc": 1491949327.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vkdo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aurora2k7", "parent_id": "t1_dg4unmn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, we got deck slots.
