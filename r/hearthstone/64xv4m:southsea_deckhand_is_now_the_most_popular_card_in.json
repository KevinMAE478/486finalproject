First of all, overall winrate being lower when you play the card doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s always the wrong decision. For example, it&amp;#39;s possible that it&amp;#39;s correct to keep in some matchups but incorrect in others. Total winrate is just an average of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, correlation does not imply causation. For example, Hand of Protection is down there as well as one of the lowest winrates in the game. Does that mean it&amp;#39;s one of the worst cards in the game and &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; you to lose? No, it&amp;#39;s likely that it&amp;#39;s that low just because it&amp;#39;s played in (bad) Paladin Quest decks. It has a low winrate through association, not by directly being Silverback Patriarch-tier bad.
