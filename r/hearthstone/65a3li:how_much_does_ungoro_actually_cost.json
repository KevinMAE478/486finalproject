About a week ago I made a post about what an insane amount of money I... uh I mean someone I know... spent on just this expansion (it was more than US $400) and how... this person I know... was still missing a lot of cards and had no more extra dust to craft the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People blew up at me and called me a liar and downvoted it to oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, there you have it. I&amp;#39;m from the US but I live in a region where packs cost more, even when using Amazon Coins. I didn&amp;#39;t dust my goldens. So, here I am. I spent ... uh I mean this guy I know spent a truly embarrassing amount of money and still doesn&amp;#39;t even have access to the entire expansion. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg8yart", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492190132.0, "created_utc": 1492161332.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 131}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8o1l1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1908, "report_reasons": null, "author": "knotshure", "parent_id": "t3_65a3li", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is why I love the internet.

I also know that not everyone are reliant on their parents. These are exemple and gross approximations and it is intended to be. I don&amp;#39;t have the time to spend and calculate the actual dust value needed to play half of the deck, considering you need quests and legendaries that have an astronimical value compared to common, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure 200$ per expansion isn&amp;#39;t enough to actually cover half of the viable decks. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you have 68/135 cards, or 120/135 cards if you are missing the key cards for decks. So I stand my ground when I say that being able to play half the decks requires a lot of investment. Also the fun of HS for me isn&amp;#39;t playing a deck, but experimenting with decks, and sadly without a considerable collection all you can do is netdeck or experiment with a broken collection that extremely limit you capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also live on my own and work 40/hr a week just like most adult on the planet. This was an exemple, showing a classic case of a person that don&amp;#39;t value money like the average person. If you can&amp;#39;t see past that and stick to one example, than I&amp;#39;m sorry for you because I don&amp;#39;t feel like naming and examining every single person and their financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg901tg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492195778.0, "created_utc": 1492166978.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yzkz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 124, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RiveTV", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yv3j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This assumes you need every card from every expansion to stay competitive which isn't the case.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This assumes you need every card from every expansion to stay competitive which isn&amp;#39;t the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg8yzkz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492192367.0, "created_utc": 1492163567.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 124}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a3li", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a3li", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a3li", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg90a5x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jdmgto", "parent_id": "t1_dg900oq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Given that's the cost of ten brand new AAA games, yeah, it is.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that&amp;#39;s the cost of ten brand new AAA games, yeah, it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg90a5x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492196471.0, "created_utc": 1492167671.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg900oq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jaredismyname", "parent_id": "t1_dg8z3ka", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That seems ridiculously expensive...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That seems ridiculously expensive...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg900oq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492195688.0, "created_utc": 1492166888.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8z3ka", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mdk_777", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yv3j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You would probably only need around half of that to stay competitive.

In fact, as you need fewer cards, the cost to collect them drops at an increasing rate. This is because disenchanting and crafting the cards is (obviously) more expensive than opening them randomly, and you can disenchant all unplayable cards. I don&amp;#39;t have the exact numbers, but I&amp;#39;d suspect that your 110 packs gave you well over 50% (60? 70?) of the cards even though it was below half the number of packs to complete the set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your comment about this being a simulation and not real world results: it is prudent to examine the assumptions behind any simulation and not take the results as fact, but these probabilities were fed from real world results and should reflect them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also fixed the typo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg8p7fv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492169499.0, "created_utc": 1492140699.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a3li", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8rnrh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eatstheweeds", "parent_id": "t1_dg8onw3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The deck-building experience requires a bigger card library than net-decking does.
