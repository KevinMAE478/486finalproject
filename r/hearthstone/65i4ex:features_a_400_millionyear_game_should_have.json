The last time we saw a significant UI change was when Old Gods dropped and we were able to delete the Basic Decks and Deck Recipes were added.  The previous overhaul was when Tavern Brawl was added.  Laziness isn&amp;#39;t Blizzard&amp;#39;s corporate culture, so these overhauls &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; require drastically more work than they look to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole thing strikes me as a prototype that was jammed into something that was available cheaply, but has now become exponentially too big for its britches.  This game needs to be moved over to an engine that can actually handle it, and the longer Blizzard waits, the more work that will take.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dgampi1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492291031.0, "created_utc": 1492262231.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i4ex", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i4ex", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i4ex", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i4ex", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavb4s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Felix0900", "parent_id": "t1_dgak0fd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "$10 is crazy when you look at how other games offer cosmetic dlc, for instance [Rocket League's](http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/252950/) dlc gives you a car, 6 decals and a set of wheels for $2.
