For me i knew i would be able to do it for quite a while, but what was holding me back was the INSANE amount of grinding i knew i would need to do. Finally i found a deck that was really good against the wild meta decks at the time and it ONLY took 150 games from rank 5 to get to legend. Everyone makes misplays sure, but i dont believe that there are people that know all the cards in Hearthstone that is unable to get to legend putting enough time in with pretty much any deck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg862ws", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143984.0, "created_utc": 1492115184.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654mmw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg86cjt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Omegeria", "parent_id": "t3_654mmw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I hit legend back in the day with patron warrior pre-nerf, but now I just get bored around rank 5-3", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hit legend back in the day with patron warrior pre-nerf, but now I just get bored around rank 5-3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg86cjt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492144285.0, "created_utc": 1492115485.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654mmw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654mmw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8909t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bnightstars", "parent_id": "t1_dg86p7h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "this will be true but why most people don't reach rank 5 ether ?
