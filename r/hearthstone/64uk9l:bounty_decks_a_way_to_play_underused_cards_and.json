I laid out a similar idea a few weeks ago and got blasted by people who said there would be system gaming, etc. and told me to shut up and go play casual. I proposed essentially a Deck Creativity Score and some form of weighted star allocation working in the background of matches. I like your Bounty Deck name much better though! If they can implement a Heroic brawl format I'm sure they could implement this as a tavern brawl trial. Hell, charge us gold to unlock it, I'd still do it.\n\nThe ranking system and the associated reward mechanisms simply promote efficiency over creativity.\nThey should re-think the binary nature of win vs. loss rewards and perhaps implement a mathematical formula that identifies the total mana cost of the winning deck and a few other parameters and then calculates an appropriate number of stars to award the winner. Stats nerds might call this system \u201cweighted averaged stars\u201d or something like that. \n\nAny other methodology would be susceptible to manipulation (i.e. Time-based stars, people would just rope constantly, or number of turns-people would just pass pass pass to maximize their star gains). It would be harder to manipulate your deck\u2019s total mana cost because adding 2 Faceless Behemoths to your deck to spike its overall mana cost would be detrimental to your winrate and theoretically offset any gains attributable to weighted stars.\n\nCreative decks, or Kibler decks or whatever you want to call them, would have a lower winrate overall but that would be accommodated slightly by this weighted calculation. The exact parameters and structure of this formula-driven approach would be extremely difficult to get right but this small indie company can find the mathematicians to do it. I\u2019m sure of that.\n\nHell, they could go all out and assign a Deck Creativity Score or \u201cDCS\u201d for every constructed deck that would influence the star gains from ladder wins. It could even be transparent to the player. Click on your deck name and it displays the DCS and a tooltip that mentions the primary factors that contribute to a higher DCS, including budget cards, high cost cards, no duplicates, no legendaries, etc. They could experiment with what parameters to include and how much weight each gets assigned. This would also address the new player experience and imbalance issues they face when trying to climb the ladder against vastly superior collections.\n\nThe higher the DCS, the more your wins are worth but the less likely you will be to win against hyper efficient decks. So there\u2019s a risk/reward game within a game for the deckbuilding process, a process which right now surely has room for some improvement. This would encourage deckbuilding creativity and help diversify the metagame more so than the revolving door of nerfs or outright obliteration of certain cards (the dishonorably discharged Warsong Commander). Of course Kibler would be rank 1 legend every month, but I think we\u2019d all be ok with that. I\u2019d love to see this tested in a Tavern Brawl scenario.\n\nTLDR \u2013 Ladder system and rewards in their current state will continue to create hyper-efficient and often aggro dominated metas instead of creative/interesting/fun metas. I\u2019m not advocating for a control meta either, before anyone suggests that. Blizzard just needs to figure out how to overhaul their simplistic and binary ranking system to encourage deck-building creativity while still offering rewards and incentives that feel worthwhile. And don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cwin 3 games\u201d dailies, see above re: efficiency.

If they can implement a Heroic brawl format I&amp;#39;m sure they could implement this as a tavern brawl trial. Hell, charge us gold to unlock it, I&amp;#39;d still do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ranking system and the associated reward mechanisms simply promote efficiency over creativity.\nThey should re-think the binary nature of win vs. loss rewards and perhaps implement a mathematical formula that identifies the total mana cost of the winning deck and a few other parameters and then calculates an appropriate number of stars to award the winner. Stats nerds might call this system \u201cweighted averaged stars\u201d or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any other methodology would be susceptible to manipulation (i.e. Time-based stars, people would just rope constantly, or number of turns-people would just pass pass pass to maximize their star gains). It would be harder to manipulate your deck\u2019s total mana cost because adding 2 Faceless Behemoths to your deck to spike its overall mana cost would be detrimental to your winrate and theoretically offset any gains attributable to weighted stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creative decks, or Kibler decks or whatever you want to call them, would have a lower winrate overall but that would be accommodated slightly by this weighted calculation. The exact parameters and structure of this formula-driven approach would be extremely difficult to get right but this small indie company can find the mathematicians to do it. I\u2019m sure of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hell, they could go all out and assign a Deck Creativity Score or \u201cDCS\u201d for every constructed deck that would influence the star gains from ladder wins. It could even be transparent to the player. Click on your deck name and it displays the DCS and a tooltip that mentions the primary factors that contribute to a higher DCS, including budget cards, high cost cards, no duplicates, no legendaries, etc. They could experiment with what parameters to include and how much weight each gets assigned. This would also address the new player experience and imbalance issues they face when trying to climb the ladder against vastly superior collections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The higher the DCS, the more your wins are worth but the less likely you will be to win against hyper efficient decks. So there\u2019s a risk/reward game within a game for the deckbuilding process, a process which right now surely has room for some improvement. This would encourage deckbuilding creativity and help diversify the metagame more so than the revolving door of nerfs or outright obliteration of certain cards (the dishonorably discharged Warsong Commander). Of course Kibler would be rank 1 legend every month, but I think we\u2019d all be ok with that. I\u2019d love to see this tested in a Tavern Brawl scenario.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR \u2013 Ladder system and rewards in their current state will continue to create hyper-efficient and often aggro dominated metas instead of creative/interesting/fun metas. I\u2019m not advocating for a control meta either, before anyone suggests that. Blizzard just needs to figure out how to overhaul their simplistic and binary ranking system to encourage deck-building creativity while still offering rewards and incentives that feel worthwhile. And don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cwin 3 games\u201d dailies, see above re: efficiency. These \u201cwin x with x\u201d quests are just efficiency promoters that even pollute the casual game mode now, which I had previously considered a safehaven for creativity and \u201cfun\u201d in HS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "name": "t1_dg63pil", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042923.0, "created_utc": 1492014123.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uk9l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5kkk1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anarrogantbastard", "parent_id": "t3_64uk9l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I could see a version this being implemented if there are ever in client tournaments, or even special tavern brawls.
