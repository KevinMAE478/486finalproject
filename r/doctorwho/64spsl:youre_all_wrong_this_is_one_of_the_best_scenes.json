In addition I feel the major difference between Classic and New Who in relation to &amp;quot;soap opera baggage&amp;quot; is how heavily the companion&amp;#39;s families play in the companion&amp;#39;s lives while travelling with the Doctor. In Classic Who they were normally a precipitating event (parents or family members often died in the serial the companion joins or just previously to the events in the serial). In New Who they are constantly coming in and out of the companion&amp;#39;s and Doctor&amp;#39;s life. This creates a much different dynamic between the Doctor and their companion and how they treat their adventures which throws the &amp;quot;soap opera baggage&amp;quot; in much sharper contrast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "doctorwho", "name": "t1_dg5gi3s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491999404.0, "created_utc": 1491970604.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhek", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64spsl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5e9bj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IganSchacht", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ugx0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/doctorwho", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And don't forget her awesome grandpa!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t forget her awesome grandpa!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "doctorwho", "name": "t1_dg5e9bj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995849.0, "created_utc": 1491967049.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhek", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64spsl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5xy5z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FalconHunter", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ugx0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/doctorwho", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; didn't allow their own personal troubles and shortcomings get in the way\n\nEven though Donna forgot about them (or the writers just stopped hammering it home with dialogue), that's ALL she did.
