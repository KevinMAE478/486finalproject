It goes against what the Doctor stands for, and portrays him completely out of character. I get that Moffat was trying to portray him as the episode's title describes, but he literally shoots another Time Lord just because he was an obstacle. That's something you'd expect from the Master. His actions makes no sense because his motivation is saving ONE of the many companions he's had, not to mention a companion that has multiple entities existing because of \"The Impossible Girl\" plotline. Of course, he wouldn't share the same bond with any of these entities, but at least he could see her again. In fact, that's literally what he was going to do in the first place; his plan was to save her, then erase her memory of him, virtually having the same effect. I feel this whole out of character portrayal could have been salvaged if the Doctor was actually stopped, either by his own conscience or someone else (perhaps Ashildr/Me?), as has happened many times before with previous incarnations. Also, now that he's cheated death for one companion with virtually no consequences, what's to stop him from doing it with everyone?\n2. The Hybrid story arc goes nowhere, really, only suggestions and speculations are thrown around by Ashildr/Me as to what it is, and it really shows how poor the writing was for the episode when Steven Moffat had to confirm in an interview what it is, which is apparently what Ashildr suggested (the pairing of the Doctor and Clara). Had this been conveyed more confidently and was properly linked to the events of the episode, it would have given the arc a more satisfying conclusion, if the consequences of the Doctor becoming his own worst enemy were realised, which they aren't. In fact, there are no consequences, except the Doctor getting his memories erased of Clara, meaning he forgets the events of the episode and learns nothing, except he does remember her? Sorta?\nI feel if Moffat focused more on those two main aspects and brought them together cohesively and ironed out the logical kinks, it would become a decent season finale, but in it's current state it's just plain terrible unless you completely switch your brain off. I'll now continue the list with some personal nitpicks.\n3. It came after Heaven Sent, and was therefore automatically disappointing, but dropped the ball so hard that it kinda devalued what came before it.\n4. The ending with Clara and Ashildr/Me in the diner TARDIS felt like really bad fan-fiction.\n5. Gallifrey's wasted, as many others describe.\n6. Clara's death was fine as it was, and if any of the alternate options listed in 1. were chosen, this wouldn't be a problem. Reviving Clara felt like Moffat was just satisfying his own ego.\n7. It stings so bad because this could have easily been a great episode if Moffat showed the care and attention to detail that he showed in literally the very episode preceding it.\nPersonally, Hell Bent is my least favourite episode of the revived series because it had so much potential, so much to live up to, and instead dropped many balls, betrayed the character of the Doctor and made death have no weight or meaning. It commits many easily avoidable sins, and it really sucks because I can see how it could have been good.\nIf any wants to defend the episode and counter my criticisms, feel free to do so, I welcome any and all constructive counterarguments.
