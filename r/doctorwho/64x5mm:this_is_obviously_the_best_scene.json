It is what made me fall in love with Matt Smith\u2019s Doctor. And why he will likely be my favorite rendition of the character. While Tony Curran\u2019s portrayal of Van Gogh is unparalleled. Matt Smith\u2019s Doctor, and Karen Gillian\u2019s Amy Pond are just as imperative to the story. When we meet Van Gogh at the beginning of the episode, he is a penniless drunk - and the town\u2019s joke. He only sold one painting in his lifetime, and struggled with mental illness until his suicide at the age of 37. While there is much debate of the effect his mental illness had on his late paintings, his art expresses that he was at the peak of his ability, and completely in control - longing for concision and grace. Understanding Van Gogh takes more than an appreciation of his art. He frequently wrote his younger brother, Theo - who provided Vincent primary emotional, and financial support. These letters provide us insight into why Vincent painted, not just for the love of art. But for the love of nature, color, and what he believed to be a necessary response to his torment. One of my favorite quotes from his letters to Theo states \u201cI long so much to make beautiful things. But beautiful things require effort\u2014and disappointment and perseverance.\u201d Van Gogh produced over 2,100 artworks in his lifetime, his best-known in the last two years of his life. He had such a command of color because he saw things beneath the surface. I believe that he saw these things because he looked for them, not just because he was gifted. In another letter to Theo he wrote: \u201cAt present I absolutely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that night is still more richly coloured than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance. And without my expatiating on this theme it is obvious that putting little white dots on the blue-black is not enough to paint a starry sky.\u201d In this episode, Vincent is able to see something that Amy and The Doctor, and even the viewer cannot. We are only able to see it through his portrayal. Not only that, but Vincent has insight into Amy\u2019s loss, even though she is not aware of it herself. Vincent takes the Doctor and Amy\u2019s hands at the end of the episode, and shows them the way he sees the world. Vincent: \u201cHold my hand, Doctor. Try to see what I see. We\u2019re so lucky we\u2019re still alive to see this beautiful world. Look at the sky. It\u2019s not dark and black and without character. The black is, in fact deep blue. And over there: lighter blue and blowing through the blues and blackness the winds swirling through the air and then shining, burning, bursting through: the stars!\u201d [the sky gradually transforms into van Gogh\u2019s painting Starry Night] Vincent: \u201dAnd you see how they roar their light. Everywhere we look, the complex magic of nature blazes before our eyes. It seems to me there\u2019s so much more to the world than the average eye is allowed to see. I believe, if you look hard, there are more wonders in this universe than you could ever have dreamt of.\u201d The Doctor: \u201cI\u2019ve seen many things, my friend. But you\u2019re right. Nothing\u2019s quite as wonderful as the things you see.\u201d While the Doctor and Amy are able to save Vincent from the danger at hand, they are unable to save him from himself. Amy spends the majority of the episode hoping that time can be rewritten, and that Vincent will live a long life since they \u201csaved\u201d him. However, when they return (without Vincent) to the present - Amy despairs that there aren\u2019t any new Van Gogh paintings. She turns to the doctor with tears in her eyes and says: \u201cWe didn\u2019t make a difference at all.\u201d The Doctor turns to Amy, embraces her and says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don\u2019t always soften the bad things, but vice-versa, the bad things don\u2019t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. And we definitely added to his pile of good things.\u201d I find myself on both sides of this story. There are times when I feel tormented, and I will never be understood, or appreciated. I battle not giving into despair or the sickness I feel inside myself. There are times I feel that I\u2019m sacrificing my sanity for powering through, or pulling myself out of bed on days when I simply do not want to exist. Then there are times when I meet someone else in the midst of their despair. I recognize it immediately, and I want to save them. Perhaps some of that is empathy, some of that is hope that I can be saved myself. Of course, the problem is that we can\u2019t save anyone from themselves, no matter how badly we want to. I have some friends who used to be in (addiction/alcoholism) recovery (like myself) who I try to call every couple of weeks. So often I wish I could just go over to their apartment, or drag them out of a bar back into a meeting. Not to shame them - but because I care about them. 90% of the time, when I call my friends who are still battling alcoholism, addiction, or depression I get their voicemail. I always leave a message telling them that I care about them, that I love them, and I\u2019m available if they ever want to talk. Out of the 200+ voicemails I\u2019ve left this year, I\u2019ve been called back twice. And when they do answer, they are normally frustrated, angry, bitter, or too busy to talk. I think that it\u2019s important not to expect anything in return for our compassion, or love. We want so desperately to be able to make a difference, and we count everything as a loss if we feel that we don\u2019t. It\u2019s important to know that you can make a difference, and it still matters even if you can\u2019t save someone from themselves (in the end). So often, we consider a single defeat to define us, or others. But when I look at Van Gogh, as tragic as his suicide was - his art changed the world. It changed me - it speaks to, and comforts me on a regular basis. And that is more than a victory against death. I know it\u2019s hard to see past our own lifespan, or the lifespan of others. But I promise - when you make something that lasts, when you pour your heart and soul into something - it will speak longer than you ever could. We can always make a difference.

It is what made me fall in love with Matt Smith\u2019s Doctor. And why he will likely be my favorite rendition of the character. While Tony Curran\u2019s portrayal of Van Gogh is unparalleled. Matt Smith\u2019s Doctor, and Karen Gillian\u2019s Amy Pond are just as imperative to the story. When we meet Van Gogh at the beginning of the episode, he is a penniless drunk - and the town\u2019s joke. He only sold one painting in his lifetime, and struggled with mental illness until his suicide at the age of 37. While there is much debate of the effect his mental illness had on his late paintings, his art expresses that he was at the peak of his ability, and completely in control - longing for concision and grace. Understanding Van Gogh takes more than an appreciation of his art. He frequently wrote his younger brother, Theo - who provided Vincent primary emotional, and financial support. These letters provide us insight into why Vincent painted, not just for the love of art. But for the love of nature, color, and what he believed to be a necessary response to his torment. One of my favorite quotes from his letters to Theo states \u201cI long so much to make beautiful things. But beautiful things require effort\u2014and disappointment and perseverance.\u201d Van Gogh produced over 2,100 artworks in his lifetime, his best-known in the last two years of his life. He had such a command of color because he saw things beneath the surface. I believe that he saw these things because he looked for them, not just because he was gifted. In another letter to Theo he wrote: \u201cAt present I absolutely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that night is still more richly coloured than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance.
