It&amp;#39;s generally considered that Tom Baker is one of the best Doctors and Sarah Jane is one of the best companions. He had a long era and did a lot of backstory on The Doctor&amp;#39;s home planet and had many fantastic serials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(New) Series 3 Episode 10 - Blink&lt;/strong&gt; (Mid-10th Doctor)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s a terrible starting point if you&amp;#39;re already hooked, Blink is usually used as one of the best episodes to get new people interested in the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Classic) Doctor Who: TV Movie&lt;/strong&gt; (8th Doctor)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really an entry point per se since it&amp;#39;s the only televised 8th Doctor material there is (save for Night of the Doctor). This was an attempt to appeal to the American market with a pilot for an American series and failed as it was pretty poor. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it as a starting point to the show but Paul McGann is a fantastic Doctor, he has an amazing collection of audio stories and it&amp;#39;s only a couple hours or so.
