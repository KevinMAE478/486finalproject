A place she thought she'd be able to catch a train to anywhere, she instead found herself on an island filled with inbred hillbillies, wannabe Italian gangsters, and young white kids screaming \u201cShaolin\u201d for absolutely no reason whatsoever. \n\nShe\u2019d stay up late at night, plotting an escape from her future hell as either a waitress at a Polynesian restaurant in a strip mall, specializing in Sweet 16 parties, or a stay at home mom who only wears velour track suits seven days a week. \n\nShe\u2019d rather die by the hands of Cropsey than live one more day on that rotting garbage heap. With sheer determination and two slices from Nonna\u2019s, the only good thing Staten Island has to offer, she made her move on that foggy morning in November. She crawled on hands and knees, for what reason, no one knows, up to the toll booths of the Verrazano. Her new life less than a mile away, she lifted herself up and began to run. \n\nWith her eyes glued to the road, she ran as fast as she ever imagined. The dreaded fear of those Staten Island mutts catching her carried each foot faster and faster. Her attention began to focus on her surroundings.
