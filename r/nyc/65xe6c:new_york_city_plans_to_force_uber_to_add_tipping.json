Consumers just keep doing it so there isn&amp;#39;t an incentive to pay decent wages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works in the rest of the world, but somehow in the US I&amp;#39;m expected to tip someone for pouring a black coffee or taking me somewhere after I already paid for the service. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked in a restaurant for years, it&amp;#39;s a shitty practice that only really benefits companies. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nyc", "name": "t1_dgektqx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492512416.0, "created_utc": 1492483616.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgekh8o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shmoozey", "parent_id": "t1_dgehoq3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nyc", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Those jobs are typically well paid.
