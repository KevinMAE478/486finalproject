As such, it took some time to figure out the proper technique/settings to satin-stitch the star symbol. The neoprene was chosen to achieve the form fitting design which also required structure for the peplum that flows straight out from her waist. I crafted the single loop bow from interfaced casa satin. The shorts I also made from neoprene. I wore pink ballet tights and turned one pair into arm socks. I also styled the wig by taking out wefts and hand-sewing in a felt cone at the center, which I then glued the wefts back onto and used hairspray + heat to lift the rest of the wig into a cone around it. The front curls were styled with velvet covered heat rollers. I&amp;#39;m pleased with the result and am currently working on making her spear to add to the costume.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitchdb.tv/user/103202205\"&gt;http://www.twitchdb.tv/user/103202205&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get your creative work ready because the next Bi-Weekly Creative Contest will start tomorrow, &lt;strong&gt;Friday April 14th&lt;/strong&gt;.
