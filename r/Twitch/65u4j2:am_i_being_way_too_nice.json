I am a small streamer (&amp;lt;100 followers) and up til yesterday I was streaming highly saturated games and making slow climbs in viewer numbers. Which was fine, really. I do want to be successful but I like streaming games I like. Yesterday, I started playing a significantly less popular, smaller indie game, and my viewer count exploded. Within 20 minutes I was the top viewed channel in the game and the chat went nuts.  Almost everyone was asking if they could join my group, and I was just trying not to be an asshole, so I reluctantly started by saying the first person who asked could join in. This only incited more clamoring, and I was dancing back and forth between Discord and the stream and trying to learn the game. It was a pain in the ass the whole time. I was also getting multiple conflicting suggestions from EVERYONE about how to set up a game I knew NOTHING about.  I maintained like this for four hours before I was too exhausted and stressed out to go on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I resolved to add Nightbot for chat commands and take a hard look to try to figure out my Discord server to try to mitigate some of the things that were going on.  I created a few commands, including one for players asking if they could group up.  I even advertised the command, but that wasn&amp;#39;t working either.  I only have one mod, who is usually playing with me and not focusing 100% on the chat. I have a couple regulars who help me a bit, but it&amp;#39;s not enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn&amp;#39;t expect to spike so quickly. I wasn&amp;#39;t prepared.
