This new purple bar contains a lot of information, but honestly, this bar on it&amp;#39;s own is not that bad.  It&amp;#39;s a one stop shop for most things you need to access on Twitch (except for followed/subbed channels), and it looks fairly clean.

This channel bar also contains information which appears in multiple locations which is completely unnecessary.  &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tGw7Bxc.jpg\"&gt;If you&amp;#39;re watching a channel that you follow, the name, icon, or some combo of the two, will appear &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; times on this page, sometimes more&lt;/a&gt; (red circles).  Which leads us in to the...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Followed streams are listed down the left literally less than an inch away from the &amp;quot;Following&amp;quot; page link in the top bar.  It also serves to display duplicate information such as viewer count and game title (blue and yellow circles respectively).  And yes, I know you can \nminimize the left bar but if you do that it basically becomes useless unless you&amp;#39;re really good and remembering icons, but even still, you can&amp;#39;t see any stream information for people you follow unless you have it open, or go to the &amp;quot;Following&amp;quot; page right above it.  Plus, as far as I can tell the channel information does not update in real time (seems to refresh every couple of minutes), so in order to even get updated information as to who is and isn&amp;#39;t live, see what people are playing, or see the titles at all, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to go to the following page.  When the left bar is expanded, the deluge of text, images, red dots, and numbers is painful to look at.  Partner that up with chat on the right and it&amp;#39;s an onslaught on the eyes to look at your website.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, Twitch&amp;#39;s approach with this new layout was to not make things any easier, but to simply cram more information in to one place.  Now, going back to the first image, compare this to Beam.  Everything you need is in one bar at the top of the page.

This is simply meant to be constructive criticism from someone who works very close to people in web dev and graphic design.
