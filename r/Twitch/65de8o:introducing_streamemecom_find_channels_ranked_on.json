After &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5sqdq8/would_something_like_this_be_cooluseful/\"&gt;posting the idea on this sub a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt;, I got some good feedback and positive responses so I decided to make the site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came up with an idea for Streameme watching a particular salty streamer, and seeing chat spam PJSalt. I wanted to find other salty streamers in real time, but realized there was no easy way to do this. So I came up with Streameme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Streameme uses chat&amp;#39;s content and ranks the channels by how often the words/emotes are used. For example, the funny category can use &amp;quot;LOL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;LUL&amp;quot;, etc as well as EleGiggle.\nHow the site works is by joining the roughly top 1500 channels and parsing the chat. Over a rolling period of 5-15 minutes based on viewer count, it ranks the amount of criteria being met and displays them on the site. After that period, the records are purged to try and keep the rankings up to date in real time. You can find out more &lt;a href=\"http://www.streameme.com/Home/About\"&gt;in the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently the filter defaults max of 1000 viewers. However, you can use the filters if you&amp;#39;d like to change that. Also if you see the fire icon, that means the chat is spamming the criteria at least 2x more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way I hope the tool can help people discover new channels, and hopefully allow for smaller viewer count streams to get some visibility. If not, I think its an interesting way to see what streams are spamming what.
