As a streamer starting out, you want to be successful because you want your effort, time, and investment to streaming to pay off. Everything seems to feel like a numbers game: &amp;quot;how can I get more viewers? How can I get more follows? What&amp;#39;s a good view to follow ration? When will I reach 100 followers? 500? When will viewers donate to me?&amp;quot; Let&amp;#39;s face it, a lot of us have asked this. But I feel if you worry too much about these numbers, it&amp;#39;s unnecessary stress you&amp;#39;re putting on yourself. You should care about your stream, but you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be worried/paranoid about it.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People will leave your stream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nNot everyone is going to be interested in watching you. Think of it like performing music on a street corner, some people may watch for 30 seconds, some people may watch for 30 minutes. You may be super enthusiastic, animated, and interactive, but if someone isn&amp;#39;t into that vibe, they&amp;#39;ll just leave. Don&amp;#39;t take it to heart because it&amp;#39;s just how life is, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve done the same to many things: songs, tv shows, YouTube clips, etc.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People will unfollow you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIt\u2019s probably the worst feeling as a new streamer to gain a follower and then lose another.

I have unfollowed (and even re-followed) streamers, it\u2019s nothing personal. Don\u2019t take it to heart. (unless a personal friend unfollows you, then I\u2019d start asking questions lol).

That doesn\u2019t mean you will in 12 months. Some people take 12 months to gain 1 follower.

Some streamers do &amp;quot;follow for follow&amp;quot;, not because they are genuinely interested in each other&amp;#39;s stream, but because they want to pad their follow numbers. There are even paid services to give you followers and viewers. Speaking of viewers, some streamers give themselves &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; viewers to boost their exposure in a game category by having multiple sessions of their stream up. These new streams may seem like they are having amazing growth and are popular, but in reality, it&amp;#39;s artificial...    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewers can tell when you&amp;#39;re too focused on growth rather than fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI enjoy watching small streams, and when a streamer asks me to follow after I say &amp;#39;Hi&amp;#39;, that&amp;#39;s an instant turn off. Even worse is when I watch a stream and the streamer goes off on a rant about how hard it is to grow and unfair that some people are growing faster. This isn&amp;#39;t entertaining, this is cringey and uncomfortable.
