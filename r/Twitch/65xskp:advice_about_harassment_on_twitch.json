While I can't offer advice beyond block/report, here are some bandaid alternatives (which you may have already tried/known about/had suggested to you previously ... but maybe there's something useful in here regardless -- that's my hope at least):\n\n1) Don't respond to him in ANY way. While streaming, have a mod or yourself ban without fanfare whatever username he's using. Even saying something like, \"I'm banning you,\" or, \"Leave this channel,\" can be enough attention for him. Don't say/type anything to him at all. \n\n2) Use incognito/private browsing mode while watching other streams (if you're ok with lurking in those channels), or use a separate account to chat there that he doesn't know about. This does make it harder to get your name out there as a streamer, but if people associate your name with him trolling in their channels ... it might not be doing much good for you anyway. If the only time he can harass you is when you're streaming, YOU have control over HIM. (see: #1)\n\n3) Be detailed in your reports and ask other witnesses (not in open chat, obviously) to do the same. Dates and previous usernames will (I suspect) help to backtrack the harassment. \n\n4) I honestly believe that for him to have been doing this for so long, he's getting something out of it. Only you can give him that something, so if you can figure out what that may be, you can slap a big ol' DENIED sticker on that. 9 times out of 10, they're looking for attention of ANY kind (see: #1)\n\n5) There's only so much Twitch can do. As he said, it's easy to change an IP, so eventually you'll have to make the choice about what's more important to you. Not everyone can be thick-skinned enough to just ignore him, so if you feel like this is something you just can't stomach anymore ... walk away from streaming. Make a new username that he can't trace back to you and just enjoy the Twitch viewer experience -- I know I do :)\n\nAnyway, this may all be old news to you, but hopefully there's something in there you haven't tried (or whoever else reads this and is having their own stalker issues).
