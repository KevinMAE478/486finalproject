After that you need to set how those calories will be filled with, high protein will help you build muscle mass and high carb will help you through activities that demand a lot of physical work or endurance.\n\nSo, let's say your maintenance is 2000 cal and you wanna increase to 2300 cals to gain weight, and you want a 40/40/20 protein/carbs/fat diet.

It doesn't matter how many meals, how large or what they're made of, as long as you meet your macros, and get your nutrients from varied, healthy sources, you'll move closer to your goal.\n\nNutrition requires constant attention and you need to make adjustments as you gain weight, mass, or notice your diet isn't really working out. Set out a realistic plan you can go through and strive for small, consistent changes over radical, ambitious goals.

This helps you portion your main meals well.\n* Don't rely on but don't be afraid of supplements - Protein supplements are usually cheaper than meat weight for weight by protein and even calories, they shouldn't ever be relied on, nor make up a significant part of your diet, but they're great for times when you're struggling to get in enough protein and can be drank on the move or at any time.\n\n**Foods**\n\n* Nut butters, nuts and seeds in general- Particularly walnut paste and pumpkin seeds because they're cheap, relatively neutral in taste, high in Omega 3 and high in protein. Whichever nut paste/butter you like most just start adding them to foods you already eat- breakfast cereals, yogurts, sandwiches, fruit, even savoury dishes as a satay or coating/sauce.\n* [Learn to love eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0)\n* Cheese- calorie dense food with lots of protein and fat. Great for adding to existing meals/foods too and goes great with above.\n* Milk- Pretty much the liquid form of cheese but with a little more lactose and so easy to drink down.\n* Overnight oats- I like to buy 5kg of oats and a packet of things like hazelnuts, cranberries, walnuts, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, flax etc and mix them all together with a dash of salt and some sweetener of choice. I have a laundry scoop which I position on the tub and every night I'll put a scoop in a bowl with milk and leave it in the fridge overnight and wake up to sweet, delicious porridge with 400+ healthy calories.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other people have addressed the general outline of diet really well so I&amp;#39;ll try to address this, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m just here to ask if you guys have any meal/snack suggestions that pack a punch and are healthy?
