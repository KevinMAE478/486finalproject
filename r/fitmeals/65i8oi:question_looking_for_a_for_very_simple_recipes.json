Knowing how to cook will then mean you'll know if you can and how to adapt recipes to suit your tastes or your limitations. \n\nOne of the easiest things to cook with your equipment is a stir fry.

Lots of things work with stir fries, I like carrots, broccoli, green beans, cauliflower and a leafy green like spinach, bok choy or wombok. \n\nFor the sauce, a basic recipe I might use includes 1Tbsp soy sauce, 1tsp crushed or chopped garlic, 1/2tsp crushed ginger, 1/2tsp crushed chilli, 1tsp fish sauce or oyster sauce and honey or brown sugar to desired sweetness. Play with the ratios; you can get vastly different flavours by emphasising one or another component. If you'd like a thicker sauce add a teaspoon of cornflour (corn starch) to the cold sauce mix. If you add it to a hot pan you'll get lumps. \n\nThe basics are heat (medium high) your pan with some oil (sesame oil is delicious if you have it).  Make sure you start cooking with a hot pan, it should sizzle.  If you're using onion, garlic or other spices that you want to brown but not burn, brown them first, remove from the pan then add back in with the sauce at the end. Add your protein to your hot pan and keep it moving until it's browned. You don't want it cooked through just yet, it'll finish with the veggies. Once the protein is browned, add all of your harder veggies. Keep them moving until they're just tender but still have some crispness and texture. Add your soft/leafy vegetables last along with your stir fry sauce. They usually only take 30-60 seconds to wilt. \n\nWhile that's cooking, you can put on rice or noodles if you want them.
