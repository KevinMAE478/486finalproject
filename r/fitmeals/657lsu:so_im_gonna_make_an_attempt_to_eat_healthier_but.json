Even though this is FitMeals, you've posted a question that goes a bit off the grid. This post is going to be more about choices and general weight loss from a 1000-ft view rather than specific recipes for more fit meals. (sorry)\n\nSo try to ignore your ideas of what you believe \"healthy\" is. Because most of it is PR nonsense. Let's look at some major chains and places that lots of us go to eat.\n\nLet's say you go to Applebees, and you think, \"I'm going to eat right today. I'll have an Oriental Chicken Salad. Salad and grilled chicken are healthy,\" you'll actually be eating around 1400 calories-- way over half your daily allotment if you believe in a 2000 calorie diet. [Source](https://www.applebees.com/Nutritional-Info). But if you decided to be \"indulgent\" and get the Pork Chop with Chutney and decide to get some sweet potato fries, you'd still be under 1000 calories. Now, you'd be best off in this case getting the pork chop and steamed veggies or broccoli (which would put you around 650-750 calories), but you get my point. \n\nAnd how about Chipotle? [Source](https://chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator). I like their setup-- I can get what I really want, and not what I don't. I'm a huge burrito magnet. But *just* the tortilla sets me back 300 calories. Dang. Do I want it that much? If I skip the tortilla, that's a huge savings. And I get the same tasty from a bowl. You said that fake meats/tofu are the only healthy way to go. Let's explore that. Sofritas and Steak are the same number of calories. Sofritas has higher fat. No cholesterol. More sodium. Less than half the protein. More carbs by a longshot. More calcium. So is Sofritas automagically better because it's made of soy? Well, it really depends on what your goals are. If your goal is to eat less red meat, no meat, or etc., then yes. If your goal is to lose weight, and you don't care about vegan/vegetarian options, then the steak is fine for you.\n\nDid you know that if you have a daily Starbucks habit, and you switch from a grande vanilla latte to a grande soy latte (btw, they use vanilla soy, so you still get the vanilla and sweet taste), you'll save 60 calories a day? [source](https://www.starbucks.com/menu/catalog/nutrition?drink=all#view_control=nutrition&amp;drink=espresso). That's 300 calories a week for a M-F habit. Switching out 1 or 2 days per week for straight coffee will make those cuts even wider. \n\nDid you know that if you currently eat dessert every day, and you *just* stop eating dessert, you'll lose 1lb per week? (500 cal dessert x 7 = 3500 cal or 1 lb body fat.) Likewise, if you're eating a few snacks per day that could be better spent, calorically, you can find cuts everywhere. If you have a soda habit, and you can swap out even 1 soda per day with water, you'll be saving tremendously. Try to swap it out with water, not sweetened water or no-cal soda-- research is out there for why. [source](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/diet-soda-healthier-regular-soda/).\n\nMy point is you can do a lot better for yourself just by making better food choices instead of overhauling everything you eat and hold dear. Start there. Maybe someday you'll decide that you *want* to make more food, but your current ideas of eating healthy are probably setting you up for failure by making them unpalatable and/or unattainable. You're going to have a bad time if you think your cooking is going to make you vomit, and if you don't like cooking then it's going to be a difficult chore to keep going. So start off making better choices and cutting what you don't *need* and then work from there!
