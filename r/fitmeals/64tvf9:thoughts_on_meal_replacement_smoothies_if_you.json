I wouldn't want to gain 5lb/month though since i'd rather reduce the amount of body fat I'd be gaining along with muscle... I've accidentally fast bulked due to binge eating issues when I went on medication and I gained 15lbs in like 2 months. Not a pretty sight.\n\nProtein powder and oats are plenty filling. Just not as a drink. Even when I make oats they need to be double cooked (so double the water = double the volume) or they need to be paired with lots of other satiating food. There have been posts here, I think I made a post about it actually, discussing the most and least satiating foods. Or maybe I posted it on r/loseit. Anyways, plenty of people said that oats aren't satiating. Others said they are. Different results. \n\nLooking through research, one study (\"Solid versus liquid-satiety study in well-adjusted lap-band patients.\") discusses how liquid calories/meals are less satiating than solids, although adding water to a solid meal doesn't increase satiety.\n\nAnother study shares these results: \"In real-life setting the intake of the liquid (809396 g) was respectively 14 and 30% higher compared to the semi-liquid (699391 g) and semi-solid product (566311 g; P&lt;0.0001). In laboratory setting, removing eating effort, resulted in a 29% (P&lt;0.0001) intake difference between liquid (319176 g) and semi-solid (226122 g). Standardizing eating rate resulted in 12% difference between liquid (200106 g) and semi-solid (17688 g; P=0.24). If not controlled, the difference in intake between liquid (419216 g) and semi-solid (277130 g) was comparable to the real-life setting (34%; P&lt;0.0001). \" (The effect of viscosity on ad libitum food intake). \n\nAnother older study from 1991 has a similar finding: \" In a first experiment, the two-food meals had the same caloric content, weight, volume, composition and temperature but differed only in their physical form (solid or liquid). As compared to the solid meal, the 24-h total caloric intake following the liquid food was higher. This difference could be attributed to cognitive cues from the form of food or to the lack of masticatory movements while ingesting the liquid meal. The last hypothesis was tested in a second experiment, \"In which the test-meals appeared absolutely identical to the senses and were composed of a liquid and a solid item; however, the major part of calories was either in the liquid or in the solid part. When most of the calories had to be drunk, the total subsequent caloric intake was higher than when most of the calories had to be eaten. It seems that calories ingested in a liquid form are not well taken in account and could induce a subsequent overconsumption, at least until satiety was conditioned to the fluid.\" (Effect of the physical state of a food on subsequent intake in human subjects.)\n\nThis study discusses differences in liquid vs solid meal replacements, which would lump into protein powder drink vs protein bar: \"Previously we reported that the thickness of meal replacement diet shakes had a direct and significant effect on hunger intensity during the first 2 h and that hunger intensity scores for liquid meal replacements were significantly below baseline for 3 h following consumption (Mattes, R.D., Rothacker, D. Beverage viscosity is inversely related to postprandial hungar in humans. Physiol. Behav. 2000, 74 (4-5), 551-557.). This study Uses the same protocol to investigate meal replacement bars designed for overweight consumers. Subjects were prescreened to include only those that normally ate breakfast and liked chocolate. The bar used in this Study contained 250 calories (about 30 more than most liquid diet shakes) 4 g of dietary fiber, 14g protein, and 8 g of fat. Subjects were instructed consume the entire bar with a glass of water following an overnight fast when they would normally consume their first meal of the day and to assess their hunger on a I (not hungry at all) to 9 (as hungry as I have ever felt) scale before consumption, immediately after and hourly for 6 It (only on typical weekdays). Similar assessments were made for the perception of stomach fullness (1 = empty, 9 = extremely full), strength of the desire to eat (1 = no desire, 9 = extremely strong) and thirst (1 = not at all thirsty, 9 = extremely thirsty). One-hundred and eight subjects (23 males; 85 females) completed the study. No gender satiety differences were found. Hunger ratings and desire to eat remained significantly below baseline for 5 h following consumption. Stomach fullness scores were significantly above baseline for 5 h. Thirst scores were significantly below baseline for 3 h. Although the meal replacement diet bars contained only 30 additional calories than liquids, they provided an additional 2 h of hunger suppression from baseline which may have an impact on overall weight loss success. These results support superior short-term hunger control with solid meal replacements.\" (Short-term hunger intensity changes following ingestion of a meal replacement bar for weight control)\n\nAnd another study: \"On two occasions, 9 subjects (age: 61 \u00b1 3 years; BMI: 25.6 \u00b1 1.3 kg/m2) consumed 25 % of daily energy needs as solid or liquid meal-replacements of similar energy contents. Blood and appetite ratings were collected over 4 hours. The post-prandial hunger composite (area under the curve) was lower following the solid versus liquid meal-replacement (p &lt; 0.005) and remained below baseline over 4 hours (p &lt; 0.05). Similar responses were observed with the desire to eat. The insulin and ghrelin composites were lower following the solid trial compared to the liquid [insulin: 5825 (range: 4676\u201311639) vs. 7170 (4472\u201314169) uIU/l \u00b7 240 min, p &lt; 0.01; ghrelin: \u2212 92798 (range: \u2212 269130\u201347528) vs. \u2212 56152 (range: \u2212 390855\u201330840) pg/ml \u00b7 240 min, p &lt; 0.05]. Ghrelin also remained below baseline over 4 hours (p &lt; 0.05). No differences in cholecystokinin and leptin were observed between products.
