But all I want is the new road stuff. Ferries are useful only in a city with lots of waterways, monorails make your city look like a 1970&amp;#39;s theme park, cable cars are only useful if you have a big mountain to climb (as long as your citizens don&amp;#39;t mind being pinned against the glass as they travel at a 45 degree angle) and blimps are an unrealistic gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, I&amp;#39;m really looking forward to the expansion but I can&amp;#39;t see myself doing much with the new transport types, with the possible exception of ferries. I can see myself messing around with the new road and rail tools for hours though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CitiesSkylines", "name": "t1_dg7vq2c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492132828.0, "created_utc": 1492104028.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_331rj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655b59", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_331rj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655b59", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7owr3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "monkeyvoodoo", "parent_id": "t1_dg7np2g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CitiesSkylines", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Following up on my own comment, it sounds a helluva lot like Port Blue's [Setting Sail](https://youtu.be/YsNLiKqL_ls?t=60).
