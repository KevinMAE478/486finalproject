When different speed RAM is used in the same PC, all RAM drops down to operate at the slower speed, which in your case is the 1334MHz. This is fine, but you are not utilizing all the potential of the Crucial RAM. If you decide to replace the Samsung RAM in the future, make sure the new RAM is 1600MHz so that it matches the speed of the Crucial RAM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CitiesSkylines", "name": "t1_dgc44wq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492383506.0, "created_utc": 1492354706.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxatr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nlx78", "parent_id": "t1_dgavj3y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CitiesSkylines", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you know more about the question raised by Hawkera?
