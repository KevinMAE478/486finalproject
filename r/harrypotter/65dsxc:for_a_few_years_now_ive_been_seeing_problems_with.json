I like him so much I'm taking my notes as I read instead of reading the whole thing first, just in case I end up not liking his conclusion. But anyone who bothers to figure out why Dumbledore would value Bob Ogden's memory is someone whose opinion I intend to listen to.\n\n&gt; The memory may serve two other purposes, though. First, it kind of, sort of helps establish that Voldemort never experienced love ... if Dumbledore thinks Harry is skeptical about this \u201cpower,\u201d driving it home by showing Harry this memory makes a lot of sense.\n\n&gt; The other purpose \u2014 and the one I\u2019m more interested in: Harry now has a critical clue about the identity and location of the Resurrection Stone.\n\nI think both these points are sufficient to justify why Dumbledore shows it to Harry. And I think the fact Dumbledore is on a \"wild goose chase\" is sufficient reason for Dumbledore to have sought out Ogden in the first place.\n\n&gt; Dumbledore was also a member of the Wizengamot and almost certainly knew about Morfin\u2019s attack on Tom Riddle Sr. and on Marvolo\u2019s attempt to defend his son against Ogden and the other authorities.\n\nI don't think this detail changes the point, but while it's *likely* that Dumbledore was on the Wizengamot at this point, do we know for *sure?* Even the [Wikia](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizengamot) doesn't know his start date, and considering how thoroughly they document questionable \"canon\", I imagine they would list it if it had ever been mentioned. But I don't actually think this point would change Dan's point.\n\n&gt; I\u2019ve seen a few explanations, but only one makes sense.\n\nWhere is Dan seeing all these explanation of what Dumbledore learned from this memory, and where I can join that community??\n\n&gt; And finally, Dumbledore had no idea what he was looking for but figured it was worth the look. We generally think of that as a good idea: when you\u2019re dealing with the Dark Lord, leave no stone unturned, right? But that\u2019s not consistent with what we already know \u2014 Dumbledore began his investigation into Voldemort\u2019s past in 1943 if not before, as established by when he obtain Morfin Gaunt\u2019s memory.\n\nWait - why isn't that consistent with what we already know? Why, Dan, do you think he started his investigation in 1943? I think I'm missing something here.\n\n&gt; Why was Dumbledore investigating Voldemort\u2019s past before Voldemort was Voldemort?\n\nBefore reading the rest of the essay - my answer is, he didn't take it for granted Riddle was the charming perfect boy everyone thought he was. Perhaps because he saw Riddle with his guard down, he recognized it as a mask from the start, but had no proof because Riddle was that good at covering his tracks. This led him to suspecting he had something to do with the Chamber of Secrets. I think that is enough reason for Dumbledore to start an investigation just with that, but you're right it doesn't necessarily account for why he didn't do something about it. However, *Grindelwald* might account for Dumbledore being distracted.\n\n&gt; Dumbledore didn\u2019t have Slughorn\u2019s memory until probably the 1980s\n\nAny reason you think he got it in the 80s? I think he got it between 1992-1994, otherwise, wouldn't Dumbledore know that Riddle made or wanted to make multiple Horcruxes before he saw the diary in 1992?\n\nAnd I know Dan doesn't think this is the answer, but shouldn't it also be noted that Dumbledore did not recognize the ring as a Hallow until he found it in the Gaunt house in 1996? Meaning he didn't get a good look at the ring on Tom's hand in '43-45, nor could he tell it was a Hallow from the memories. He was curious about the ring, perhaps, but the fact he never realized it was a Hallow could suggest he wasn't looking *that* hard at the *ring*, even if he was looking hard into the murders.\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s because he was ashamed of telling the truth.\n\nI'm not sure I'm going to agree with your conclusion, but hats off to you for having a theory based on Dumbledore's shame. I agree it's a huge driving force and most theories assume he did things just because he has some uncontrolable need to manipulate.\n\n&gt; Dumbledore wasn\u2019t really interested in discovering more about Voldemort\u2019s past or investigating the murder of the Riddles. He was investigating the whereabouts of Marvolo\u2019s ring.\n\nDaaaaaaamn, not the theory I was expecting!!! This is great!! Though....... though.... *though*...... I don't think I will believe this theory, because of what I said before. I don't think he would be looking actively, consciously. Perhaps a part of him would dwell on the stone, wishing for the chance to apologize, but I don't think he was in the mental state to search for the ring at this point, not with Grindelwald in the news starting wars and all that. I don't think he would attempt to solve his problems or find answers in the Hallows at this stage of his life. I don't say this to defend his moral fiber, he's foolish and cowardly, but it's his very shame that would stop him from looking, that makes him so afraid of Grindelwald. Dumbledore winning the Elder Wand suggests a huge jump in his understanding what the Hallows are really about. And that is the biggest reason why he wouldn't seek the Resurrection Stone. This is going to have to be a very convincing argument to win me. I'm thrilled to keep reading.\n\nOnto Dan's thoughts on why Dumbledore is lying to Harry in limbo; Dumbledore is admitting his shame to Harry, he is being very open. Why not admit that he was looking for the Hallows in the 40s when he admits he was looking for them in his teens and admits he had James's cloak and admits that he went mad from seeing the Resurrection Stone that *led to his death and left Harry all alone?* How would his hunt in the 40s make him *more* ashamed than the other examples? Dumbledore would surely know that Harry would understand why someone would want the Stone. Dumbledore knew what Harry saw in the Mirror of Erised, he knew (in limbo) that Harry had intended to die to those he loves. Why in the world would Dumbledore be compelled to keep his desire for the Resurrection Stone a secret in limbo? *Why would the shame be that strong?*\n\n&gt; Just like he lied when his afterlife-self told Harry that he only had the cloak for a few days.\n\nThis could suggest that he would lie. While I don't actually think he does, I can't deny that this could suggest it. But I don't find Dan's argument convincing that he would lie about *the stone* and especially *in this way*.\n\n&gt; Dumbledore gave up the search for the Hallows, but only temporarily. He ends up acquiring the Elder Wand\n\nHe doesn't intentionally go after the wand. He goes after Grindelwald to save people from his wrath. He gains the wand, not out of personal glory, and *that* is why he is suitable for the wand. He doesn't gain the wand out of a desire to gain the wand. He gains the wand out of a desire to protect people.\n\n&gt; Once again, you need to give Dumbledore a ton of credit for having the foresight to collect this memory \u2014 more foresight than even he is due.\n\nI think it likely Dumbledore collected this memory years after Smith died, possibly in the 60s. Why not look into disappearances and murders around the guy he's investigating? I don't think the logic needs to be stretched or that there needs to be a self-motivated hunt for the Resurrection Stone to explain why he would have interviewed these people or collected these memories.\n\n&gt; Also, I think my version of the events makes Dumbledore a lot more human \u2014 and a lot more sympathetic. ... he\u2019s still brilliant and wise, but he\u2019s also flawed. And that flaw makes him accidentally effective\n\nAnd this is why I love this essay even if I don't find it convincing. But I think Dumbledore is already a lot more human than most people think he is even *when* he is \"insisting on going it alone\". I think looking at the risks involved *and* the gaps in his own undersanding reveal why Dumbledore is both scared to reveal the information and scared to reveal it to the wrong person, before he understands who the wrong people to share it with might even be.\n\n&gt; And you know what? I like that Dumbledore. He\u2019s the greatest wizard of all time \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean he has to be perfect, or even should be.\n\nI love Dumbledore more than I can physically contain specifically because he isn't perfect. He is the most fascinating character I've ever read.\n\n&gt; In fact, we never find out how Dumbledore discovered the location of the ring/Horcrux. \n\nChecked out the house and found it by accident? (edit: when I say by accident I mean, he likely knew he'd find something, just didn't know he'd find a Hallow). Would account for (my theory) where he is taken by surprise and loses his mind when he sees it. If he were mentally prepared to find the stone - that is, if he were or had been actively searching - I think he might have had a different reaction.\n\nDan Lews - if you ever want to chat about Dumbledore, let me know. I've written my own [essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/) on Dumbledore and while we differ on the details, we still have very similar ideas about Dumbledore in general. I think we could spend hours analyzing him. I may not be convinced, but I've still never read a better essay about Dumbledore.\n\nCheers!\n\n_____\n\nDan - I would love to continue over-analyzing everything with you if you're keen!\n\nedit: I'm almost positive I've sourced [your silent B page](http://nowiknow.com/why-we-have-a-silent-b/) on reddit before.", "edited": 1492212840.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone else posted this two hours sooner than you and I&amp;#39;ve spent all day drafting my response only to find I should have posted it here instead!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the text of my other comment,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like this Dan Lewis guy - a lot.

First, it kind of, sort of helps establish that Voldemort never experienced love ... if Dumbledore thinks Harry is skeptical about this \u201cpower,\u201d driving it home by showing Harry this memory makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other purpose \u2014 and the one I\u2019m more interested in: Harry now has a critical clue about the identity and location of the Resurrection Stone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think both these points are sufficient to justify why Dumbledore shows it to Harry. And I think the fact Dumbledore is on a &amp;quot;wild goose chase&amp;quot; is sufficient reason for Dumbledore to have sought out Ogden in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore was also a member of the Wizengamot and almost certainly knew about Morfin\u2019s attack on Tom Riddle Sr. and on Marvolo\u2019s attempt to defend his son against Ogden and the other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think this detail changes the point, but while it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; that Dumbledore was on the Wizengamot at this point, do we know for &lt;em&gt;sure?&lt;/em&gt; Even the &lt;a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizengamot\"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t know his start date, and considering how thoroughly they document questionable &amp;quot;canon&amp;quot;, I imagine they would list it if it had ever been mentioned. But I don&amp;#39;t actually think this point would change Dan&amp;#39;s point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve seen a few explanations, but only one makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where is Dan seeing all these explanation of what Dumbledore learned from this memory, and where I can join that community??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, Dumbledore had no idea what he was looking for but figured it was worth the look. We generally think of that as a good idea: when you\u2019re dealing with the Dark Lord, leave no stone unturned, right? But that\u2019s not consistent with what we already know \u2014 Dumbledore began his investigation into Voldemort\u2019s past in 1943 if not before, as established by when he obtain Morfin Gaunt\u2019s memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait - why isn&amp;#39;t that consistent with what we already know? Why, Dan, do you think he started his investigation in 1943? I think I&amp;#39;m missing something here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why was Dumbledore investigating Voldemort\u2019s past before Voldemort was Voldemort?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before reading the rest of the essay - my answer is, he didn&amp;#39;t take it for granted Riddle was the charming perfect boy everyone thought he was. Perhaps because he saw Riddle with his guard down, he recognized it as a mask from the start, but had no proof because Riddle was that good at covering his tracks. This led him to suspecting he had something to do with the Chamber of Secrets. I think that is enough reason for Dumbledore to start an investigation just with that, but you&amp;#39;re right it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily account for why he didn&amp;#39;t do something about it. However, &lt;em&gt;Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt; might account for Dumbledore being distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore didn\u2019t have Slughorn\u2019s memory until probably the 1980s&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any reason you think he got it in the 80s? I think he got it between 1992-1994, otherwise, wouldn&amp;#39;t Dumbledore know that Riddle made or wanted to make multiple Horcruxes before he saw the diary in 1992?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know Dan doesn&amp;#39;t think this is the answer, but shouldn&amp;#39;t it also be noted that Dumbledore did not recognize the ring as a Hallow until he found it in the Gaunt house in 1996? Meaning he didn&amp;#39;t get a good look at the ring on Tom&amp;#39;s hand in &amp;#39;43-45, nor could he tell it was a Hallow from the memories. He was curious about the ring, perhaps, but the fact he never realized it was a Hallow could suggest he wasn&amp;#39;t looking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hard at the &lt;em&gt;ring&lt;/em&gt;, even if he was looking hard into the murders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But that\u2019s because he was ashamed of telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m going to agree with your conclusion, but hats off to you for having a theory based on Dumbledore&amp;#39;s shame. I agree it&amp;#39;s a huge driving force and most theories assume he did things just because he has some uncontrolable need to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore wasn\u2019t really interested in discovering more about Voldemort\u2019s past or investigating the murder of the Riddles. He was investigating the whereabouts of Marvolo\u2019s ring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daaaaaaamn, not the theory I was expecting!!! This is great!! Though....... though.... &lt;em&gt;though&lt;/em&gt;...... I don&amp;#39;t think I will believe this theory, because of what I said before. I don&amp;#39;t think he would be looking actively, consciously. Perhaps a part of him would dwell on the stone, wishing for the chance to apologize, but I don&amp;#39;t think he was in the mental state to search for the ring at this point, not with Grindelwald in the news starting wars and all that. I don&amp;#39;t think he would attempt to solve his problems or find answers in the Hallows at this stage of his life. I don&amp;#39;t say this to defend his moral fiber, he&amp;#39;s foolish and cowardly, but it&amp;#39;s his very shame that would stop him from looking, that makes him so afraid of Grindelwald. Dumbledore winning the Elder Wand suggests a huge jump in his understanding what the Hallows are really about. And that is the biggest reason why he wouldn&amp;#39;t seek the Resurrection Stone. This is going to have to be a very convincing argument to win me. I&amp;#39;m thrilled to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Onto Dan&amp;#39;s thoughts on why Dumbledore is lying to Harry in limbo; Dumbledore is admitting his shame to Harry, he is being very open. Why not admit that he was looking for the Hallows in the 40s when he admits he was looking for them in his teens and admits he had James&amp;#39;s cloak and admits that he went mad from seeing the Resurrection Stone that &lt;em&gt;led to his death and left Harry all alone?&lt;/em&gt; How would his hunt in the 40s make him &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; ashamed than the other examples? Dumbledore would surely know that Harry would understand why someone would want the Stone. Dumbledore knew what Harry saw in the Mirror of Erised, he knew (in limbo) that Harry had intended to die to those he loves. Why in the world would Dumbledore be compelled to keep his desire for the Resurrection Stone a secret in limbo? &lt;em&gt;Why would the shame be that strong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just like he lied when his afterlife-self told Harry that he only had the cloak for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could suggest that he would lie. While I don&amp;#39;t actually think he does, I can&amp;#39;t deny that this could suggest it. But I don&amp;#39;t find Dan&amp;#39;s argument convincing that he would lie about &lt;em&gt;the stone&lt;/em&gt; and especially &lt;em&gt;in this way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore gave up the search for the Hallows, but only temporarily. He ends up acquiring the Elder Wand&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t intentionally go after the wand. He goes after Grindelwald to save people from his wrath. He gains the wand, not out of personal glory, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is why he is suitable for the wand. He doesn&amp;#39;t gain the wand out of a desire to gain the wand. He gains the wand out of a desire to protect people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, you need to give Dumbledore a ton of credit for having the foresight to collect this memory \u2014 more foresight than even he is due.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it likely Dumbledore collected this memory years after Smith died, possibly in the 60s. Why not look into disappearances and murders around the guy he&amp;#39;s investigating? I don&amp;#39;t think the logic needs to be stretched or that there needs to be a self-motivated hunt for the Resurrection Stone to explain why he would have interviewed these people or collected these memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I think my version of the events makes Dumbledore a lot more human \u2014 and a lot more sympathetic. ... he\u2019s still brilliant and wise, but he\u2019s also flawed. And that flaw makes him accidentally effective&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is why I love this essay even if I don&amp;#39;t find it convincing. But I think Dumbledore is already a lot more human than most people think he is even &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; he is &amp;quot;insisting on going it alone&amp;quot;. I think looking at the risks involved &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the gaps in his own undersanding reveal why Dumbledore is both scared to reveal the information and scared to reveal it to the wrong person, before he understands who the wrong people to share it with might even be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And you know what? I like that Dumbledore. He\u2019s the greatest wizard of all time \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean he has to be perfect, or even should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love Dumbledore more than I can physically contain specifically because he isn&amp;#39;t perfect. He is the most fascinating character I&amp;#39;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, we never find out how Dumbledore discovered the location of the ring/Horcrux. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Checked out the house and found it by accident? (edit: when I say by accident I mean, he likely knew he&amp;#39;d find something, just didn&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;d find a Hallow). Would account for (my theory) where he is taken by surprise and loses his mind when he sees it. If he were mentally prepared to find the stone - that is, if he were or had been actively searching - I think he might have had a different reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan Lews - if you ever want to chat about Dumbledore, let me know. I&amp;#39;ve written my own &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/\"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; on Dumbledore and while we differ on the details, we still have very similar ideas about Dumbledore in general. I think we could spend hours analyzing him. I may not be convinced, but I&amp;#39;ve still never read a better essay about Dumbledore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan - I would love to continue over-analyzing everything with you if you&amp;#39;re keen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I&amp;#39;m almost positive I&amp;#39;ve sourced &lt;a href=\"http://nowiknow.com/why-we-have-a-silent-b/\"&gt;your silent B page&lt;/a&gt;

So I doubt he'd turn this into a detailed confessional.\n\nIt appears to me to be exactly what he is doing:\n\n&gt; \u201cCan you forgive me for not trusting you? ... I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. ...  I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd I was such a fool. But you know, don\u2019t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cMaster of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\u201d\n\n&gt; \"You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. ... I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\u201d\n\n&gt; His tone was unbearably bitter.\n\n&gt; \u201cSo you\u2019d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the\nCloak?\u201d [Harry asked.]\n\n&gt; \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself. ... You know the secret of my sister\u2019s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.\n\nDumbledore's seems sure that Harry knows this, which seems omniscient to me.\n\n&gt; \u201cI resented it, Harry.\u201d\n\n&gt; Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the\ntop of Harry\u2019s head, into the distance.\n\n&gt; \u201cGrindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me,\nHarry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards\ntriumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the\nrevolution.\n\nHe seems to be giving quite the confession.\n\n&gt; \u201cOh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. **Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes.** If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.\n\nHe even makes himself appear *worse* than he could have, he could have said, \"I didn't know what he was, he tricked me!\" but he doesn't. He readily admits he knew deep down, but was too selfishly driven to admit to himself what Grindelwald was.\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone \u2014 to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.\"\n\n&gt; \u201cInvincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me.\"\n\nHe seems perfectly prepared to admit these weaknesses about himself, and even adds embellishments that make him appear worse suggesting how aware he is that what he did was wrong and why.\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother\u2019s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\u201d\n\n&gt; ... \u201cWell, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows ... He ran, **while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.**\"\n\n&gt; \u201cI, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cBut you\u2019d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!\u201d\nburst out Harry. \n\n&gt; \u201cWould I?\u201d asked Dumbledore heavily. \u201cI am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. \n\nAgain, he seems very open about admitting his weaknesses.\n\n&gt; \"...while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him ... Oh, not death ... Not what he could do to me magically. I knew ... perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. **It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister.

I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was. . . .\"\n\nHe can admit to this, but not admit that he had been interested in the Resurrection Stone when he was middle-aged?\n\n&gt; \u201cI was such a fool, Harry.

I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\u201d\n\nHe can admit that he was never worthy of the Deathly Hallows, that this was the final proof, that he had ben weak his entire life - and yet he can't admit to his search in the 40s?\n\n&gt; \u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was natural! You wanted to see them again. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\nHe can't admit he'd been looking for the Stone, even when Harry tells him it's only natural? When Harry, of all people, would understand?\n\n&gt; \u201cMaybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.\"\n\n&gt; \u201cBut the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner.\n\nHe can admit he took it out of vanity, but is somehow too ashamed to go into more detail?\n\n&gt; The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did.

Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. ... I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His tone was unbearably bitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo you\u2019d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the\nCloak?\u201d [Harry asked.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself. ... You know the secret of my sister\u2019s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore&amp;#39;s seems sure that Harry knows this, which seems omniscient to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI resented it, Harry.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the\ntop of Harry\u2019s head, into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGrindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me,\nHarry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards\ntriumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the\nrevolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seems to be giving quite the confession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. &lt;strong&gt;Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He even makes himself appear &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than he could have, he could have said, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know what he was, he tricked me!&amp;quot; but he doesn&amp;#39;t. He readily admits he knew deep down, but was too selfishly driven to admit to himself what Grindelwald was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone \u2014 to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cInvincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seems perfectly prepared to admit these weaknesses about himself, and even adds embellishments that make him appear worse suggesting how aware he is that what he did was wrong and why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother\u2019s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... \u201cWell, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows ... He ran, &lt;strong&gt;while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut you\u2019d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!\u201d\nburst out Harry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWould I?\u201d asked Dumbledore heavily. \u201cI am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, he seems very open about admitting his weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him ... Oh, not death ... Not what he could do to me magically. I knew ... perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. &lt;strong&gt;It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right.

Lupin's quote in the PoA tells us Dumbledore became Headteacher between 1965 and 1971, meaning Hepzibah died between 1955 and 1961\n\nIn the spirit of making absolutely sure, I re-read both chapters 18 from PoA and 20 from HBP. The only information ch. 18 of PoA gives us is Lupin's quote,\n\n&gt; \"It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts ... but then Dumbledore became headmaster\"\n\nAccording to [Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin), \n\n&gt; \"Shortly before Remus Lupin\u2019s fifth birthday, as he slept peacefully in his bed, Fenrir Greyback forced open the boy\u2019s window and attacked him.\"\n\nRemus was born March 1960, so he was attacked before March 1964. This could give us a range between Dec 1963-March 1964, but mostly likely closer to March. For the Lupins to have sufficient time to believe that Remus would not be able to attend Hogwarts, Dumbledore can't have been headmaster any earlier than 1964. There is technically a small possibility Dumbledore became headmaster even before the attack and it was merely the Lupins' initial assumption that Remus would not be able to attend school, but I think this is stretching it, so I'm going to say Dumbledore became headmaster after the attack.\n\nSo this pinpoints the timeline to Dumbledore becoming headmaster in or after 1964. This also depends on whether or not 1960 is definitely accurate for Lupin's birth year (I had trouble finding an original source for this, though all the HP fan sites say he was born in 1960), but I don't think -+1 years makes much of a difference here, so I think it's safe to say he was born in 1960.\n\nTherefore, I think the dates 1965-1971 are accurate enough for when Dumbledore became headmaster.

Lupin&amp;#39;s quote in the PoA tells us Dumbledore became Headteacher between 1965 and 1971, meaning Hepzibah died between 1955 and 1961&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of making absolutely sure, I re-read both chapters 18 from PoA and 20 from HBP. The only information ch. 18 of PoA gives us is Lupin&amp;#39;s quote,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts ... but then Dumbledore became headmaster&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin\"&gt;Pottermore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shortly before Remus Lupin\u2019s fifth birthday, as he slept peacefully in his bed, Fenrir Greyback forced open the boy\u2019s window and attacked him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remus was born March 1960, so he was attacked before March 1964. This could give us a range between Dec 1963-March 1964, but mostly likely closer to March. For the Lupins to have sufficient time to believe that Remus would not be able to attend Hogwarts, Dumbledore can&amp;#39;t have been headmaster any earlier than 1964. There is technically a small possibility Dumbledore became headmaster even before the attack and it was merely the Lupins&amp;#39; initial assumption that Remus would not be able to attend school, but I think this is stretching it, so I&amp;#39;m going to say Dumbledore became headmaster after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this pinpoints the timeline to Dumbledore becoming headmaster in or after 1964. This also depends on whether or not 1960 is definitely accurate for Lupin&amp;#39;s birth year (I had trouble finding an original source for this, though all the HP fan sites say he was born in 1960), but I don&amp;#39;t think -+1 years makes much of a difference here, so I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say he was born in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I think the dates 1965-1971 are accurate enough for when Dumbledore became headmaster.
