She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn&amp;#39;t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn&amp;#39;t think had anything to do with nerves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on she even wishes him luck in a later match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the fourth book we see Harry run into her before the World Cup:\n&lt;em&gt;...and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team.

Their one and only date ended terribly with many tears and frustration. Once again Harry&amp;#39;s inept understanding of a girl&amp;#39;s feelings rears its ugly head as he is not able to understand Cho&amp;#39;s frustrations.

As much as I love JK Rowling, romance is not her forte. However, out of all the romances that spring up throughout the books, the Harry/Cho one to me seemed the most natural as it developed over a span of four books it seems.
