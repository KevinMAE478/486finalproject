Truly great magic does not involve saying silly words or even a wand. Certain acts, even certain *intentions* (so basically what you're thinking and/or feeling), carry a magical power. Think of Lilly's sacrifice - she didn't cast a spell to protect Harry. But her willingness to sacrifice her life to save him created a powerful magical protection, strong enough to counteract a Killing Curse.\n\nThroughout the books, Harry discovers more and more types of magic which don't rely on spells. He even thinks in the Deathly Hallows: *\"As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.\"*\n\nTo answer one of your questions. What is guarded behind the locked door in the Department of Mysteries? Dumbledore explains it at the end of the Order of the Phoenix: *\"\u201cThere is a room in the Department of Mysteries,\u201d interrupted Dumbledore, \u201cthat is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.\u201d\"*\n\nThe Department of Mysteries researches the areas of magic which are not connected to spells. There is a room where they study death (the one with the Veil), human intelligence (the one with the brains), time (the area with the time turners, from which you could also access the Hall of Prophecy), and love (the locked room) among other things. The rooms seem to contain powerful magical artefacts which are connected to the different mysterious \"non-spell\" areas of magic. Like the prophecies - there seem to be no hard rules about how to foresee the future (as McGonagall tells Hermione in her third year), instead, some people seem to randomly just *know* what is going to happen. What does that tell us about the nature of time? How do the magical prophetic powers of people like Trelawney work? We don't have answers, but the people in the Department of Mysteries are obviously working on finding them.\n\nSince I'm a Ravenclaw, I found the room studying human intelligence the most interesting, for two reasons. Firstly, we know that one's intent, one's thoughts, are extremely important when it comes to magic. Students have to concentrate to make spells work, Harry has to think of a good memory to summon a Patronus, Lily's and later Harry's intent to die to save others resulted in a magical protection. Secondly, there is this interesting sentence about the damage done to Ron by the brains: *\"There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain\u2019s tentacles had wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly\u2019s Oblivious Unction, there seemed to be some improvement.\"* It seems thoughts have some interesting magical properties, and I'm really curious about them.\n\nAs for the room studying death, the only explanation we get is from Nearly Headless Nick: *\"Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, \u201cNot everyone can come back as a ghost.\u201d \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cOnly \u2026 only wizards.\u201d [...] \u201cI was afraid of death,\u201d said Nick. \u201cI chose to remain behind.
