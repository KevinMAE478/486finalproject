There are always hidden nuances that people don't realize at first glance.\n\nThe important thing for anyone to remember is - fans love canon, but they all have different ideas of what canon means. For the purposes of this argument, let's say there are three types of HP fans. 1. Anything JKR says is canon. 2. Only the seven books are canon. 3. The films are canon because JKR approved them and she wouldn't have approved them if they were wrong. If 1. then you are probably happy with whatever JKR says about her world, even if it changes it slightly. If 2. then you are probably frustrated with JKR for tweets and her Pottermore updates and especially when they slightly contradict things from the books. If 3. then you conflate the two mediums (book and film) as if they are one entity rather than two industries that don't include the same people, and so it's only natural to assume theatre will be conflated into that too.\n\nThere are also lots of levels and types of politically and socially aware people. Way too many to list here, but for the purposes of this argument, let's say there are three types. A. People who aren't aware how little minorities are represented in Western media. B. People who are aware. and C. racists.\n\nJust by these categories alone, there are potentially 9 different opinions about this. If I'm 1A. or 1B, then I'm probably perfectly happy to imagine Hermione is black, because she either \"always was black\" or \"she's black now\". If I'm 2A, though, I might say that... well, the books *heavily imply* she's white and Dean and Angelina are both specified to be black and so that means Hermione's white, and I don't appreciate JKR changing this, and because Hermione is definitely white, this probably means JKR just wants to feel good about herself by being progressive. If I'm 2B, then I probably think that, yes, Hermione was written as white, but anyone should have the chance to play this great character and considering her race isn't directly specified, it isn't even technically breaking canon to have a woman of color play her, so there shouldn't be an issue. If I'm 3A, then I'm confused, because Emma Watson is white, and so shouldn't the stage actress look like Emma Watson? I might even suggest they should cast Emma, Dan, and Rupert for the stage. 3B probably doesn't exist, and 1C, 2C, and 3C are just racist.\n\nOn top of these opinions, there is the fact that most HP fans are not literary academics. Nor should they be, but academia is very comfortable with multiple interpretations of the same text, and HP fans are not. Also, serial stories (like comics) and fantasy/sci-fi are usually ignored by academia, and those are the types of stories that use the word canon, meaning there really are no established rules about what canon should or shouldn't be. Everyone is just kind of making up their own definition and thinking it should be the only one.\n\nUltimately black Hermione is a canon issue for most fans. A lot of fans still aren't over Dan Radcliffe's blue eyes. I remember fans being up in arms that Petunia's hair color was wrong. I went to an HP fan convention and a costume designer from the films was there and I saw *three* people ask him in harsh tones why Hermione's dress wasn't blue in GoF.\n\nBut *ultimately* ultimately.... I think diversity in media is more important than any definition of canon, and diverse representation has to be a conscious change, it won't happen unconsciously. The accusation against films for casting minorities to \"appear progressive\" come from people who don't understand how hyper-analyzed every choice in film is or how casting works.

Hate his face, his voice, his presence, I dunno if its because jupiter ascending was the first time I ever saw him or what, but I cant stand him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "harrypotter", "name": "t1_dg73oni", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084270.0, "created_utc": 1492055470.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg72949", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ravenclaw1991", "parent_id": "t1_dg6vgtw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/harrypotter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I find it hard to believe there wasn't a single moment you didn't like...
