That could explain why Hogwarts is so well protected, no one can break in, and the idea of Jinxing a name like that. Harry must&amp;#39;ve performed a sort of Apparition that is more- instant, more like teleporting than compressing yourself in no-space. That gives a new perception on underage magic, it&amp;#39;s able to trigger some parts of magic some Wizards simply cannot do consciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, but no, I still don&amp;#39;t like it. It&amp;#39;s like using a law of the land to justify keeping a secret from an entire prominent community. Like saying 1/3 of the Wizarding population has no clue of their identity for a reason that applies to 2/3 (actually more. More like 9/10.) Limbo can be dealt with.
