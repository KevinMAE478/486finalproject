I can imagine Hermione helping Ginny with potions homework and Ginny showing Hermione mundane magical pranks, talking about household spells, and chatting with her after quidditch practice while Hermione did homework in the bleachers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really think that Hermione hanging out with Ron would bother her. All my female friends with older brothers were thrilled to be rid of them when they finally got to school. I never got the sense that Ginny wanted approval or attention from her older siblings. Harry might be different, but it seemed to me that Ginny was so crushed out on him that even if he had tried to hang out with her, she wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to handle it. If anything, I can imagine Hermione telling Ginny silly little details about Harry because she knew that Ginny had a crush.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ginny-Fleur relationship seems like one that might inspire more jealousy or misunderstanding, as touched on lightly in the book. Fleur has the air of being &amp;#39;snobby,&amp;#39; at least until her true colors show, which is definitely in contrast to both Ginny and Hermione&amp;#39;s core personalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "harrypotter", "name": "t1_dgdv2w7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481415.0, "created_utc": 1492452615.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiqi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voyq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiqi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voyq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiqi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voyq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiqi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65voyq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge7wei", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "goodlife23", "parent_id": "t1_dge6tk9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/harrypotter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I imagine that when he and Ginny finally talked about their year apart, it was very difficult for Harry since he ended it to keep her safe and she really wasn't.
