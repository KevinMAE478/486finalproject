His disdain for the incompetent and arrogant officers who sneer at the Force and the once-great Jedi that he used to be a part of. The rage he has against the Order, hunting the survivors down mercilessly one by one to find Kenobi, the man he blames for his loveless, agonizing life. He finds entire groups of surviving Padawans and cuts them down all at once. These magical monks that the troopers fear are all children before Vader, and their awe of his ability to kill Jedi feeds his infamy. \n\nShow Vader visiting Padme's grave. His labored breathing catches just a bit as he enters the tomb. He places an uncertain glove on the stone surface. A small hologram appears with some of the last images of Padme, her hair long and her face beaming with a smile. Vader's breathing intensifies, and stops altogether when she turns to him to reveal a circular belly, cradling it softly. Vader leaves quickly, telling his troopers to seal it permanently behind him, and orders it never to be opened again. Afterwards he is particularly vicious with the Naboo senator he has come to put back into line. \n\nHe's on the deck of a Star Destroyer, having just captured the *Tantive IV*. The princess won't give up her rebel friends, and Vader's patience is running thin. He *hates* this woman. She's stubborn and brave and fearless, and something about her fills him with rage. He decides he will torture her himself, but leaves partway through. For some reason he couldn't watch any more. \n\nNews of Vader's softness reaches the Emperor. He is displeased and admonishes Vader; for some time now he has felt the power diminish in him. He has grown weaker. Privately he plots to replace him. This disgust with Vader only grows stronger after the destruction of the Death Star. Vader cares little; a large part of him wants to die now.\n\nVader entrusted the task of finding information on the pilot that destroyed the Death Star to Boba Fett.

Show the struggle that no one sees when he dons the suit, in agony every day. His disdain for the incompetent and arrogant officers who sneer at the Force and the once-great Jedi that he used to be a part of. The rage he has against the Order, hunting the survivors down mercilessly one by one to find Kenobi, the man he blames for his loveless, agonizing life. He finds entire groups of surviving Padawans and cuts them down all at once. These magical monks that the troopers fear are all children before Vader, and their awe of his ability to kill Jedi feeds his infamy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Show Vader visiting Padme&amp;#39;s grave. His labored breathing catches just a bit as he enters the tomb. He places an uncertain glove on the stone surface. A small hologram appears with some of the last images of Padme, her hair long and her face beaming with a smile. Vader&amp;#39;s breathing intensifies, and stops altogether when she turns to him to reveal a circular belly, cradling it softly. Vader leaves quickly, telling his troopers to seal it permanently behind him, and orders it never to be opened again. Afterwards he is particularly vicious with the Naboo senator he has come to put back into line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s on the deck of a Star Destroyer, having just captured the &lt;em&gt;Tantive IV&lt;/em&gt;. The princess won&amp;#39;t give up her rebel friends, and Vader&amp;#39;s patience is running thin. He &lt;em&gt;hates&lt;/em&gt; this woman. She&amp;#39;s stubborn and brave and fearless, and something about her fills him with rage. He decides he will torture her himself, but leaves partway through. For some reason he couldn&amp;#39;t watch any more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;News of Vader&amp;#39;s softness reaches the Emperor. He is displeased and admonishes Vader; for some time now he has felt the power diminish in him. He has grown weaker. Privately he plots to replace him. This disgust with Vader only grows stronger after the destruction of the Death Star. Vader cares little; a large part of him wants to die now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vader entrusted the task of finding information on the pilot that destroyed the Death Star to Boba Fett.

They focused far too much on details that were nigh insignificant in the grand scheme.

Couple all this with the &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; results after his fall and you can see why he&amp;#39;d think he was lied to about the Dark Side as well - he was able to end the war and bring peace &lt;em&gt;the very day he fell.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of the galaxy thought the Jedi had orchestrated the war to seize power - a conspiracy that given his growing mistrust for the Jedi it seems likely he&amp;#39;d be giving more credence to. (Keep in mind he was already too old by the time he joined the Jedi - the council never wanted him to join, they believed he couldn&amp;#39;t be trained from that age, they thought he was dangerous and they &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; fully trusted him - he knew all of this.) From his perspective, the Jedi were executed and the war was instantly won - clearly they were part of the problem and killing them wasn&amp;#39;t a mistake. &lt;em&gt;From his perspective.&lt;/em&gt; The fact that was all orchestrated by Palpatine to turn him was, again, not immediately clear at the time. Given &lt;em&gt;all that,&lt;/em&gt; when he was put on the council at the Chancellors request and they refused to make him a Master, it was just confirmation for him they were hiding something and weren&amp;#39;t willing to tell him the truth - it was the final proof he couldn&amp;#39;t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s one of the main problems with the prequels. They focused far too much on details that were nigh insignificant in the grand scheme. Yes, love was the passion that led him to the Dark Side, but a Jedi who trusted in their teachings could have let go, and by the time of RotS, he didn&amp;#39;t - which was... not really glossed over, but it certainly wasn&amp;#39;t given focus in the movies as it should&amp;#39;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll always defend the prequels. They&amp;#39;re messy and flawed with shit dialogue, but at their core they&amp;#39;re an amazing story told poorly. You should read the novelization for RotS if you&amp;#39;re into that kind of thing - it&amp;#39;s the same story told &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HighQualityGifs", "name": "t1_dg6ynph", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077574.0, "created_utc": 1492048774.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6vege", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Incursus", "parent_id": "t1_dg6utkf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HighQualityGifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But Anakin's fall was completely centered on the cheesy romance. \n\nEDIT: Well this sparked some very well written responses that I enjoyed reading.
