But like anything else, you improve greatly with practice. James Kochalka and John Porcellino are examples of good cartoonists who express a lot with relatively minimalist styles. Check them out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-There is no barrier to entry whatsoever to cartooning. A true democratized art form! All you need is paper and pens. And a scanner, if you want to share your work online. The starting point is right in your sketchbook or at your desk. All other tools such as fancy drawing tables or german brushes made from unicorn hair, are totally optional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would recommend you read a lot of comics. You&amp;#39;ll notice what goes into it, the thought process at work. Read everything, short fiction, novels... and have fun exploring in your art.     &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg460dz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491941515.0, "created_utc": 1491912715.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg44rga", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kypperstyx", "parent_id": "t3_64mmvz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What are all of the processes to getting started?
