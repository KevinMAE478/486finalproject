I just saw the Fictional Languages analysis video; it was cool.  I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to learn a conlang for a while (and had started trying to learn the Elvish alphabet a couple of years ago but that fell by the wayside as I forgot about it).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What conlang do you suggest I start with?&lt;/em&gt;  I&amp;#39;m a fluent English speaker and am technically(?) fluent in Taishanese, but I don&amp;#39;t know very much of the latter vocab-wise.  I don&amp;#39;t have any attachment to the popular conlangs&amp;#39; source material, though I did read &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; for school.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Also, has anyone ever told you that you vaguely look like Billy Eichner?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg6lyih", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061962.0, "created_utc": 1492033162.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6505eb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6m4f2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bob51zhang", "parent_id": "t3_6505eb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In your opinion, what's the best conlang created?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what&amp;#39;s the best conlang created?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg6m4f2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492062161.0, "created_utc": 1492033361.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6505eb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6m5pi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "q203", "parent_id": "t3_6505eb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you ever considered making a conlang yourself?
