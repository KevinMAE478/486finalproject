The fight attendants are there for your safety and no passenger can legally set foot on a passenger plane without a flight attendant on board for the companies security and passenger safety.

Why is it so important to bump PAYING passengers you ask? Often there are trips that end at out stations or a crew member gets sick or a plane gets broke and the crew 'times out' while it's fixed and they need a new crew to fly it. The long and short of it is that if they take a different flight or don't make it good chance your delaying or worse cancelling not only that flight but the rest in the sequence that crew is covering as well. You do the math. \n\n\nNow should they haul a passenger off a plane to do it? Of course not, they should know if they have dead headers before they start boarding and get offers for people to fly later and a hotel before they board and rebook the required passengers before they get to the plane. However sometimes there's a last minute scheduling change. Most airlines I've seen will either rebook the company people on other flights of necessary or just cancel the other flight all together to avoid just this.\n\n\nWhy do they oversell or downsize airplanes anyway?
