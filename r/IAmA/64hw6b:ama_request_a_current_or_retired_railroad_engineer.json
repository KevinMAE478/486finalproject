Spent some time in Texas, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Minnesota in the first part of my career but now I'm settled back home in California.  I am a \"Qualified Engineer\" but currently work as a Conductor until my seniority allows me to hold an engineer position.  An Engineer drives the train and the Conductor is in charge of the safe operation of the train and any issues enroute.  It's a fun job although very monotonous at times but it was my dream job growing up so I can't complain.  The hardest thing s adapting to a life oncall 24/7, we have no schedule and no days off and are given a 90min call to report to work.  I work in heavy grade territory so we go pretty damn slow all night long, average 12 mph uphill and 25mph downhill, usually 12 hours shifts.\n\nAs for strange encounters, everyday is a new day.  On more than one occasion I have witnessed people out in the middle of nowhere digging man sized holes miles from civilization in the swamps of East Texas and in the Mojave desert.  One specific odd occurrence that comes to mind was a couple years ago we had a brake hose fail which applys all the brakes on the train and the train can't move until it's repaired.  Well I'm out in the middle of the desert, it's sometime in the night around midnight.  I find the issue and think to myself that if I could acquire a rope I could tie the hose up and move further down the line.  No sooner than I thought that I hear from behind me a voice, \"Hey bud, you need some rope.\"  I turn around and shine my lantern and find some guy standing there with a couple feet of yellow rope.  He handed me the rope and walked back into the desert AWAY from my train.  I assumed it was just a strange coincidence from someone that was riding my train but find it odd that he walked away from the train.\n\nOperating a train becomes like driving a car.  On your commute to work you know the speed limits of each street, where the school zones are and where the dips and bumps are.  As an engineer you are responsible for knowing the speed limit everywhere your route takes you and must know the capabilities of your train.  Your constantly planning ahead while maintaining what's behind you.  A train acts like a giant steel rope and you must always be aware of the slack of your train.  So you have to watch where and how much power or brake you give in spots depending on the terrain and train type.  There are a number of levers, buttons and gauges we use to move the train and are constantly alert to what's going on out the window in front of us while also peaking in the mirror behind to inspect the train of anything dragging or smoking.\n\nMy route is 182 miles from Bakersfield, CA to San Bernardino, CA or Los Angeles, CA.  Over 3 different mountain passes and across the Mojave desert.  While not the prettiest route, it definitely falls into routine.
