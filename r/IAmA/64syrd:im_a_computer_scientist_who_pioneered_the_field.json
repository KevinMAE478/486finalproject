My lab&amp;#39;s work focuses on the second kind, but really both need to be engaging and pleasant to interact with in order to help people.  So, in socially assistive robotics, technical obstacles include understanding the user&amp;#39;s intent, emotion, needs, history, and as much as possible in real time, so that the robot can respond in a personalized way in real time.  That involves facial recognition, emotion recognition, gesture recognition, speech recognition, intent recognition... and from the robot&amp;#39;s response side, that involves the robot being able to behave in an engaging way in order to support the user.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg4tw0z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969727.0, "created_utc": 1491940927.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4s3de", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "enrac", "parent_id": "t3_64syrd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for your work in this field!
