Automation is great, but it is extremely involved in trying to make sure the plane is doing exactly what it needs to, but when it comes down to everything, you need to know how to fly if those systems fail. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think requiring pilots to have 1500 hours to get their ATP is extreme as most pilots build time by flight instructing. Once you get over 500-750 hours, you aren&amp;#39;t benefiting yourself by flying the traffic pattern for another 750. I think the transition to airlines should be more streamlined which I think would help a ton with pilot&amp;#39;s debt from flight fees/college loans but we are ways away from ever having a system like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg4kpcg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959782.0, "created_utc": 1491930982.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4k2vg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "coryrenton", "parent_id": "t3_64ru5d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "with automation technology, how simple do you think a commercial airplane be made in terms of controls (or what is the shortest time someone could be made competent in flying a commercial plane, using modern technology)?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;with automation technology, how simple do you think a commercial airplane be made in terms of controls (or what is the shortest time someone could be made competent in flying a commercial plane, using modern technology)?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg4k2vg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959094.0, "created_utc": 1491930294.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru5d", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru5d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4l4z5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pilotthrowaway44", "parent_id": "t1_dg4kx7d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "On my first solo cross country a pop up thunderstorm swung down way further south than expected so I made a landing at a nearby airport to get away from it but the winds shifted as I was coming in and almost drove me into the runway.

Chartering a flight like that would be even more difficult and would cost an ungodly amount to make that happen. \n\nThe thing to keep in mind is people are bumped from flights all the time. Like [Business Insider said](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-often-airlines-involuntarily-bump-passengers-united-american-travel-flights-2017-4) over 434,000 people were voluntarily bumped from flights last year and over 40,000 were involuntarily. So what happened to the guy from the airline standpoint is (unfortunately) very normal. \n\nIt was a lot of series of events that caused what happened in the video to happen, but the guy refusing to get off the plane combined with over-zealous airport police caused it all. I am not blaming the guy at all. I want to make that clear. What happened to him is inexcusable, but it is important at the same time to note, when you are refusing to get off of a plane when law enforcement is saying to do so, it will only end in force (just it shouldn't be that amount). They don't mess around with those kind of things.
