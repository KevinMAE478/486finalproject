During the party her and friends are coming through the crowd going to the bar. As they were walking through the crowd I accidentally ended up very obviously in her way without noticing and she gave me the hand on the shoulder &amp;quot;excuse me&amp;quot;. The tone of her voice she said it with combined with the look on her face, she was very nice and polite about it, it wasn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;hey, get the fuck out of my way asshole&amp;quot; thing. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not an answer, just a side note about the worst part.\nSome friends and I were asked to do a second little clip out in the parking lot, just kind of hanging out while the stars are coming to or leaving the party. We were asked to smoke while chilling by the car. With the length of the time we were there, I ended up smoking almost 3 packs of cigarettes in about 4 hours. Never again.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dgd95d4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492443424.0, "created_utc": 1492414624.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
