But this was in the plane after boarding. Paying confirmed customers who had been allowed boarding were asked to deplane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the employees could not handle it properly by offering significant compensation. Instead of offering significant compensation in cash (as required by DoT) upto 200-400% of fare - they only offered shitty vouchers of $400 and then $800. If they had offered cash as compensation - they would definitely get volunteers. If not, they can go higher and higher till $1300 (max compensation as assured by the DoT).  If that didn&amp;#39;t work , they could find other means of transportation for their employees. Instead they decided to cheap out and go on a power Trip to deplane a paying confirmed passenger. Not deny boarding (which they are allowed to do) but deplane. When passenger refused, the police got involved. The police also got on a power Trip and slammed the guy&amp;#39;s face on to the armrest.\nLeading to the entire flight getting delayed for cleaning up the blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, the police are at fault for the violence. But United is majorly at fault here. They escalated the situation - tried to force a customer off for no reason but their own stupidity. When customer got belligerent at the bullshit - they got cops involved who fucked it up even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg4kosa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959765.0, "created_utc": 1491930965.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ih8e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Seraph_Grymm", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fxoj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Overbooking is pretty standard in the TOS/fare rules of many airlines, not just United.
