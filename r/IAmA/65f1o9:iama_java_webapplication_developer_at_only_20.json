I tried ALL summer to get an entry-level position somewhere in the agency because I knew that was how I could atleast have a chance in getting a career in programming somehow. Getting in finally as a bottom of the food chain processor two days before my birthday, allowed to me to gain access to the agency's employee intranet as well as the internal job listings.

I was determined to then get my foot in the door within the IT division. \n\nI think the absolute largest thing here is having a well done, well articulated, **stellar** cover letter for your resume. Always.. - ALWAYS use a cover letter. For someone who might lack experience, it's where you can really sell yourself and let your personality shine a bit for the hiring manager/architect/senior employee that might be reading it. You can outline your passion for the work, anything you've done and have experience with on your own time, your integrity as an employee, etc. I always thought mine was too long since it was 4 paragraphs long but I managed to fit on one page, so I'd don't be afraid to be wordy as long as your spitting important points out and keeping the reader interested. There's tons of resources online that tell you how to have great cover letters, what employers look for in certain positions, help with the interview process, etc. and you can best believe I spent ample time researching all that. The first interview I got was for an Associate .NET Developer position, I bombed it as soon as one of the senior developers asked me to walk him through a long chain of SQL... The second interview I had gotten was for the position I currently hold now, and I think what really helped me was of course my passionate cover letter but also becoming an expert on this simple 3 class application I had made my senior year of highschool basically outlining where my skill set was. The 2 architects were impressed, and a week later I got the call from the hiring manager.\n\nBeing young and inexperienced, I tried to beef up the coding classes I took in highschool as much as possible in my written resume. My situation might be unique in that aspect, as I know the majority of highschools still strongly lack in modernized IT-related extracurriculars. There's tons of courses online however that are cheap and will give you a certification at the end. Coding bootcamps as well I know look great on a resume. Even following a long video series from some tech YouTuber showing how to code some big application is definitely something you can talk about in your cover letter and resume! You just have to look and be driven/motivated if you want to make a change in your life.\n\nThis is super lengthy and I'm sorry about that but I'll end with you always **HAVE** to stay positive, have **BIG** aspirations, set goals for yourself and convince yourself to stick to them. Don't ever sell yourself short and never say you can't. These aren't 'beliefs' or some shit, this is how the universe works and how humans interface with it. The mind is an absolutely incredibly powerful magnet that nobody cares to pay any attention to.

For someone who might lack experience, it&amp;#39;s where you can really sell yourself and let your personality shine a bit for the hiring manager/architect/senior employee that might be reading it. You can outline your passion for the work, anything you&amp;#39;ve done and have experience with on your own time, your integrity as an employee, etc. I always thought mine was too long since it was 4 paragraphs long but I managed to fit on one page, so I&amp;#39;d don&amp;#39;t be afraid to be wordy as long as your spitting important points out and keeping the reader interested. There&amp;#39;s tons of resources online that tell you how to have great cover letters, what employers look for in certain positions, help with the interview process, etc. and you can best believe I spent ample time researching all that. The first interview I got was for an Associate .NET Developer position, I bombed it as soon as one of the senior developers asked me to walk him through a long chain of SQL... The second interview I had gotten was for the position I currently hold now, and I think what really helped me was of course my passionate cover letter but also becoming an expert on this simple 3 class application I had made my senior year of highschool basically outlining where my skill set was. The 2 architects were impressed, and a week later I got the call from the hiring manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being young and inexperienced, I tried to beef up the coding classes I took in highschool as much as possible in my written resume. My situation might be unique in that aspect, as I know the majority of highschools still strongly lack in modernized IT-related extracurriculars. There&amp;#39;s tons of courses online however that are cheap and will give you a certification at the end. Coding bootcamps as well I know look great on a resume. Even following a long video series from some tech YouTuber showing how to code some big application is definitely something you can talk about in your cover letter and resume! You just have to look and be driven/motivated if you want to make a change in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is super lengthy and I&amp;#39;m sorry about that but I&amp;#39;ll end with you always &lt;strong&gt;HAVE&lt;/strong&gt; to stay positive, have &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; aspirations, set goals for yourself and convince yourself to stick to them. Don&amp;#39;t ever sell yourself short and never say you can&amp;#39;t. These aren&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;beliefs&amp;#39; or some shit, this is how the universe works and how humans interface with it. The mind is an absolutely incredibly powerful magnet that nobody cares to pay any attention to. I promise you, thoughts/emotions/intentions are all very powerful in this reality the right ones with enough time will inevitably begin to manifest in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dgaxwbi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307721.0, "created_utc": 1492278921.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgawjz5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LePornHound", "parent_id": "t3_65f1o9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I guess my big question is, how did you get your foot in the door?  \n\nMost of the time, employers won't even read your resume without 6 years experience and 3 doctorate degrees, so how did you get your resume to human eyes?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess my big question is, how did you get your foot in the door?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, employers won&amp;#39;t even read your resume without 6 years experience and 3 doctorate degrees, so how did you get your resume to human eyes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dgawjz5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492305895.0, "created_utc": 1492277095.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1o9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f1o9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb4pkr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jleverman", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2nwt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Great question. At my highschool we used *Fundamentals of Java\u2122 AP\u00ae Computer Science Essentials / Edition 4* (ISBN: 0538744928) as our main course resource. I thought following the book did an alright job but I always felt as if my teacher at the time could have delivered it better. To learn a new chapter and concepts, we'd go through a couple PowerPoint slides outlining the chapter, go through some program examples as a class that's she'd walk us through, then be given 3 or so projects/assignments to complete in class only. Each chapter and the description I gave of how we accomplished it was across the span of about a week to a week and a half each. I quickly learned that if I didn't start tutoring myself at home I'd fall behind real fast since new concepts constantly build on top of older ones. It just felt rushed in my opinion. 39 minutes a class (1 hour every 9 school days as we had a rotating hour class schedule) every day just didn't seem like enough to fully grasp Java.\n\nI'd say my biggest challenge coming into a professional programming role from only have done C++ and Java *college-level* highschool classes, was being able to understand new code that was completely foreign to me and having to jump down the rabbit hole of different methods, managers, controllers, implementations, interceptors, etc. etc. All the different masks a Java class could wear using different enterprise code strategies was definitely a struggle as well just overall being exposed to what **real** java applications were like. I mean I'm talking thousands on thousands of lines of code with almost countless classes across so many java packages that all in random with a few back-end java services make up just one whole business process that could either be for consumer use or purely internal in itself. It was all pretty daunting to get used to coming from only having experience wiring up a handful of classes for a simple program! Learning Spring framework which is very common that we use on top of all our java was also a learning curve.\n\nI guess to answer your question, I think the whole curriculum is pretty well-rounded, I could go on to critique certain aspects of it but I feel as if I'd be biased from a web developer's point of view. I wanna say it lacks in preparing a student for the professional world in terms of what enterprise architecture is like what new and commonly used technologies that are being utilized across silicon valley *but* then again the curriculum is already throwing a lot at the average student to begin with. I will say the AP test I took at the end of my senior year was *COMPLETELY* out of line. I was totally and utterly shocked that as students who just finished a basic Java fundamentals class we were actually expected to *totally write out by hand* lines on lines of code as solutions to whatever scenario or question was being asked on that test. I thought I did atleast averagely alright and I didn't even score atleast one credit from it...\n\nI'm not sure I gave you the answer you were looking for but I'd be happy to answer a more specific question you might have in regards to AP Java, this is exciting to have an actual AP teacher come across my post!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great question.
