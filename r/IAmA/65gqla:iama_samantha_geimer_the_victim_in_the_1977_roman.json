I almost lost it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right; you can&amp;#39;t tell someone what&amp;#39;s wrong about their relationship while they&amp;#39;re in it. I just have to say that there&amp;#39;s something impossibly special about learning and experiencing life &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; someone, instead of having a partner who spoils all the endings and takes the magic out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s important is to make it clear that they can come to you,  tell you anything,  and you won&amp;#39;t judge them. Respect their wishes, which are often a condition of their confidence,  and trust that you can guide them toward the right conclusion, rather than forcing one on them.  I really wish is had an adult who did this for me,  but I was too afraid of getting him in trouble.  I wasn&amp;#39;t mature enough for a relationship like that,  and if I&amp;#39;d had someone with a little experience in my corner, I might have figured things out a lot quicker.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dgaisy0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492281109.0, "created_utc": 1492252309.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2061}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gqla", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8xb0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 147, "report_reasons": null, "author": "najing_ftw", "parent_id": "t1_dga8u1x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for your response.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dga8xb0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257242.0, "created_utc": 1492228442.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 147}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8u1x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2903, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tsnye", "parent_id": "t1_dga7o6i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": " I think it is probably unwise, but you have to take your own path.

There was to be no trial, just a plea deal broken by the Judge.\n\nI don't know who told you this, but it's a common talking point for Polanski defenders, and it's completely false.\n\nFirst of all, you have to understand that California has two types of plea deals: binding and non-binding. Binding plea deals are agreed to by the judge. Non-binding plea deals are agreed to by the prosecutor and the defense. The judge acknowledges the deal, but is not bound to it. Any California lawyer would have known this and made it clear to Polanski that he was agreeing to a non-binding plea deal that could be reversed by the judge later.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\n&gt; The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for two main types of plea agreements. An 11(c)(1)(B) agreement does not bind the court; the prosecutor's recommendation is merely advisory, and the defendant cannot withdraw his plea if the court decides to impose a sentence other than what was stipulated in the agreement. An 11(c)(1)(C) agreement does bind the court once the court accepts the agreement. When such an agreement is proposed, the court can reject it if it disagrees with the proposed sentence, in which case the defendant has an opportunity to withdraw his plea.\n\n\nHere is the relevant section.\n\n(1) In General.\n\nAn attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. If the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will:\n\n(A) not bring, or will move to dismiss, other charges;\n\n(B) recommend, or agree not to oppose the defendant's request, that a particular sentence or sentencing range is appropriate or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request does not bind the court); or\n\n(C) agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement).\n\n**Furthermore**\n\n&gt; (3) Judicial Consideration of a Plea Agreement.\n\n(A) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the court may accept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report.\n\n(B) **To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(B), the court must advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request.**\n\nIn other words, they are warned that they may not get the recommended sentencing. The court can choose a different punishment.\n\n(4) Accepting a Plea Agreement.\n\nIf the court accepts the plea agreement, it must inform the defendant that to the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the agreed disposition will be included in the judgment.\n\nNotice B is not mentioned.\n\nIn other words, it is entirely possible for the judge to accept a plea bargain without being bound to it, if the plea is merely that the prosecutor will recommend a particular sentencing. The sentencing is still the decision of the judge.\n\nYou might also want to actually read the [court documents](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/roman-polanski-plea-transcript). The only promise Polanski was made was that certain charges would be dropped. The judge specifically asks him if he understands that he could be sentenced to the full term, and Polanski says, \"Yes.\" He specifically asks him if he understands that he was not guaranteed a shorter sentence and Polanski says, \"Yes.\" In other words, he was made no promises, and the judge did his due diligence in making him aware of that.\n\nSpecifically from the transcript:\n\nThe Court: \"Yes. Before you do so, however, I must advise the defendant, under Section 1192.5 of the Penal Code, that the approval of the Court to the plea is not binding on the Court; that the Court may, at the time set for hearing on the application for probation or pronouncement of judgement, withdraw its approval, in light of further consideration of the matter; and three, in such case, the defendant shall be permitted to withdraw his plea, if he desires to do so.\"\n\nPolanski could have withdrawn his plea and went through the trial, but he skipped the country before that could happen. He is a fugitive from justice.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact that the Judge Rittenband lied to Roman and his attorney...y person in their right mind would have fled rather that trust a Judge engaged in such bizarre behavior and who had lied twice before.

Any California lawyer would have known this and made it clear to Polanski that he was agreeing to a non-binding plea deal that could be reversed by the judge later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for two main types of plea agreements. An 11(c)(1)(B) agreement does not bind the court; the prosecutor&amp;#39;s recommendation is merely advisory, and the defendant cannot withdraw his plea if the court decides to impose a sentence other than what was stipulated in the agreement. An 11(c)(1)(C) agreement does bind the court once the court accepts the agreement. When such an agreement is proposed, the court can reject it if it disagrees with the proposed sentence, in which case the defendant has an opportunity to withdraw his plea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the relevant section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) In General.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An attorney for the government and the defendant&amp;#39;s attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. If the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(A) not bring, or will move to dismiss, other charges;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(B) recommend, or agree not to oppose the defendant&amp;#39;s request, that a particular sentence or sentencing range is appropriate or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request does not bind the court); or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(C) agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furthermore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Judicial Consideration of a Plea Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(A) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the court may accept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(B) &lt;strong&gt;To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(B), the court must advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, they are warned that they may not get the recommended sentencing. The court can choose a different punishment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(4) Accepting a Plea Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the court accepts the plea agreement, it must inform the defendant that to the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the agreed disposition will be included in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice B is not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, it is entirely possible for the judge to accept a plea bargain without being bound to it, if the plea is merely that the prosecutor will recommend a particular sentencing. The sentencing is still the decision of the judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might also want to actually read the &lt;a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/roman-polanski-plea-transcript\"&gt;court documents&lt;/a&gt;. The only promise Polanski was made was that certain charges would be dropped. The judge specifically asks him if he understands that he could be sentenced to the full term, and Polanski says, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; He specifically asks him if he understands that he was not guaranteed a shorter sentence and Polanski says, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; In other words, he was made no promises, and the judge did his due diligence in making him aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically from the transcript:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Court: &amp;quot;Yes. Before you do so, however, I must advise the defendant, under Section 1192.5 of the Penal Code, that the approval of the Court to the plea is not binding on the Court; that the Court may, at the time set for hearing on the application for probation or pronouncement of judgement, withdraw its approval, in light of further consideration of the matter; and three, in such case, the defendant shall be permitted to withdraw his plea, if he desires to do so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Polanski could have withdrawn his plea and went through the trial, but he skipped the country before that could happen. He is a fugitive from justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dgao9m5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492293886.0, "created_utc": 1492265086.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 196}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga63kr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1432, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tsnye", "parent_id": "t1_dga5orw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know for a fact that the Judge Rittenband lied to Roman and his attorney, the judicial misconduct that occurred is beyond belief.

But that was in my mid/late 20s.

For all we know, she might have the greatest or worst judgement in the world. We have no idea who she is. If it had been someone else in that situation back in 1977 instead of her, they might be saying something completely different today, there's no right or wrong answer to dealing with trauma, just a spectrum of healthy and unhealthy behaviors. And that all depends on the individual. \n\nPersonally, after working with hundreds of victims and treating countless patients who have endured sexual assault, I am pretty uncomfortable with many of OP's statements and answers in this thread. I cringe when I read about the sexual culture of \"old\" Hollywood and cringe even harder when I still see it on display today- 30+-something actors/musicians/producers, etc. dating teenage models, stories of incredibly rich and powerful Americans (some of whom are involved in the entertainment industry- of course, without any names, and only *isolated* incidents) going overseas to rape a 9-year-old boy, whispers of rampant pedophilia and sexual assault and the public backlash that comes against anyone who tries to speak out against it- you should have seen my facebook feed when the Bill Cosby allegations started coming out, there's no wonder so many victims stay silent for decades (or never come forward). The industry will always protect itself, and we as fans will do whatever we need to in order to justify and rationalize behavior, until we can't anymore. Trust me, even with all the support that it seems like they would have, if Feldman or Wood ever actually named names, they'd be ripped apart. And unfortunately, not only does that make it possible for these crimes to continue, but I think it also maintains a security net for the offenders- there are truly individuals who are too powerful and rich to fail. Even if they did, you'd have people crying out, \"But he did his time!\" and ignoring the fact that even if someone did whatever stint in jail they were meant to, maybe a grown adult who has sex with children shouldn't be supported or revered by society.

I cringe when I read about the sexual culture of &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; Hollywood and cringe even harder when I still see it on display today- 30+-something actors/musicians/producers, etc. dating teenage models, stories of incredibly rich and powerful Americans (some of whom are involved in the entertainment industry- of course, without any names, and only &lt;em&gt;isolated&lt;/em&gt; incidents) going overseas to rape a 9-year-old boy, whispers of rampant pedophilia and sexual assault and the public backlash that comes against anyone who tries to speak out against it- you should have seen my facebook feed when the Bill Cosby allegations started coming out, there&amp;#39;s no wonder so many victims stay silent for decades (or never come forward). The industry will always protect itself, and we as fans will do whatever we need to in order to justify and rationalize behavior, until we can&amp;#39;t anymore. Trust me, even with all the support that it seems like they would have, if Feldman or Wood ever actually named names, they&amp;#39;d be ripped apart. And unfortunately, not only does that make it possible for these crimes to continue, but I think it also maintains a security net for the offenders- there are truly individuals who are too powerful and rich to fail. Even if they did, you&amp;#39;d have people crying out, &amp;quot;But he did his time!&amp;quot; and ignoring the fact that even if someone did whatever stint in jail they were meant to, maybe a grown adult who has sex with children shouldn&amp;#39;t be supported or revered by society. There are bigger issues here than legal justice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dgb84ha", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321648.0, "created_utc": 1492292848.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gqla", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb87fw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ssutuanjoe", "parent_id": "t1_dgb0n15", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; but this is just the strangest mindfuck to me.\n\nAgreed.
