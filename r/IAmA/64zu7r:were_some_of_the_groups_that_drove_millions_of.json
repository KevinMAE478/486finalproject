The conversation about political mobilization and organization are all taking place online - whether it&amp;#39;s over Twitter or more niche platforms. In a world without net neutrality, an ISP that favored one candidate over another, or didn&amp;#39;t like what a particular organization was doing, could block those sites, or make them buffer slowly so they were less effective. Net neutrality is about making sure the ISPs we rely on to get to those platforms can&amp;#39;t abuse their power at their whim - it ensures the internet continues to serve those essential purposes as the critical communications system of our time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg6bs8t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051166.0, "created_utc": 1492022366.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zu7r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zu7r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wbba", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anonttt", "parent_id": "t1_dg6bx58", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Would it be possible to bypass their censor crap with a vpn?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to bypass their censor crap with a vpn?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IAmA", "name": "t1_dg6wbba", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074670.0, "created_utc": 1492045870.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6bx58", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KyleTheBoss95", "parent_id": "t1_dg6b735", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IAmA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not OP, but while that is part of it, Net Neutrality forces your ISP to grant you access to all websites unconditionally.
