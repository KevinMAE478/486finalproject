I feel like the focus on the social aspect is more a symptom of problems we have with sensory integration and the complex neuronal processing associated with social reward (namely endocannabinoid-mediated oxytocin release). Do you think research funding is guided by the neurotypical (NT) population&amp;#39;s desire for people with ASD to assimilate because assimilation has the outward appearance of happiness/functionality? Also, how do you feel about selection criteria for the ASD population - should we be more general or should we take intersectionality into account? How has this changed over the years? Lastly, what is your opinion of ABA therapy?

I have read that this experience is somewhat common among females with high functioning autism. My question is about why the spectrum is so wide. My issues are definitely significant and impairing but they do not really even come close to what someone on the more \"severe\" side struggles with. I asked my psychologist why the spectrum is so wide but she couldn't really give me an answer.  \n  \nMaybe it is just me but in this autism awareness month I have seen the conflicting sides of the spectrum almost \"fighting\" to talk over the other to tell the media that their autism type exists. I know the saying \"when you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism\" but is a diagnostic label actually effective when it doesn't give much insight into the condition?  Is their any scientific evidence that all the different cases we identify as ASD are biologically/genetically related in any way or otherwise? Are we dealing with comorbid conditions? Sorry if this seems questioning but these are things I genuinely struggle with myself and I do not mean to antagonize anyone. I do apologize if it comes off that way.    \n   \nWhat exactly is autism? I know the DSM5 definition, but is it only characterized by broadly defined communication impairment and repetitive behavior? There is a big difference in my mind between the inability to speak and the inability to modulate tone of voice.

It is not that I dislike being grouped with them, but I simply wonder if it benefits any of us to be under the same umbrella.  \n  \nThis leads me to my next question. On the internet there is a prevalent phenomenon of self diagnosis. I have a hard time with this and admit it probably has something to do with my black and white thinking. Is self diagnosis valid? How accurate is it? I truly feel for the people who cannot access help, but I wonder if they really do have ASD. If someone has gotten through their entire life, had a family, a relatively stable career, etc. without any professional help or support but has struggled socially, is it possible they're autistic? It is my understanding that even the mildest cases can only function relatively well with supports in place.  \n  \nAlso what is your opinion on outgrowing autism? In the autism advocacy community, the overwhelming opinion is that autism is a permanent neurological difference that never changes but can only be learned to cope with. However I have read about brain plasticity and I wonder if it is possible to become functional enough to lose the diagnosis. However I think here the problem for some would be in a limbo of identity. Many seem to place autism highly with regard to their identity so if they no longer qualified for an ASD could they still call themselves autistic?  \n  \nWhat are your thoughts on the neurodivergence movement? I have a hard time with the concept of a neurotypical. I get that it is defined as someone without autism, but I can't really imagine that it's a useful classifier since the human race is so varied that it seems impossible that there is a typical way of being. I don't necessarily dislike the views of the neurodiversity movement but I do dislike how militant they are in spreading their views. It is like they are trying to dominate a discussion and take away the voices of those of us who already have enough trouble with communication to begin with. If an autistic person supports research to a possible \"cure\" they scream internalized ableism to invalidate their views. This divide is painful and makes the autism community so fractured I again wonder if we struggle with the same condition. Some people attribute gifts to their autism but if those gifts aren't a diagnostic characteristic of ASD can they really be attributed to autism? Isn't it possible that an autistic person is also gifted with unrelated talent?  \n  \nWow I am now rambling. Sorry!!!
