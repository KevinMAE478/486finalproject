Being called out on it has made me want to become much more aware and sensitive because I don&amp;#39;t want to be that person, but it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me that a gay man could do this at all because LGB people can for sure have the same blind spots about trans folks as heterosexual people have about the LGBT community in particular&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like this guy was more malicious but I understand that he was in an environment where the producers are trying to cause drama and pit people against each other, and tbh I think all reality shows are emotionally toxic and aim to bring out the worst in people. But again even though he like me is part of an LGBT community we still have blind spots and this probably led him to underestimate the potential damage that could be dealt and the hurt that could be caused.
