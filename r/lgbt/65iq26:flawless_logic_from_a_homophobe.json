Worldwide *HIV Transmission* occurs to a massively greater degree among Heterosexual populations. In shear numbers, Hetro HIV overwhelms Gay HIV. I guess we can only concluded that Hetero Sex is bad (see #6).\n\n2.) *Anal Sex* - by some studies, about 1/3rd of Gay men have NO interest in anal sex. Others are exclusively Tops, while that does not make one immune, the risk is lower.  Others only have the leanest thinnest interest in it. Contrary the the porn the Original Poster has been watching, not all Gay men have anal sex, I think it is safe to say, virtually NO Gay Women have anal sex. \n\n3.) *Evolution* - If being gay were an evolutionary negative, then why has it lasted for thousands of years? The first written down documented case of gay men is in text written about 1000BC. Very very likely it, being gay,  existed well before that. Moses, yes that Moses, is estimated to have live in 1400BC to 1500BC, the Bible mentions Gay people in the Laws of Moses. That documents it back some 3500 years. And most certainly it existed long before someone thought to write it down. \n\nNext, in Biblical times, neither the concept nor the term Homosexual or Gay existed.

Likely it was not Gay people who brought down Sodom-Gommorrah, it was *Straight people behaving badly*. Remember this was the Bronze Age, these people were one tiny step above barbarians. \n\n4.) *Genetic* - It depends on what you mean by Genetic. It is not Inherited, not genetic in that sense, it is not like Blue Eyes, but there could be some genetic component to it. But far more likely it has to due with Hormones during pregnancy. *All people start out as Female*, at the point of *\"Differentiation\"* a surge of hormones push the fetus in one direction of another. If that surge is on the low side, that can push the fetal development into the middle ground. This happens by pure random chance and has been happening by pure random change for many thousands of years. The Taxonomic Classification of \"Homo Sapiens\" dates back about 60,000 to 100,000 years. Likely Gay people go back at least that far if not farther. Perhaps back as much as 200,000 years or more. Likely there were Gay Neanderthals and Gay Homo Erectus as well. \n\nMother Nature has had plenty of time to weed out Gay people, but here we are. If Natural Selection is to be believed, then Gay people have been selected. \n\nOh, and let's not forget, that this is not behavior limited exclusively to humans.

AND many many many many people smoke and drink without health problems because they do so cautiously and in moderation. And many many simply choose not to smoke or drink at all. Even if we were to place being Gay in this category, there would be many many many many Gay people who engage in intimate relationships in a reasonable, moderate, and cautions way, and who would and do live long and healthy lives. There are gay people in their 70's, 80's, and 90's. \n\nAlso agree that generalizing that is bad and this is bad, so they must be bad is pretty thin logic. Everything is bad in the wrong context.

Perhaps over time they will see how horribly Anti-Christian their views are, but don't hold your breath waiting because it can take a long time. \n\nWe hear a lot of flack from the Southern Baptists about being against Gay Rights, but, oddly, the Northern Baptists affirmed Gay Rights ages ago, and more and more Christian groups are following the true path of Christ, and opening that hearts, their minds, and their Churches to gay people.
