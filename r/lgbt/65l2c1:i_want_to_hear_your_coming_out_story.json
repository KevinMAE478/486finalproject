I no longer live under a cloud of shame and fear, and I&amp;#39;ve been in a relationship with a man I love dearly coming up on 9 months.  We live together now, and we talk seriously about marriage and our future family.  I really couldn&amp;#39;t be happier, but reading through the stories posted here and on &lt;a href=\"/r/LGBT\"&gt;/r/LGBT&lt;/a&gt;, I definitely know I&amp;#39;ve been one of the lucky ones.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, here&amp;#39;s my coming out letter: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YTImAQm-FqNBYOq1ZHMdVz8pqTi3lIcW78Qx-Kz-xY0/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YTImAQm-FqNBYOq1ZHMdVz8pqTi3lIcW78Qx-Kz-xY0/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a collage I made of all the supportive comments I received (in case I needed a boost...):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/RVWBVVe.jpg\"&gt;Imgur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lgbt", "name": "t1_dgd0iah", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426868.0, "created_utc": 1492398068.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l2c1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdae8h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JuanFitz", "parent_id": "t3_65l2c1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lgbt", "controversiality": 0, "body": "These stories helped me before coming out so paying it forward.    Came out in my late 20s cerca de 2013.\n\n\nI have to come out to everyone (for coming out so late and coming across as straight to all) so too many to count and I refused to use social media, only in person unless they heard and asked me.  \n\nFirst person I told was to a gay friend (friend and work colleague) while we were at a bar after he disclosed something very personal about himself.  At the time he thought I was straight and I felt it was my turn to tell him something about myself that was very personal.   Came out of nowhere, we became better friends possibly due to that night (has always been platonic for those with wandering minds :) ). \n\n Hardest one was with my older brother who is my best friend, was the second person and first family member I told.  We drank and fought  (think ju jitsu) for years, slightly meatheadish at times (I was a decent wingman at bars over the years but played up the being overweight to hide), since he was older, I always looked up to him and he was by far the hardest to tell.  After a long night of drinking together,  I was drunk and emotional, said \"sorry man but this is how it is\" through what at the time were tears of embarrassment.  He said who gives a fuck you are still my brother and we did the man shake half hug thing.   He proceeded to get in trouble with the girlfriend to be wife that night for staying up too late to continue drinking with me.  \n\nWas sober when I told the parents though.  Mom proceeds to call me after I had left and  ball on the phone with me feeling bad that she should have known.  I explained I hid it well from everyone my best friends and siblings had no idea. (Told all siblings first so that parents had an outlet if needed) Dad nonchalantly stated to mom after the fact, well wasn't expecting that, and continued on to watch Football.    \n\nTo my knowledge all my family and friends took it very well.
