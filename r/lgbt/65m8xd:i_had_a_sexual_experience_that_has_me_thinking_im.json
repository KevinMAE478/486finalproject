I&amp;#39;m a 19 year old girl, I&amp;#39;ve never really given a lot of thought to relationships or sexuality. I&amp;#39;ve always been indifferent towards having a boyfriend. I think certain male celebrities are attractive but I&amp;#39;ve never really thought of them in a sexual manner, more of just a &amp;quot;His eyes are cute&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;he has a nice face&amp;quot; kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I met a person at my friend&amp;#39;s birthday party. She&amp;#39;s 26. Long story short: We started talking at the party, and we just connected on a level I&amp;#39;ve never felt before. By the end of the night, I felt like she was my best friend.\nFast forward a week later, I&amp;#39;m hanging out at her apartment, it&amp;#39;s like 3 am and we&amp;#39;re both tired. We went to her bed to lay down. We talked in the dark for about an hour and suddenly she said something like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been dying to kiss you all night, can I?&amp;quot; I was instantly hit with a lot of &amp;quot;butterfly&amp;quot; feelings in my stomach, but without thinking, I said yes and we started kissing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another long story short: We had sex. And it was probably the best experience of my life. I was really nervous throughout all of it since I was so inexperienced, she was obviously more experienced than me. But despite my nerves, it was the deepest connection I&amp;#39;ve ever felt with another person at both an emotional and physical level.\nThis happened about 3 days ago and she&amp;#39;s been busy so we haven&amp;#39;t had the chance to talk much about it but we&amp;#39;re seeing each other tomorrow. I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this all moved so fast.
