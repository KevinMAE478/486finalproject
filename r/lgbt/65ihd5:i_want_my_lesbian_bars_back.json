It is a term to describe the type of misogyny aimed exclusively at black women. I feel that lesbians are targeted with a level of vitriol and hatred other groups aren't, even though those groups have committed the same offenses or worse. There are tons of articles about how poorly lesbians treat bisexuals and transgender women. We are dissected and put under a microscope. There was an article in the New York Times, the New Yorker, and The Guardian. I've seen articles excoriating lesbians while praising straight men about their treatment of transgender women on the Daily Beast. Slate, Vox, and Medium have all dedicate digital ink to how horrible we are. But, there's never a peep about anyone else. There is a special contempt reserved for lesbians.\n\nI personally object to the notion of being in the \"queer community\" because it connects me politically and in a group with people for whom I have empathy but no shared political issues in common outside of being \"queer\" and I don't see how I am connected to them politically. We have straight people saying that not being able to post their leather fetish on Facebook makes them queer or straight people who are into S&amp;M calling themselves queer. \n\nI'd like to note there are advocacy groups who've specifically asked that intersex people not be included in that acronym because it completely undermines the very valid issues they have with the medical community, the type of government support they should have, the lack of protections or clear guidelines for surgery on intersex people. These advocacy groups have said that their members and even their group would be glad to be allies to transgender people but that they reject being co-opted. I cannot feel comfortable being part of a community that cynically co-opts another group's identity without permission. Their point is that they don't think anything is wrong with them but had surgery inflicted upon them nonetheless. I see where they are coming from. \n\nI think the LGBT community is, and has always been, false. Either way, in its current form, it is obsolete. It says a lot that the lesbian bookstores, cafes, bars, and weekly parties are gone. Someone tried to open an upscale lesbian club in Soho and it failed. I'm not gonna say why, but many of our major groups at pride have been pushed out or taken over.

It is a term to describe the type of misogyny aimed exclusively at black women. I feel that lesbians are targeted with a level of vitriol and hatred other groups aren&amp;#39;t, even though those groups have committed the same offenses or worse. There are tons of articles about how poorly lesbians treat bisexuals and transgender women. We are dissected and put under a microscope. There was an article in the New York Times, the New Yorker, and The Guardian. I&amp;#39;ve seen articles excoriating lesbians while praising straight men about their treatment of transgender women on the Daily Beast. Slate, Vox, and Medium have all dedicate digital ink to how horrible we are. But, there&amp;#39;s never a peep about anyone else. There is a special contempt reserved for lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally object to the notion of being in the &amp;quot;queer community&amp;quot; because it connects me politically and in a group with people for whom I have empathy but no shared political issues in common outside of being &amp;quot;queer&amp;quot; and I don&amp;#39;t see how I am connected to them politically. We have straight people saying that not being able to post their leather fetish on Facebook makes them queer or straight people who are into S&amp;amp;M calling themselves queer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to note there are advocacy groups who&amp;#39;ve specifically asked that intersex people not be included in that acronym because it completely undermines the very valid issues they have with the medical community, the type of government support they should have, the lack of protections or clear guidelines for surgery on intersex people. These advocacy groups have said that their members and even their group would be glad to be allies to transgender people but that they reject being co-opted. I cannot feel comfortable being part of a community that cynically co-opts another group&amp;#39;s identity without permission. Their point is that they don&amp;#39;t think anything is wrong with them but had surgery inflicted upon them nonetheless. I see where they are coming from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the LGBT community is, and has always been, false. Either way, in its current form, it is obsolete.
