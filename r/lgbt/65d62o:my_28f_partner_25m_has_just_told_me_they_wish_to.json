I'm thrilled for both of you. I'm not saying it will be easy, but it will be easier for you than many because you have each other. I know from experience that this can lead to a stronger, healthier relationship for both of you.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself as well as your partner. Your questions, doubts, fears, hopes, assumptions etc. need to be addressed just as much as theirs do. It's a part of basic relationship maintenance. Your anxieties are a part of what's happening in your relationship, and you (plural) can only deal with them if they are voiced. There's a lot changing in your relationship right now, and that's bound to stir up fears. You can't know which are valid until you talk about them. Keeping them inside your head often makes them look bigger/harder to deal with than they are.\n\nEarly transition is a bunch of hurry up and wait, particularly for the medical bits. The heavy lifting is mostly in the social side: figuring out how to be in the world individually and together as the change occurs. It helps to pitch awkward social situations and figure out how you'd deal. Most of what you and your partner end up talking about will be worse than anything that will actually happen (it was for my husband and I,) but it helps to know you are both on the same page for how to cope with that stuff. There may be anxiety and frustration to deal with as you wait for appointments to come around, so having coping strategies to distract each other would be good.\n\nI also highly recommend seeing a counselor with experience in gender issues. If you can't find one nearby, many will work over Skype these days, so you can look further afield if you need to. Try to keep it in-state, though, because if you need to ask about legal stuff or medical stuff they are more likely to know what's available/required in the state where they live and work. If money is tight, LGBTQA+ helplines often have counselors that work on sliding scales. \n\n/r/asktransgender is an awesome resource and support network, as is /r/mypartneristrans . There are subs for other gender identities if your partner turns out to be non-binary, all awesomely supportive. \n\nFinally, remember that transition is a menu, not a process. Your partner will be looking for things that address specific dysphoria triggers. They may not need the full suite of everything that's available. There's a tendency for medical folks to treat transition like a machine, feed body in one end and things a,b,c...x,y,z happen in order until body comes out other end other sex. Don't let your partner be bullied into taking measures they feel meh about. Doubts are fine, we all get those, but if there isn't excitement as well they aren't ready. There's no time limit, the only arbiter of what 'done' looks like is your partner.\n\nYou are awesome, and I wish you both the very best.

The heavy lifting is mostly in the social side: figuring out how to be in the world individually and together as the change occurs. It helps to pitch awkward social situations and figure out how you&amp;#39;d deal. Most of what you and your partner end up talking about will be worse than anything that will actually happen (it was for my husband and I,) but it helps to know you are both on the same page for how to cope with that stuff. There may be anxiety and frustration to deal with as you wait for appointments to come around, so having coping strategies to distract each other would be good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also highly recommend seeing a counselor with experience in gender issues. If you can&amp;#39;t find one nearby, many will work over Skype these days, so you can look further afield if you need to. Try to keep it in-state, though, because if you need to ask about legal stuff or medical stuff they are more likely to know what&amp;#39;s available/required in the state where they live and work. If money is tight, LGBTQA+ helplines often have counselors that work on sliding scales. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/asktransgender\"&gt;/r/asktransgender&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome resource and support network, as is &lt;a href=\"/r/mypartneristrans\"&gt;/r/mypartneristrans&lt;/a&gt; . There are subs for other gender identities if your partner turns out to be non-binary, all awesomely supportive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that transition is a menu, not a process. Your partner will be looking for things that address specific dysphoria triggers. They may not need the full suite of everything that&amp;#39;s available. There&amp;#39;s a tendency for medical folks to treat transition like a machine, feed body in one end and things a,b,c...x,y,z happen in order until body comes out other end other sex. Don&amp;#39;t let your partner be bullied into taking measures they feel meh about. Doubts are fine, we all get those, but if there isn&amp;#39;t excitement as well they aren&amp;#39;t ready. There&amp;#39;s no time limit, the only arbiter of what &amp;#39;done&amp;#39; looks like is your partner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are awesome, and I wish you both the very best. Be honest with each other and be kind, you are both worth cherishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lgbt", "name": "t1_dg9y7gw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492242058.0, "created_utc": 1492213258.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d62o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d62o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbbxwr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zerujin", "parent_id": "t1_dgaeyg3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lgbt", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Best of luck to you both.
