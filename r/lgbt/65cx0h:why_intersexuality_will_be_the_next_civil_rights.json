That is why trans people suffer a lot due to ignorance, because we&amp;#39;re viewed as &amp;quot;x wanting to be x&amp;quot; (often misconstrued to be sexually driven) and absolutely no more thought or education is put into correcting that erroneous way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of intersex people, they see it as &amp;quot;oh, it&amp;#39;s a birth defect, huh&amp;quot; before moving on with their lives. They don&amp;#39;t see intersex people as breaching their perceived social gender or sexuality roles due to the way they were born, so even the tiny minority that even know they exist don&amp;#39;t have any qualms about them because in most cases, intersex people live otherwise completely normal lives. (Correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, again, I would say that intersex conditions are not at all taboo, mostly due to the fact that an extremely vast percentage of the general population have no idea they occur.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lgbt", "name": "t1_dgaoh14", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294233.0, "created_utc": 1492265433.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tqel", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mynameisnotbecky1", "parent_id": "t1_dg9la66", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lgbt", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But being intersex is still a taboo in society, unlike homosexuality and to a certain extent, transgenderism.
