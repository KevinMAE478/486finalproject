We used to do quarterly 72-hour fasts, but decided the regular weekly 48s were better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ETA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just noticed the poster below me and their comment about eating disorders, particularly anorexia.  Lolol, well....I guess I&amp;#39;ll toss my 2-cent TMI in here then.  I&amp;#39;ve dealt with anorexia since I was 15.  I&amp;#39;ve had multiple relapses over the years and the ONLY thing that has seemed to actually work for me and keep me in check has been the combination of keto and IF.  It gives me the control//routine/familiarity that I need in order to not go off the rails.  Keto gives me license to eat things that I actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; and which &lt;em&gt;taste good.&lt;/em&gt;  IF gives me license to be a little bit &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; (for example, on weekends, I&amp;#39;ll loosen up a bit and do lazy keto, plus probably drink a bunch of wine and ultimately go way over the number of calories I would like to....but knowing that as of Sunday night I&amp;#39;m fasting for 48 hours lets me give myself some slack and not go into an obsessive restricting tailspin).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might seem counterintuitive but hey, I guess we&amp;#39;re all different.  For me, this has probably saved my life....or at least made it much more manageable.  Haven&amp;#39;t had a relapse in over 3 years now.  That&amp;#39;s huge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "keto", "name": "t1_dg6a5y6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049514.0, "created_utc": 1492020714.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rske", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xw84", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rske", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xw84", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg66cuj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sneakpeekbot", "parent_id": "t1_dg66cik", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/keto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Here's a sneak peek of [/r/fasting](https://np.reddit.com/r/fasting) using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/fasting/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year!**\n\n\\#1: [Just completed a 77 day fast.
