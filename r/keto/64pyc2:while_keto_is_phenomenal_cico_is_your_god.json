He is a body builder and was already keto adapted for about a year prior, so he's not starting from a keto-flu. There was no way he was actually burning that much energy, as the only alteration to his routine was less working out due to the vlogging demands and was maintaining a sub-2000 calorie diet prior.\n\nSample size of 1, obviously, but it's a profoundly interesting data point on this whole discussion.\n\nIF his results are repeatable for a significant sample size, it might mean that, while strict CICO resulting in calorie deficit will always cause weight loss, on keto, you may find that a calorie excess isn't necessarily going to lead to weight gain.\n\nIt's entirely possible his experience is unique. Perhaps his basal metabolism is massively responsive to caloric intake? Maybe he experienced more energy throughout the day, letting him burn off some excess calories? I'm not even ruling out shenanigans, despite him seeming like a pretty trustworthy guy overall.\n\nI find it fascinating, if not conclusive.

Strict CICO reminds me of that old joke about the lost balloonist that everyone in the English-speaking world likes to pin on their political adversaries: \"You're in a balloon, 50 feet up in the air...\"  Gee thanks.  Technically correct but not very helpful.\n\nEnergy balance is part of the story.  It might even be the main driving force.  CICO as presented by official nutrition authorities inevitably leads to bad advice though.  Specifically, advice to go ultra-low-fat.  That's what royally screws up Dr. Fuhrman's ANDI scoring system.  He gets that micronutrients are important, but fails to realize that dietary fat helps people absorb some of those micros and boosts satiety to prevent overeating.  The trained professionals sneer at every new plan and proclaim \"it's all about calories!\"  Thus giving the appearance of dismissing whatever practical knowledge could have been gained.\n\nCICO among laypeople also leads to inappropriate moralizing.  I've seen it here repeatedly just in the past few minutes.  Reducing calories didn't work for you, therefore YOU messed it up.  YOU cheated on the diet.  YOU are fat because YOU are too lazy and have no willpower.  Oh really?  I've honestly cut calories below TDEE using a non-fasting non-keto plan.  After a miserable month I hadn't lost even half a pound, even with a reasonable increase in exercise, and it crashed my testosterone.  I have blood test results to prove it.  My wife also has been unable to lose weight by simply reducing calories.  I can assure you that she only lacks willpower after the damn diet hasn't worked at all for the past freaking month.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, cutting calories by fasting actually works.  (At least for me.  For many people there are psychological barriers to skipping meals.)  I lost 15 lb last month while experimenting with several short-term water/coffee fasting schedules.  Didn't feel miserable at all.  Rate of fat loss neatly matched CICO predictions.  Cutting calories by ditching carbs also works.  But trying to lose body fat simply by focusing on calories doesn't work.  How very interesting!  Clearly not the end of the story scientifically.\n\nThen there's that study that allegedly debunked the insulin hypothesis...  Not quite.  It supposedly disproved (there's debate about that) one aspect of the insulin hypothesis.  It didn't radically change our understanding of how insulin functions, or shed much light on how free-living humans will behave.\n\nOn the other hand, I *have* read many claims over the past 15 years that it's literally impossible to store fat while in ketosis.  The body revs up metabolism or does some other sorcery to make those fat and protein calories magically go away.  I've also heard precisely the same claims made by fruitarians.  No joke!  The banana overdose gurus have said something to the effect of: eat unlimited fruit, automatically burn off the sugar, if you gain weight you must be cheating somehow.  From either perspective it's probably wrong.  That study cited might actually be somewhat relevant to such claims.\n\nI agree with you that it's reckless to say people can eat infinite calories.  The question is, will they naturally overeat while keto?  And that's where I think we can agree.  Drop the carbs, stop snacking, eat real food when actually hungry, and watch the appetite and energy balance change themselves.  CICO is in there somewhere, but it's not up front and center.", "edited": 1491927703.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the &amp;quot;just score more points&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;water is wet&amp;quot; comments.  Strict CICO reminds me of that old joke about the lost balloonist that everyone in the English-speaking world likes to pin on their political adversaries: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re in a balloon, 50 feet up in the air...&amp;quot;  Gee thanks.  Technically correct but not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energy balance is part of the story.  It might even be the main driving force.  CICO as presented by official nutrition authorities inevitably leads to bad advice though.  Specifically, advice to go ultra-low-fat.  That&amp;#39;s what royally screws up Dr. Fuhrman&amp;#39;s ANDI scoring system.  He gets that micronutrients are important, but fails to realize that dietary fat helps people absorb some of those micros and boosts satiety to prevent overeating.  The trained professionals sneer at every new plan and proclaim &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all about calories!&amp;quot;  Thus giving the appearance of dismissing whatever practical knowledge could have been gained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CICO among laypeople also leads to inappropriate moralizing.  I&amp;#39;ve seen it here repeatedly just in the past few minutes.  Reducing calories didn&amp;#39;t work for you, therefore YOU messed it up.  YOU cheated on the diet.  YOU are fat because YOU are too lazy and have no willpower.  Oh really?  I&amp;#39;ve honestly cut calories below TDEE using a non-fasting non-keto plan.  After a miserable month I hadn&amp;#39;t lost even half a pound, even with a reasonable increase in exercise, and it crashed my testosterone.  I have blood test results to prove it.  My wife also has been unable to lose weight by simply reducing calories.  I can assure you that she only lacks willpower after the damn diet hasn&amp;#39;t worked at all for the past freaking month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, cutting calories by fasting actually works.  (At least for me.  For many people there are psychological barriers to skipping meals.)  I lost 15 lb last month while experimenting with several short-term water/coffee fasting schedules.  Didn&amp;#39;t feel miserable at all.  Rate of fat loss neatly matched CICO predictions.  Cutting calories by ditching carbs also works.  But trying to lose body fat simply by focusing on calories doesn&amp;#39;t work.  How very interesting!  Clearly not the end of the story scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s that study that allegedly debunked the insulin hypothesis...  Not quite.  It supposedly disproved (there&amp;#39;s debate about that) one aspect of the insulin hypothesis.  It didn&amp;#39;t radically change our understanding of how insulin functions, or shed much light on how free-living humans will behave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; read many claims over the past 15 years that it&amp;#39;s literally impossible to store fat while in ketosis.  The body revs up metabolism or does some other sorcery to make those fat and protein calories magically go away.  I&amp;#39;ve also heard precisely the same claims made by fruitarians.  No joke!  The banana overdose gurus have said something to the effect of: eat unlimited fruit, automatically burn off the sugar, if you gain weight you must be cheating somehow.  From either perspective it&amp;#39;s probably wrong.  That study cited might actually be somewhat relevant to such claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree with you that it&amp;#39;s reckless to say people can eat infinite calories.  The question is, will they naturally overeat while keto?  And that&amp;#39;s where I think we can agree.  Drop the carbs, stop snacking, eat real food when actually hungry, and watch the appetite and energy balance change themselves.
