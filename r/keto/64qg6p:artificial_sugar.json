I felt great, no cravings after the first couple days, and I had little trouble sticking to my defecit. As the weeks went on I started trying things like mug cakes, halo top with sugar free chocolate syrup, adding sugar free syrup to my coffee. I started feeling hungrier and was consistently going over my calories. I was having energy crashes in the afternoon and craving chocolate. I didnt cheat, but was starting to notice myself having old binge tendencies, like standing at the freezer door while I shoved halo top into my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to stop counting calories with the promise to myself to stop it with the artificial sugar and keto desserts. I told myself that if I was having cravings, I could eat whatever I wanted of whole keto foods (bacon, cheddar, etc).
