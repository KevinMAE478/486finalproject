Yes, I have a basic understanding of the law of thermodynamics and how it relates to this issue, but I believe that there are several other factors that play a big part in losing or gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, I don&amp;#39;t believe that a calorie consumed and a calorie absorbed are the same thing. We know of at least one type of molecule that is technically food and contains calories, but when eaten produces much less energy than would be expected as the human body is not capable (at least not fully) of digesting the molecule and absorbing it&amp;#39;s calories: fiber. Fiber is a carbohydrate, meaning that it is essentially made up of sugar molecules, which are is the most basic form of energy that our body can use, but due to the structure of fiber molecules, our body is incapable of absorbing more than a fraction of the available energy that the molecule holds. The amount of calories extracted from a gram of fiber may also vary from person to person. Most people know that there are soluble and insoluble fibers, but there are actually a lot of sub types of fiber as well. The amount of energy that is extracted from a gram of fiber is highly dependent upon the type of fiber and the types of bacteria contained in the gut. Because everyone&amp;#39;s gut biome is a little different, the amount of energy absorbed vs consumed can be quite variable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fiber isn&amp;#39;t the only type of molecule that is absorbed differently by different people either. Those with lactose intolerance have trouble digesting lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. I would argue that lactose intolerance is not a disorder, as most mammals lose the ability to digest lactose after they stop nursing and subsequently stop producing an enzyme called lactase which allows for lactose digestion. Adult lactase production is actually a mutation in humans and is more common within certain ethnicities. In short if two people with different ethnic backgrounds consume an equal amount of milk, the amount of calories actually absorbed by their bodies might be very different between the two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The calories in vs calories out philosophy oversimplifies a complex issue, but I know the response of CICO proponents, that &amp;quot;calories in&amp;quot; means calories absorbed, not just consumed, and to this I would argue that there are not many people out there that just want to weigh less. Most normal people on a diet have goals such as looking better or just being healthier. The phrase &amp;quot;losing weight&amp;quot; has become somewhat synonymous with looking better or getting healthy, but &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t the real issue, body fat is.\nBody fat is what makes us fat, or what most people think of as &amp;quot;overweight,&amp;quot; and unhealthy. If your goal is simply to lose weight, then you might not mind losing a few pounds of muscle and the CICO method may work for you. But, if your goal is to look better or be healthier (a much better goal than just weighing less) then you should try to retain as much muscle as possible while cutting down on body fat in order to maintain your strength and appearance. CICO is a principle related to weight loss, not body fat reduction, and is therefore not a beneficial approach to looking or feeling better, or what most people think about when they say or hear the phrase &amp;quot;losing weight.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you put in your body is more important than than how much of it. Sure you need to eat less to lose more, that is common sense. But if you were to eat 90% carbs at a 100 calorie deficit vs taking a keto approach at a 100 calorie deficit you may weigh the same after a month, but you would probably be a lot more happy with the keto results due to losing more fat and retaining more muscle than you would have on a high carb approach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, since you are retaining more muscle on keto, and more muscle means a higher TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) then over time you will be able to eat more calories than someone just following a CICO approach and still lose the same amount of weight. Meaning if there was a set of identical twins that weighed the same, had the exact same body composition and had a TDEE of 2000 calories each, if one decided to eat only twinkies and junk food at 1900 calories a day, while the other ate keto at 1900 calories a day, then yeah they would both lose weight, but at the end of a month their TDEEs would be different as their body compositions would have become different. Maybe the junk food twin lost 5 lbs but their TDEE is now 1900, whereas the keto twin also lost 5 lbs, but retained more muscle and now has a TDEE of 1950. Now if the twins wanted to continue losing weight at the same rate the junk food twin would have to consume 50 calories less than the keto twin. This may be an extreme example, but it demonstrates the flaws in the CICO mentality that all calories are equal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl:Dr A CICO approach oversimplifies things, doesn&amp;#39;t account for individual variation, and is a &amp;quot;weight loss&amp;quot; guideline while body fat reduction (not weight loss) should be the goal of your diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Calories in vs calories out (CICO)  is often proclaimed as the reason that a person loses or gains weight while on a diet, but I'm not completely convinced by this theory.

Sometimes that is enough, but if body takes in too much fat (and if insulin is not up) body just throws the excess fat out via various processes in the body.\n\nIt is worth noting that one major health benefit of being in ketosis is that your body burns away bad fat and puts in good fat, or burns fat stored in unhealthy location and stores it into good location. This explain why some people might not lose weight but their waistline shrinks: fat gets relocated. This moving-fat-around explain why body most of the time wants to take in most the fat if you're eating small amounts of fat (it wants to keep the constant storing and un-storing processes going).\n\nSince body tries to avoid too sudden changes, it would have probably taken closer to 500 if only 500 was eaten.\n\nThere are other factors in the play: For example: When you first start keto, you lose a lot of weight during the first two weeks. This is due to two things: 1) because of previous low fat diet, fat receptors are mostly off, so huge amount of fat actually passes right through you (you are in essence taking in much less fat calories than what you think) 2) you lose water weight.\n\nSimilarly, most people experience weight-loss-plateau after couple of months. This is partly because fat-adaptation is usually finished, and you're burning fat very very very very efficiently, so even if you're eating the same calories as when you started you are now getting more energy out of each gram of fat. This is why I think the formulas are, ah, how to say it: missing lot of key points.\n\nAnd fasting (no calories) has a funny effect too: your body basically reasons that you failed to kill a mammoth, and if it now reduces your calories you will very likely fail in the next hunt too, so body actually gives you EXTRA energy from stored fat to make sure that you don't fail in the next mammoth hunt. This is why people who do fasting right talk about feeling invincible and great. This hunting disaster option is why body wants to always have some fat stored so that it can function normally even if period of no-calories happens.\n\nI personally just try to keep carbs as low as possible, eat moderate protein, and don't worry about fat. My weight is dropping towards the ideal weight (at first very quickly, but the closer I get that ideal weight the slower the rate of weight loss). Of course, if I were underweight my body would slowly work to increase weight towards the ideal weight (to have some fat stored for the bad day).\n\nIf I stress about something that raises the insulin, my weight loss stops. If I BOTH stress and sleep too little, then my insulin raises so much that I start to gain weight. But each time I learn what not to do, and how different processes work and what are my limits.\n\nSo, for me, it's a game of hormones, the only number I really focus on is keeping carbs low. Goal is to get to ideal weight eventually, I exercise to improve hormonal balance not to consume calories. Some months are super easy, some months are struggle because I stay up too late and then get frustrated wondering how can anybody fail at going to sleep at decent hour ;-D  There are also lot of major health benefits for being in ketosis, so weight loss is not the sole focus for me (the world's oldest person has basically been eating mostly eggs her entire life).\n\nAnd genetics of course decide how hormones in your body react to certain groups like sweeteners or dairy products. Some are lucky, some can only have small amounts of sweeteners or dairy, some unlucky persons have to cut sweeteners completely off.\n\nSo, from my perspectives the whole focus on formulas and numbers  by bodybuilder-types is a bit needless, but some people like numbers and spreadsheets, and if you're a (semi)professional athlete is good to keep track of everything, and being on deficit guarantees that you cannot gain a lot of weight even if your hormones go up.

But I feel sorry for an average non-fitness person who reads this forum: they don't need to be hit with so much math and numbers.

I&amp;#39;ve now tracked for around 1.5 months, and I average around 1600 kcal, and the few binge cravings I&amp;#39;ve had, I&amp;#39;ve diverted to keto foods and they have resulted in a near maintenance binge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;#39;m sure people can lose weight with keto without tracking, as did I, but as another tool in the toolbox, tracking and CICO isn&amp;#39;t a bad tool at all (even if CICO is an oversimplification).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and I hate the saying &amp;quot;all calories are not equal&amp;quot; (just something I want to say here, you didn&amp;#39;t say this or anything), because that&amp;#39;s just wrong, it&amp;#39;s the same kind of oversimplification we accuse of CICO. All calories ARE equal, no matter what, it&amp;#39;s just a measurement of energy. For PEOPLE, what matters is where the calories come from, and they have different reactions for different foods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "keto", "name": "t1_dg5kmdh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492007749.0, "created_utc": 1491978949.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rske", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sq7t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rske", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sq7t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6b748", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Forgetfultiger", "parent_id": "t1_dg69tzi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/keto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The first month I started keto I lost not even a pound.
