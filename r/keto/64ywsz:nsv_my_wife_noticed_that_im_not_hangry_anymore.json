So many times we&amp;#39;d be trying to lose weight and get healthy at different times or worse through different methods. This allows us to eat together the same meal, or at very least have mostly Keto Friendly food choices in the house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus we Coach each other along and motivate each other. No more worry of enabling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note. We&amp;#39;re going to Vegas next week and plan on hitting a few fav spots and which will be non keto. But both have a hard plan to clean up the minute we&amp;#39;re back. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "keto", "name": "t1_dg6vfyn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492073592.0, "created_utc": 1492044792.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6tyyl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brett_riverboat", "parent_id": "t3_64ywsz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/keto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really wish my wife would get on-board with keto.
