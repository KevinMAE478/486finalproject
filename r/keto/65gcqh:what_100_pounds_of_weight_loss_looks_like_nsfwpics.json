It's easy to relapse and you need to make sure you do not relapse and that you stay on track.\n\nDrive is number 3 to me because you need to want to lose weight.

I would go to bed feeling like shit, waking up puking in my mouth from over eating. Wake up so tired. I broke chairs, couches, beds, you name it. My driver car seat is fucked up from being over weight. I broke the plastic that my power seat buttons are attached to. My car is a 2015... Also big thing for me was the fact my last relationship was back in 2012. I began to barely fit in 3XL shirts and sweatshirts. I wouldn't wear jackets because they wouldn't fit. All of this and my families concern for my health just added to everything. My dad and I made a deal that if I lost 50 pounds he would quit cigarettes and he quit January 1st. I didn't just do it for myself I did it for everyone I know and love also. I thought I was going to die, I felt like I was a waste of space just breathing in air and be dead in my 30s.

When I made coffee at home I used MCT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exercise you don&amp;#39;t need it to be 100% honest. I exercise because it gets my mind going makes me think and makes me feel at peace. I have gotten into running. During winter I did gym and personal trainer now that it&amp;#39;s warmer out i try to run as much as possible and I&amp;#39;ve also been playing soccer when I have the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My keys to losing weight\n1. Diet\n2. Discipline \n3. Drive&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diet will always be number 1 way to lose weight you can&amp;#39;t eat crap and expect to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discipline is number 2 to me because you need discipline to start as well as continuing to diet. It&amp;#39;s easy to relapse and you need to make sure you do not relapse and that you stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drive is number 3 to me because you need to want to lose weight. I didn&amp;#39;t start to diet earlier in my life because I didn&amp;#39;t really want to. I enjoyed the foods I ate they were delicious. I would go to bed feeling like shit, waking up puking in my mouth from over eating. Wake up so tired. I broke chairs, couches, beds, you name it. My driver car seat is fucked up from being over weight. I broke the plastic that my power seat buttons are attached to. My car is a 2015... Also big thing for me was the fact my last relationship was back in 2012. I began to barely fit in 3XL shirts and sweatshirts. I wouldn&amp;#39;t wear jackets because they wouldn&amp;#39;t fit. All of this and my families concern for my health just added to everything. My dad and I made a deal that if I lost 50 pounds he would quit cigarettes and he quit January 1st. I didn&amp;#39;t just do it for myself I did it for everyone I know and love also. I thought I was going to die, I felt like I was a waste of space just breathing in air and be dead in my 30s. Anyways I feel a ton better once I get out of bed I have energy whereas before I would basically be sleept all day especially after eating lunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "keto", "name": "t1_dgabis9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261770.0, "created_utc": 1492232970.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaauzq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ravendarklord76", "parent_id": "t3_65gcqh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/keto", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Couple questions\nDid you cheat?
