My lowest on keto 163lbs, but I shot all the way back up to 198(!!). Sadly, it has taken me from January until now, just to get back down to 190. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 2-year keto anniversary is 2 weeks away, and it&amp;#39;s sad to think how close I could be to my goal weight by now, if I&amp;#39;d just been able to stick with it. But I&amp;#39;m really pumped to be doing this challenge again! I&amp;#39;m on day 3 of doing 18/6 IF, and I&amp;#39;m doing better than ever with my water intake. I feel amazing, and I know it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before I&amp;#39;m back in the 160&amp;#39;s again (and beyond!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone here!

Roast is easy, you can chuck in a couple of potatoes to keep your guests happy, and just avoid them yourself, and then I normally just grab some feta and pesto, and toss the roast veges into a vegetarian salad for my sister-in-law. Another easy one is Mexican, you can get some really good low carb wraps, and then people just dish their own taco&amp;#39;s up based on your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At home we also do a lot of soup. Although I am (&lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt;) keto, I like to try one or two days a week with no meat. There is a variety of vegetarian soups out there, so you never get bored, and if we are having people round, I just pick up a loaf of crusty bread to keep them happy. Cauliflower and blue cheese is a go to for us, and if you have a slow cooker, so so easy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we love these as a variation of eggs Benedict instead of hash or english muffin.
