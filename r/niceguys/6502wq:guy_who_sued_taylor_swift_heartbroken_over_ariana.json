After all I said yesterday I don&amp;#39;t think this fella can be helped and I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s more important that he was stopped, or at the very least didn&amp;#39;t receive any kind of encouragement for this kind of behavior. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could however ignore all of this other Tom foolery and get behind him on a slightly more &amp;#39;positive&amp;#39; endeavour;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Presumably as he&amp;#39;s getting to the end of writing the book which he hopes will end Taylor Swift&amp;#39;s career, he now appears to have suddenly came up with the idea of writing a script for an &amp;quot;epic holocaust blockbuster&amp;quot; (which no doubt will feature that &amp;quot;super bad dude&amp;quot; Hitler, mind you he was only number 3 on his list of the top 3 evil most deadliest people to have ever lived so maybe we might see Taylor Swift or poor old Walt Disney appearing instead as the evil leader of the nazi party &lt;a href=\"https://theamazingrussellgreer.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/the-evil-gene/\"&gt;https://theamazingrussellgreer.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/the-evil-gene/&lt;/a&gt;), which he seemingly wishes to pitch to some major Hollywood studios. To help support this endeavor he has started a gofundme page and produced a YouTube video (&lt;a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/epicholocaustfilm\"&gt;https://www.gofundme.com/epicholocaustfilm&lt;/a&gt;) which he hopes will generate enough funds to get this project off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fear is, coming as it does smack bang in the middle of all of this anger and venom he appears to be spouting against Ariana Grange and Taylor Swift (who he is also trying to assert elsewhere has aids &lt;a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Does-Taylor-Swift-have-AIDS\"&gt;https://www.quora.com/Does-Taylor-Swift-have-AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, something he has done with other women who have rejected or &amp;#39;offended&amp;#39; him, and then he says he&amp;#39;s hoping for some support from AIDS charities and support groups to help with his attempts to legalise brothels!) and God knows who else, is that any money he raises from this endeavour will go instead to fund these hate campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously this guy needs to be stopped by someone and brought under control as he appears to be incapable of stopping himself and it only ever appears to escalate. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "niceguys", "name": "t1_dg917sh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492198968.0, "created_utc": 1492170168.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rvxp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6502wq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rvxp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6502wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ctye", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Beebopalooba", "parent_id": "t1_dg75rhz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/niceguys", "controversiality": 0, "body": "26", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;26&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "niceguys", "name": "t1_dg7ctye", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492105264.0, "created_utc": 1492076464.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rvxp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6502wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7hgf4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cjhobbitbane", "parent_id": "t1_dg75rhz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/niceguys", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I actually really like her *music*, it's totally not because she wears miniskirts and thigh highs literally everywhere.

He knew about this (as you can see from his quora question, screenshot available if he takes it down) at least a week before he attended and was advised not to take any gifts with him, yet he went against that and turned up with flowers, a picture book (wtf) and a cuddly toy whilst dressed in a suit and, it would appear, throwing his arms around Ariana telling her how grateful he was for her music and how much he wanted her to work with him and do his music. It appears that this behaviour perhaps understandably may have threw Ariana, hence any awkward reaction he may have received. His main points of grievance against her would appear to be the fact that he went to the special effort of wearing a 'tux' bought specially for the occasion but she apparently failed to comment on how nice he looked (it was a paid for meet and great fella, not a date), that she didn't hug him as closely as some of her other fans when he had his photo taken with her (which is ridiculous) which he finds particularly offensive as none of those other fans bought her any gifts (he assumes) presumably as they were respectfully adhering to the 'no gifts' policy! And as far as the picture book thing goes, which apparently had a copy of his music inside (a really mediocre song he has written/produced) and a request for Ariana to \"do his music\", this was handed to one of Ariana's assistants (as the no gift rule would have prevented him from giving it to Ariana himself, which he was previously aware of) who he claims \"made a promise\" to give it to Ariana. Even if that was the case however, this did not form any kind of contract or obligation for this to occur or indeed for Ariana to have to give him any kind of reply, let alone agree to do his music. Similar to the \"no unsolicited music\" policy he was aware of prior to trying to submit his music to Taylor Swift, these rules and policies are in place for a reason and you can't ignore these rules and subsequently  claim disability discrimination when it doesn't go your way! Indeed disability discrimination laws are there to ensure fair and equal treatment, ie equality, of every individual regardless of the presence of any disability and the fact is these rules and policies were/are in place and apply to ALL individuals, no exceptions. As such they are not discriminatory, nor are the actions of any individuals following these rules and policies. But as far as disability 'shaming' goes, it would seem with this individual the only shame involved is that which he brings on disabled people himself as a result of his actions and behaviour. However, as the evidence also shows (I'm talking about fb posts he's made over the last couple of years, just examine his time line however screenshots are again available if he deletes past posts) this has never really been about Aruba or anyone else doing his music. No, it's always been about his hopes that he would somehow impress these woman with the fact he cared enough to write a song for them (as terrible as these songs may be) and as a result of which they would agree to go in a date with him and hopefully form a relationship. Hence the many posts he made as he was working on this music back in 2015/2016 where he stated how he was \"going to get\" these women (his words) and how they would soon be his. Seriously 'ucked up behaviour! But, let him go ahead and take this thing with Ariana to the  press and make any claims about disability discrimination or shaming and I'd be happy to present this counter argument showing she has done nothing wrong and revealing that he is in fact some crazy stalker of these women. I'll say again, sort yourself out and get some help, you do not have to live your life like thus and these women don't deserve to be on the receiving end of your misplaced anger and aggression!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh and as far as this whole &amp;#39;disability shaming&amp;#39; thing with Arianna Grande goes, if you examine his quora profile (link available elsewhere in this thread) you&amp;#39;ll discover that there was actually a &amp;quot;no gifts&amp;quot; policy at the backstage meet and greet he attended with Arianna at one of her concerts.

And as far as the picture book thing goes, which apparently had a copy of his music inside (a really mediocre song he has written/produced) and a request for Ariana to &amp;quot;do his music&amp;quot;, this was handed to one of Ariana&amp;#39;s assistants (as the no gift rule would have prevented him from giving it to Ariana himself, which he was previously aware of) who he claims &amp;quot;made a promise&amp;quot; to give it to Ariana. Even if that was the case however, this did not form any kind of contract or obligation for this to occur or indeed for Ariana to have to give him any kind of reply, let alone agree to do his music. Similar to the &amp;quot;no unsolicited music&amp;quot; policy he was aware of prior to trying to submit his music to Taylor Swift, these rules and policies are in place for a reason and you can&amp;#39;t ignore these rules and subsequently  claim disability discrimination when it doesn&amp;#39;t go your way! Indeed disability discrimination laws are there to ensure fair and equal treatment, ie equality, of every individual regardless of the presence of any disability and the fact is these rules and policies were/are in place and apply to ALL individuals, no exceptions. As such they are not discriminatory, nor are the actions of any individuals following these rules and policies. But as far as disability &amp;#39;shaming&amp;#39; goes, it would seem with this individual the only shame involved is that which he brings on disabled people himself as a result of his actions and behaviour. However, as the evidence also shows (I&amp;#39;m talking about fb posts he&amp;#39;s made over the last couple of years, just examine his time line however screenshots are again available if he deletes past posts) this has never really been about Aruba or anyone else doing his music. No, it&amp;#39;s always been about his hopes that he would somehow impress these woman with the fact he cared enough to write a song for them (as terrible as these songs may be) and as a result of which they would agree to go in a date with him and hopefully form a relationship. Hence the many posts he made as he was working on this music back in 2015/2016 where he stated how he was &amp;quot;going to get&amp;quot; these women (his words) and how they would soon be his. Seriously &amp;#39;ucked up behaviour! But, let him go ahead and take this thing with Ariana to the  press and make any claims about disability discrimination or shaming and I&amp;#39;d be happy to present this counter argument showing she has done nothing wrong and revealing that he is in fact some crazy stalker of these women. I&amp;#39;ll say again, sort yourself out and get some help, you do not have to live your life like thus and these women don&amp;#39;t deserve to be on the receiving end of your misplaced anger and aggression!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "niceguys", "name": "t1_dgbvj9a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492363041.0, "created_utc": 1492334241.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rvxp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6502wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgazmu2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Neskimo", "parent_id": "t3_6502wq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/niceguys", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He knows what he's doing", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knows what he&amp;#39;s doing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "niceguys", "name": "t1_dgazmu2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492310096.0, "created_utc": 1492281296.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rvxp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6502wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbod5g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YankeeMurderino", "parent_id": "t3_6502wq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/niceguys", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So he's claiming he's going to get a private investigator to find out who the trolls are.

It seems that he has had to struggle with rejection all of his life after being abandoned by his birth parents and family, and this rejection continued on into his school life where he appears to have faced further rejection and ridicule for the way his disability affected his appearance.

The course of action he appears to have engaged in with each of the mentioned celebrities being to first of all become obsessed with them largely because of their looks and/or their own success, this has then led him to believe that if he was successful in being able to form a relationship with any of these women not only would that fulfill his personal need for acceptance, but also as being seen to be the partner of such a celebrity it would also hopefully provide him with some wider acceptance from all of the celebrity's fans and ergo the world in general. And in order to fulfill this fantasy, we see actions related to childhood/adolescent fantasy whereby he has developed a belief that if he is nice to these people, sends them flowers and teddy bears, dresses himself up in a smart suit when he has a chance to meet them and writes songs and music for them (I remember back as a young boy myself writing poetry for a girl I had the hots for) then surely this will lead (as it does in movies and other such fiction) to him being able to successfully 'woo' (his word) these celebrities which in turn might lead to a date and the promise of an ongoing relationship. But... this is all fanciful and delusional thinking stemming from those early rejections and need to be accepted, which is perhaps understandable, is it not? But where is this all going to go?
