Basically one day the conversation of women in politics came up and I found out just how many people are against that because it would put a woman in power over a man. It just wasn&amp;#39;t the men saying this too but plenty of women. I think that&amp;#39;s a huge cause of sexism and one of the hardest parts about electing a woman president is that too many men and women would see it as making us weak. I mean remember we are dealing with the same people who use cuck as an insult here...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EnoughTrumpSpam", "name": "t1_dgbb1x4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492325853.0, "created_utc": 1492297053.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb3nxl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jouskia", "parent_id": "t1_dgaz7ee", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EnoughTrumpSpam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am loathe to agree with you because I'd love to have a woman as president, but this election made me feel really naive in terms of how much Sexism is out there.
