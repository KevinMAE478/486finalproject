I was never in the camp that Trump was Putin&amp;#39;s puppet, but the collusion was obvious. It&amp;#39;s possible that the relationship has finally soured. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Less likely, this could be a ploy to make it &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like the relationship is rocky, but the when Trump and Putin talk &lt;em&gt;all of sudden&lt;/em&gt; Trump has convinced Putin to be a US ally and he&amp;#39;ll be praised as a statesmen, whil Putin gets everything he wants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Putin has a solid alliance with Iran, then I&amp;#39;m not sure Putin needs Syria. There&amp;#39;s the contention over the oil pipeline, but if Rex and Vlad get publicly chummy, they can work out an arrangement. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EnoughTrumpSpam", "name": "t1_dg6h9fw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056804.0, "created_utc": 1492028004.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39usd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ybb2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wntz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64ybb2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EnoughTrumpSpam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EnoughTrumpSpam", "name": "t1_dg6wntz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075093.0, "created_utc": 1492046293.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39usd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ybb2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6xmb9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bainaq", "parent_id": "t3_64ybb2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EnoughTrumpSpam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a little high and I can't tell if this is what is happening.
