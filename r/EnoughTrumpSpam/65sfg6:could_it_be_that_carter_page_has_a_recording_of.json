The only way I could see this even being plausible is if Trump didn&amp;#39;t think of it as treason and really does believe &amp;quot;wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if we could just get along with Russia&amp;quot; on some level.  Like that request at his rally where he asked Russia to get Clinton&amp;#39;s emails, if he actually sees Russia as an ally of the US in some twisted way I could maybe see him not being afraid of making tapes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even then why would he make tapes instead of a video conference or using Page as an in-between?  It&amp;#39;s not a theory that makes sense, but I&amp;#39;m curious what she&amp;#39;s heard that lead her to this theory since she does seem to have sources with credible information.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EnoughTrumpSpam", "name": "t1_dgd9uda", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492445588.0, "created_utc": 1492416788.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39usd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sfg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39usd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sfg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhek0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drive_me_away", "parent_id": "t1_dgcza1s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EnoughTrumpSpam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think he is mentally all there.
