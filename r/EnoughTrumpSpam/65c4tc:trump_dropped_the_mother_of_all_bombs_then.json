Sure, you may have healthcare now; but that's the Affordable Care Act, not Obamacare. Next, take into account that the word Obama is the new king of dirty words. So anything that Obama did or has the name Obama is the devil and needs to be wiped from this earth. Also, if you realize that Obamacare *is* the ACA, just call it Obamacare. It'll make it easier for you to hate it.\n\nNext, realize that you are a person destined to be rich, but are unable to get there for whatever reason; so instead, you look towards the Republican Party for help. They're rich, successful and they hold the capitalist mentality to heart: Put your hard work in and you will be successful and you deserve to reap the rewards from your labor. If your'e already well off, then you may already have the mentality that you deserve to keep what you earned and screw everyone else. If you don't think that way and are well off, start thinking that way.\n\nOnce you get that in mind, then you have to learn to disregard compassion for anyone else. Everyone else is a freeloader. Get your own damn healthcare, get your own damn education, support religious people who won't issue a marriage certificate to those damn gays and remove as many benefits from the freeloading cretins that we call the poor so they learn to pull up their boostraps and get a third job and be responsible. Remember, they have a choice. Maybe instead of getting that new iPhone, invest in healthcare! Tell yourself that having a socialist mentality will destroy this country; and instead of working to help with various programs, like the Affordable Care Act, or taking some cues from the other countries that have universal healthcare, just try to get rid of it because a black man created our version of universal healthcare. Also, if you have Christian values, realize that the type of socialism we're dealing with is not the same as the socialism that Jesus Christ believed in. How do you get there? Well, that's the hardest part.\n\nJust tell yourself it's different. And keep saying it. Over and over and over again. Keep saying it until the voice in your head that tries to contradict you is harder to hear. Just keep going. Until suddenly, that small voice - your conscience, is gone. Then, it's suddenly easier to face the hypocrisy. Suddenly, it's okay for Trump to take more vacations than Obama because he's doing Presidential stuff. Suddenly, it's okay to ignore the fact that the AHCA actually would have provided benefits and relief for the old and richer population and that, ironically, the old and rich would have benefited from your tax dollars. A form of socialism, actually. *But this time, it's okay*, because those rich people worked hard for their money so it's unfair for them to have to give away more of it. Then, it's suddenly okay to disregard the hypocrisy that Hillary's emails were a huge problem; but these potential Russian ties aren't. Disregard the fact that Hillary wanted war; yet the current administration is flexing their military muscle. Disregard the fact that someone with no experience in education is now the head of the Department of Education. Disregard the fact that the man who now runs the EPA, sued the EPA numerous times because of his ties to the oil industry. Disregard the fact that not only have we not drained the swamp, the President didn't even like the term until he saw it got a positive reaction. Disregard the fact that the current President is fine with jeopardizing our current healthcare system because he's waiting for the Democrats to beg for his help instead of helping the people of his own country and trying to come to an answer to this problem that is apparently destined to destroy this country.\n\nOnce you've done all that, then you'll be able to understand how they can justify his weekend vacations. The left sucks. The left are babies and the left are libtards.\n\nTL;DR - It's party over country.\n\nEdit: Some minor fixes. I'll also point out that not everyone on the right are like this. But the most vocal ones are ... and just like all groups, the loudest ones don't really represent the logical ones who do have a problem with Trump, but they're the ones that make the news. It's just that a lot of this stuff has happened in the past six months.

It&amp;#39;ll make it easier for you to hate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, realize that you are a person destined to be rich, but are unable to get there for whatever reason; so instead, you look towards the Republican Party for help. They&amp;#39;re rich, successful and they hold the capitalist mentality to heart: Put your hard work in and you will be successful and you deserve to reap the rewards from your labor. If your&amp;#39;e already well off, then you may already have the mentality that you deserve to keep what you earned and screw everyone else. If you don&amp;#39;t think that way and are well off, start thinking that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get that in mind, then you have to learn to disregard compassion for anyone else. Everyone else is a freeloader. Get your own damn healthcare, get your own damn education, support religious people who won&amp;#39;t issue a marriage certificate to those damn gays and remove as many benefits from the freeloading cretins that we call the poor so they learn to pull up their boostraps and get a third job and be responsible. Remember, they have a choice. Maybe instead of getting that new iPhone, invest in healthcare! Tell yourself that having a socialist mentality will destroy this country; and instead of working to help with various programs, like the Affordable Care Act, or taking some cues from the other countries that have universal healthcare, just try to get rid of it because a black man created our version of universal healthcare. Also, if you have Christian values, realize that the type of socialism we&amp;#39;re dealing with is not the same as the socialism that Jesus Christ believed in. How do you get there? Well, that&amp;#39;s the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just tell yourself it&amp;#39;s different. And keep saying it. Over and over and over again. Keep saying it until the voice in your head that tries to contradict you is harder to hear. Just keep going. Until suddenly, that small voice - your conscience, is gone. Then, it&amp;#39;s suddenly easier to face the hypocrisy. Suddenly, it&amp;#39;s okay for Trump to take more vacations than Obama because he&amp;#39;s doing Presidential stuff. Suddenly, it&amp;#39;s okay to ignore the fact that the AHCA actually would have provided benefits and relief for the old and richer population and that, ironically, the old and rich would have benefited from your tax dollars. A form of socialism, actually. &lt;em&gt;But this time, it&amp;#39;s okay&lt;/em&gt;, because those rich people worked hard for their money so it&amp;#39;s unfair for them to have to give away more of it. Then, it&amp;#39;s suddenly okay to disregard the hypocrisy that Hillary&amp;#39;s emails were a huge problem; but these potential Russian ties aren&amp;#39;t. Disregard the fact that Hillary wanted war; yet the current administration is flexing their military muscle. Disregard the fact that someone with no experience in education is now the head of the Department of Education. Disregard the fact that the man who now runs the EPA, sued the EPA numerous times because of his ties to the oil industry. Disregard the fact that not only have we not drained the swamp, the President didn&amp;#39;t even like the term until he saw it got a positive reaction. Disregard the fact that the current President is fine with jeopardizing our current healthcare system because he&amp;#39;s waiting for the Democrats to beg for his help instead of helping the people of his own country and trying to come to an answer to this problem that is apparently destined to destroy this country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve done all that, then you&amp;#39;ll be able to understand how they can justify his weekend vacations. The left sucks. The left are babies and the left are libtards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - It&amp;#39;s party over country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some minor fixes. I&amp;#39;ll also point out that not everyone on the right are like this. But the most vocal ones are ... and just like all groups, the loudest ones don&amp;#39;t really represent the logical ones who do have a problem with Trump, but they&amp;#39;re the ones that make the news. It&amp;#39;s just that a lot of this stuff has happened in the past six months. It&amp;#39;s very exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EnoughTrumpSpam", "name": "t1_dg9cj8x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215529.0, "created_utc": 1492186729.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 91}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9aoe4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 72, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Banshee__Queen", "parent_id": "t1_dg94gv6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EnoughTrumpSpam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm still questioning how his loyalty base are justifying him taking almost every weekend off.
