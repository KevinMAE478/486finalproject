Mrs. Foster has recently begun to suspect her husband of purposely exacerbating her \"almost pathological fear of missing a train, a plane, a boat, or even a theatre curtain\". She is continuously badgered by her husband, Eugene, who makes a habit of waiting to leave the house until after the proverbial last second has already passed.\n\nMrs. Foster is preparing for a six-week trip to Paris, where their daughter and her family reside. While attempting to leave for the airport, things finally come to a head. After the usual rounds of teasing his wife's delicate psyche, Mr. Foster tries to foil his wife for the last time by claiming he has mistakenly left a present for their daughter in the house. Mr. Foster insists on looking for the gift himself and goes back inside. While her husband pretends to search their six-story home, Mrs. Foster finds the present in the car and can't help but notice \"it was wedged down firm and deep, as though with the help of a pushing hand.\" Mrs. Foster rushes to retrieve her husband as quickly as possible, but hears a noise from inside their home and has a sudden change of heart. Mrs. Foster gets back in the car and much to the surprise of the driver, demands to be driven to the airport immediately.\n\nMrs. Foster enjoys her time in Paris and writes her husband weekly, as promised.\n\nThe visit concludes, and Mrs. Foster flies back to New York.
