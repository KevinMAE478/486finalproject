They're separated by a long distance. She is probably pretty happy because she gets all the benefits of being married to him like his money, fame, freedom to work on her own projects, and protection, with very few downsides - people who don't like trump don't like her and she has to occasionally have sex with him.\n\n\nThis is almost exactly how America was when we split from Britain but were still colonies. We were pretty happy. You can pretty much word for word replace \"melania\" in the above paragraph with \"the colonies\" and it fits. Most felt this way even while the revolution was going on. They were like \"chill bruh we good, taxes ain't so bad compared to all the shit we get for free.\" \n\n\nSo imagine one day Baron is like \"hey ma, this is dumb, I wanna change my name. I don't like being associated with dad. Get a divorce and let's live on our own, I'll be the bread winner!\" And melania is like \"holy shit wtf bro you're 11 you can't do shit. I like getting everything I want paid for. Yeah trump sucks but we are protected - no one will touch us and we don't have to worry about starving.\"\n\n\nBaron really doesn't care about his dad, he just wants to live independently and do his own thing, like look at porn in the middle of the day, or ride his bike without the SS following. And he's tired of seeing hookers not cleaning up their piss when dad visits. So he does a shitty photoshop job of trump cheating on Melania with another woman and shows it to his mom. Melania is like \"who cares he grabs women there all the time!\" Then Baron lies and is like, \"dad said he's gonna leave you for her!\"\n\n\nSo Melania believes him (idk why tho he's 11 and kinda dumb). So she calls Trump up and tells him to stop cheating on her. He's like, \"baby, I know, I know the best people, just the best. I wouldn't ever cheat-you see, sometimes when dad's - I have three bombs aimed at the Middle East, so when them blacks attack, so the blacks they're poor, and crime is a terrible burden, so you see I golf, and when I golf - but mr. bannon has been saying things, the greatest things. So I'll talk to you later!\"\n\n\nAnd she's like \"dude wtf is wrong with you.\" But she quickly forgets. So Baron makes a gif of trump getting pissed on by an elephant and is like, \"yo ma! look at this shit!\" Then he puts a bunch of booby traps around their room and says dad did it. It's pretty unconvincing stuff, but Melania is kinda dumb too. So after awhile Melania gets upset and files for divorce. Except it's not a legal request bc she's definitely an illegal immigrant, obviously. \n\n\nSo eventually after a lot of fighting with the government she says they're divorced and cuts all ties to Trump. Trump doesn't recognize the divorce, but she still tells everyone it's true.\n\n\nSo Trump decides to visit Melania and Baron (now unified in their hatred for trump), and after 7 hours of stammering gibberish, slaps her across the face. So they have a huge fight. Baron bites his leg, Melania burns his toupe\u00e9. Trump cuts off one of their fingers. It's a big deal and lasts awhile. \n\n\nBut finally trump is like, \"damn bro this bitch ain't worth it.\" And he decides to grant her the divorce and move on with his bitter ass life. Then Melania and Baron live semi-happily ever after with a lot of hardships bc an 11 year old and an illegal alien can't do a whole lot to make money, but eventually they figure shit out.\n\n\nAnd that's pretty much the story of how America gained its independence from Britain.

Get a divorce and let&amp;#39;s live on our own, I&amp;#39;ll be the bread winner!&amp;quot; And melania is like &amp;quot;holy shit wtf bro you&amp;#39;re 11 you can&amp;#39;t do shit. I like getting everything I want paid for. Yeah trump sucks but we are protected - no one will touch us and we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about starving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baron really doesn&amp;#39;t care about his dad, he just wants to live independently and do his own thing, like look at porn in the middle of the day, or ride his bike without the SS following. And he&amp;#39;s tired of seeing hookers not cleaning up their piss when dad visits. So he does a shitty photoshop job of trump cheating on Melania with another woman and shows it to his mom. Melania is like &amp;quot;who cares he grabs women there all the time!&amp;quot; Then Baron lies and is like, &amp;quot;dad said he&amp;#39;s gonna leave you for her!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Melania believes him (idk why tho he&amp;#39;s 11 and kinda dumb). So she calls Trump up and tells him to stop cheating on her. He&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;baby, I know, I know the best people, just the best. I wouldn&amp;#39;t ever cheat-you see, sometimes when dad&amp;#39;s - I have three bombs aimed at the Middle East, so when them blacks attack, so the blacks they&amp;#39;re poor, and crime is a terrible burden, so you see I golf, and when I golf - but mr. bannon has been saying things, the greatest things. So I&amp;#39;ll talk to you later!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;dude wtf is wrong with you.&amp;quot; But she quickly forgets. So Baron makes a gif of trump getting pissed on by an elephant and is like, &amp;quot;yo ma! look at this shit!&amp;quot; Then he puts a bunch of booby traps around their room and says dad did it. It&amp;#39;s pretty unconvincing stuff, but Melania is kinda dumb too. So after awhile Melania gets upset and files for divorce. Except it&amp;#39;s not a legal request bc she&amp;#39;s definitely an illegal immigrant, obviously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So eventually after a lot of fighting with the government she says they&amp;#39;re divorced and cuts all ties to Trump. Trump doesn&amp;#39;t recognize the divorce, but she still tells everyone it&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Trump decides to visit Melania and Baron (now unified in their hatred for trump), and after 7 hours of stammering gibberish, slaps her across the face. So they have a huge fight. Baron bites his leg, Melania burns his toupe\u00e9. Trump cuts off one of their fingers. It&amp;#39;s a big deal and lasts awhile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But finally trump is like, &amp;quot;damn bro this bitch ain&amp;#39;t worth it.&amp;quot; And he decides to grant her the divorce and move on with his bitter ass life. Then Melania and Baron live semi-happily ever after with a lot of hardships bc an 11 year old and an illegal alien can&amp;#39;t do a whole lot to make money, but eventually they figure shit out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s pretty much the story of how America gained its independence from Britain. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EnoughTrumpSpam", "name": "t1_dgathza", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492301647.0, "created_utc": 1492272847.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgan9b6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 460, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dedragon40", "parent_id": "t1_dgalvzo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EnoughTrumpSpam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, this presidency is probably the best thing that could ever happen to Melania.
