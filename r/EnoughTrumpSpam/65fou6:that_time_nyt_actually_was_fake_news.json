Conversely, the potential to make a bad situation worse is very, very high,\u201d Kuehn said.\nFor years, senior US military officers have expressed reluctance to intervene in the Syrian civil war. In 2013, Martin Dempsey, then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said that even a limited safe zone would cost over $1bn a month and require substantial air assets and ground troops to maintain. His successor, Joseph Dunford, told the Senate last month that a no-fly zone would \u201crequire us to go to war against Syria and Russia\u201d before walking his assessment back under pressure from proposal advocate John McCain.\n\n&gt; Clinton, who has long backed a no-fly zone as the Syrian bloodshed has accumulated, acknowledged those concerns in last week\u2019s third presidential debate. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cbut to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.\u201d\n\n&gt; But strategists have a hard time understanding how a no-fly zone provides the US with a large enough leverage to trade with Assad or Russia, given their objective is, respectively, self-preservation and the preservation of a client.\n\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t understand how a no-fly zone gets you to a political settlement. There\u2019s no history supporting that. There were no-fly zones in Iraq for close to a decade and it settled nothing,\u201d said Joshua Rovner of Southern Methodist University.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Call bacl when they massacre protestors and then massacre the people who went to their funerals&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure thing bud.
