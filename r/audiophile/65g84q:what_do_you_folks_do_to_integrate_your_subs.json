Stereo, or Movie. And both have different needs and requirements. With patience, it is possible to set them up such that they work well for either. \n\nMusic needs full range stereo going to 2 speakers without a crossover. This is important even if your speakers don't extend low very far. Full bodied instruments like a bass guitar, cello, male voices, drums, all can be spread around a sound stage and in stereo, but with a crossover, it all goes to the sub which hurts the realism and sound stage. Ideally you would operate the sub with the LPF set all the way up, and let the stereo manage the crossover frequencies. Then I put on some good tracks that I know well like Dave Brubeck \"Take Five\" and I start with the sub dialed out, then slowly bring it in until the music sounds full, but I can't tell the sub is there until I turn it off. That's the low end of \"music\" balance level. From there I can take it up a few db in the stereo settings if I need more bass, but the level at the sub is set. \n\nMovies. This is harder if you also use it for music. Movies generally have much louder and dedicated subwoofer tracks. A volume that sounds invisible for music, may be very very loud for a movie. However most stereos allow you to adjust the level of DTS and Dolby subwoofer channel. For instance I use a Denon and I set the \"LFE volume\" to -10db instead of the default of 0. This makes the sub kick hard during explosions and sound great in a movie, yet doesn't sound way too loud like it is without it. \n\nIf you do find you have to use a crossover in the LFE channel, set it for the low end of your speaker. For instance with most tower speakers, 40hz gives me good results. With smaller speakers like bookshelves maybe 60hz or even 80hz. This fits with the sweepable LPF of most subs which let them go up to 120 to 200hz. \n\nYou generally do not need to set custom LPF and HPF with extra hardware as any surround capable stereo system will allow you to set crossover and sub level. \n\nNow the last thing depends greatly on your sub, your room, and any room correction your stereo can do. Think of the sound from your sub as alternating between no bass, and super bass about every 2 feet in a normal sized room. This means move the sub 2 feet closer, and the sub will either get super loud, or super quiet. These are standing waves in your room so where you place your sub matters a lot. Generally I try to position it so it sounds neither too loud or too quiet, and I work EQ from there. \n\nMy Denon also has Audyssey XT32 which has subwoofer sound profiling which digitally flattens it's response in any room. This makes it much easier. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so there are 2 ways to do a sub. Stereo, or Movie.

Movies generally have much louder and dedicated subwoofer tracks. A volume that sounds invisible for music, may be very very loud for a movie. However most stereos allow you to adjust the level of DTS and Dolby subwoofer channel. For instance I use a Denon and I set the &amp;quot;LFE volume&amp;quot; to -10db instead of the default of 0. This makes the sub kick hard during explosions and sound great in a movie, yet doesn&amp;#39;t sound way too loud like it is without it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do find you have to use a crossover in the LFE channel, set it for the low end of your speaker. For instance with most tower speakers, 40hz gives me good results. With smaller speakers like bookshelves maybe 60hz or even 80hz. This fits with the sweepable LPF of most subs which let them go up to 120 to 200hz. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You generally do not need to set custom LPF and HPF with extra hardware as any surround capable stereo system will allow you to set crossover and sub level. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the last thing depends greatly on your sub, your room, and any room correction your stereo can do. Think of the sound from your sub as alternating between no bass, and super bass about every 2 feet in a normal sized room. This means move the sub 2 feet closer, and the sub will either get super loud, or super quiet. These are standing waves in your room so where you place your sub matters a lot. Generally I try to position it so it sounds neither too loud or too quiet, and I work EQ from there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Denon also has Audyssey XT32 which has subwoofer sound profiling which digitally flattens it&amp;#39;s response in any room. This makes it much easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dgafvc5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492271912.0, "created_utc": 1492243112.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmiy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g84q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahkx9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IsItTheFrankOrBeans", "parent_id": "t3_65g84q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I bought two of them.
