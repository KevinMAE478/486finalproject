This is a pretty huge advantage for me and the single reason that I'm considering this over the PM5005.\n- Has FM radio? Yeah okay this isn't really a big advantage as I'm not much of a radio listener, but it's nice to have.\n\nCons: \n\n- Higher THD rating (0.7% vs 0.05%) I honestly don't understand THD enough to know whether this is something that'd be noticeable or not and can't find any info about the signal-to-noise-ratio other than for FM radio.\n- Less inputs - enough for my turntable and PC which is all I have now, but I wouldn't be able to add more stuff in future if I did decide to add a TV or something. That said, the chances of me adding a TV for anything other than being a bigger screen for my computer are slim to none, so whether or not I'd ever want any more inputs is debatable.\n- No built in phono stage.\n\n---\n\nAny thoughts on the two?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not certain yet, but I&amp;#39;m considering upgrading my amplifier this month (from a little SMSL SA-50). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve narrowed it down to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marantz PM5005&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Denon DRA-F109&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it works out ever so slightly cheaper for me to get the DRA-F109.

I didn&amp;#39;t suggest powered speakers initially because it can be difficult to get them to work with multiple sources without adding additional equipment (and avoiding the cost and space of separate boxes for an amp/reciever is part of the attraction of powered speakers), and it&amp;#39;s not as easy to integrate a sub as with an AVR.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a good entry level turntable that will be kind to your records.  The speakers have bluetooth built in already, don&amp;#39;t they?  Give it a try, but you probably won&amp;#39;t find the need for lossless wireless playback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I son&amp;#39;t see any specifics on how to integrate a subwoofer, but you could get a Bic F12 down the road and not be much beyond your $500 budget.  If you get a sub, look up the subwoofer crawl to make surfeit is placed as well as practical for your main listening position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may also want to look into some basic info on speaker placement to make sure you get the most out of your investment, but, of course, all that advice is subject to what is practical with regard to aesthetics and other practical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dg9ojds", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229625.0, "created_utc": 1492200825.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmiy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bbt8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9n715", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Brumund", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ml58", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You could connect the TV to the optical input, and run chromecast through the TV.
