Imagine one day you finally manage to run the distance in 9.99 seconds. You've attained your goal.\n\nBut you've spent years and years and years working towards this goal, it's been your consuming passion. It's the only hobby you have, nothing else interests you. So you keep running, faster and faster. Now you can run the distance in 8.5 seconds. It doesn't matter since you win with anything below 10 seconds but you're getting faster (even though it no longer matters).\n\nYou keep pouring more and more time and money into running, better shoes, better training, you're running faster and faster all the time even though it doesn't matter at all.\n\nNOW imagine there were other people trying to run the distance in less than 10 seconds. Imagine a dozen people have beaten the time. All of you are winners, you are all 100% successful.\n\nOH BUT *you* are special, *you* can run the distance in 7.2 seconds! It doesn't matter than you only needed less than 10 and every winner gets the exact same prize, you can run the distance faster than anybody else! You're the champion even though you don't have anything tangible to show for it!\n\nThis is high end audio. These people spending $10,000 on a DAC attained perfect digital-to-analogue conversion back when they first spent $100 on a DAC BUT now they're THE MOST PERFECT of all their friends! Most importantly, they're THE MOST PERFECT of all the people on their respective little internet groups and nobody can deny! **LOOK AT MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!** \n\nThis is why you're reading a review of a product saying complete bullshit like \"Prince's main and backing vocals have an incredibly natural, raw, and unaltered sound through the DAC 9\". \n\nThis review is particularly 'special' because they flat out admit to throwing logic out the window: \n\n&gt;There is a digital chip in the DAC 9 that is being used for purposes other than its intended design. This chip is not available in any other ARC DAC. Squeezing information about this chip from the Audio Research team is tougher than finding highly classified information online. This is the frustrating part for many people. As consumers we are just supposed to believe ARC and rely on the fact the company has a very stellar reputation. Fortunately, we can check their work in a different way, by listening to the final product.\n\nSo there's a chip in this DAC that does something, or so we're told. We don't know what it does or why it's doing it. But it's amazing:\n\n&gt;Some control freaks won't rest, or even trust themselves that they like the sound, until this secret is unmasked. Oh well, keep waiting while everyone else enjoys thousands of hours worth of great music.\n\nThey make fun of somebody who questions the Magic Chip in the same way a religious zealot (or anti-religious zealot for that matter) mocks the non-believers, literally labeling them \"freaks\" for questioning the mighty Magic Chip.\n\nTake the rest of the article. No galvanic isolation, gee welcome to noise floor city population your bank account. New technologies? Nah, doesn't support them (not that they're worthwhile anyway, but if my DAC cost more than a car I'd probably expect cruise control as well as power windows).

Even the author isn't sure about that one. SELECTABLE FILTERS HOLY FUCK yeah nah this is a regular feature of DAC's in the three figure range.\n\nFunniest thing about all this? When they release the \"DAC 10\" (whenever that might be), the same guy will write the same article telling you the DAC 9 is a piece of shit that isn't worth flushing down the toilet. \n\nWe always need to be that one step ahead of the last guy racing behind us!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because all the empirical testing was done decades ago.

You can measure lots of tendencies of the device, but for the most part, what is being experienced in good audio isn&amp;#39;t quantifiable on a spec sheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the most amazing experience I&amp;#39;ve had listening to audio (as in, hearing what I would call the best reproduction of audio I have ever listened to) would have been in a session, playing back a 2&amp;quot; 24-track machine. But specwise, that THD, noise floor, dynamic range, and frequency capability of that machine, on paper, was crap compared to the most basic audio receiver and CD player available at the time, but the former sounded AMAZING while the later sounded lifeless and dull.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dgamo3h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492290952.0, "created_utc": 1492262152.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaclt7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mugtrees", "parent_id": "t1_dga1xo8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Such as?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such as?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dgaclt7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492263946.0, "created_utc": 1492235146.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga1xo8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Josuah", "parent_id": "t1_dg921hb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The audio review magazines/sites and forums that do measurements also do measurements for DACs. ???", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audio review magazines/sites and forums that do measurements also do measurements for DACs. ???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dga1xo8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247030.0, "created_utc": 1492218230.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg921hb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mugtrees", "parent_id": "t1_dg8zrqk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm surprised there's not more empirical testing results out there for dacs.
