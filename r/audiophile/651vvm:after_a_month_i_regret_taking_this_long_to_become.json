I was using a 5.1 all in one computer system. Then I was using an ever so slightly better but missing one speaker (one of the front speaker connections on the receiver died) all in one home theatre system.\n\nI decided since I had a little more money to spare, and since it was in the interest of what I do (I make videos and so it's helpful to be able to hear what I'm doing with some accuracy) I decided it was time to replace my speaker system.\n\nI set myself a budget of $70 and looked at the all in one computer systems my local store had available. I was pretty set on getting the Logitech Z506 5.1 system.\n\nI decided before buying it though I'd do some research, so I did what I always do when it comes to research: Head to Google and start digging. I was looking for computer speakers, but I saw a lot of people suggesting time and time again to grab either a pair of studio monitors, or some bookshelf speakers + an amp. \n\nI didn't even know what bookshelf speakers or studio monitors were. So I did yet more digging, and started reading about them.\n\nEventually I decided that bookshelf speakers, along with a sub (since I do occasionally enjoy my bass heavy music), were the route I wanted to go down. \n\nI quickly realised my $70 budget wasn't enough, and so I upped it to about $150 and decided to buy just the speakers and a cheap amp to go with them, and worry about the sub later. I set a max price of around ~$250 if the system was REALLY good enough to warrant it.\n\nEnded up posting in the purchase help thread here, got given some suggestions. Since I couldn't audition in person I tried to find sound tests for all the mentioned speakers on YouTube. It's not quite the same as actually hearing the speakers when you have it diluted through a shitty microphone, but it was enough to give me a basic feel for each of the speakers.\n\nOne of the speaker examples suggested were the Dali Zensor 1s. Every different sound test I listened, even when the microphones were absolute ass.. the speakers sounded great to me. Something about them I couldn't quite place it. So, that was it, I was convinced, these were the ones I wanted.\n\nFor the cheap SMSL-SA 50 amp I went with, along with the speakers, speaker wire, etc, my total had now crept up to around $300. I had that uneasy feeling about my purchase since $300 is actually a very large sum of money for me. (I live in a country where the $ goes about 3x further, and some months that's around about what I earn in the entire month) \n\nI bought them though, and only a few weeks later I dropped another $300 on the Jamo J12 sub to go with them.\n\nThat's a huge chunk of cash for me, and every bit of logic told me that I realistically was going to end up disappointed - wishing I'd just spent that $70 and gone with the Logitech speakers. Maybe seeing a little better quality, but nothing to write home about.\n\nBoy was I wrong! I've only had these speakers for a month and a half and the amount of time I've spent just been awestruck at how good music sounds now. It has already been my money's worth. Every listen I still have that \"Wow\" feeling, amazed that a pair of speakers can reproduce the sound so well.\n\nMy music tastes have expanded greatly. Previously while I had fairly eclectic tastes, so many great bands just.. didn't sound that great to me. I'd blamed the music all along, never realising that some of those tracks just sounded worlds apart once you had a good stereo system. I've fallen in love with jazz, classical music, and classic rock in particular. \n\nMusic used to be something that I used to supplement other activities. Working on something? Put some music on in the background. Playing games? Put some music on while I play. Chatting away? Pop on some music.\n\nNow music is its own experience for me. I like to put on a playlist or album, and just lean back in my chair, close my eyes, and let it wash over me.\n\nI don't know about telling the difference between 320kbps and flac. Personally 128kbps and below sounds bad to me, but anything above that (even the free version of Spotify's 160kbps) sounds great. I could probably tell 160 vs flac apart in an A/B test, but only with certain songs, and only barely - but not 320 vs flac that's for sure.\n\nI even produced a couple of (very poor) electronic tracks since getting my speakers as the renewed love for music has made me want to make some of my own. \n\nPerhaps the best part for me though is something very unique to my situation. I used to be an addict. Yeah it sucks, but I got clean, and not only that but I was able to turn my life around to be even better than it was before my addiction. Why do I bring up my addiction? Well, during my experimentation, I got to hear music under the influence of a lot of substances. Some of those substances do other-worldly things to the listening experience.

I was using a 5.1 all in one computer system. Then I was using an ever so slightly better but missing one speaker (one of the front speaker connections on the receiver died) all in one home theatre system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided since I had a little more money to spare, and since it was in the interest of what I do (I make videos and so it&amp;#39;s helpful to be able to hear what I&amp;#39;m doing with some accuracy) I decided it was time to replace my speaker system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set myself a budget of $70 and looked at the all in one computer systems my local store had available. I was pretty set on getting the Logitech Z506 5.1 system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided before buying it though I&amp;#39;d do some research, so I did what I always do when it comes to research: Head to Google and start digging. I was looking for computer speakers, but I saw a lot of people suggesting time and time again to grab either a pair of studio monitors, or some bookshelf speakers + an amp. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even know what bookshelf speakers or studio monitors were. So I did yet more digging, and started reading about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I decided that bookshelf speakers, along with a sub (since I do occasionally enjoy my bass heavy music), were the route I wanted to go down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly realised my $70 budget wasn&amp;#39;t enough, and so I upped it to about $150 and decided to buy just the speakers and a cheap amp to go with them, and worry about the sub later. I set a max price of around ~$250 if the system was REALLY good enough to warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ended up posting in the purchase help thread here, got given some suggestions. Since I couldn&amp;#39;t audition in person I tried to find sound tests for all the mentioned speakers on YouTube. It&amp;#39;s not quite the same as actually hearing the speakers when you have it diluted through a shitty microphone, but it was enough to give me a basic feel for each of the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the speaker examples suggested were the Dali Zensor 1s. Every different sound test I listened, even when the microphones were absolute ass.. the speakers sounded great to me. Something about them I couldn&amp;#39;t quite place it. So, that was it, I was convinced, these were the ones I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the cheap SMSL-SA 50 amp I went with, along with the speakers, speaker wire, etc, my total had now crept up to around $300. I had that uneasy feeling about my purchase since $300 is actually a very large sum of money for me. (I live in a country where the $ goes about 3x further, and some months that&amp;#39;s around about what I earn in the entire month) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought them though, and only a few weeks later I dropped another $300 on the Jamo J12 sub to go with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a huge chunk of cash for me, and every bit of logic told me that I realistically was going to end up disappointed - wishing I&amp;#39;d just spent that $70 and gone with the Logitech speakers. Maybe seeing a little better quality, but nothing to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong! I&amp;#39;ve only had these speakers for a month and a half and the amount of time I&amp;#39;ve spent just been awestruck at how good music sounds now. It has already been my money&amp;#39;s worth. Every listen I still have that &amp;quot;Wow&amp;quot; feeling, amazed that a pair of speakers can reproduce the sound so well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My music tastes have expanded greatly. Previously while I had fairly eclectic tastes, so many great bands just.. didn&amp;#39;t sound that great to me. I&amp;#39;d blamed the music all along, never realising that some of those tracks just sounded worlds apart once you had a good stereo system. I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with jazz, classical music, and classic rock in particular. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Music used to be something that I used to supplement other activities. Working on something? Put some music on in the background. Playing games? Put some music on while I play. Chatting away? Pop on some music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now music is its own experience for me. I like to put on a playlist or album, and just lean back in my chair, close my eyes, and let it wash over me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about telling the difference between 320kbps and flac. Personally 128kbps and below sounds bad to me, but anything above that (even the free version of Spotify&amp;#39;s 160kbps) sounds great. I could probably tell 160 vs flac apart in an A/B test, but only with certain songs, and only barely - but not 320 vs flac that&amp;#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even produced a couple of (very poor) electronic tracks since getting my speakers as the renewed love for music has made me want to make some of my own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part for me though is something very unique to my situation. I used to be an addict. Yeah it sucks, but I got clean, and not only that but I was able to turn my life around to be even better than it was before my addiction. Why do I bring up my addiction? Well, during my experimentation, I got to hear music under the influence of a lot of substances. Some of those substances do other-worldly things to the listening experience. After stopping my experimentation, while I didn&amp;#39;t really miss the experiences - I did notice that music seemed to have lost its zest for me. It was never that jaw-dropping euphoric experience that I had when listening to it under the influence, when I listened sober...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...That was, until I got my current system!
