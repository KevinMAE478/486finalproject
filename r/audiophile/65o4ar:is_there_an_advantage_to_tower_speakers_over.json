They are really for my own edification.  I read through the comments on this thread and I see a lot of misconceptions that I previously held before doing some a/b testing on my own.  The notion that towers sound &amp;quot;fuller&amp;quot; or offer a &amp;quot;bigger&amp;quot; sound just haven&amp;#39;t held up against actual testing.  I am sure it isn&amp;#39;t true with every speaker line up out there but it has held true in the 5 or 6 I have done this with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, unless you have a giant room or are sitting more than 15 feet away from your speakers, I would opt for bookshelf speakers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dge6am1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492494211.0, "created_utc": 1492465411.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmiy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o4ar", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4v5p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "megalithicman", "parent_id": "t3_65o4ar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "more tower, more power!  http://imgur.com/aNWcRLQ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;more tower, more power!  &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/aNWcRLQ\"&gt;http://imgur.com/aNWcRLQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dgc4v5p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384575.0, "created_utc": 1492355775.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmiy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o4ar", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcb9h2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "duncan_D_sorderly", "parent_id": "t3_65o4ar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/audiophile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You have the advantage of being able to create a phase coherent source down to the lowest registers compared to smaller units with a sub.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the advantage of being able to create a phase coherent source down to the lowest registers compared to smaller units with a sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "audiophile", "name": "t1_dgcb9h2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393112.0, "created_utc": 1492364312.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
