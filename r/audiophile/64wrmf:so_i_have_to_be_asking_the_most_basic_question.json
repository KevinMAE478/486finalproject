Since you are new to this, I would recommend buying a kit that includes the drivers and the crossover already and all you have to do is make the cabinet.

How to position my speakers correctly?\n\n Honestly, I can't help you much here because I also don't know much about optimal speaker placement. The only think I hear is that the tweeters should be at ear height and that they should be facing you at an equal distance away from you.\n If you include a subwoofer in your system you have to keep if a few inches away from your wall (so that the back port has room) and that you need to do something called a \"sub crawl\" to find the best place to put it.
