You might be able to get away with in-wall speakers for rears and keep the couch against the wall, but it&amp;#39;s definitely not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also listed two brands for the main speakers, just in case you wanted some more options. The HTD&amp;#39;s are probably the ones I&amp;#39;d go with for your use case, as they&amp;#39;re more geared towards HT so movies and TV. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps, at the very least as a starting point.
