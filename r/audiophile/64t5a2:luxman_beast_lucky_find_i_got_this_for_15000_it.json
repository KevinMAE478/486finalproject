You&amp;#39;ve essentially become a ticket scalper, I&amp;#39;m sure you think they are paragons of virtue and free market values as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are taking people&amp;#39;s kindness of sell thing at reasonable prices and shitting on it. Sometimes I sell things way below value, not so someone like you sees a thing they can flip but so someone without the means can enjoy that piece. What you are doing is making decent audio gear less accessible to new comers and people who cannot spend a lot on audio gear.
