I notice there&amp;#39;s not a lot of reviews or opinions of the NuPrime models out there so wanted to add my two cents to anyone considering their product line. I had tons of trouble finding something to go on besides a few reviews from New Zealand and random forums. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you know much about NuPrime, you know they&amp;#39;re class D supporters.  That might eliminate a lot of you right there.  However, this is the best implementation of class D I&amp;#39;ve heard to date. (Note: haven&amp;#39;t heard an NCore, so there&amp;#39;s that). It easily bests the ICE power modules I&amp;#39;ve heard in terms of bass and midrange control, which was sorely lacking in the Peachtree integrateds, though they had terrific soundstage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take the plunge and try out a NuPrime since I wanted a small form factor and efficient amp to run my speakers when I didn&amp;#39;t feel like running the hot and electrically thirsty tube amp. When I got it, I was surprised at how dense it was. This box is packed. My Peachtree felt like mostly dead air inside by comparison. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Break in took about two weeks to smooth out some top end harshness, but now the STA 9 is super liquid, very clear and resolving, and has tons of bass and midrange weight. In a lot of respects it outdoes my venerable Decware tube amp in terms of liquidity and lushness, but the Decware still wins for low level listening and smooth 3D imaging. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NuPrime boasts a high damping factor, which is evident in the clarity and control of the lower range. Bass that can often get muddy in other amps is distinctly rendered with clear attack and decay. The bass lines on Pet Sounds is noted for its on-the-beat quickness. My Sansui 3000a always had issues with making these lines stand apart from each other and tended to blend the attacks and decays together and the Peachtree only could illustrate that the notes existed but without any weight or bassiness to them. The NuPrime makes it clear that you&amp;#39;re listening to a bass guitar and has that &amp;quot;in the studio&amp;quot; sound. Beyond that, guitars, synths, and drums sound awesome.  Vocals aren&amp;#39;t quite as impactful as on the tube amp, but no slouch at all.  Everything in the track stands on its own and images nicely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amp runs cool, backgrounds are dead black, and it&amp;#39;s easy to fit anywhere. If 100 watts aren&amp;#39;t enough, it can bridge into 290 watts. For my speakers, 100 watts is more than enough. It&amp;#39;s also slim both in height and width but only about 12&amp;quot; deep compared to full size components. It can go just about anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gripes? The power switch is on the back and there are no 12-volt triggers, so each session means fishing your hand around the back or just leaving it on. Even though NuPrime notes it&amp;#39;s among their warmest sounding amps, it&amp;#39;s still a tiny bit bright for my ears but that could be due to my Zu Omens (I know....save your strength. I&amp;#39;m in the market for new speakers.  Very tempted by the Spatial Triode Master M3)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend giving the STA-9 or, based on my experience, any NuPrime product an audition.
