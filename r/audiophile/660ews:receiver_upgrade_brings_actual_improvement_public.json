This resulted in some horrible corner effects and reflections for the bass that I could not fix.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been somewhat suspicious of room correction in the more recent home theater receivers but I just couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore.  So for the last few months I have been researching and window shopping for a new receiver.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally pulled the trigger on a new in the box Denon AVR-X4200W.  It is not the most recent tech but it is fairly close and I got a really good deal on it (good for my local market where everything is overpriced).  This took me from 75w/ch to 125w/ch, gave me room correction, and current tech HDMI plus a bunch of other stuff like networking, wifi, bluetooth,etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room correction has actually made a huge difference. Setting it up was remarkably painless and it is easy to switch between corrected and uncorrected to hear the difference.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last two nights after work were just re-listening to my favorite tunes and it sounds so much better.
