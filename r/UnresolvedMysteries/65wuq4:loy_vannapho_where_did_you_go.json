After dropping Ma off at work, Loy would usually visit Jokers Comedy Club for a game of poker or pool, go home for lunch, and then return to pick her up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; A witness reports seeing Loy sitting on a bench at Howard Amon Park. Other witnesses report seeing Loy, dressed in a white polo shirt, shorts, and flip-flops, around the dock at this time. (These sightings are reported to police the following day.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; When D.T. Luu, Loy\u2019s son-in-law, calls Loy\u2019s phone, it goes straight to voicemail, which is unusual. Loy\u2019s phone was an older flip phone, which he kept charged.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:15 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; Loy does not arrive home; his family calls police to report him missing. Luu is adamant that Loy would never miss picking up his wife and that being out of reach is uncharacteristic of his father-in-law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, August 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Morning:&lt;/strong&gt; Crews from Columbia Basin Dive Rescue, along with Richland and West Richland police, begin to scour the Columbia River for any sign of Loy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon:&lt;/strong&gt; Employees at Jokers Comedy Club report that they saw Loy two days prior to his disappearance (Tuesday, August 9), but have not seen him since. Their surveillance footage confirms that Loy never made it to Jokers on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:20 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; Richland police Sergeant. Alan Jenkins finds Loy\u2019s truck, a gray 2005 two-door Toyota Tundra, at Columbia Point Marina Park, a popular boating and hiking spot in Richland. Police recover blood samples and fingerprints inside the abandoned truck. The blood is spread about the interior and a single sandal is found outside the truck. Police and family are uncertain whether the sandal belongs to Loy or someone else. Blood and fingerprints are sent to a lab for processing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pattern of blood inside the truck shows small pools and drops of blood rather than spray or smearing, leading police and family to believe that Loy did not drive himself to the area near the dock and that he did not commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friends and family are puzzled by the truck\u2019s location, as Loy was never known to spend time in the area and it was not a part of his regular travel route. \u201cA 70-something-year-old, slow walking person to take a stroll in the park would be highly unlikely,\u201d says Luu. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Search dogs do not find Loy\u2019s scent anywhere outside of the truck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loy\u2019s family members search the truck for any receipts that might indicate where he has gone, but find nothing. The family notes that the gas tank was down to 1/8th, which is unusual as Loy tends to keep the truck filled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:30 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; Having found nothing apart from Loy\u2019s truck, the search is called off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 13-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nColumbia Basin Dive Rescue continues to send out search teams over the course of the week. Friends, family members, and other community members conduct separate searches between Richland and West Richland. None of the groups find anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Captain Mike Cobb of the Richland police department is able to track Loy\u2019s cell phone location on the day he went missing and discovers that he may have gone as far as Pendleton, Oregon before returning to Richland. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe know the technology was there, but we don\u2019t know that the person was there,\u201d Cobb points out. Police do not know exactly when the cell phone signals came from different areas, but suspect that the phone had died by 4 p.m., when Luu called and got Loy\u2019s voicemail. If the phone was still on, it is possible that Loy did not or could not pick it up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police  follow up with Luu almost weekly as they continue their investigation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, August 20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAn update to the \u201cJustice for Loy\u201d Facebook page notes that at the time of his disappearance, Loy was wearing a thick, flat, 24-karat gold chain. The family estimates that the chain and charm, a likeness of a Buddhist monk, is worth roughly $3,200. The post asks that people keep an eye out for this piece at local jewelry or pawn shops in the Tri-Cities, Seattle, or Tacoma areas - especially the \u201cLittle Saigon\u201d section of the International District. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, September 21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nRichland detectives, aided by the Department of Homeland Security, search the areas between Coffin Road and the Columbia River just off I-82 by helicopter flyover, but find nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Present day:&lt;/strong&gt;\nInitially, the family hoped to find Loy unharmed. As Loy has now been missing for over six months without medication for his diabetes, they now believe that he is likely deceased. Still, the family is hoping for some closure and has used their Facebook page to urge anyone with information to come forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=\"http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/article96806062.html\"&gt;Tri-City Herald 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/article95399027.html\"&gt;Tri-City Herald 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/crime/article103340392.html\"&gt;Tri-City Herald 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.yaktrinews.com/news/new-details-search-missing-west-richland-man/362062674\"&gt;YakTri News&lt;/a&gt;, and the Justice for Loy FB page (not linked due to Reddit rules, obvs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got obsessed with this case right at its beginning, as it\u2019s local to me and I had seen Loy around the Uptown prior to his disappearance without knowing who he was.
