So... with that said, here we go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between 1994 - 2003, musician Elliott Smith released a plethora of music (both as solo artist and with his band, Heatmiser) for indie labels Kill Rock Stars/Caroline Records. He would eventually catch the attention of filmmaker Gus Van Sant and Dreamworks, lending his soundtrack contributions to films like Good Will Hunting and Wes Anderson&amp;#39;s The Royal Tenenbaums. In addition to his work on film scores, he also released two albums (XO and Figure 8) on the Dreamworks imprint around this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite an Oscar nomination for his work on Good Will Hunting and subsequent performance at the event in 1998, the general public seemed to remain largely unaware of Elliott. To this day, he is still viewed as an artist who enjoys a cult following. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A multi-instrumentalist with a knack for melody and &amp;quot;spider web thin&amp;quot; vocal delivery, Elliott&amp;#39;s personal and often melancholy lyrics dealt with topics that included drug addiction and loss. This lead to him being dubbed a &amp;quot;sad sack&amp;quot; by the media, with people comparing him to the likes of Nick Drake and Kurt Cobain. So, when news of his suicide broke on October 21st, 2003, to many, it was no surprise. However, a bizarre coroners report and odd behavior on his girlfriends behalf has left many wondering &amp;quot;was it really suicide?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suicide or Homicide?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the year or so leading up to his death, Smith&amp;#39;s output and physical/mental health had begun to wane. He was reportedly smoking up to $1500 worth of heroin and crack a day, exhibiting signs of paranoia (he believed Dreamworks executives were following him in a white van), and after a particularly disastrous set opening for Wilco on May 2nd, 2002, one reporter claimed &amp;quot;it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith winds up dead within a year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, by the start of 2003 Smith had taken part in a rehabilitation program and was attempting to re-establish himself as an artist. After his 34th birthday, he even made the decision to give up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, sugar, and his psych meds. Work on his latest album was well underway, and he was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On September 19th, 2003, a healthy looking and seemingly happy (a &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/GozVtCixIO0\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; has recently surfaced on Youtube) Smith played a free show at the University of Utah as part of Redfest. It would be his last. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 21st, 2003&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elliott and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba are arguing. Chiba locks herself in the bathroom to take a shower when suddenly, she hears a scream. Upon opening the door, she sees Smith standing there with a knife in his chest. Chiba pulls the knife out and immediately calls 911. Left behind on a post-it note are the words &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry - love, Elliott. God forgive me.&amp;quot; Smith is later pronounced dead at the hopsital at 1:36 p.m. He was 34 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it was originally reported to be a suicide, the autopsy report has left open the possibility of homicide. There were no traces of illegal substances or alcohol in Smith&amp;#39;s system, but prescribed levels of Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and Amphetamines were found. What makes this report interesting, however, is the fact that there were &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt; hesitation wounds. The coroner &lt;strong&gt;DOES&lt;/strong&gt; list &amp;quot;possible defense wounds&amp;quot; on Smith&amp;#39;s hands, but never really gives specifics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting is the fact that, less than a year after his death, Chiba went on to file a lawsuit against Elliott&amp;#39;s family for 15% of his earnings. She stated that the two lived together as a husband and wife, and that he pledged to take care of her financially for the rest of her life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Two Cents&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else find it odd that they were arguing shortly beforehand, and that Chiba&amp;#39;s story flip flops between &amp;quot;taking a shower&amp;quot; and going to the bathroom and locking the door just to get away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, how convenient is it that Chiba removed the knife from Smith&amp;#39;s chest? After all, that would immediately excuse her fingerprints being on the thing. If she inserted the knife as well, it would give her all the more reason to take a shower.
