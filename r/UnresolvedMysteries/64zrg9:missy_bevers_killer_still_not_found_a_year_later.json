Revenge (Maybe she had an affair with their spouse or even an ex or maybe it was someone who she had an affair with years ago and called it off and they figure if they can't have her then no one will).\n\n3. To get her out of the way (The killer may have had a relationship with her husband and wanted the victim out of the way so they could eventually have that relationship again). \n\n4. Or it could also be someone who went to her church and became infatuated with her, stalked her and then killed her.\n\nThe first one (A hit) and the last one (An infatuated stalker) are the least likely scenarios. \n\nIf it was a hit, then it was one of the sloppiest yet cleanest hits in history.  A professional hit man isn't generally concerned about making someone suffer, they'd have just broken into the church, shot her a couple times, and then left. Professional hit men don't generally worry about making their victim suffer, they kill them, collect the other half of the money owed to them and disappear. This killer wanted her to suffer. From the autopsy reports, it says that she died from punctures to her head and chest, meaning the killer most likely hit her with the claw of the hammer. That alone says plenty... As the killer probably could have repeatedly struck her in the skull with the front of the hammer and crushed her skull, but they chose as method that would have probably inflicted more pain and taken a little bit longer to have killed her, meaning this person was very angry with the victim for something.\n\nIn the case of a stalker, if a stalker resorts to killing the person they're stalking, then there is usually a documented history of the stalker stalking the victim, and it gradually leads up to them killing the victim, and I haven't seen anything about her being stalked in the distant past or in the months leading up to her murder.\n\nWhich makes me believe it's most likely a woman whose spouse or maybe even their former spouse had an affair with Missy Bevers in the past.  This could have been someone who caught their spouse having an affair with her and then called things off or maybe they even stayed together afterwards and broke up several months before she was murdered and then they blamed the breakup on her.

I don't think the killer wore it because they had some secret desire to be a cop, they wore it because they knew it would hide their identity, and that if someone drove by and saw a person in a police uniform walking outside the church, then chances are they would think it was in fact a real cop roaming outside the church and probably wouldn't bother calling it in. However if someone saw someone with ski mask walking around outside the church, then chances are they'll find it suspicious and call it in. Not only that, but it very likely could have temporarily confused the victim when she saw it (If she even did) and the helmet and padding likely provided protection and padding should she have been able to have fought back.  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492086440.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen people make post with the theory that the killer was walking around playing dress up like they were a police officer and that seems to be the absolute furthest thing from what most likely happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, people who want to be cops or who failed out of the police academy don&amp;#39;t go walking around breaking into churches and pretending that they&amp;#39;re a cop.

So whoever did it had to have some personal vendetta against her and that can only be for a few things...\n\n1. Money problems (They had a business together and felt they were screwed over financially by the victim).\n\n2. They thought the victim was sleeping with their spouse.\n\n3. The murderer was having an affair with the victims husband and murdered her to get her out of the way.\n\n4. The murderer had been in a relationship with her and she called it off and they killed her with the mentality that if they can't have her no one will.\n\n5. Or they were a church member who had become infatuated with her which led to them stalking and killing her.\n\nI honestly can't think of any other scenario as to why someone would go to the lengths that this murderer did. I mean this wasn't some spur of the moment murder where they just happened to randomly have the opportunity to kill her, this person had to have planned this out well in advance, buy the outfit they wore, wait for a night when it was raining so that she would have to go inside the church, and then go there and carry out the murder.\n\nI don't know the layout of the church or exactly how they carried out the murder, whether they came up from behind her and surprised her or what, but the victim was in very good shape so I'd imagine that she had to have either been cornered or taken by surprise, otherwise she would have been able to run away.\n\nThe police estimated that the killer was anywhere between 5'2 to 5'7 based off of the video footage, meaning they weren't that big of a person and most likely could have been fought off by the victim, but again, they may have taken her by surprise and I'd imagine their outfit with the helmet and all may have helped them should she have struggled against them during the murder.\n\nIt seems that the method of how they chose to kill her was a very personal way of doing it, the autopsy report says that she died of puncture wounds to the skull and chest, so it appears that the killer hit her with the back of the hammer, it's like they wanted to make her suffer. Maybe the person who killed her chose to not use a gun because they didn't own one or didn't know how to use one, but it just seems like they intentionally chose a very brutal way of killing someone. \n\nWhoever the killer is, most definitely did their homework and showed a great deal of patience, they had to know Missy Bevers routine fairly well, what time she showed up to set up her fitness camp and they also had to know that when it rained outside that she set up the camp inside the church. Not only that, but the killer also had to know what doors the victim would be coming in and where she'd go once she got in the building and where they could hide to catch her by surprise and murder her. \n\nI think they walked with a limp to either make it seem like they were older than they were or because they had done their homework well enough that they knew her father-in-law was a similar height and would be an instant suspect since he walked similarly to how they walked in the video. The one thing the killer wouldn't know is that on a day it was raining, which is a day they probably patiently waited for, as it would give them the perfect opportunity to break in and kill her since she would then have to set up her fitness class inside the church, the victims father would be in a completely different state on a business trip, and that he'd have both witnesses and cell phone records to prove it. If that hadn't have happened, he could very well be sitting in a jail today.\n\nIn regards to the mysterious car pulling into the SWFA Outdoors store...\n\nWhile the police are saying they don't believe that the car at the gun store was connected to the murder, I think anyone with common sense knows that it is in fact connected. If you watch the video you can see that the car turns in coming from the direction of the church and then immediately shuts their lights off. They then drive around the parking lot to make sure no one is there, and once they realize no one is in the parking lot, they park under a light with their headlights off for several minutes. \n\nI think they were doing one of two things while in the parking lot, and that is they either went to the church and broke in and then drove over to the parking lot just in case there was a silent alarm and waited to see if security or cops came, which they would have clearly been able to see from where they were parked, or they were putting on layers of clothing or perhaps their mask and making final preperations for the murder. It's also worth noting that they very well could have been doing both. \n\nWhen the car left the SWFA Outdoors parking lot, it went in the opposite direction of the church, which would make it seem like they were not going towards the church, but if you look at Google Maps, you'll notice that you can't just cross the highway and turn back towards the church as there is a grass median stopping you from doing that, but the car could have easily gone just slightly up the road in the direction they turned in and then turned their car around about 1000 ft up the road and gone back in the direction of the church and that's exactly what I believe happened. \n\nOther things to look for... Is that at the 6:56 point of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgRoqhoIxnY when they're driving off it looks like they're either maybe adjusting their seat which was pulled very far back or maybe they're leaned forward adjusting their shirt, but you can see what appears to be white letters on the back of their shirt, which are very similar to the ones the killer wore which said \"POLICE\".
