Chantelle was fairly younger than her partner, and they first met when she was just 16 years old, which was half of his age at the time. Eight years later, their daughter Leela was born. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chantelle, Leela and Simon moved to Nannup, a town with a population of 503 people, in 2004. They lived with their friend, Tony Popic. Locals in Nannup described Chantelle as being very involved in the community--she worked as a swimming instructor, and also sold makeup and clothes. Tony worked at the local hardware store, and was described as a diligent employee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simon Kadwill, however, did not work and spent most of his time indoors. Locals in Nannup described him as eccentric and odd. When a nearby power pole with a transformer was installed, Kadwill reportedly became very concerned about potential electromagnetic waves targeting Leela and himself. He even reportedly broke out in hives over this news, and buried magnets in his garden in an attempt to ward off the waves. Tony was later seen trying to dig up the magnets with Simon yelling at him. As well as this, Simon was reported to have exerted a lot of control over Chantelle, who acted in a submissive manner towards him. Despite this, no incidents of domestic abuse were ever reported to the police.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Disappearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In July of 2007, Chantelle called her parents and explained that Simon had left for Brazil, and the family were going to follow suit.  This was the last time they heard from their daughter. The same day, Chantelle sold her car and her dogs. This was the last time her bank account was touched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Chantelle, Leela, Simon and Tony were reported missing. A note addressed to Chantelle&amp;#39;s parents was found on their property. It explained that they had moved overseas to Brazil due to the electromagnetic interference caused by the power poles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police would find no evidence showing that the family ever left the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Religious Cult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst investigating the disappearance, police discovered a dark secret about Simon Kadwill. He had started his own online doomsday cult called &lt;a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/missing-briton-may-be-conman/news-story/b12f7917494ba553b8fb24ab272e8898?nk=3efbca381ca3e313025b2aca4d9cce5a-1491975767\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servers of the Divine Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he detailed how followers could prepare themselves as the world would head into a &amp;quot;Great Transition&amp;#39;&amp;#39; from darkness into light. The website detailed that this would signify the birth of a new world of higher consciousness following the end of a 75,000-year cycle. Kadwill had also published a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Servers-Divine-Plan/dp/1889280305\"&gt;book under the same name&lt;/a&gt;, which was withdrawn from publication after the family&amp;#39;s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kadwill&amp;#39;s last entry was published in June 2007. In it, he stated, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m exhausted and the only option left is to leave this world.&amp;quot; He had previously talked about wishing to leave this earth with his family. He also told one of his followers that he was considering killing himself, his wife and his daughter with the drug Nembutal. However, realising that the death of his daughter would be charged as murder, he changed his plan and instead considered living in isolation with his family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gary Feltham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police also uncovered another dark secret about Simon Kadwill.

He had stolen the identity of a British colleague, and had falsified identification to support this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chantelle had apparently never known that her partner was not the man he claimed to be. It was also alleged that he had a great degree of control over the occupants of his house, and that he was manipulative and very persuasive. &lt;a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/spycatcher/201208/dangerous-cult-leaders\"&gt;This is a common characteristic of cult leaders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The man on the train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several days after Chantelle&amp;#39;s last phone call to her parents, &lt;a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-13/police-say-new-lead-on-disappearance-of-family/4884546\"&gt;a man using Tony Popic&amp;#39;s ID and carrying his mobile phone boarded a train from Bunbury to Perth&lt;/a&gt;.
