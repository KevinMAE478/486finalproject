Josh had an airtight alibi. IBM has a very secure corporate campus and he was working during the time of the murder. The TV serviceman was cleared due to the confirmation he had just arrived to the scene based on his work schedule for the day. Josh moved away from Rochester after the murder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rochester police worked with the FBI to create a potential suspect profile. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s safe to assume the attacker was a single male who likely blends into residential neighborhoods easily without raising suspicion... the offender was comfortable being in a strangers home uninvited... [indicating] he likely had burgled or stolen property from other homes&amp;quot;. Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Investigations and Rochester police have interviewed hundreds of people during the course of the investigation, however there are a number of individuals they have never been able to fully eliminate. This includes &amp;quot;one strong suspect&amp;quot; who is currently serving time for another crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DNA evidence has been collected by investigators, but they fail to specify what was found or where it was found. There has been no match so far. The fire, however, destroyed a lot of potential evidence that could help investigators solve the case.

Someone followed her during her drive from campus to her home. Is it unlikely that a random stranger followed her all the way home to kill her? Maybe. But female college students have been targeted before. The RCTC parking lot is also quite large (I believe there are 3 separate lots) and mostly unsecured \u2013 I took PSEO classes there from 2012-14 and even at that point there were times where I was uncomfortable walking to my car alone in the middle of the day. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The killer was &amp;quot;just passing through the neighborhood&amp;quot;. This is the &amp;#39;theory&amp;#39; I hate the most, but is one still employed by the Rochester PD as a possibility.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The killer knew April. Again, a theory I don&amp;#39;t like as much because as far as I can find, everyone that knew April loved her. However, we never truly know what happens behind closed doors. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It is also possible a single young man out there was obsessed with April. Someone in her neighborhood, at her job or in her classes that had unsuccessful attempts to win her affections. This, however, is just pure speculation on my part, there is no evidence to show that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; someone was obsessed with her, that anyone(April, her husband, RPD) knew about it. But, if someone was obsessed with her, April had a relatively set schedule as most college students do. And supposedly people in the neighborhood believed there was a &amp;quot;squatter&amp;quot; in the abandoned house across the street. I cannot however find any hard evidence to back up that there was an abandoned house in the neighborhood though because most of the histories listed online only go back as far as 2011 and are not very detailed. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am uncomfortable with the fact that the Rochester PD is not subjecting us with the knowledge of what DNA evidence they found at the scene. I don&amp;#39;t know an awful lot about police work, but I cannot seem to think of a valid reason why that information would be kept from the public. Also, could DNA technology improve enough to prove without a reasonable doubt who April&amp;#39;s killer is? Hard to say, especially when we don&amp;#39;t know what that evidence may be, but it is curious that RPD believe this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same with the strong suspect who is currently serving time (I&amp;#39;m going to refer to as &amp;#39;them&amp;#39; since there is no indication if they are male or female). They are already in the clink, but can the RPD not still investigate into them? RPD does still look into April&amp;#39;s case and still receives tips on it, why would RPD not look into their strong suspect, regardless of whether or not they were in jail? (Again, I don&amp;#39;t know enough about policing to know whether or not this is a possibility because of the fact that they are serving jail time)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on April&amp;#39;s murder?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sources&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.postbulletin.com/news/crime/officials-remind-public-of-unsolved-sorensen-murder/article_d31414cb-502c-5884-82e1-f5b53903c246.html\"&gt;x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/cold-case-spotlight/10-years-later-officials-are-still-investigating-small-town-s-n742426\"&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "April Jean Sorensen (nee.
