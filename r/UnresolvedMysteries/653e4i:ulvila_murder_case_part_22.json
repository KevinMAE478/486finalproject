Let&amp;#39;s dive right in where we left, this is going to be one hell of a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August 2011 after Auer was released, she was eager to meet her children again, and wanted to start building a relationship with them. The youngest didn&amp;#39;t even think of her as their mother any longer, only as an &amp;quot;aunt&amp;quot; they sometimes visited in the prison. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tried to call her brother who was acting as a foster parent to the children, but could not get in touch. She tried to contact the social services, but they would not answer either. She could only meet the oldest daughter, who was no longer living with the rest of the kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer&amp;#39;s brother, Ari Auer, had taken the kids in his care to a yacht he had bought with the money he was given as a compensation for taking in three kids. The ammount was reported to be about 8000 euros (8 533 USD) a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the yacht the children started to tell stories which Ari Auer videotaped. The children, mainly the oldest son, told his foster father that he had been awake during the murder of his father and he had heard how his mother killed Lahti. According to him Anneli Auer had together with her oldest daughter planned the murder and practiced it before actually doing it. Auer and the daughter had build a wooden shield that she had used to cover herself from the blood splatter. The actual killing had taken place before the emergency phone call. Auer and her daughter had recorded the sounds of Lahti dying and played it back during the phone call to make an illusion that Lahti was still alive. The boy had heard all this through his bedroom door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the tapes, when the foster parents asked the children to tell more, they started to talk about how they had been abused by Auer and the oldest daughter. How Auer used to hit them, tie their legs together and drag them by their hair up and down the staircase in their home. How she would punish the children by locking them outside in the middle of the winter with nothing but their underwear on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer had also been so happy about the death of his husband, that they would throw a deathparty every 1st of december, where they would play with Lahti&amp;#39;s ashes, sometimes cut themselves or the middle daughter and draw satanic pictures with the blood. Sometimes they would sacrifice mice, parrots and even cats for the glory of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty wild, huh? Well, it got wilder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason the kids brought up a man named Jens Kukka, who Auer had dated for a while. According the youngest children Auer, Kukka and the oldest daughter were having group sex and made the children watch. Sometimes Kukka would anal rape the younger children too. Kukka&amp;#39;s teenage brothers would watch. Kukka would also sometimes molest other children in the neighborhood too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The children told that Kukka had bought them sex toys. Apparently the oldest daughter (11 at the time) was willingly using them on herself and on the younger children. Sometimes Anneli and the oldest daughter would dance in the back yard naked except for madeshift devilhorns on their head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ari Auer took the tape to the prosecutor and demanded that they investigate it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, the prosecutor agreed that this was reasonable enough to open the case once again. They decided to split the case: one prosecutor for the murder investigation, other to the sexual abuse investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First they examined the emergency call recording again. Now the forensic team agreed with the boy, you could obviouslt hear from the tape that it was tampered with. They decided to send the tape abroad to the FBI, maybe they could with their superior equipment find out more about the tampering. The FBI returned the tape, apparently they had found nothing to support this theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The case went to the court again, and in December 2013 Auer was again convicted to a life sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sexual abuse case meanwhile was handled by a different prosecutor. Someone leaked to the press that they had video evidence of the abuse. No such video ever existed, but the police said they found suspicious pictures on Auer&amp;#39;s computer. These pictures were normal family pictures of Auer and the children, though in some of them they were in their swimsuits. On the same computer the police found pornographic pictures of adult women, but because they were uploaded on the computer around the same time, the prosecutor argued that this was a sign of something sinister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they questioned the outsiders mentioned in the children&amp;#39;s tales, no one knew anything. The neighbour&amp;#39;s children denied ever being alone with Kukka. Kukka&amp;#39;s teenage sons knew nothing about the sex shows they had presumably watched and were really confused about the questions. The oldest daughter denies everything the younger kids say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor&amp;#39;s medical expert, a pediatrican, testified in court that she had found the cut marks on the childrens skin using UV-light to reveal old scars. On naked eye you could not see anything, but with this light you could make out cross-shaped scars on the children&amp;#39;s shoulders. Same kind of scars were now also found on Lahti&amp;#39;s body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer was found Guilty of two accounts of felonious rape and three accounts of felonious sexual abuse of children. She was given 7 year prison sentence. Her ex was also found guilty and he was given 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The court argued that while some of the stories the children told are obviously made up, there is enough truth in them to convict to people. No matter that originally right after Lahti was murdered the children had described their relationship with their mother close. Or that Seppo M\u00e4kel\u00e4, the undercover lover, was around when the abuse was supposedly happened, but still he described in his reports that he thinks Auer is a good mother and that the children are happy and loved in their home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2015 the court of appeal declared Auer not guilty of the murder for the last time, but the sexual abuse sentence still stands. Auer was released on parole in June 2015. She has not seen her youngest children in years, but the oldest daughter is in contact with her mother. The daughter has not changed her story ever during this bizarre tale and she says that her mother is innocent, there was an intruder in their house and that she or any of the other children were never abused by their mother or by anyone else either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police has not opened the old lines of investigation for finding the murderer of Jukka S. Lahti. I would like to know more about the police Lahti talked with in November 2006 before his murder. Or about &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/64vqav/ulvila_murder_case_part_12/dg62nbj/\"&gt;the old friend&lt;/a&gt; who died almost exactly 24 hours after Lahti was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or about one man who was fired from the factory where Lahti worked, and who during the investigation said that Lahti was not a nice person. This man had cuts and wounds in his arms and hands in December 2006, around the time Lahti was killed. The same man had anger issues and had threaten another man who he hold a grudge shortly before Lahti was killed. He lived in the same neighborhood, and his only alibi is his girlfriend/wife who says that she would have woken up if the man had left during the night. This man was also neighbor (and friend?) to detective Santaoja, who was adamant to suspect Auer and would not consider any other suspects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the links are the same as part 1, but I added some newspaper links I found in english and one picture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulvila_murder_case\"&gt;English Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://anneliauer.com/about/\"&gt;anneliauer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GdOmCnFdxA\"&gt;Documentary&lt;/a&gt; in Finnish, but with English subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/13667-anneli-auer-cleared-of-murder-charges-after-six-years.html\"&gt;Anneli Auer cleared of murder&lt;/a&gt; by english newspaper Helsinki Times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/6833-auer-s-sex-crime-sentence-extended-2.html\"&gt;Auer&amp;#39;s sex crime sentence extended&lt;/a&gt; by Helsinki Times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://babylon.naurunappula.com/200x200/32/0c/320c0812f5393ff7/0/912739.jpg\"&gt;Satanic tattoo design&lt;/a&gt; according to the prosecution.
