The more I learn about it, the weirder it gets. Buckle up for the most famous unsolved murder mystery from Finland, folks! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jukka Sakari Lahti was 51-years-old when he was killed in his own home at the night of December the 1st 2006. His wife, Anneli Orvokki Auer, called the emergency number and told the responder about an intruder who had assaulted her husband. There&amp;#39;s a recording of the call and on the backround you can hear Lahti&amp;#39;s screams as he is dying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2009 the investigating police in charge was changed and Anneli Auer became the prime suspect. She was charged in the same year. This case has been in and out of court numerous times, the most reasent decission was from December 2015 and the verdict was Not Guilty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer&amp;#39;s version is that after Jukka Lahti had come home that night at about 11pm the family went to bed. At 2:41 they woke up when an unknown intruder broke the glass window of their terrace door that was by their bed in their bedroom. Auer says that they didn&amp;#39;t realise at forst what was happening, and Jukka Lahti took two logs of wood from next to the fireplace to defend himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intruder attacked Lahti, and Auer went to help her husband. She had not realised that the intruder was armed with a knife before he stabbed her in the side of her chest. She realised that the man was a killer so she run to wake up the four children who were in the house. She opened the front door and told the children to run outside. Only the oldest daughter (9-years-old at the time) woke up and she did not leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer did not have a mobile phone at the time, so she went to the kitchen to call the emergency number from their landline. During the phone call the emergency operator left her on hold for while she alerted the police of the situation. During that time Auer gave the phone to her oldest daughter to leave to help her husband, who was begging for help in the bedroom. The killer tried to attack her again, and again she ran away and went back to the phone. She was gone for 59 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the oldest daughter looked to the bedroom, she saw the man climbing out of the window. She also saw her dad laying on the floor, covered in blood. She screamed, and the scream can be heard on the taped emergency call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jukka Lahti was pronounced dead on the scene once the police arrived. He had been stabbed 81 times with a knife that was found on the scene. However, the cause of death was blunt-force trauma to his face. The murder weapon has not been found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the initial investigation the police believed that the murderer was an outsider, maybe someone who held a crudge against Jukka Lahti. Lahti had worked in HR to a local factory that had laid off many workers in the past month. Lahti&amp;#39;s friends and family told the police that he had told them that someone had made threats to him, but they didn&amp;#39;t know who. Also it was later found that a few days before his death Jukka Lahti had called a different police precinct three times, but no one at the station remembered to have spoken with him, even though the phone records clearly show that he had talked with someone at the station and someone had searched the police database with his name during the call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police said that they had leads on the case. They were asking for public&amp;#39;s help to find a red Volvo that had been seen in the area around the week before the murder. They said they had the murderer&amp;#39;s voice on tape and that they had found DNA-traces on the scene. They tested over 700 samples, but found no mach during the investigation. In 2013 it was revealed that the DNA in question was contaminated and belonged to a forensic investigator. However, the investigator in question was not assigned to Lahti&amp;#39;s case, and no one seems to know when and how he came in contact of the DNA sample.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2007 the police arrested a local actor as a suspect, but he was released 7 days later. After this, the lead police inspector Juha Joutsenlahti suggested that the case should be transfered to the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, but the National Police Commissioner refused and the lead investigator was changed to Detective Chief Inspector Pauli Kuusiranta. Auer became the main suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2009 Auer met a man who said his name was Seppo M\u00e4kel\u00e4. They started to date. Seppo met Auer&amp;#39;s children and visited her home several times. Unbeknownst to Auer, Seppo was undercover cop whose mission was to determin what had REALLY happened in the night of the murder and if Auer had anything to do with it. Seppo disappeared as soon as he had appeared in Auer&amp;#39;s life. Auer has said that she had fallen in love a little bit and that the kids had liked Seppo a lot too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer found out about Seppo&amp;#39;s true intentions only during the trial and demanded the police to give her any records and data Seppo had gathered. The police refused, because according to them Seppo had not found anything relating Auer to the murder. Auer&amp;#39;s defence attorney said that this in itself was evidence supporting Auer&amp;#39;s innocence. Finally the supreme court ordered the police to give the records to the defence. Mysteriously some material that should have been in the police records had vanished. Some of it reappeared during the trial, when convinient to the prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer was arrested in 28th of September 2009. Two days later the police informed the media that she had confessed. Auer has later denied any confession and claimed that she was manipulated by the police. She said she hadn&amp;#39;t been sleeping in three nights, that the police had lied to her saying that her children had told them that there was no one else in the house at the time. The police had said that if they can come in some sort of agreement of what could have happened in the night of the murder, Auer could see her kids again. The police records of the confession and interrogation that led to it are missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prosecution had other evidence. They claimed that Auer had staged the crime scene, that Auer had attacked Lahti after a domestic dispute and stabbed him. According to the prosecution Auer had thought she had killed Lahti and went to the phone. During the phone call Lahti woke up and started to scream, so Auer had to leave the phone to finish the job. They said that they can hear Auer cursing and screaming &amp;quot;-ole&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;-uole&amp;quot; on the tape. (&amp;quot;Kuole&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;die!&amp;quot; in Finnish.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In November 2010 Anneli Auer was declared Guilty of Murder of Jukka S. Lahti. She was given a life sentence. The three judges on the case voted against her 2-1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auer&amp;#39;s four children were given to Auer&amp;#39;s brother and his wife. Soon they began having trouble with the oldest daughter and she was later transfered to Child Welfare Services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011 Auer&amp;#39;s case went to the court of appeal, and in July 2011 the judges declared Auer Not Guilty unanimously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy ending? Nope! There&amp;#39;s more to come in a bizarre twist worth of any crime fiction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give you sources in English in part 2, but here are some pictures of the case.
