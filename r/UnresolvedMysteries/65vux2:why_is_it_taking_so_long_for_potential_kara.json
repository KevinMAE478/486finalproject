It is relatively expensive to test DNA in a case like this because the results of the testing may end up being used in a criminal case, so the level of care required when receiving, prepping the lab, testing, and storing the samples/articles of evidence, returning evidence materials to the investigating authorities, and storing the results, is especially high. Compare that to the simplicity of collecting reference samples from relatives of missing persons where the test result need only serve as a reference sample. They probably have only mitochondrial DNA to test in this case, which takes longer as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they are close to having enough to charge that guy with the murders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dge2121", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489257.0, "created_utc": 1492460457.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vux2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vux2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vux2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vux2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8igv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "missxfebruary", "parent_id": "t1_dge87n7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't tell my husband, but DVR-ing reruns of that and Unsolved Mysteries are the main reasons I got excited when he started working for a cable company and we got it for free :P", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t tell my husband, but DVR-ing reruns of that and Unsolved Mysteries are the main reasons I got excited when he started working for a cable company and we got it for free :P&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dge8igv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497003.0, "created_utc": 1492468203.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge87n7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "runshadowfax", "parent_id": "t1_dge5uar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I miss the days when Disappeared was on Netflix!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I miss the days when Disappeared was on Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dge87n7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496617.0, "created_utc": 1492467817.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge5uar", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "missxfebruary", "parent_id": "t1_dge4q9i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know, I haven't gotten into podcasts, I would like to though!
