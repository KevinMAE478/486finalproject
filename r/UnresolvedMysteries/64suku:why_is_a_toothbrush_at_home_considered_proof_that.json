You see it with bigger things, too, like Stephen Koecher's Christmas presents (for the record, I don't really have an opinion about what happened to him--I just think it's foolish to dismiss the possibility of suicide because he'd bought some Christmas presents for people), but that door locking thing was a very clear example, especially since it's such an autopilot thing for most people. I mean, I've gotten out of my car and thought to myself, \"Don't lock the doors, you need to come back for the groceries,\" and then locked my doors two seconds later.

It&amp;#39;s a neutral item that everyone understands is pretty essential to everyday life (if you have a reasonable standard of hygiene, anyway). Whereas if you say something like &amp;quot;she didn&amp;#39;t pack her makeup,&amp;quot; even if she was the type of woman who wouldn&amp;#39;t be caught dead outside without makeup, you&amp;#39;d have a lot of people making other assumptions, like men who don&amp;#39;t quite get that a lot of women wear makeup daily even if they&amp;#39;re not working or attending special events, etc. Plus you&amp;#39;d have to explain whether that was normal for her, etc. since there are a lot of women who &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; wear makeup that often. Although I guess that&amp;#39;s the same problem we&amp;#39;re running into with toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the thing that I see a lot in this sub, I see a lot of over-analyzing of actions a possible suicide victim takes. Like if they drove to the site, whether they locked their car doors and took the key or not. I remember reading one thread where there were a bunch of people arguing that a guy who had been acting erratically, didn&amp;#39;t show up to work, and instead drove off to an area known for suicides, probably didn&amp;#39;t kill himself because locking his doors showed he meant to come back. You see it with bigger things, too, like Stephen Koecher&amp;#39;s Christmas presents (for the record, I don&amp;#39;t really have an opinion about what happened to him--I just think it&amp;#39;s foolish to dismiss the possibility of suicide because he&amp;#39;d bought some Christmas presents for people), but that door locking thing was a very clear example, especially since it&amp;#39;s such an autopilot thing for most people. I mean, I&amp;#39;ve gotten out of my car and thought to myself, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t lock the doors, you need to come back for the groceries,&amp;quot; and then locked my doors two seconds later.
