But the timing for the first death doesn&amp;#39;t seem right for that -- having it happen at night instead of when the parking lot would presumably be its most crowded and visible seems strange when I generally associate that way of dying with somebody who wants to make a statement. The fact that one woman was &lt;em&gt;in the trunk&lt;/em&gt; while the other was in the car itself strikes me as odd -- more like a murder-suicide to me, in which case the method of dying wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be a public statement as much as a &amp;quot;we both go together&amp;quot;-type thing. The one in the main interior of the car might have only initially intended to burn the car with the other woman in it, even -- unless there&amp;#39;s other evidence that more substantially points to a double suicide that police aren&amp;#39;t sharing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dg6dfug", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492052887.0, "created_utc": 1492024087.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg63oyo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DanOfBradford78", "parent_id": "t3_64ysf4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've got to think that suicide by Immolation must be a very unpopular way to end your life.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got to think that suicide by Immolation must be a very unpopular way to end your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dg63oyo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042907.0, "created_utc": 1492014107.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ysf4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fpwn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CarrieMe", "parent_id": "t3_64ysf4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Plus the car fire in New Jersey, 39 miles away, in March. \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/pix11.com/2017/03/20/2-bodies-found-murdered-in-car-set-on-fire-linked-to-rhonj-star-kim-depaola/amp/\nWeird.", "edited": 1492026696.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus the car fire in New Jersey, 39 miles away, in March. \n&lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/pix11.com/2017/03/20/2-bodies-found-murdered-in-car-set-on-fire-linked-to-rhonj-star-kim-depaola/amp/\"&gt;https://www.google.com/amp/pix11.com/2017/03/20/2-bodies-found-murdered-in-car-set-on-fire-linked-to-rhonj-star-kim-depaola/amp/&lt;/a&gt;\nWeird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dg6fpwn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055228.0, "created_utc": 1492026428.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ysf4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ysf4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ysf4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ysf4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8lt23", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pink1Martini", "parent_id": "t1_dg79p4h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Actually I didn't even think of that!
