At 3am, Ben and his girlfriend left the nightclub and Daniel stayed back, chatting to a woman for half an hour.

There were approximately 30 other commuters on the train, including three females he had gone to school with. On the train Daniel told two of the girls: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m partied out ... I&amp;#39;m going home to crash.&amp;quot; The girls left the train and Daniel waved them goodbye.
