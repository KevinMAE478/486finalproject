She disappeared from inside her father's home on the night of December 16th, 2011. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAyla's mother, Trista Reynolds, had kicked a heroin addiction shortly before she got pregnant with her\u2026 but, a few months after Ayla's first birthday she began using again. It didn't take her long to realize she needed to get clean for Ayla, so she enrolled in a 10 day detox program and left Ayla with her aunt (Trista's sister). When Ayla's paternal grandmother got wind that Trista was in rehab she and her son petitioned for custody and Ayla was quickly placed in their custody. When Trista found out that social services had taken Ayla from her sister she immediately checked out of detox, but, because of Trista's drug problem Justin was given full custody.\u2026 Ayla didn't make it to see her 2nd birthday. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDuring an interview with Crime Watch Daily Trista said that soon after she lost custody Ayla started showing up to visitation with strange injuries that had suspicious explanations. She talked about one incident where Ayla had come over with large buises all up and down her legs, Justin told her a big kid kicked her in the ball pit at Chuck-E-Cheese's\u2026 she says that location didn't even have a ball pit. That wasn't even the worst excuse Justin came up with... \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust a few weeks before Ayla disappeared she'd had a cast placed on her arm, she was still wearing it when she vanished. Justin said that he slipped and fell on the porch steps because it was raining, he claimed he accidentally fell on Ayla's arm. The toddler's injuries weren't constant with this story because she had a spiral fracture, indicating her arm had been twisted rather than being fallen on. Justin didn't say he grabbed her arm to keep her from falling or anything\u2026 he said he had his arms around her and fell. Those incidents resulted in a case being opened with CPS, it was active at the time of her disappearance. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOn the morning of December 16th Justin called 911 to report Ayla missing but hung up during the call, he then called back and said his phone had died. On the night Ayla went missing 3 adults were inside the home\u2026 Justin, his girlfriend, and his sister. His mother also lived in the home but I'm not sure if she was there that night because a lot of reports just name those 3. There were also two other children, each adult had one child. Supposedly, Ayla was sleeping in a room by herself, he and his girlfriend and her baby in the basement, and his sister in her own room with her child. The other two children were sleeping with their mothers. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile police found no signs of forced entry\u2026 they did find Ayla's blood and vomit in several areas of the house, in her father's car and her car seat, and on his boots. In an area by his bed they found a pool of Ayla's blood with saliva and vomit mixed in, it was the equivalent of more than one cup. They lawyered-up and refused to cooperate with the investigation\u2026 police have said they do not believe Ayla is alive. This is reinforced by that fact that this was a high profile disappearance of the small child and an age progression has never been done... that's unusual. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen Crime Watch Daily interviewed Justin's sister (surprise visit to the house\u2026 it wasn't mutually arranged) she said that Ayla was lactose intolerant and had been given regular cow's milk then started throwing up\u2026 blood. They didn't take her to the hospital or anywhere else... even though there was the same saliva/vomit/blood mixture in the car and car seat that was found in the house. Trista says Ayla wasn't lactose intolerant and drank regular formula and cow's milk. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPolice believe Ayla is a victim of child abuse resulting in death. The blood (mostly blood), saliva, and vomit mixture indicate an internal injury or injuries, the amount means it was probably serious. The pool of blood, which was hastely covered (it seems he didn't think police would really look down there or something) in Justin's basement bedroom and the small amounts of blood were also on the walls (I can't find anything saying where on the walls the blood is) and on his boots. The blood mixture was also found in Ayla's room, on her bed, on her doll, and on a pair of her house shoes. The sheet from her bed was also missing.

She disappeared from inside her father&amp;#39;s home on the night of December 16th, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ayla&amp;#39;s mother, Trista Reynolds, had kicked a heroin addiction shortly before she got pregnant with her\u2026 but, a few months after Ayla&amp;#39;s first birthday she began using again. It didn&amp;#39;t take her long to realize she needed to get clean for Ayla, so she enrolled in a 10 day detox program and left Ayla with her aunt (Trista&amp;#39;s sister). When Ayla&amp;#39;s paternal grandmother got wind that Trista was in rehab she and her son petitioned for custody and Ayla was quickly placed in their custody. When Trista found out that social services had taken Ayla from her sister she immediately checked out of detox, but, because of Trista&amp;#39;s drug problem Justin was given full custody.\u2026 Ayla didn&amp;#39;t make it to see her 2nd birthday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During an interview with Crime Watch Daily Trista said that soon after she lost custody Ayla started showing up to visitation with strange injuries that had suspicious explanations. She talked about one incident where Ayla had come over with large buises all up and down her legs, Justin told her a big kid kicked her in the ball pit at Chuck-E-Cheese&amp;#39;s\u2026 she says that location didn&amp;#39;t even have a ball pit. That wasn&amp;#39;t even the worst excuse Justin came up with... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks before Ayla disappeared she&amp;#39;d had a cast placed on her arm, she was still wearing it when she vanished. Justin said that he slipped and fell on the porch steps because it was raining, he claimed he accidentally fell on Ayla&amp;#39;s arm. The toddler&amp;#39;s injuries weren&amp;#39;t constant with this story because she had a spiral fracture, indicating her arm had been twisted rather than being fallen on. Justin didn&amp;#39;t say he grabbed her arm to keep her from falling or anything\u2026 he said he had his arms around her and fell. Those incidents resulted in a case being opened with CPS, it was active at the time of her disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the morning of December 16th Justin called 911 to report Ayla missing but hung up during the call, he then called back and said his phone had died. On the night Ayla went missing 3 adults were inside the home\u2026 Justin, his girlfriend, and his sister. His mother also lived in the home but I&amp;#39;m not sure if she was there that night because a lot of reports just name those 3. There were also two other children, each adult had one child. Supposedly, Ayla was sleeping in a room by herself, he and his girlfriend and her baby in the basement, and his sister in her own room with her child. The other two children were sleeping with their mothers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While police found no signs of forced entry\u2026 they did find Ayla&amp;#39;s blood and vomit in several areas of the house, in her father&amp;#39;s car and her car seat, and on his boots. In an area by his bed they found a pool of Ayla&amp;#39;s blood with saliva and vomit mixed in, it was the equivalent of more than one cup. They lawyered-up and refused to cooperate with the investigation\u2026 police have said they do not believe Ayla is alive. This is reinforced by that fact that this was a high profile disappearance of the small child and an age progression has never been done... that&amp;#39;s unusual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Crime Watch Daily interviewed Justin&amp;#39;s sister (surprise visit to the house\u2026 it wasn&amp;#39;t mutually arranged) she said that Ayla was lactose intolerant and had been given regular cow&amp;#39;s milk then started throwing up\u2026 blood. They didn&amp;#39;t take her to the hospital or anywhere else... even though there was the same saliva/vomit/blood mixture in the car and car seat that was found in the house. Trista says Ayla wasn&amp;#39;t lactose intolerant and drank regular formula and cow&amp;#39;s milk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police believe Ayla is a victim of child abuse resulting in death. The blood (mostly blood), saliva, and vomit mixture indicate an internal injury or injuries, the amount means it was probably serious. The pool of blood, which was hastely covered (it seems he didn&amp;#39;t think police would really look down there or something) in Justin&amp;#39;s basement bedroom and the small amounts of blood were also on the walls (I can&amp;#39;t find anything saying where on the walls the blood is) and on his boots. The blood mixture was also found in Ayla&amp;#39;s room, on her bed, on her doll, and on a pair of her house shoes. The sheet from her bed was also missing. It appears that Ayla was injured in Justin&amp;#39;s basement bedroom (pure speculation: he may have thrown her down the stairs. I&amp;#39;m not sure of the layout or the blood spatter though) and at some point put in her car seat, possibly taking her to the hospital but she died on the way, then she was brought back home and wrapped her in her bed sheet and her body was disposed of somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t prosecute because\u2026 well, a good defense lawyer could tear it to shreds.

I find it really implausible that some outside people (because the DNA indicates more than one apparently?) broke into the house undetected, with no tools or weapons, completely unprepared, and were easily able to locate everything they needed, again undetected, and killed her for no apparent reason (how are you gonna ask for a ransom when the body&amp;#39;s right there?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah I don&amp;#39;t think outside DNA on one piece of clothing can really account for everything &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the DAs colleagues evidently did not agree with or understand her decision to exonerate them.
