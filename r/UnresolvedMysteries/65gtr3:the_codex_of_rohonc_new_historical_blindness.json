Now I\u2019m launching a series of companion piece bonus episodes called \u201cBlind Spots\u201d to tie in with the full-length episodes. My first Blind Spot discusses another mysterious manuscript: the Rohonc Codex [pronounced \u02c8rohont\u0361s]. I thought I\u2019d share it with you guys too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it doesn\u2019t appear to have been carbon dated like the Voynich Manuscript yet, some scholars have narrowed down the origin of its paper, which bears a distinct watermark of a star over an anchor, to early 16th century Venice, Italy. However, as this is just provenance of the paper, and as the book itself was found in a library in the village of Rohonc in Hungary after Hungarian nobleman Guszt\u00e1v Batthy\u00e1ny donated the library to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1838, this doesn\u2019t tell us much about the authorship, contents and purpose of the book itself. An entry in the Rohonc library catalogue misidentifying it as a prayer book appears to indicate the book was in existence as far back as 1743, but there the trail goes cold.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the Voynich Manuscript, the Rohonc Codex has interested scholars because of its odd illustrations and unreadable writing. Its pictures seem to depict Christian symbols, such as crosses and crucifixion, but there also appears to be pagan and even Islamic iconography, such as suns, stars, and crescents, leading to speculation that the book hints an unusually cosmopolitan society or syncretistic religious tradition. The system of writing itself appears indecipherable, with more than 200 distinct characters, indicating it may be a code or syllabary rather than a traditional written language.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the Hungarian Academy of Sciences found it in the donated collection, they thought that its characters might be old Hungarian runes, and because it reminded them of another recent antiquarian find that had excited them\u2014the wooden book of T\u00far\u00f3c, which hinted at a richer historical heritage for Hungary than was previously known\u2014they touted the Rohonc Codex as a new and important artifact of Hungarian history and devoted much time to its study. In 1866, however, it turned out the wooden book of T\u00far\u00f3c was a forgery perpetrated by a rare antiquities dealer named S\u00e1muel Liter\u00e1ti Nemes whom, as a Magyar nationalist, wanted to artificially enrich the historical traditions of Hungary and make some money in the process. Thus, many abandoned the study of the Rohonc Codex, assuming it too was a Nemes forgery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recently, however, linguists and historians have come to believe it may not have been a forgery because there is no proof to link it to Nemes and it doesn\u2019t appear similar to his other forgeries, nor would it seem to suit his purposes.  Today there is much dispute over the manuscript.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it originate from a Christian society or from a more multicultural civilization, representing an amalgamation of religious traditions? If so, what civilization?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the system of writing used in the codex Greek, Cyrillic, or perhaps ancient Dacian or some other script?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is not a traditional written language, was it composed in a kind of constructed language, syllabary or a cipher?
