Her family hasn\u2019t seen her in almost 12 years, and they believe she is long dead, but still ache to bring her home. She left behind 2 young sons, and another preceded her in death. What happened to her is still a painful mystery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to family, Stacy was going through a bit of a rough patch. It started with a divorce, and was followed by a bitter custody battle. All that pain was escalated when her 10-year-old son was hit by a drunk driver in March of 2005. He did not survive. \nStacy\u2019s family believes it was around this time she started to get involved with drugs, and the other people who used them. She started dating Steven Bishop, an ex-offender, freshly released on parole the previous year. He had already served 5 years for aggravated assault. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since she didn\u2019t have a permanent residence, she was a bit of a transient at the time she went missing. She was known to stay a few weeks at a time with a family member, before moving over to another aunt or cousin\u2019s couch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Disappearance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On July 20th, 2005, she was visiting with her aunt in Gilbet, AZ. Her boyfriend Steven Bishop was with her. The two were last seen leaving the residence around 3 pm. They told family they were going to run a few quick errands, but promised to return shortly. They never did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that Steven and Stacy made it to an ATM, where they withdrew some cash. Afterwards, they went to a nearby dollar store, and made a purchase there. What happened after that is where things start to become obfuscated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In December 2005, 4 months after the disappearance, Stacy\u2019s car was found in an extremely desolate hill, located near Lake Pleasant, AZ. Lake Pleasant is a regional park, only about an hours drive from Gilbert. The vehicle, a maroon Subaru station wagon, was abandoned in an area that was difficult to reach, and initially, could only be \naccessed by helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When investigators searched the car, a few items of evidentiary value were discovered. Inside a few personal effects of Stacy\u2019s remained untouched, including her purse and momentous from her son\u2019s funeral. Family says they could never imagine Stacy willingly leaving these things behind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Near the vehicle, large bones and a syringe were found. The syringe could not ever be definitively linked to the missing couple or anyone else. The bones turned out to be from an animal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Stacy had another vehicle, a faded green pickup truck. This vehicle is also missing, and has never been located. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happened to Stacy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While family can not be sure what happened to Stacy, it hasn\u2019t stopped them from speculating. Suicide, or just purposely choosing to leave has crossed their minds. According to her sister and step-mom, Stacy mentioned she no longer wanted to be around, and had even written a letter once stating she was leaving and never coming back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, adding possible motivation for the disappearance, both Stacy and her boyfriend, Steven, had warrants out for their arrest. She was wanted for failure to appear in court on charges of drug possession, and endangering the life or health of a minor. Steven was wanted for failure to appear on domestic violence charge, and for violating the terms of his parole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, they do not find this to be the most-likely option, and neither do police. Stacy was heartbroken about her son\u2019s death, but no one believes it was enough so to abandon her other two children. If she were still alive, family thinks she would have at least called when the driver who killed her son was sentenced, but even that day came and went with silence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another possibility, is that Steven Bishop murdered Stacy (or the other way around) and is now on the run. But it has been so long now with no sightings of the two, police believe Steven most likely met the same fate as Stacy, whatever that may be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misguided Leads?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one of Stacy\u2019s ex-boyfriends came forward and spoke to investigators a year after her disappearance. He told them he had met up with Stacy and begged her to turn herself in, but she refused. Upon further questioning, his story suddenly changed, and he claimed that Stacy was on a hit-list, and had been murdered, although no substantiating evidence was ever found. More information about this unusual development does not seem to be forthcoming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another weird twist, a psychic investigator also contacted police, telling them he believed he saw where Stacy\u2019s body was buried. Police cadaver dogs actually hit on the area he described to them, saying that a body had once been buried there, but further excavation turned up nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think happened to Stacy Aragon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did Stacy and Steven fake their disappearance, and run off together? We know she was severely depressed, had spoken of running away, and was facing legal troubles. But, family seems to believe Stacy was way too beat-up about her son\u2019s death to leave her other two sons, or completely forget about his killer\u2019s sentencing. It is unusual for her not to have contact with her family, and 12 years is an awfully long time to stay missing in a world of people looking for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, could it be that Steven, being a violent ex-con with a history of domestic violent, murdered Stacy, and is now on the run? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lean towards possibly a drug deal gone bad. I can\u2019t find any information on why Stacy and Steven had to go to an ATM, but I also know you don\u2019t need cash to go to the dollar store. Did they meet up with someone to buy drugs and possibly got abducted and/or robbed? If the person responsible for abandoning their vehicle was a drug dealer or addict, perhaps that could explain the syringe found at the scene. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the unusual information added by the ex-boyfriend also makes me scratch my head. Whose hit-list was she on, and why? Did he really see her, and if not, what would be his motivation for lying about that? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, I also can\u2019t ignore the fact that Stacy was going through a bitter divorce and custody battle with her husband. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what are your opinions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/a/aragon_stacy.html\"&gt;http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/a/aragon_stacy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/07/16/phoenix-stacy-ann-aragon-disappearance-family-answers-10-years/30204597/\"&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/07/16/phoenix-stacy-ann-aragon-disappearance-family-answers-10-years/30204597/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Stacy Before the Disappearance**\n\nStacy Aragon is remembered for being a jovial, young mother.
