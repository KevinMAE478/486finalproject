In the past, police departments required that families wait 24 or 48 hours before they took a report. This is no longer the case. Also, in the past, police departments sometimes would only take a missing person&amp;#39;s report from the significant other or the family. We&amp;#39;ve come a long way with Amber and Silver alerts, but the most vulnerable people - the homeless, people who come from a chaotic family, the mentally ill - are sometimes never reported missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, there&amp;#39;s no international database for missing people. We have the DoeNetwork.org and NamUs.gov, but it seems like we could do more, but I don&amp;#39;t know what.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dgbn9jd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492343644.0, "created_utc": 1492314844.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jke0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jke0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jke0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge6f87", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nevershagagreek", "parent_id": "t1_dge59w4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha, fair enough!
