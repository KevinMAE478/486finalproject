It was such pure chance/luck, it's almost unbelievable.\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with him, Peter K\u00fcrten -- popularly known as \"The Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf\" for the way he used to often drink the blood of his victims as they died -- was a German serial killer who committed a series of savage murders and sexual assaults between February and November 1929 in the city of D\u00fcsseldorf. In the years prior to these assaults and murders, K\u00fcrten had amassed a lengthy criminal record for offenses including arson and attempted murder. He also confessed to the 1913 murders of a 9-year-old girl in M\u00fclheim am Rhein and a 17-year-old girl in Loscheckes. The child murderer in Fritz Lang's famous 1931 movie *M* was based, at least in part, on Peter K\u00fcrten.\n\nDescribed by Doctor Karl Berg as \"the king of the sexual perverts,\" K\u00fcrten was found guilty of nine counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder for which he was tried and sentenced to death in April of 1931.\n\nThe police initially had an extremely difficult time tracking down K\u00fcrten because they weren't even sure if his crimes could be attributed to one person, two people, or a variety of different perpetrators. This is mainly because his victims included a wide array of individuals of different ages and genders -- everyone from very young children to elderly women -- and his method of killing his victims varied, as he sometimes strangled them to death, sometimes stabbed them to death with a knife, sometimes stabbed them to death with scissors, and on many occasions he attacked and killed his victims with a hammer. (He later admitted to switching weapons so frequently simply to confuse the police and lead them to believe the crimes were being committed by different individuals. He was sexually aroused by watching his victims die, but the method he used to kill them was of no consequence to him.)\n\nOn May 14th, 1930, K\u00fcrten approached a distressed young woman in a park named Maria Budlick who was being harassed by another man. After the man who had been harassing Budlick left the scene, K\u00fcrten managed to calm her down and invited her back to his apartment at 71 Mettmanner Stra\u00dfe to eat and drink. Budlick \u2014 correctly deducing the underlying motive for K\u00fcrten's hospitality \u2014 stated that she was uninterested in having sex with him, at which point he calmly agreed to lead her to a local hotel instead. He ended up bringing her into the nearby Grafenburg Woods, where he seized her by the throat and attempted to strangle her as he raped her. When Budlick began to scream, K\u00fcrten released his grasp on her throat and eventually allowed her to leave.\n\nBudlick did not report this assault to police, but described her ordeal in detail in a letter to a friend a few days later. However, she addressed the letter incorrectly. As such, the letter was opened at the post office by a clerk on May 19th. Upon reading the contents of the letter, this clerk forwarded the letter to the D\u00fcsseldorf police. This letter was read by Chief Inspector Gennat, who deduced there was a slim chance Budlick's assailant may be the D\u00fcsseldorf murderer. Chief Inspector Gennat interviewed Budlick, who recounted her ordeal, further divulging one of the reasons K\u00fcrten had spared her was because she had falsely informed him she could not remember his address. She agreed to lead the police to K\u00fcrten's home, and led police to K\u00fcrten's Mettmanner Stra\u00dfe address. The landlady confirmed to the chief inspector the tenant's name was Peter K\u00fcrten.\n\nThe fact that K\u00fcrten was finally caught only because his final victim addressed a letter incorrectly is absolutely mind-boggling to me.

She ended up being left at the bar alone, without a ride while her \"friends\" went off with the men they just met. \n\nThe young woman, now quite upset, walked to a nearby payphone where she was last seen as it was next to a 24 hours convenience store.
