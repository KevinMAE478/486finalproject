The guy giving Pravin a ride lied to the police and said Pravin tried to rob him in an attempt to avoid a DUI. I doubt the cop knew Pravin was drunk and Pravin chose to run into the woods and he paid for that choice. Pravin&amp;#39;s autopsy was reviewed by two out of state coroners and the independent coroner runs a business where he seeks to provide closure and advocate for families and this independent coroner freely admits he never obtained access to the full autopsy report and couldn&amp;#39;t make a definitive conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dg80ktc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137992.0, "created_utc": 1492109192.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dzx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655dzx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8d252", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dallyan", "parent_id": "t1_dg7vicc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, it wouldn't be surprising.
