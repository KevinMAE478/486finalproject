Some time has passed since the last time this case was brought up and I thought it might be nice to have some fresh discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are not familiar, Tom Mahood is a former search and rescue worker based in California. He is responsible for the discovery of the death valley Germans. I am endlessly inspired by his tenacious pursuit for answers in the mysterious disappearance of Bill Ewasko (I also enjoy living vicariously through his other adventures detailed in his website: &lt;a href=\"http://www.otherhand.org\"&gt;www.otherhand.org&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To date Tom Mahood and his various associates have logged 931 GPS miles on foot searching for Bill. The most recent search was performed this month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the details of the search: &lt;a href=\"http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/search-and-rescue/searching-for-bill-ewasko/\"&gt;Caution Rabbit Hole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;This above link extensive and thoroughly exhaustive, detailing over 80 separate visits to Joshua Tree to search for Bill.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brief Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On June 24, 2010, Bill Ewasko visited Joshua Tree National Park and seemingly vanished into thin air. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bill hailed from Marietta, Georgia, where he lived with his fianc\u00e9e, Mary.  Joshua Tree was an annual excursion for him. By all accounts, Bill was an experienced hiker, but at 65 years old he preferred a map and compass to the more modern convenience of GPS. Living in Georgia, Bill was accustomed to hiking in the heat\u2014I\u2019d venture to assume that the dry heat of California was likely a welcome change from Georgia\u2019s humidity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bill flew in to California on June 23rd and rented a white Chrysler Sebring. He planned to return home on July 1st. The following morning he headed to Joshua Tree. He told Mary that he was planning on hiking Cary\u2019s Castle and that he planned to leave the park by 5 PM (He also made Mary aware of his general itinerary for the duration of his visit). It is thought that he only brought 3 water bottles with him that day.  Mary was concerned when she didn\u2019t receive a phone call later that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning (Friday the 25th), rangers visited the trail head at Cary\u2019s Castle and found no traces of Bill\u2019s rental car. It wasn\u2019t until the following evening (5 PM Saturday the 26th) that Bill\u2019s car was located at the Juniper Flats trail head. Juniper Flats trail head was popular for hikers looking to conquer Quail Mountain, a destination listed on Bill\u2019s itinerary. However, there are many other directions a hiker might take from that trail head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate truth is that Bill had already been missing for 48 hours before the searchers even knew where to look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning around 7 AM, Bill\u2019s cellphone pinged off the Serin Tower. This ping placed him at roughly 10.6 miles away from the cell tower, meaning that he covered surprisingly more distance than expected. &lt;a href=\"http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/search-and-rescue/searching-for-bill-ewasko/current-bill-ewasko-thoughts-january-2013/\"&gt;The cell phone ping is explained in greater detail here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A witness had spotted Bill\u2019s vehicle at the Juniper Flats trailhead, but was convinced that it was parked in the opposite direction (backed in to the parking space) than the rangers had found it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Marsland, a searcher working with Tom, offered these thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, as I look over all the facts and timeline of the case, coupled with the baffling and nonsensical cell phone information, puzzling non-itinerary and thoroughly searched topography, I have come to believe that the answer might lie in a total bottom-up rethink of the assumptions about Bill&amp;#39;s disappearance. That line of inquiry and a re-sifting of all the known information - not just the ping, but the circumstances surrounding how, where and when the search unfolded - might lead one to scenarios (or one very specific scenario) probably better left unposted. If all the clues about Bill&amp;#39;s last hike do not seem to add up to anything -- in fact, seem to point everywhere and nowhere at the same time -- well, there might be a good reason for that. And that&amp;#39;s about all I have to say. Best to let others form their own opinions; the information is all there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foul play, or deliberate disappearance. This is suggested by the odd eyewitness accounts of Bill&amp;#39;s car supposedly having been moved or being altogether absent during some of the time he was missing. However, it is very hard to come up with a scenario that explains these peculiarities AND the cell ping seemingly happening on Sunday in a very remote area of the park. It is conceivable that Bill was done away with, and that his phone was dropped near a main road 10.6 miles from Serin Tower and some passerby happened to pick it up and turn it on. But given the specifics of the timeline and the unlikelihood of encountering anybody in this part of the park (it doesn&amp;#39;t seem a good use of a criminal&amp;#39;s time to be hanging around the lightly visited Juniper Flats Trailhead waiting to mug people), it seems improbable. Moreover, if Bill disappeared deliberately, why is he hanging around with the phone still active on Sunday morning (and where does he hang out within the confines of the park - since the car didn&amp;#39;t exit - without anyone finding him)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ping information is wrong. Verizon&amp;#39;s estimate of the accuracy of the ping allows for a 10% margin of error, which could extend the possible area a half mile or so further out - doesn&amp;#39;t really change things much. A more serious snafu with the mileage could change the whole picture. But there is no evidence of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill went completely off his rocker from heat exhaustion, and went into an area that makes absolutely no logical sense (e.g. into the canyons west of Upper Covington, or eschewing an obvious exit route like a road or a path).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill is in an area that has already been searched, but is obscured for some reason. (This includes the possibility that he did nearly make it out, but expired near a road or some other area no one would bother to search)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More of his thoughts can be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.adammarsland.com/ewasko3.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, where is Bill?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are his remains simply hiding in plain sight? If so, why has none of his equipment been found (aside from a bandana that may or may not be his)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should any weight be given to theories of foul play? Could someone have moved his car? Is his body simply in an &lt;em&gt;entirely different&lt;/em&gt; part of the park?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the phone ping? Did he leave his phone off during most of his hike and only turn it on on Sunday morning? How did he manage to get so far away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems there are more questions and no clear answers.
