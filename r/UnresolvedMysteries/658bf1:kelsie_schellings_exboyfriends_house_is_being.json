She had lived in Denver at the time, and her boyfriend, Donte, lived in Pueblo. She contacted him regarding the ultrasound, and apparently he send her numerous messages trying to get her to go down to Pueblo (confirmed by texts and cell tower pings.) Kelsie was never seen again. \nThe parents became worried after they didn&amp;#39;t hear from Kelsie the following day.. although they were receiving weird texts from Kelsie&amp;#39;s phone stating she wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well and was going to lay down, she&amp;#39;d contact them soon, etc. A huge series of lies follows this whole case. Once Donte, the boyfriend, became a person of interest, he was questioned twice by police. His stories ranged from her losing her phone, to him taking her to the hospital (although the hospital had no records of Kelsie or Donte ever being there) There was also video evidence showing Donte using her card to take out cash from an ATM, in which he stated Kelsie was in the car waiting for him, but video proves otherwise. The last video evidence (I think) is that of Kelsie&amp;#39;s car being abandoned at a Walmart parking lot on February 5th overnight.. the next morning an unidentified man was seen on video getting into the car and driving away. The car was later found, on February 14 at St Mary Corwin Hospital (still no record of Kelsie or Donte ever being at the hospital)\nPersonally, I think ALL the signs point to the boyfriend... there is so much more to this case.
