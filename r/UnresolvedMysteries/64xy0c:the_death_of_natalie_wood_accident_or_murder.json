Witnesses claim that this is when things began to unravel. Waitresses at the restaurant saw the trio drink &lt;em&gt;several bottles&lt;/em&gt; of champagne and state that the three patrons eventually caused a rude and rowdy ruckus with &lt;em&gt;Natalie openly flirting with Walken&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They left the restaurant in a drunken mess, boarded a small dinghy and motored to the &amp;quot;Splendour.&amp;quot; Exactly what happened from this point forward will probably always be a bit unclear. Walken, Wagner and Wood continued their partying as Captain Davern began his last rounds of shutting down the boat. At around 12:20 am Davern noticed that the dinghy was gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davern simply assumed Natalie had taken it, as was her custom, to view the evening stars. When she didn&amp;#39;t return minutes later, Davern notified Wagner of her absence who immediately set out in another dinghy to look for her. At about 1:00 am Wagner notified the harbor patrol to scout for her. At around 3:30 am the Coast Guard was added to the search party. At 7:30 am helicopters would discover her body, floating face down some two hundred yards from the boat. The small dinghy was discovered adrift, with four life vests aboard, some two hundred yards from her body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several stories about the details of Natalie&amp;#39;s death would begin to surface. Wagner&amp;#39;s people continue to assert that Natalie drowned when she slipped into the icy water after becoming annoyed by the incessant pounding of the tied-up dinghy on the side of the yacht.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police finally reached the conclusion that after changing into her nightgown, a pair of knee-highs and a thick down jacket, Natalie Wood got in the dinghy, perhaps to drive it to the hotel on shore. However while she was untying the dinghy, she likely slipped on the wet swim platform, striking her head on the side of the boat or platform itself and fell into the cold water of the harbor. Wood then succumbed after being dragged down by the now heavy, waterlogged coat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles County coroner to the stars, Dr. Thomas Noguchi had his own Natalie Wood theory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He concluded the actress did indeed escape in the dinghy. She then slipped and fell into the harbor waters. She attempted to crawl up the sides of the rubber dinghy, but the heavy coat, now weighing 30-40 pounds prevented her from lifting herself into the boat. As Wood struggled to get into the dinghy, she noticed it slowly drifting away out into the harbor. She became more and more frightened and began to scream but her yells were drowned out by the loud stereo of some local revelers. Natalie grabbed the side of the dinghy and began to steer it toward the shore. She eventually succumbed to the cold, and slipped into death shrouded in her nightgown and red down coat. Natalie Wood was 43 years-old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll probably never know what really happened that night. Wagner and Walken refuse to talk about it and eyewitness accounts don&amp;#39;t really match up with all the facts. The official coroner&amp;#39;s report states the following: a private searcher who located the dinghy says that the key was in the ignition, which was in the off position. The gear was in neutral and the oars tied down. &lt;em&gt;It appeared the boat had not even been used&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The condition of Natalie&amp;#39;s body created a need for a large amount of cosmetic work for her funereal presentation. The official coroner&amp;#39;s report states the following about the condition of Natalie&amp;#39;s body: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;body was taken from the ocean and placed in the hyperbaric chamber building for safe keeping. Upon the investigator&amp;#39;s arrival at location, decedent observed Lying in &amp;#39;stokes litter&amp;#39; (military style stainless steel rescue cage). Decedent is wrapped in plastic sheet, she herself is dressed in flannel nightgown and socks. The jacket that she was wearing when found floating, is no longer on the body, having come off when she was pulled from the water. At the time decedent was pulled from water, sheriff&amp;#39;s personnel says that body was absent of any rigor and they noted foam coming from mouth. Rigor is now present of a 3 to 4 throughout entire body. Decedent has numerous bruises to legs and arms. Decedent&amp;#39;s eyes are also a bit cloudy appearing. No other trauma noted and foul play is not suspected at this time.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When further researching the case, Walken has stated there was an argument between Walken and Wagner about Woods&amp;#39; career, that led to Wagner breaking a bottle. Other interviews he states Wagner and Woods got into a heated argument after. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe they are withholding information. Perhaps Wagner, angry at Woods for flirting with Walken, pushed her off. Maybe he lost control but it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your theories would be very helpful, as I am writing this up for a true crime mysteries book and could use fresh eyes! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood\"&gt;Here is her wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And feel free to research yourselves if it grips you enough!
