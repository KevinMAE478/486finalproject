A part of me wanted to dive deep into the rabbit hole and post about the cases, while another part of me was hesitant due to the overwhelming amount of crimes committed by the two monikers. With the extensive crime spree&amp;#39;s, it&amp;#39;s hard to separate fact from fiction, let alone the numerous red-herrings. Nevertheless, I decided to finally attempt to contribute my own submissions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I would like to disclose my opinion: I am going to be writing under the assumption that the Visalia Ransacker and The East Area Rapist/Original Night Stalker are the same person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I stated my position, this particular post is going to be dedicated solely to the Visalia Ransacker. However, I&amp;#39;m not going to dive heavily deep into his crimes. I will give a brief overlay of his attacks, but my primary focus will be on days and locations he committed his atrocities. Also, I would like to note now: This is going to be Part One. Most of my attention will be focused on EAR/ONS. I have most of the stuff I want to share already pre-written. Warning: It&amp;#39;s incredibly lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&amp;#39;s start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginning on April 6th, 1974, an unidentified male began a series of serial burglaries in and around Visalia, California until December 10th, 1975. Generally, single-story residences were targeted. Inside, homes were rummaged and torn apart, but small items that weren&amp;#39;t of much value were typically stolen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These reported break-ins hardly received attention across the press and news on television. In other words, the crimes went under the radar. During the majority of the intrusions, nobody was necessarily harmed in a physical manner until September 11th, 1975, when his crime spree escalated for unknown reasons. By now, although not receiving much press, some newspapers dubbed the intruder, &lt;em&gt;The Visalia Ransacker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the late hours of the night on September 11th, the home of Claude Snelling -- a professor teaching journalism at College of the Sequoias -- was broken into. The sound of loud and strange noises echoing throughout the home awoke Claude. Once he was able to wipe the sleep from under his eyes, he went to check on the commotion. That is when he noticed a masked trespasser attempting to abduct his teenage daughter, Beth Snelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Visalia Ransacker was already outside in the backyard dragging Beth in hand when Claude heroically came to his daughter&amp;#39;s aide. The intruder threw Beth aside in a panic, pulled out a gun and shot Claude Snelling in the stomach before fleeing. The wound proved fatal and Claude died in the back patio after rescuing his daughter from the monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to this tragic home invasion, the Visalia Ransacker had allegedly attacked 84 homes, and this occasion was the first abduction and murder reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was this event that finally prompted law enforcement to perform stakeouts with hopes of catching the thief and killer. Different officers were designated to various neighborhoods that had been previously ransacked. However, despite neighbors and police being on high alert, the intruder managed to continue his invasions in an uncanny fashion ten more times between the dates of September 22nd, 1975 - December 10th, 1975.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Visalia Ransacker continued relishing in his abilities, growing more confident by the day without being apprehended, but on December 10th, Detective William McGowen witnessed a suspicious male walking through the neighborhood he was patrolling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;McGowen attempted to confront the man for questioning, and that&amp;#39;s when the stranger pulled out a gun and shot at the detective. Shockingly, the bullet fired struck McGowen&amp;#39;s flashlight, ultimately knocking him on his back and shattering the glass. Miraculously, he was unharmed, but the perpetrator managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not necessarily confirmed the shooter was and is the Visalia Ransacker, but it&amp;#39;s the leading assumption. Interestingly, Detective McGowen was able to get a glimpse of the man. Apparently, the individual had a ski-mask on, but it was rolled up so his face was visible. According to him, the man seemed to have blonde hair and was approximately 5&amp;#39;9 - 5&amp;#39;10 in height. His age estimated to be between 25-30 years old and he was rather chubby, perhaps weighing 190-200 pounds, but was incredibly agile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For nearly two years, the Visalia Ransacker burglarized 94 homes. Authorities have estimated that number could be much larger, possibly 125 residences. Because of the large number, I am going to try my best to record a timeline of events. My hope is that a familiar pattern will emerge (by the way, I think I have found one). Also, I have never been to California, so if some of my information is wrong, please let me know. With this case, it needs to be as accurate as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;April 6, 1974. Saturday. Linda Vista St, Visalia, CA&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;April 6, 1974. Saturday.

Is the criminal a teenager on break for summer vacation, thus not attacking due to more people being outside late in the evening? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;September 14, 1974. Saturday.

Could these attacks be that of a high schooler or first year grad student? Most of his burglaries happened on the weekend. That could possibly explain his extensive traveling on occasion. Also, I&amp;#39;m curious what compelled the individual to deviate from his typical M.O. in terms of days. Uncontrollable urges? Frustration?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;November 1, 1974.

From what I&amp;#39;ve read, there are two &amp;quot;Vassar Streets.&amp;quot; One is located in Pomona, CA, while another is supposedly in Bakersfield, CA. The distance between the two locations are two hours and thirty minutes. I thought I&amp;#39;d mention that for clarification. To reiterate, I&amp;#39;ve never been to California, so I&amp;#39;m not accustomed to their city/street layout. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;November 2, 1974. Saturday.

He did start attacking in new areas from the beginning of 1975.

I apologize in advance if it seems pointless and irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unclear on what slowed the individual down on his crimes. In 1975, his menacing antics weren&amp;#39;t as frequent from the prior year. In my opinion, I find being as methodical as the Visalia Ransacker is an important key to tracking this unknown criminal. If you can initiate the perspective the ransacker had, it could possibly shed new light on the mysterious man who alluded authorities for years. This was a very lengthy piece to write, and difficult as well. Currently, I&amp;#39;m writing/editing a &amp;quot;Part 2&amp;quot; of this that is focusing primarily on The East Area Rapist.

A part of me wanted to dive deep into the rabbit hole and post about the cases, while another part of me was hesitant due to the overwhelming amount of crimes committed by the two monikers. With the extensive crime spree's, it's hard to separate fact from fiction, let alone the numerous red-herrings. Nevertheless, I decided to finally attempt to contribute my own submissions. \n\nBefore I begin, I would like to disclose my opinion: I am going to be writing under the assumption that the Visalia Ransacker and The East Area Rapist/Original Night Stalker are the same person.\n\nNow that I stated my position, this particular post is going to be dedicated solely to the Visalia Ransacker. However, I'm not going to dive heavily deep into his crimes. I will give a brief overlay of his attacks, but my primary focus will be on days and locations he committed his atrocities. Also, I would like to note now: This is going to be Part One. Most of my attention will be focused on EAR/ONS. I have most of the stuff I want to share already pre-written. Warning: It's incredibly lengthy.\n\nAnyway, let's start.\n\n---\n\nBeginning on April 6th, 1974, an unidentified male began a series of serial burglaries in and around Visalia, California until December 10th, 1975. Generally, single-story residences were targeted. Inside, homes were rummaged and torn apart, but small items that weren't of much value were typically stolen.\n\nThese reported break-ins hardly received attention across the press and news on television. In other words, the crimes went under the radar. During the majority of the intrusions, nobody was necessarily harmed in a physical manner until September 11th, 1975, when his crime spree escalated for unknown reasons. By now, although not receiving much press, some newspapers dubbed the intruder, *The Visalia Ransacker.*\n\nIn the late hours of the night on September 11th, the home of Claude Snelling -- a professor teaching journalism at College of the Sequoias -- was broken into. The sound of loud and strange noises echoing throughout the home awoke Claude. Once he was able to wipe the sleep from under his eyes, he went to check on the commotion. That is when he noticed a masked trespasser attempting to abduct his teenage daughter, Beth Snelling.\n\nThe Visalia Ransacker was already outside in the backyard dragging Beth in hand when Claude heroically came to his daughter's aide. The intruder threw Beth aside in a panic, pulled out a gun and shot Claude Snelling in the stomach before fleeing. The wound proved fatal and Claude died in the back patio after rescuing his daughter from the monster.\n\nPrior to this tragic home invasion, the Visalia Ransacker had allegedly attacked 84 homes, and this occasion was the first abduction and murder reported.\n\nIt was this event that finally prompted law enforcement to perform stakeouts with hopes of catching the thief and killer. Different officers were designated to various neighborhoods that had been previously ransacked. However, despite neighbors and police being on high alert, the intruder managed to continue his invasions in an uncanny fashion ten more times between the dates of September 22nd, 1975 - December 10th, 1975.\n\nThe Visalia Ransacker continued relishing in his abilities, growing more confident by the day without being apprehended, but on December 10th, Detective William McGowen witnessed a suspicious male walking through the neighborhood he was patrolling.\n\nMcGowen attempted to confront the man for questioning, and that's when the stranger pulled out a gun and shot at the detective. Shockingly, the bullet fired struck McGowen's flashlight, ultimately knocking him on his back and shattering the glass. Miraculously, he was unharmed, but the perpetrator managed to escape.\n\nIt's not necessarily confirmed the shooter was and is the Visalia Ransacker, but it's the leading assumption. Interestingly, Detective McGowen was able to get a glimpse of the man. Apparently, the individual had a ski-mask on, but it was rolled up so his face was visible. According to him, the man seemed to have blonde hair and was approximately 5'9 - 5'10 in height. His age estimated to be between 25-30 years old and he was rather chubby, perhaps weighing 190-200 pounds, but was incredibly agile.\n\nFor nearly two years, the Visalia Ransacker burglarized 94 homes. Authorities have estimated that number could be much larger, possibly 125 residences. Because of the large number, I am going to try my best to record a timeline of events. My hope is that a familiar pattern will emerge (by the way, I think I have found one). Also, I have never been to California, so if some of my information is wrong, please let me know. With this case, it needs to be as accurate as possible.\n\n* April 6, 1974. Saturday. Linda Vista St, Visalia, CA\n* April 6, 1974. Saturday. Whitney St, Visalia, CA\n* May 4, 1974. Saturday.

Could these attacks be that of a high schooler or first year grad student? Most of his burglaries happened on the weekend. That could possibly explain his extensive traveling on occasion. Also, I'm curious what compelled the individual to deviate from his typical M.O. in terms of days. Uncontrollable urges? Frustration?\n\n* November 1, 1974. Friday.

I apologize in advance if it seems pointless and irrelevant. \n\nIt's unclear on what slowed the individual down on his crimes. In 1975, his menacing antics weren't as frequent from the prior year. In my opinion, I find being as methodical as the Visalia Ransacker is an important key to tracking this unknown criminal. If you can initiate the perspective the ransacker had, it could possibly shed new light on the mysterious man who alluded authorities for years. This was a very lengthy piece to write, and difficult as well. Currently, I'm writing/editing a \"Part 2\" of this that is focusing primarily on The East Area Rapist.

Instead of two ear-rings, he would take only one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, he could have taken whatever. He stayed in the homes for an extended period of time rummaging through the homes. He would bind his victims, ransack the house, come back, rape them, then ransack even further, and repeat this process multiple times. What&amp;#39;s interesting to note, it&amp;#39;s assumed he already knew where most of the items were that he was going to steal, but asked the victim anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dg83fv2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141097.0, "created_utc": 1492112297.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg830gj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yodfather", "parent_id": "t1_dg82unc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would think they'd have to be taking low-value items intentionally.
