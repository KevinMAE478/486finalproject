This stressor would have caused experiences to potentially impact them in a way that caused aging to occur faster. In fact, East Asia for these generations of both John Doe and Xuan Cao would have experienced a lot of stress while growing up and living, so I would not be quick to rule out age. Aside from that I agree these two men are an unlikely match but I am still hopeful.
