I had a plan to create a topic about Tereska&amp;#39;s life and our investigation but I see someone was much faster than me, thank you blondynizm. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;English and German translations of original article are in preparation and we will try to hit some foreign media outlets soon because David Seymour&amp;#39;s work is more popular in the West than in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To clarify some things: I have started the investigation and for first months I was doing it by myself (with some support from German charity foundation &amp;#39;Tereska&amp;#39;) but when I came to Warsaw I met polish journalist, Aneta Wawrzy\u0144czak who joined me, since then we were working together, and she had done amazing job. Alone I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do it. (I needed to go back to Greece where I work as a volunteer). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tereska died tragically in 1978 in a mental hospital nearby Warsaw. Family of Tereska is in a process of getting medical documentation from the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got scans of original David Seymour&amp;#39;s contact sheets from Magnum Photos, it made everything much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we have been to Polish national TV. \n&lt;a href=\"http://www.pytanienasniadanie.tvp.pl/29881861/tajemnica-slynnego-zdjecia-dziewczynki-rozwiazana\"&gt;http://www.pytanienasniadanie.tvp.pl/29881861/tajemnica-slynnego-zdjecia-dziewczynki-rozwiazana&lt;/a&gt; (only in Polish)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dg4kled", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959659.0, "created_utc": 1491930859.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 502}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qbhr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4cjuh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pstrocek", "parent_id": "t3_64qbhr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for posting this.
