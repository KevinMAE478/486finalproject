She was renting a duplex with a female roommate, and had dreams of buying a house and starting her own catering business. She worked two jobs at the time of her disappearance: The first being a daytime position in the retail sales department of the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, and the second as a clerk at the Circle K at the corner of Hall Road and Aloma Avenue, where she worked the night shift alone five nights a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deborah\u2019s boyfriend, Scott Iaggi, left his shift at the Circle K at 11:00PM on February 3. He passed by to check on her two hours later at 1:00AM on February 4th. At 3:00AM, a friend who happened to be driving by the Circle K saw Deborah inside the store, standing behind the counter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, sometime between 3:15 and 3:30AM, a woman walked in to pick up a buy a pack of cigarettes. To her surprise, instead of Deborah or another employee in their Circle K smock, standing behind the counter was a tall young man wearing a black Megadeth t-shirt with a dragon spitting fire. Assuming he was the clerk, she went up to him and asked for cigarettes, but he was unfamiliar with the cigarettes and had to be pointed to the particular brand she wanted. He calmly operated the cash register and made her change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t smoke, you know,\u201d he told her, and handed her the carton of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 4:00AM, another customer came in to find the store empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police arrived to find Deborah\u2019s red Toyota backed up in the parking lot, locked with her purse, car keys, and paycheck inside. A carton of chocolate milk and cup of coffee had been left on a stack of house plans behind the counter, with her Circle K smock neatly folded nearby. The register was locked, and it appeared that no merchandise had been taken or moved out of place. It was as if the store had simply been abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A search dog hit on two spots on the pavement behind the Circle K. The first was behind the deserted business next door. The second followed her scent out the back of the store, through a space in the tall wood fence into the parking lot of the Shoals apartment complex \u2014 and promptly lost it. This led detectives to believe that Deborah had either voluntarily entered, or been dragged into, a waiting vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But who would have wanted to abduct the kind and hardworking Deborah Poe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was quickly apparent that the nature of Deborah\u2019s work made her an easy target for abduction: As a young, attractive woman working at a gas station alone at night, in an era before there were security cameras in every building, she was frequently harassed by customers who ranged from harmlessly creepy to downright dangerous in the few short months she worked there. The most frightening incident happened just two weeks before her disappearance, when a naked man burst into the Circle K and climbed over the counter towards Deborah. He chased her around the interior of the store a couple times, then outside and around the gas pumps, until she was able to beat him back to the store and lock the doors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once she got the full-time job at the Orlando Sentinel, her boyfriend and family begged her to quit the Circle K, saying it was too dangerous and that she was working too much. When that failed, Scott began to work the night shift alongside her for the last month, but this ended when Deborah told him there was no need for him to not get any sleep and that she didn\u2019t \u201cneed you to be my protector all the time\u201d.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there\u2019s the unidentified man behind the counter. Detectives have long struggled to make sense of the elusive \u201cMegadeth Man\u201d who, after 27 years and hundreds of tips, has never been identified. Was he actually involved in Deborah\u2019s abduction, or was it just an extraordinary coincidence that he was there in the store, behind the counter, minutes after she was last seen? Although the authorities first considered him responsible for Deborah\u2019s abduction, it seems they\u2019ve shifted over the years towards believing that he was actually a witness \u2014 and &lt;a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-11-24/news/9611211092_1_crimeline-megadeth-poe\"&gt;possibly the boyfriend of another employee at the store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police originally didn\u2019t go public with any information about him in fear of scaring him out of Orange County, but after three months with no success in identifying him, they went to the media &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/zQ0wexC.jpg\"&gt;with a composite sketch&lt;/a&gt;. He was somewhere between 19 and 25 years old with long, stringy dark hair and dark eyes. Besides the Megadeth t-shirt, he was wearing a skull ring and a wire cross earring on his right ear. Most significantly, he a    had a black van parked out in the parking lot with a Megadeth mural airbrushed on the side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August 1990, a man riding an ATV found the skeletal remains of a young woman off Aloma Avenue, two miles from where Deborah was last seen. These were initially believed to be hers due to the location and physical similarities, but her family didn\u2019t recognize the woman\u2019s jewelry, and they were eventually ruled out via dental records.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A segment about Deborah\u2019s disappearance aired on Unsolved Mysteries on November 6, 1991, generating over 150 leads from viewers around the country. Most of them were from people saying they had seen (or knew) the Megadeth Man, although Orange County detectives did receive one call from authorities in Virginia who said they had a similar case and a suspect in custody who matched the description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detectives looked into multiple suspects over the next few years, although they were never able to charge anybody. One was an ex-boyfriend who Deborah had broken up with because she thought him to be mentally unstable. In 1998, detectives said they had zeroed in on a man who used to talk about Deborah\u2019s disappearance constantly, but now refuses to discuss it with anyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 2002, a team of over a dozen sheriff\u2019s detectives and search-and-rescue volunteers scoured the empty lot behind the Chapel Hill Baptist Church on Trevarthon Road in Orlando. Law enforcement had long considered the one-acre lot, which is 3 - 4 miles from the Circle K, a possible location of Deborah\u2019s remains, as it was \u201cnear the home of a suspect in the case\u201d. A search of ancestry.com revealed that Deborah\u2019s boyfriend lived just across the street from the Chapel Hill Baptist Church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That morning, five of the six dogs alerted to human remains in a grassy section of the field. However, a 12-hour excavation of the field turned up nothing of importance \u2014 although detectives weren\u2019t discounting the possibility that Deborah\u2019s remains had been buried there at some point and moved at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Orlando Sentinel, the newspaper that Deborah briefly worked for, ran a \u201cmissing persons\u201d ad in the classified section every day for 11 years after her abduction, ending in December 2001. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;27 years after her disappearance from the Circle K that night in February, Deborah Poe has never been found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think happened to Deborah Poe? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/p/poe_deborah.html\"&gt;The Charley Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0w7s1yg.jpg\"&gt;&amp;quot;Missing Clerk&amp;#39;s Friends Plan Search&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/J70Zklf.jpg\"&gt;&amp;quot;Missing Clerk Worked Two Jobs to Save for House&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mystery Man May Prove Clue to Case&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/zQ0wexC.jpg\"&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/zQ0wexC.jpg\"&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZXLVj1p.jpg\"&gt;&amp;quot;New Leads Spring From TV Show&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Zfv9tvI.jpg\"&gt;&amp;quot;Search Fails to Find Remains&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/N3tFWKR.jpg\"&gt;Newspaper Blurb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/z41tLie.jpg\"&gt;&amp;quot;Lost But Not Forgotten&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Deborah Deann Poe was 26 years old when she disappeared from the graveyard shift of her convenience store job on February 4, 1990.\n\nDeborah grew up in northern Virginia near Washington D.C.  and moved to Orlando in October 1989.
