She was raised in a Minneapolis suburb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barely a teen, the 13-year-old Lynn met\u00a019-year-old Keith Raymond Schuller\u00a0while the two families were vacationing in northern Minnesota, and began a relationship that culminated in\u00a0their marriage on September 18, 1965\u00a0when Lynn was 18 and Keith, 24.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Lynn gave birth to the couple\u2019s son.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith Schuller reported his wife missing on\u00a0August 6, 1972. (Media reports listed her age as 26, though Lynn Schuller was actually 25 at the time she went missing.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith Schuller then filed for divorce\u00a0a total of seven times in Linn County District Court without success. Without his in-laws\u2019 knowledge, Schuller finally went to Dubuque County District Court to file the papers, and the divorce was granted in July 1976.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Less than two years later on March 20, 1978, a Dubuque District Court judge granted Schuller\u2019s request to have Lynn Schuller declared legally dead. The decree listed the couple\u2019s young\u00a0son as the sole heir of Lynn\u2019s life insurance benefits, with Keith the conservator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Keith Schuller reported his wife Lynn Schuller missing in August 1972,\u00a0police suspected murder\u00a0from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than four decades later, they still believe Schuller is responsible for her death, but don\u2019t ever expect to find her body. Why? The suspicions surrounding her disappearance sounded so much like that of local folklore that even police were reluctant to acknowledge Keith Schuller could have committed such an abhorrent act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tale began in a Minneapolis suburb, where Lynn Tickner had been born and raised. Barely a teen, she met Keith Schuller \u2014 six\u00a0years her senior \u2014 while the two families were vacationing in northern Minnesota. A long-distance relationship culminated in\u00a0Lynn and Keith\u2019s marriage on Sept. 18, 1965.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two made their home in Cedar Rapids, and Lynn gave birth the couple\u2019s first and only child in 1969. By all outward appearances, they seemed like a happy couple until 1971, when Keith abruptly announced he wanted a divorce. Lynn, however, wasn\u2019t ready to break up their new family and refused to grant the divorce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith continued to press for a divorce, and in 1972, Lynn wrote a letter to her mother stating that Keith had threatened to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith owned a 6-foot-long alligator, Pogo, and two pet snakes. He\u2019d also served as a medic in the Army for three years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months later, while vacationing at the same lake where their daughter and Keith had met, the Tickners received a call from their son-in-law. Lynn had disappeared, he told them, and he didn\u2019t know where she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Perfect Crime?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry and Eloise Tickner immediately headed south for Cedar Rapids, where\u00a0Keith Schuller told them he\u2019d last seen Lynn while she was sleeping. He said that around 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 6, 1972 [sic- that date was a Sunday] that he and their 3-year-old son had left the home and returned about five hours later to discover both Lynn and her bicycle were gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith Schuller was asked to assist in the investigation \u2014 particularly to help search the nearby woods for his wife\u2019s body \u2014 but he refused to do so and was arrested for refusing to assist an officer.
