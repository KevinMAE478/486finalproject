Technologies like fingerprint / iris scanning, facial recognition etc. also make it more difficult to forge documents and assume new identities. Therefore I&amp;#39;d expect that at least in developed countries with well functioning institutions there will be less and less cases in which a disappearance is voluntary. (In the developing world this is obviously not the case, as information technology can be seen as an enabler of migration, and increasingly many people are fleeing their miserable economic situations, often also by assuming false indentities - but this is quite a different topic and not what this threat is about, I guess)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, however, also implies that the &amp;quot;option&amp;quot; to simply start a new life  is increasingly taken away from people who see this path as their last way to escape from their current situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dgdb34m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492449883.0, "created_utc": 1492421083.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65skl6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdg6gf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mcc86", "parent_id": "t3_65skl6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Some possible scenarios ...\n\u26aaHomeless person, sadly died on an alley somewhere, without proper ID.\n\u26aaPersons who are in witness protection. \n\u26aaVictims of spouse or parental abuse,  have changed their identity to save their lives (I know of one).\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some possible scenarios ...\n\u26aaHomeless person, sadly died on an alley somewhere, without proper ID.\n\u26aaPersons who are in witness protection. \n\u26aaVictims of spouse or parental abuse,  have changed their identity to save their lives (I know of one).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dgdg6gf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492463011.0, "created_utc": 1492434211.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65skl6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65skl6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65skl6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65skl6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8bwd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "glittercheese", "parent_id": "t1_dge7o2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Go troll somewhere else\ud83d\ude0a\u270c\ud83c\udffb", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go troll somewhere else\ud83d\ude0a\u270c\ud83c\udffb&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dge8bwd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496768.0, "created_utc": 1492467968.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge7o2q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Carl_Solomon", "parent_id": "t1_dge618q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As far as I can tell, mine is the only response which answered the question posed in the title.
