On November 7th, 1969 a young Nun (Sister Cathy Ann Cesnik) working at Archbiship Keough High School (an all girls, Catholic prepatory school that is now &amp;#39;Seton Keough High School located in Baltimore, MD.) went missing. On January 3rd, 1970 her body was found in Lansdowne, MD. Lansdowne is in Baltimore County (outskirts of the city), so it&amp;#39;s not far from the school. Despite an &amp;quot;extensive&amp;quot; (I use that term loosely here) search, her killer was never found (or convicted, depending on how you feel).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite technically never being solved, many familiar with the case believe that the Priest at the time was responsible for her death. A number of female students apparently came to Cesnik and revealed that they had been raped/molested by the priest.
