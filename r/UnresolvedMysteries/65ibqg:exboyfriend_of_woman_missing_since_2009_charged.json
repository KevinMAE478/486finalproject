The surveillance saw Jose entering and exiting the premises at odd times, which he advised was him moving his things out after their breakup.

It was the only window in the house with an open blind \u2014 and the only window that had been left unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After finding Rodriguez-Cruz\u2019s Alexandria apartment address in his sister\u2019s home office, Derrick Butler, 46, drove there that night, hoping to get some answers. As far as Pam Butler\u2019s family knew, she and Rodriguez-Cruz were still a couple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Brandon Butler said, he logged onto his aunt\u2019s computer and began fast-forwarding through six days\u2019 worth of stored security video, starting at the previous Thursday, when she had made the Valentine\u2019s date with her mother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The time-stamped video, later confiscated by homicide detectives, shows only his aunt and Rodriguez-Cruz at the house, Brandon Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said the couple left together early Thursday, apparently headed to work. That night, he said, Rodriguez-Cruz arrived back at the house first and waited outside until Butler got home a little while later. Then she opened a rear door and they went inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 9:48 p.m. Thursday, he said, his aunt again stepped into camera view, leaning out the front door to get her mail from the box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez-Cruz, 44, said he stayed overnight Thursday. The next day, Butler\u2019s work-at-home Friday, he left the house by himself in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although Butler, working inside, is not seen on Friday\u2019s video, nothing indicates that she was in peril during the day.

Brandon Butler said the video shows Rodriguez-Cruz leaving shortly before 11:30 p.m., about 3 1/2 hours after he had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez-Cruz stayed for almost two hours Saturday, a half-hour Sunday and about 90 minutes Monday, Brandon Butler said. After two of the visits, he left the house carrying a shoulder-slung duffle bag, plus a plastic trash bag on one occasion, Brandon Butler said. He said none of the bags appeared to be heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said he didn\u2019t realize she was missing until the Tuesday night when Derrick Butler went to his apartment, wondering where his sister was.
