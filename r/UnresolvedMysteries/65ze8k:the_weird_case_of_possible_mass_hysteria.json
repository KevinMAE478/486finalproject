The small size of the pits led police to believe that the damage had been the work of vandals using buckshot or BBs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, within a week, a few residents in Sedro Wooley and Mount Vernon, 25 miles south of Bellingham, also began noticing damage to their windshields. By the second week of April, the &amp;quot;vandals&amp;quot; had attacked further south in the town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island. Losing no time, all available law enforcement officers in the area sped to town in the hope of apprehending the culprits. Road blocks were set up south of town, and all cars leaving or entering the city were given a detailed once-over, as were their drivers and passengers to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;THEY&amp;#39;RE GETTING CLOSER!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Farther south, cars at the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Oak Harbor were discovered to have the same mysterious dings. Nearly 75 Marines made an intensive five-hour search of the station looking for evidence -anything that might lead to the source of the mystery. They came up empty, yet by the end of the day, more than 2,000 cars from Bellingham to Oak Harbor were reported as having been damaged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two thing became abundantly clear: This could not be the work of roving hooligans; and whatever was causing windshield pits and dings was rapidly approaching Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;SEATTLE UNDER SIEGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the morning of April 14, Seattle newspapers ran front-page reports of the events that had transpired to the north. The afternoon papers carried similar stories. At 6 PM a report cam in to the Seattle police that three cars had been damaged in a lot at 6th Avenue and John Street. At 9 PM a motorist reported that his windshield had been hit at North 82nd Street. Then the floodgates opened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motorists began stopping police cars on the street to report windshield damage. Parking lots and auto sale lots were hit. Even police cars parked in front of precinct stations suffered damage. Extra clerks were brought into the station to answer the flurry of calls from angry and perplexed car owners. By the next morning, windshield pitting had reached epidemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLASS MENAGERIE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sheer numbers of the damaged windshields ruled out hoodlums, and experts couldn&amp;#39;t explain the strange pits and holes appearing out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &lt;em&gt;On Whidbey Island, Sheriff Tom Clark postulated that radioactivity released by recent H-bomb tests in the South Pacific was peppering windshields. Geiger counters were run over windshield glass, but all were free of radioactivity. Still, the sheriff held firm that &amp;quot;no human agency&amp;quot; could have created the scars on the glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &lt;em&gt;Some thought that the Navy&amp;#39;s new million-watt radio transmitter at Jim Creek near Arlington was converting electronic oscillations to physical oscillations in the glass. Navy Commander George Warren called this theory &amp;quot;completely absurd.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &lt;em&gt;Cosmic rays bombarding the Earth from the sun were considered, but since so little was known about cosmic rays, this theory could be neither proved nor refuted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &lt;em&gt;A mysterious atmospheric event was theorized (although no one could explain exactly what kind that would be).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &lt;em&gt;A few people reported seeing the glass bubble right before their eyes, leading some to postulate that sand-flea eggs had somehow been laid in the glass and were now hatching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &lt;em&gt;Alternative suggestions: supersonic sound waves, non-radioactive core debris from nuclear bomb tests, or a shift in the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field. Other folks simply blamed the event on gremlins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So?..what is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By April 15, 1954, police were swamped with calls. Close to 3,000 windshields had been reported as being pitted, and no one knew what to do. Desperate, Seattle Mayor Allan Pomeroy first wired Washington Governor Langlie, then President Eisenhower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What appeared to be a localized outbreak of vandalism in damaged auto windshields and windows in northern Washington State has now spread through the Puget Sound area. Chemical analysis of mysterious powder adhering to damaged windshields and windows indicates the material may simply be spread by wind and not a police matter at all.

The sheriff and his deputies felt that this level of damage could not be explained by ordinary road use. They also claimed they&amp;#39;d found odd little pellets near some of the cars, and that the pellets reacted &amp;quot;violently&amp;quot; when a lead pencil was placed next to them. (Nobody knows what this meant, though.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further investigation by the Seattle Police Department disproved the deputies&amp;#39; claims. The police determined that most of the dings pitted the windshields of older cars. In cases were auto lots were involved, brand new cars were unpitted; used cars were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although there were a few rare instances of &amp;quot;copycat&amp;quot; vandalism, most of the cases had a simple explanation: The pits had been there all along -only no one had noticed them until now.
