An intruder broke into the apartment and sexually assaulted Holly before stabbing her 27 times. The five-year old boy was playing outside, but the two-year old girl was in the apartment while the murder took place. One month later, the investigation turned to Juan Rivera, a 19-year old inmate from the Lake Country Jail, who reportedly said he\u2019d seen a potential suspect at a party which took place near the apartment on the night of the murder. Investigators became suspicious when they discovered that no party actually took place at the residence that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting on October 27, Rivera would be questioned for four straight days without an attorney. He admitted to lying about the party, but denied harming Holly Staker. Rivera\u2019s final interrogation session lasted 26 straight hours and he finally cracked and confessed to the murder. However, Rivera suffered a psychotic episode after the confession and had to be put in a padded room, where he was seen banging his head against the wall and rambling incoherently. In spite of this, detectives had Rivera sign a statement. When it was discovered that details in Rivera\u2019s statement were inaccurate, he was interrogated again and detectives kept feeding him details about the crime until most of the inconsistencies in Rivera\u2019s story were corrected and he signed a revised statement. The confession was problematic because Rivera had an IQ of 79 and a history of mental illness, and none of the physical evidence from the crime scene matched him.\nRivera had also been placed on probation and forced to wear an ankle monitor because of a prior burglary charge and electronic monitoring system records showed that he was at his house the entire evening of August 17. For Rivera\u2019s trial, the prosecution was planning to enter a pair of Rivera\u2019s sneakers into evidence which they claimed had the victim\u2019s blood on them. However, defense investigators produced concrete evidence that Rivera did not purchase the sneakers until after the murder took place and they were not even available for the sale in the U.S. on August 17. The shoes were then withdrawn from evidence and decades later, Holly Staker\u2019s blood and DNA from the real perpetrator were found on them, lending credence to the idea that someone planted the blood on the sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the basis of his confession, Rivera was convicted of the murder and received a life sentence. In 1998, his conviction was overturned, but he was found guilty at his second trial. This time, the girl Holly Staker had been babysitting testified and identified Rivera as the perpetrator even though she was only two years old when the crime took place. DNA testing was later performed on a semen sample from the murder scene, excluding Rivera as the perpetrator. His conviction was overturned again, but the state chose to put him on trial for the third time in 2009. Their insane logic was that even though the DNA didn\u2019t match Rivera, he still committed the murder and the semen sample actually belonged to another unidentified person who had consensual sex with Holly shortly before she was murdered! The prosecution\u2019s case was built around convincing the jury that a deceased 11-year old girl was sexually active, as they brought in Holly\u2019s twin sister to share stories about the two of them being sexually abused by one of their brother\u2019s friends when they were eight years old and how they once showed each other how to masturbate. Believe it or not, this strategy actually worked and the jury found Rivera guilty again! However, in 2011, the Appellate Court of Illinois overturned Rivera\u2019s conviction for the third time and took the rare step of barring the state from ever trying him again. Rivera filed a lawsuit and eventually received a $20 million settlement, the largest payout for a wrongful conviction in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a surprising development, the DNA from Holly Staker\u2019s murder would be matched to blood found on a two-by-four used in another crime in January 2000. A Chicago resident named Delwin Foxworth was attacked by three intruders in his home, who proceeded to beat him with a two-by-four, pour gasoline on him, and set him on fire. Foxworth initially survived, but the injuries had such a devastating effect that he died two-and-a-half years later. In 2003, a suspect named Marvin Tyrone Williford was convicted of Foxworth\u2019s murder and received an 80-year sentence. Even though no physical evidence tied Williford to the crime, Foxworth\u2019s girlfriend witnessed the attack and identified Williford as one of the assailants. Williford has always maintained his innocence, but the state claims the lack of physical evidence does not prove Williford wasn\u2019t involved since there were two other unknown participants in the crime. However, Foxworth and Williford have both been excluded as the owners of the DNA on the two-by-four, meaning that Holly Staker\u2019s killer took part in this crime, but has yet to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I analyze this case on this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Trail Went Cold\u201d: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://trailwentcold.com/2017/04/12/the-trail-went-cold-episode-31-holly-staker/\"&gt;http://trailwentcold.com/2017/04/12/the-trail-went-cold-episode-31-holly-staker/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rivera_(wrongful_conviction)\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rivera_(wrongful_conviction)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3850\"&gt;https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3850&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-10/news/chi-dna-links-murder-and-rape-of-holly-staker-11-to-second-murder-8-years-later-20140610_1_holly-staker-dna-evidence-dna-match\"&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-10/news/chi-dna-links-murder-and-rape-of-holly-staker-11-to-second-murder-8-years-later-20140610_1_holly-staker-dna-evidence-dna-match&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "On the evening of August 17, 1992, 11-year old Holly Staker was babysitting two children at a two-flat apartment house in Waukegan, Illinois.
