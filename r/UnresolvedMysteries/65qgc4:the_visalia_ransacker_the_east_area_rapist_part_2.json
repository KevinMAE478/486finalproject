If you&amp;#39;re unaware. I am covering the crime spree committed by The East Area Rapist. My first entry detailed the burglaries in Visalia, California, by the unidentified male known as The Visalia Ransacker. If you would like to learn more on his extensive criminal activity that came to a sudden end on December 10th, 1975, click the link below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/65375l/the_visalia_ransacker_part_1/\"&gt;The Visalia Ransacker - Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, I presumed this topic would only take approximately two posts to share the basic infamous story of The East Area Rapist that the majority of armchair detectives and websleuths alike know rather well. However, as I continued my research, the more interesting tidbits I unearthed. This created another sequence of events that is worthy of its own post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this series will be ongoing, and each new submission will delve deeper into the unbelievable atrocities of quite possibly the most under-the-radar, yet notorious serial rapist and killer in the state of California, and likely the entire United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this coverage, I&amp;#39;m going to present a timeline of events, including the geography. Throughout the listing, I will share minor side notes that are important, but they will be quite brief until I start relaying information on specific attacks in complete detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I won&amp;#39;t be handling &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; case separately, there a handful that are incredibly poignant in terms evidence and the slight variations with The East Area Rapists&amp;#39; demeanor, such as how he treated his victims, the words he specifically chosen to use in his responses, and other characteristics that are debated even to this day regarding the authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginning on June 18th, 1976, an unidentified male dubbed as The East Area Rapist preyed on families in 50 separate attacks in Northern California until the late months of 1979. During this three year stretch, an incomprehensible amount of break-ins, ransacked homes, horrific rapes, and taunting phone calls occurred. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reasons only carved in theories and speculation, the nightmares relocated to Southern California. Although the crimes became less frequent, they unfortunately became more violent, ultimately leading to murder. This deviant behavior ended on May 4th, 1986, with the horrendous rape and murder of eighteen year old, Janelle Lisa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, this murderer was given the moniker, the &lt;em&gt;Original Night Stalker.&lt;/em&gt; During this seven year period, investigators hypothesized this killer was none other than &lt;em&gt;The East Area Rapist,&lt;/em&gt; particularly due to the similar M.O. While the gradual escalation made sense, the distance between the areas of crimes were hard to rationalize. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 2001, DNA recovered from both areas of California officially linked the two various crime sprees together, which led to the name &lt;em&gt;EAR/ONS&lt;/em&gt; (The East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker). In the following years, other hallmark names were given, including &lt;em&gt;GSK&lt;/em&gt; (The Golden State Killer) and &lt;em&gt;DKT&lt;/em&gt; (The Diamond Knot Killer).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In total, this predator went on a ten year binge of fifty rapes and ten plus murders (two of which are debated upon). He has never been apprehended, and why he abruptly stopped has left authorities, investigators, media, normal citizens, and victims in a state of confusion, who are desperately seeking rightful justice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note: There is an ongoing debate on whether VR (Visalia Ransacker) and EAR/ONS is the same person. While there is no evidence in terms of DNA, the similarities between the two are staggering. Nevertheless, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they are equal. However, I feel the individuals are the same person (it seems clear because of the progress and escalation of the types of crimes committed gradually).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last reported crime committed by the Visalia Ransacker occurred on December 10th, 1975, after a close encounter with Detective William McGowen, who attempted to confront the individual, but the perpetrator pulled out a weapon and fired his gun, shattering McGowen&amp;#39;s flashlight and knocking him backwards. The criminal managed to escape and no more break-ins happened in that city of California.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Six months later on Friday, June 18th, 1976, in Rancho Cordova, California -- approximately four hours away from Visalia, CA -- a 23 year old woman who was currently living with her father, was home alone when an intruder broke in, raped and stole petty valuables from the residence. This attack was the beginning of a stretch of nightmares that lasted for ten years, finally coming to an end on May 5th, 1986 (that we know of). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMELINE OF EVENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;June 18, 1976.

Citrus Heights, CA - Adult female, 6:45 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His latest attack is very intriguing solely because of the time-frame. It&amp;#39;s considerably risky. The sun had already risen, thus causing daylight. Furthermore, many people were starting to get ready for work and school. Fleeing the crime scene and not being sighted is marvelous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;October 9, 1976. Saturday.

Citrus Heights, CA - Adult female, 7:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The month of November is interesting for numerous reasons. For one, the assault is the earliest &lt;em&gt;reported&lt;/em&gt; attack. Secondly, November is the month where Law Enforcement held the notorious Town Hall meeting(s). There is much discourse surrounding the possibility of The East Area Rapist being in the assembly at the time. Perhaps the gathering prompted him to strike his victim in an untimely fashion while many residences were away from home. &lt;strong&gt;I will discuss the common misconceptions about those meetings in a later post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;December 18, 1976.

Sacramento, CA - Couple, 1:00 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From here, The East Area Rapist took a mysterious break for approximately three months. Many people surmise summer vacation from schooling, thus involving more risk of being spotted by people who are out and about, and the sun transitioning into dusk. Nevertheless, this is simply conjecture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;September 6, 1977. Tuesday. North Stockton, CA - Couple, 1:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;October 1, 1977. Saturday.

Rancho Cordova, CA - Brian and Katie Maggiore murdered at 9:00 p.m. (There is debate whether or not this was a crime committed by The East Area Rapist).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;March 18, 1978. Friday. Stockton, CA - Couple, 1:05 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;April 6, 1978. Thursday. Rancho Cordova, CA - Adult female&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;April 14, 1978. Friday.

He wouldn&amp;#39;t strike citizens until the following year in March of 1979.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;March 20, 1979. Tuesday.

Goleta, CA - Couple, 2:00 a.m. (Escaped)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the East Area Rapist botched his October 1st attack, his crimes transition towards Southern California. With a new location primarily focused on, his antics began escalating into much darker territory. The rest of his onslaught becomes murder. Moreover, these incursions caused him to adopt another nickname, &lt;em&gt;The Original Night Stalker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;December 30, 1979. Sunday. Goleta, CA - Alexandria Manning and Dr. Robert Offerman, killed by gunshot wounds execution style. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;March 13, 1980. Thursday. Ventura, CA - Charlene and Lyman Smith were bludgeoned to death with a wooden log from their backyard. Charlene was raped prior to her death.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;August 19, 1980. Tuesday. Dana Point, CA - Patrice and Keith Harrington were beaten to death with an unknown instrument.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;February 5, 1981. Thursday. Irvine, CA - Manuela Witthuhn was raped and murdered. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;July 27, 1981. Sunday. Goleta, CA - Cheri Domingo and Gregory Sanchez were shot and bludgeoned with a blunt object.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;May 4, 1986. Sunday. Irvine, CA - Janelle Lisa Cruz was raped and murdered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Original Night Stalker&amp;#39;s attacks during this span of six years is very engrossing. The substantial gaps in time is hard to rationalize. In fact, the incubus disappeared for roughly five years between 1981 and 1986. These intervals have another level of horror than the weekly and monthly barbaric crimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Local citizens were waking up every morning, waiting to read their newspaper to see if any other dreadful atrocities were committed, yet there weren&amp;#39;t any. As the months and years passed by, communities were beginning to feel relief for the first time in a decade. Families started rebuilding their lives and making the necessary endeavors to move on and have peace. Remarkably, many were able to, until The Original Night Stalker made a reappearance for the final time in 1986, ultimately vanishing into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unclear on what happened to the man known as EAR/ONS. What compelled him to disappear for five years, emerge once more, and dematerialize as if he was a supernatural entity? There are too many lingering questions. Is he dead? If he&amp;#39;s alive, did he move out of California and attack elsewhere? How could someone with his personality completely stop after ten years of terrorizing people? Is he in jail for a lesser charge that authorities are unaware of? Perhaps the scariest question of all is, if he&amp;#39;s still alive, could he revitalize his dark obsession? He may even be your neighbor, and you don&amp;#39;t even realize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering the length of this post detailing only a fraction of the terror, part three will be dedicated to the phone calls EAR/ONS made to his victims -- the one&amp;#39;s recorded and otherwise. Moreover, I will be discussing the reported sightings of a prowler in their neighborhoods where victims were attacked. Furthermore, the use of vehicles is an interesting topic as well that could provide valuable clues and connections to The East Area Rapists&amp;#39; possible occupation, or at the very least, his methodical preparation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.coldcase-earons.com/timeline.php#\"&gt;https://www.coldcase-earons.com/timeline.php#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Night_Stalker\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Night_Stalker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thequesterfiles.com/html/the_east_area_rapist__aka_the_.html\"&gt;http://www.thequesterfiles.com/html/the_east_area_rapist__aka_the_.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello.

He wouldn't strike citizens until the following year in March of 1979.\n\n* March 20, 1979. Tuesday. Rancho Cordova, CA - Adult female, 5:15 a.m.\n* April 4, 1979. Thursday. Fremont, CA - Couple, 1:00 a.m.\n* June 2, 1979. Saturday. Walnut Creek, CA - Teenager, 10:30 p.m.\n* June 11, 1979. Monday. Danville, CA - Couple, 4:00 a.m.\n* June 25, 1979. Monday. Walnut Creek, CA - Teenager, 4:15 a.m.\n* July 5, 1979. Thursday. Danville, CA - Couple, 3:45 (Failed attack)\n* October 1, 1979. Monday. Goleta, CA - Couple, 2:00 a.m. (Escaped)\n\n---\n\nWhen the East Area Rapist botched his October 1st attack, his crimes transition towards Southern California. With a new location primarily focused on, his antics began escalating into much darker territory. The rest of his onslaught becomes murder. Moreover, these incursions caused him to adopt another nickname, *The Original Night Stalker.*\n\n* December 30, 1979. Sunday. Goleta, CA - Alexandria Manning and Dr. Robert Offerman, killed by gunshot wounds execution style. \n* March 13, 1980. Thursday. Ventura, CA - Charlene and Lyman Smith were bludgeoned to death with a wooden log from their backyard. Charlene was raped prior to her death.\n* August 19, 1980. Tuesday. Dana Point, CA - Patrice and Keith Harrington were beaten to death with an unknown instrument.\n* February 5, 1981. Thursday. Irvine, CA - Manuela Witthuhn was raped and murdered. \n* July 27, 1981. Sunday. Goleta, CA - Cheri Domingo and Gregory Sanchez were shot and bludgeoned with a blunt object.\n* May 4, 1986. Sunday. Irvine, CA - Janelle Lisa Cruz was raped and murdered.\n\nThe Original Night Stalker's attacks during this span of six years is very engrossing. The substantial gaps in time is hard to rationalize. In fact, the incubus disappeared for roughly five years between 1981 and 1986. These intervals have another level of horror than the weekly and monthly barbaric crimes.\n\nLocal citizens were waking up every morning, waiting to read their newspaper to see if any other dreadful atrocities were committed, yet there weren't any. As the months and years passed by, communities were beginning to feel relief for the first time in a decade. Families started rebuilding their lives and making the necessary endeavors to move on and have peace. Remarkably, many were able to, until The Original Night Stalker made a reappearance for the final time in 1986, ultimately vanishing into thin air.\n\nIt's unclear on what happened to the man known as EAR/ONS. What compelled him to disappear for five years, emerge once more, and dematerialize as if he was a supernatural entity? There are too many lingering questions. Is he dead? If he's alive, did he move out of California and attack elsewhere? How could someone with his personality completely stop after ten years of terrorizing people? Is he in jail for a lesser charge that authorities are unaware of? Perhaps the scariest question of all is, if he's still alive, could he revitalize his dark obsession? He may even be your neighbor, and you don't even realize it.\n\n---\n\nConsidering the length of this post detailing only a fraction of the terror, part three will be dedicated to the phone calls EAR/ONS made to his victims -- the one's recorded and otherwise. Moreover, I will be discussing the reported sightings of a prowler in their neighborhoods where victims were attacked. Furthermore, the use of vehicles is an interesting topic as well that could provide valuable clues and connections to The East Area Rapists' possible occupation, or at the very least, his methodical preparation.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nhttps://www.coldcase-earons.com/timeline.php#\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Night_Stalker\n\nhttp://www.thequesterfiles.com/html/the_east_area_rapist__aka_the_.html ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Unresolved Crime", "id": "65qgc4", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 155, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nerdfather1", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65qgc4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.UnresolvedMysteries", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "edited": 1492389549.0, "link_flair_css_class": "crime", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/65qgc4/the_visalia_ransacker_the_east_area_rapist_part_2/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492394616.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/65qgc4/the_visalia_ransacker_the_east_area_rapist_part_2/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "The Visalia Ransacker - The East Area Rapist part 2", "created_utc": 1492365816.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 69, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 155}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qgc4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qgc4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qgc4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3q9f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fullercorp", "parent_id": "t1_dgcqw27", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the employment possibilities stand out to me.
