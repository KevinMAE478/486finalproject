I have family in this city, and one of my aunts actually knew the missing boy&amp;#39;s family, so, for us, it was kind of a big deal. It definitely did hit national news at the time, but I haven&amp;#39;t found anything about it in this sub, so I decided to tell the story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, a 6 year old boy went missing, and, after a dubious investigation, the wife and daughter of the mayor of the city were accused of ordering his murder in a black magic ritual. They confessed, but then, after that, started to swear their innocence, and reported being tortured so they would confess the crime. It was the longest trial of the Brazilian history, and it&amp;#39;s a quite controversial case, and, to this day, I don&amp;#39;t know what to believe. This might be really long, and I apologize for any mistakes, as English is not my native language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found only &lt;a href=\"http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/satanic-cult-killings-spread-fear-in-brazil/article_8740ae98-48e8-5773-8fac-6049ed826457.html\"&gt;one article in english&lt;/a&gt; about the case. I&amp;#39;ll link more at the end, but, unfortunately, they&amp;#39;ll be in portuguese only. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An overlook of the case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A 6 year old boy, Evandro Ramos Caetano, went missing on April 7th 1992, in the seaside town of Guaratuba - PR, in southern Brazil. Five days later, a mutilated body was found in a bush. The corpse was given as it were Evandro&amp;#39;s body, and the police concluded that he had been murdered in a ritual performed by the &amp;quot;pai de santo&amp;quot; (male priest of Umbanda or Candombl\u00e9, afro-brazilian religions) Osvaldo Marcineiro, with the help of Vicente de Paula, Davi dos Santos, Sergio Crithofolini e Airton Bardelli, ordered by Celina and Beatriz Abagge (wife and daughter of the then Mayor of the town, Aldo Abagge).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were all arrested, and, after a confession, started to swear their innocence. In the confession, a black magic ritual was described in detail, in which the child was held by his hands and feet, while De Paula strangled him and cut his neck. Then the genitals and viscera were removed from the body, and the hands and feet cut off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The brutal story took on frightening proportions when the accused began to report scenes of torture they would had been subjected to confessing to the crime. Through legal procedures the trials of those involved were successively postponed.  To this day, four of the seven people involved were considered guilty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1992 - The crime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1992, the Mayor of Guaratuba was Aldo Abagge. The family was well known and considered very wealthy. They also owned a sawmill in the city. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maria Ramos Caetano, mother of the missing boy, Evandro Ramos Caetano, worked as a secretary in a public school run by the city hall. She worked on mornings and Evandro went to school on afternoons. So, she usually took him with her when she went to work, because she didn&amp;#39;t have anyone to take care of him while she was working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the morning of the crime, April 6th 1992, he was with her at the school, as always. They lived less than 100 meters from the school, and it was a small town so, when, around 10 AM he complained that he was feeling hungry, his mother gave him the house key and told him to go get something to eat at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t return to the school, and, when she got off work and went home, she saw that he wasn&amp;#39;t there too. She noted that he probably hadn&amp;#39;t even got home, because it seemed like nothing had been touched. So, he probably disappeared in the way home from school. His disappearance caused a commotion in the town, police was involved, everyone was looking for him. A witness said that she saw a boy getting in a car at the place and time he was believed to had been kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday, April 11th 1992, five days after he disappeared, a body was found in a bush. Some construction workers noted vultures in the area, and went to check out what was happening, finding the body of a child, laying in its back, with two straight cuts in the chest and nothing in its interior. His hands and feet were cut off, his scalp was removed and his eyes were missing. There were also some other lesions. He was wearing only a pair of shorts, and there was a key chain next to the body. The police was called, and, later, Evandro&amp;#39;s parents recognized the body as their son&amp;#39;s.  The shorts were the same that he was wearing, and the key chain was the one from the key to their home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1992 - The Investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several evidence was found to support the black magic theory. Some believe that police was led to believe in that by Diogenes Caetano, cousin of Evandro&amp;#39;s father, and son of a former mayor of the town who had a personal grudge towards the Abagge&amp;#39;s family. That&amp;#39;s where the controversy begins. I&amp;#39;ll just present what was found and what the police believed was true at the time, and try to be as impartial as I can. It&amp;#39;s really hard to find reliable information, because the case is very controversial and the visions are so polarized that the articles will almost always tend to one side or the other, and it&amp;#39;s very hard to know that to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The witness who saw a boy getting into a car at the same time and place Evandro disappeared confirmed that the car was the same color and model as Celina&amp;#39;s. But her testimony was then ruled out of the investigation because she had history of drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body was recognized as Evandro by the parents. The clothes were the same as his, and the key was found near the body. There is a DNA report that says the body is Evandro&amp;#39;s, as well as a dental arch match. Yet, there were controversial reports during the investigation. It was said that the body didn&amp;#39;t match Evandro&amp;#39;s age, that it must had been an older boy. Other report said that the corpse estimated time of death didn&amp;#39;t match Evandro&amp;#39;s disappearance time, and that boy was dead for a longer time. The inconsistency in the investigation, and the controversy about whose body&amp;#39;s it was is very important in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police believed that Beatriz Abagge was having an affair with &amp;quot;pai de santo&amp;quot; Osvaldo Marcineiro. It is said that this was no secret and &amp;quot;the whole town knew that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A witness said that, in the rituals Osvaldo performed, he was known to do to animal bodies the same kind of mutilation that was made in Evandro&amp;#39;s body (taking out the viscera, removing the scalp, the genitals and the eyes, cutting off hands and feet). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city hall prohibited the papers to talk about the case initially. Some people believe they were concerned about the town&amp;#39;s reputation, but others believe this was the Abagge&amp;#39;s family way of trying to cover up what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A witness saw a black car in the street the body was found several times that week. It was believed that car belonged to Osvald Marcineiro, or one of his associates. This same witness claim that in the night of April 8, two cars parked very quickly in the street where the body was found. A woman, identified as Celina Abagge, left one of the cars and got inside of the other. Then, both of the cars left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believed that the crime was committed in the Abagge&amp;#39;s family sawmill. In the location, some objects linked to black magic rituals and Afro-Brazillian religions were found. There was human blood in some of the objects, but it was never confirmed that the blood was Evandro&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osvaldo Marcineiro and some of his associates were arrested in July 1st 1992, and confessed to have committed the crime. They pointed Celina and Beatriz as the ones who ordered the crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 1992, police invaded the Abagge&amp;#39;s home and arrested Celina and Beatriz. The case gained national repercussion, and they started to be known as &amp;quot;The Witches from Guaratuba&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celina and Beatriz confessed to participate in Evandro&amp;#39;s murder, in a tape recorded by the police. The confession is said to be &amp;quot;very detailed&amp;quot;. Yet, two months after the confession, they claimed to have been tortured by the police to confess. A report states that there were found bruises on Beatriz&amp;#39;s body, but there was no sign further of torture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diogenes Caetano is said to had been involved in the investigation since the beginning. He said that &amp;quot;everybody knew that she [Celina] was involved with black magic stuff for a while&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s said that he has a personal grudge against Celina, so his view of the story might not be impartial because of that, and, to those who believe the Abagge&amp;#39;s innocence, he&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;villan&amp;quot; of the story, who led the police to believe his own delusion. He even wrote a book called &amp;quot;A Verdadeira Hist\u00f3ria do Caso Evandro&amp;quot; (The truth about Evandro&amp;#39;s case), that tells, in detail, what he and the family of the victim believe to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several interviews with Beatriz and Celina, in which they cry and talk about having been tortured physically, psychologically and sexually by the police to confess the crime. Celina even argues that Diogenes was involved in those tortures, and that she remembers being in the trunk of his car, being taken to his father&amp;#39;s house. They say that Osvaldo and the other men were also tortured to point them as the orderers of the crime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celina and Beatriz spent 3 years and nine months in prison, and other 3 years in home prison until the first trial, in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1998 - The first trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Celina and Beatriz were judged not guilty by a popular jury. The jurors understood that there was no concrete evidence that the body found in a bush was Evandro&amp;#39;s. In spite of the sentence, the judge determined, at the time, a new investigation to ascertain the identity of the corpse and the conditions of the death. It has never been known whether this determination was adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor was not satisfied with the decision and assured that he would appeal and obtain the annulment of the jury. The parents were also desolated, and affirmed that they had recognized the body of their son and protested against the result. Finally, Celina and Beatriz left the courtroom as innocent women, celebrating the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2003 - The second trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On September 4th 2003 the jury that acquitted Celina and Beatriz was annulled. The annulment occurred because the decision of the jurors was contrary to the evidence in the case. The jurors didn&amp;#39;t recognize the corpse found to be Evandro&amp;#39;s. But the matter was further examined and it was concluded that the jury&amp;#39;s decision is manifestly contrary to the evidence in the case file, since there were reports of dental examinations and DNA - this resulted in 99,99% positive - scientifically proving the identity of the corpse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the defense, among the reports presented during the trial, there was a necropsy examination that denied that the body found was Evandro&amp;#39;s and based on this document the jurors decided for the acquittal of the defendants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2004 - The third trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three of the five men involved were found guilty by the jury on the night of April 26th 2004. &amp;quot;Pai de santo&amp;quot; Osvaldo Marcineiro, 43, and the painter Vicente de Paula Ferreira, 54, were sentenced to 20 years and 2 months. The third accused, the craftsman Davi dos Santos Soares, 42, was acquitted of the crime of abduction, but guilty of the murder. His sentence was stipulated in 18 years and 8 months in prison. The three men were handcuffed straight to the prison after the trial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument most used by defense lawyers was that the only evidence that existed was the confessions of the accused, which they said were obtained by the police through torture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 - Fourth Trial&lt;/strong&gt;\nBeatriz was judged again. At the time, Celina, Beatriz&amp;#39;s mother, wasn&amp;#39;t judged. The Brazilian law establishes that the maximum period of prescription of a crime is 20 years and that, when the defendant turns 70, the term counts in half, which is the case of Beatriz&amp;#39;s mother. As more than ten years elapsed between the trials, Celina can no longer be punished for this crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beatriz Abagge was sentenced on Saturday, May 28th 2011 by the jurors in the Court of Jury, for the death of the boy Evandro Ramos Caetano, that took place in 1992, in Guaratuba. Voting was tight: 4 x 3. Evandro&amp;#39;s mother, Maria Ramos Caetano, declared at the end of the trial that justice was finally done and believes that now the son&amp;#39;s soul will rest in peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But... what really happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very controversial case, and opinions are divided. The media coverage paints Celina and Beatriz Abagge as poor innocent women who were falsely accused of a crime they didn&amp;#39;t commit. Almost every article about the case is very partial, and takes the side of the defense. But the family of the missing boy is very sure about the Abagge&amp;#39;s guilt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Theory -&lt;/strong&gt; Celina and Beatriz Abagge are innocent, and the police was led to believe they committed the crime. For people who believe this story, a staging was set up with the intention of harming the Abagge family. The mayor of Guaratuba at the time, was the father of Beatriz and husband of Celina, and was also suspected of the crime. It&amp;#39;s believed that the true responsible for this is Diogenes Caetano, who grew up believing that the reason his parents divorced was an extra marital affair his father, also a former mayor of Guaratuba, had with Celina Abagge when he was still a teenager. These people believe that, motived by revenge, he led the police to error, and, after that, the investigation had no return. The confessions signed by Beatriz and Celina are believed to have been obtained under torture. They think Evandro may have been kidnapped to, to be sold abroad by gangs that, at the time, practiced this type of crime in the region. Another boy had also disappeared in the town earlier in 1992, named Leandro Bossi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Theory -&lt;/strong&gt; Celina and Beatriz Abagge are guilty. They asked for a ritual of black magic to Osvaldo Marcineiro, a &amp;quot;pai de santo&amp;quot; who had lived in Guaratuba, to bring money and prosperity to the family, because the Abagge business was in difficulties. They would have kidnapped the boy, who was held for 24 hours gagged and then killed inside the Abagge family sawmill. Evandro had his hands, feet and ears cut off, being found without the viscera and without the scalp, in an advanced state of putrefaction, in a brush near the Abagge house. Clay objects that would have been used in the ritual were found in the sawmill. They confessed the crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, personaly, have no idea. I realize the whole case may sound ridiculous to someone outside of the country, but a person asking for a black magic ritual is actually very believable here in Brazil, even more like 25 years ago. I must say, Afro Brazillian religions have nothing to do with black magic rituals and the murder of children, they are very popular and very legitimate religions with tons of followers here, and I&amp;#39;m not saying that all of this people are murderers and &amp;quot;witches&amp;quot;. But, you know, there&amp;#39;s crazy people everywhere. I&amp;#39;m just saying that rituals to spirits (what they call &amp;quot;trabalhos&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;macumba&amp;quot; here) are really a thing and very popular. So it&amp;#39;s not crazy to believe that someone would order a ritual asking for money and prosperity, as people do this all the time. Killing a child in the process is, in fact, not common, and very sick and weird. But, like I said, psychos are everywhere. People have killed and still do in the name of various religions, so, it&amp;#39;s not that hard to believe that this could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the way the crime was investigated was, indeed, very skecthy. It&amp;#39;s hard to know what&amp;#39;s true and what&amp;#39;s not, because, like I said, the media took sides on this case and usually only tells the Abagge&amp;#39;s family side of the story, painting what happened to them as a terrible tragedy, and almost forgetting the pain of the missing boy&amp;#39;s family. The only way you can have access to the other side of the story is through the book written by Diogenes Caetano Filho, cousin of Evandro&amp;#39;s father. But, as it was explained, many people believe that his view of the case is also very partial, as he has a personal vendetta with the Abagge family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if the Abagge&amp;#39;s are innocent, then who killed Evandro? If the body is not Evandro&amp;#39;s body, then who is it? If Evandro was not killed, then where is he? If it wasn&amp;#39;t a satanic ritual, then who killed a child, cut off his hands and feet, removed his eyes, his scalp, his genitals and his viscera? And why would anyone do that? Also... if the family is porposefully trying to blame the Abagge&amp;#39;s even knowing they didn&amp;#39;t do it, why? Is the personal grudge more important than finding who really did kill Evandro? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many questions. I&amp;#39;d love to hear some opinions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Links (in portuguese)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.gabrielasoudapaz.org/memorial/303-Evandro-Ramos-Caetano.htm\"&gt;collection of news about the case through the years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://istoe.com.br/133790_AS+BRUXAS+DE+GUARATUBA/\"&gt;Interview with the Abagge&amp;#39;s where they claim their innocence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fabiocampana.com.br/2011/05/delegado-diz-que-caso-evandro-foi-uma-farsa-para-acusar-familia-abagge/comment-page-1/\"&gt;Interview with a police officer who says the case is a farce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com.br/books?id=PAEx__zN4hsC&amp;amp;pg=PA49&amp;amp;lpg=PA50&amp;amp;focus=viewport&amp;amp;dq=%22caso+evandro%22+*+o+globo&amp;amp;hl=pt-BR#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false\"&gt;Book Evandro&amp;#39;s uncle wrote about the family&amp;#39;s view of what happened - only parts are avaliable online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pr.ricmais.com.br/balanco-geral-curitiba/videos/familia-do-garoto-evandro-desabafa-24-anos-apos-o-crime-em-guaratuba/\"&gt;Video interview with Evandro&amp;#39;s family asking for justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://sao-paulo.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,o-juri-da-bruxa-de-guaratuba-imp-,725252\"&gt;National news about Beatriz Abagge being condemmed in 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/projetohumanos/o-caso-evandro-trailer-s04\"&gt;A very cool podcast about the case, with interviews and even audios of the confession tapes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So this case happened in 1992, in a city near where I live, in southern Brazil.

In the location, some objects linked to black magic rituals and Afro-Brazillian religions were found. There was human blood in some of the objects, but it was never confirmed that the blood was Evandro's.\n\n* Osvaldo Marcineiro and some of his associates were arrested in July 1st 1992, and confessed to have committed the crime. They pointed Celina and Beatriz as the ones who ordered the crime.\n\n* On July 1992, police invaded the Abagge's home and arrested Celina and Beatriz. The case gained national repercussion, and they started to be known as \"The Witches from Guaratuba\". \n\n* Celina and Beatriz confessed to participate in Evandro's murder, in a tape recorded by the police. The confession is said to be \"very detailed\". Yet, two months after the confession, they claimed to have been tortured by the police to confess. A report states that there were found bruises on Beatriz's body, but there was no sign further of torture. \n\n* Diogenes Caetano is said to had been involved in the investigation since the beginning. He said that \"everybody knew that she [Celina] was involved with black magic stuff for a while\". It's said that he has a personal grudge against Celina, so his view of the story might not be impartial because of that, and, to those who believe the Abagge's innocence, he's the \"villan\" of the story, who led the police to believe his own delusion. He even wrote a book called \"A Verdadeira Hist\u00f3ria do Caso Evandro\" (The truth about Evandro's case), that tells, in detail, what he and the family of the victim believe to be true.\n\n* There are several interviews with Beatriz and Celina, in which they cry and talk about having been tortured physically, psychologically and sexually by the police to confess the crime. Celina even argues that Diogenes was involved in those tortures, and that she remembers being in the trunk of his car, being taken to his father's house. They say that Osvaldo and the other men were also tortured to point them as the orderers of the crime. \n\n* Celina and Beatriz spent 3 years and nine months in prison, and other 3 years in home prison until the first trial, in 1998.\n\n**1998 - The first trial**\n\nIn 1998, Celina and Beatriz were judged not guilty by a popular jury. The jurors understood that there was no concrete evidence that the body found in a bush was Evandro's. In spite of the sentence, the judge determined, at the time, a new investigation to ascertain the identity of the corpse and the conditions of the death. It has never been known whether this determination was adhered to.\n\nThe prosecutor was not satisfied with the decision and assured that he would appeal and obtain the annulment of the jury. The parents were also desolated, and affirmed that they had recognized the body of their son and protested against the result. Finally, Celina and Beatriz left the courtroom as innocent women, celebrating the sentence.\n\n**2003 - The second trial**\n\nOn September 4th 2003 the jury that acquitted Celina and Beatriz was annulled. The annulment occurred because the decision of the jurors was contrary to the evidence in the case. The jurors didn't recognize the corpse found to be Evandro's. But the matter was further examined and it was concluded that the jury's decision is manifestly contrary to the evidence in the case file, since there were reports of dental examinations and DNA - this resulted in 99,99% positive - scientifically proving the identity of the corpse.\n\nAccording to the defense, among the reports presented during the trial, there was a necropsy examination that denied that the body found was Evandro's and based on this document the jurors decided for the acquittal of the defendants.\n\n**2004 - The third trial**\n\nThree of the five men involved were found guilty by the jury on the night of April 26th 2004. \"Pai de santo\" Osvaldo Marcineiro, 43, and the painter Vicente de Paula Ferreira, 54, were sentenced to 20 years and 2 months. The third accused, the craftsman Davi dos Santos Soares, 42, was acquitted of the crime of abduction, but guilty of the murder. His sentence was stipulated in 18 years and 8 months in prison. The three men were handcuffed straight to the prison after the trial.\n\nThe argument most used by defense lawyers was that the only evidence that existed was the confessions of the accused, which they said were obtained by the police through torture.\n\n**2011 - Fourth Trial**\nBeatriz was judged again. At the time, Celina, Beatriz's mother, wasn't judged. The Brazilian law establishes that the maximum period of prescription of a crime is 20 years and that, when the defendant turns 70, the term counts in half, which is the case of Beatriz's mother. As more than ten years elapsed between the trials, Celina can no longer be punished for this crime.\n\nBeatriz Abagge was sentenced on Saturday, May 28th 2011 by the jurors in the Court of Jury, for the death of the boy Evandro Ramos Caetano, that took place in 1992, in Guaratuba. Voting was tight: 4 x 3. Evandro's mother, Maria Ramos Caetano, declared at the end of the trial that justice was finally done and believes that now the son's soul will rest in peace.\n\n**But... what really happened?**\n\nIt's a very controversial case, and opinions are divided. The media coverage paints Celina and Beatriz Abagge as poor innocent women who were falsely accused of a crime they didn't commit. Almost every article about the case is very partial, and takes the side of the defense. But the family of the missing boy is very sure about the Abagge's guilt.  \n\n**1st Theory -** Celina and Beatriz Abagge are innocent, and the police was led to believe they committed the crime. For people who believe this story, a staging was set up with the intention of harming the Abagge family. The mayor of Guaratuba at the time, was the father of Beatriz and husband of Celina, and was also suspected of the crime. It's believed that the true responsible for this is Diogenes Caetano, who grew up believing that the reason his parents divorced was an extra marital affair his father, also a former mayor of Guaratuba, had with Celina Abagge when he was still a teenager. These people believe that, motived by revenge, he led the police to error, and, after that, the investigation had no return. The confessions signed by Beatriz and Celina are believed to have been obtained under torture. They think Evandro may have been kidnapped to, to be sold abroad by gangs that, at the time, practiced this type of crime in the region. Another boy had also disappeared in the town earlier in 1992, named Leandro Bossi.\n\n**2nd Theory -** Celina and Beatriz Abagge are guilty. They asked for a ritual of black magic to Osvaldo Marcineiro, a \"pai de santo\" who had lived in Guaratuba, to bring money and prosperity to the family, because the Abagge business was in difficulties. They would have kidnapped the boy, who was held for 24 hours gagged and then killed inside the Abagge family sawmill. Evandro had his hands, feet and ears cut off, being found without the viscera and without the scalp, in an advanced state of putrefaction, in a brush near the Abagge house. Clay objects that would have been used in the ritual were found in the sawmill. They confessed the crime.\n\nI, personaly, have no idea. I realize the whole case may sound ridiculous to someone outside of the country, but a person asking for a black magic ritual is actually very believable here in Brazil, even more like 25 years ago. I must say, Afro Brazillian religions have nothing to do with black magic rituals and the murder of children, they are very popular and very legitimate religions with tons of followers here, and I'm not saying that all of this people are murderers and \"witches\". But, you know, there's crazy people everywhere. I'm just saying that rituals to spirits (what they call \"trabalhos\" or \"macumba\" here) are really a thing and very popular. So it's not crazy to believe that someone would order a ritual asking for money and prosperity, as people do this all the time. Killing a child in the process is, in fact, not common, and very sick and weird. But, like I said, psychos are everywhere. People have killed and still do in the name of various religions, so, it's not that hard to believe that this could have happened.\n\nBut the way the crime was investigated was, indeed, very skecthy. It's hard to know what's true and what's not, because, like I said, the media took sides on this case and usually only tells the Abagge's family side of the story, painting what happened to them as a terrible tragedy, and almost forgetting the pain of the missing boy's family. The only way you can have access to the other side of the story is through the book written by Diogenes Caetano Filho, cousin of Evandro's father. But, as it was explained, many people believe that his view of the case is also very partial, as he has a personal vendetta with the Abagge family. \n\nBut, if the Abagge's are innocent, then who killed Evandro? If the body is not Evandro's body, then who is it? If Evandro was not killed, then where is he? If it wasn't a satanic ritual, then who killed a child, cut off his hands and feet, removed his eyes, his scalp, his genitals and his viscera? And why would anyone do that? Also... if the family is porposefully trying to blame the Abagge's even knowing they didn't do it, why? Is the personal grudge more important than finding who really did kill Evandro? \n\nSo many questions. I'd love to hear some opinions. \n\n**Some Links (in portuguese)**\n\n[collection of news about the case through the years] (http://www.gabrielasoudapaz.org/memorial/303-Evandro-Ramos-Caetano.htm)\n\n[Interview with the Abagge's where they claim their innocence](http://istoe.com.br/133790_AS+BRUXAS+DE+GUARATUBA/)\n\n[Interview with a police officer who says the case is a farce]( http://www.fabiocampana.com.br/2011/05/delegado-diz-que-caso-evandro-foi-uma-farsa-para-acusar-familia-abagge/comment-page-1/)\n\n[Book Evandro's uncle wrote about the family's view of what happened - only parts are avaliable online] (https://books.google.com.br/books?id=PAEx__zN4hsC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=%22caso+evandro%22+*+o+globo&amp;hl=pt-BR#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\n[Video interview with Evandro's family asking for justice](https://pr.ricmais.com.br/balanco-geral-curitiba/videos/familia-do-garoto-evandro-desabafa-24-anos-apos-o-crime-em-guaratuba/)\n\n[National news about Beatriz Abagge being condemmed in 2011](http://sao-paulo.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,o-juri-da-bruxa-de-guaratuba-imp-,725252)\n\n[A very cool podcast about the case, with interviews and even audios of the confession tapes](https://soundcloud.com/projetohumanos/o-caso-evandro-trailer-s04)\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "657wnz", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 60, "report_reasons": null, "author": "magicbeings", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_657wnz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.UnresolvedMysteries", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/657wnz/6yearold_boy_goes_missing_in_brazil_in_1992_and/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142435.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/657wnz/6yearold_boy_goes_missing_in_brazil_in_1992_and/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "6-year-old boy goes missing in Brazil in 1992, and his death is attributed to a black magic ritual.
