But dry drowning is a thing that happens. Submersion in water can result in a spasm of the larynx due to a sudden intake of air. The vacuum caused by the movement of the diaphragm cannot be relieved, as the airway is closed. This results in asphyxiation. You end with a drowning victim who does not have water in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common reaction to entering very cold water is a sudden inhalation of air, a gasp. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "name": "t1_dgdozk7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474665.0, "created_utc": 1492445865.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvlyj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Supreme000", "parent_id": "t1_dgcv83v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's just too obvious there is something going on.
