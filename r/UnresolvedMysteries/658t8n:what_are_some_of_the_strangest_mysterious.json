Some have argued they could have been hiding from predators or other humans. \nSome suggest over 30,000 people inhabited the underground city it is over 280 foot deep containing religious centres, store rooms and stables for livestock.\nThere are underground cities located all over the world most probably still remain undiscovered.\n\nFrom the Ahnenerbe (expedition) the Nazi\u2019s believed they managed to trace back the Aryan Race to the [Gobi Desert](http://www.desertusa.com/images/Gobi-map.jpg) located in central Asia claiming they lived underground as a result of weathering, they also believed the Aryan race stored secrets about their formation in these underground cities claiming the race was produced by \u201cLord Himalaya\u201d.\n\nThis race is believed to have formed 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.\n\nSome go as far as saying that the Aryan race battled these underground aliens for many years.\n\nAfter the Nazi expedition one of the explorers reported back to the press claiming to have created a submarine base in Antarctica.\nAfter the war many pictures were released of Nazi Spaceship Type aircrafts which had been stored and created at these bases. The Nazi\u2019s claimed under the Ahnenerbe they used psychics and looked into past civilizations to find the blueprints of these crafts.\nThese crafts were reported to work by electromagnetic propulsion methods, many different crafts were created such as the Kraut Meteor, The Avro Disc, The Schauberger Models, The Bellonzo Diskus and many more.\n\nBy 1940 The Nazi\u2019s were believed to have a fleet of different Spacecrafts however only a few could take flight as they were still in early development. During Hitlers downfall its believed he ordered for the destruction of these crafts some believe the technology was taken by the U.S. and Russia and continues in use today.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Request", "id": "658t8n", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 1010, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EarthAngelEarthAngel", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_658t8n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.UnresolvedMysteries", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "reqst", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/658t8n/what_are_some_of_the_strangest_mysterious/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492151588.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/658t8n/what_are_some_of_the_strangest_mysterious/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "What are some of the strangest mysterious military projects which have been declassified?", "created_utc": 1492122788.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 189, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1010}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658t8n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658t8n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg920ty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "citoloco", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yhe7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UnresolvedMysteries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is the most awesome thing I've heard about in a while.
