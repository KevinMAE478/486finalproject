In particular, phone records from Illinois Bell showed that Tessier made a collect call to his mother that evening from a pay phone in downtown Rockford rather than from Sycamore as alleged at his trial. Given the timing of the telephone call, the approximately 40-mile distance between Sycamore and Rockford, and icy road conditions, Schmack concluded that Tessier could not possibly have been in Sycamore at the time of Maria Ridulph&amp;#39;s disappearance.
