When Ben&amp;#39;s truck was discovered in the dive site&amp;#39;s parking lot unmoved two days later, the police were called and recovery divers gathered.

The Wikipedia page about his disappearance contains tons of info, and is pretty concise. When I first learned of this case, I was excited to see so much info for a missing persons case, but it goes so so much &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt;, and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;d really like to bring to the table. While I, in no way, would ever scuba diver (I have deep rooted fear of drowning, after I nearly drowned in a neighbors pool at age 3), for some reason cases involving water spark my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Ben_McDaniel\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Ben_McDaniel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little key to my abbreviations for names and various vocabulary I use throughout the series, so I don&amp;#39;t have to type them out each time.

This, along with the behavior of Ben&amp;#39;s parents, frustrated the volunteer recovery divers, who were not paid for their time or supplies/use of gear. This info was soon shared on an online diving community forum, which has threads specifically for friends/family/other divers to pay their respects to a lost diver, as well as &amp;quot;accidents and incidents&amp;quot; threads where any mistakes made by the diver are discussed, in an effort to help prevent something similar from happening in the future. The online diving community warn family and friends that the topic might be difficult or seem insensitive, and strongly encourage them to not read through those threads. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When searches came up empty and divers explaining that it would be suicide for them to go any further in the cave, Ben&amp;#39;s parents asked LE to borrow their $54,000 ROV (remotely operated vehicle). When that didn&amp;#39;t work, Ben&amp;#39;s parents put out a $10,000 (then upped to $30,000) reward for anyone &amp;quot;brave enough&amp;quot; to search the deepest depths of VS, offending many of the renowned divers who risked their lives already searching for their son. One of the divers even made it 20 feet past the map, and has said that there&amp;#39;s no way a man bigger than him could go any farther.. The diving community&amp;#39;s worst fears about the reward were realized when another uncertified diver went around the gate, and drowned in the cave. Theories began popping up that maybe Ben wasn&amp;#39;t even in the cave. Maybe he&amp;#39;s not even dead...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the end, it all boils down to-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) Ben is in the cave, he is dead, and his body is hidden/covered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) Ben is not in the cave, he is dead, and his body is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) Ben is not in the cave, but he is alive elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D) Ben is in the cave, and he is alive. (I&amp;#39;m only including this one for the sake of being comprehensive, and to include a crackpot theory later for fun. Ben cannot be alive and in the cave because the entire passage is underwater, and there is no other exit or hidden above water cavern.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll discuss all the possible theories and outcomes in an upcoming part of this series, because there is tons of info I&amp;#39;d like you all to have, to really form an opinion that has some evidence behind it. That is what will make the best discussion for us all (and admittedly, the part I&amp;#39;m looking forward to the most). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this series of write ups, I hope to have you all flipping and flopping with the mental gymnastics I still find myself doing, even after all this research!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving info/jargon, and background info about VS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we get into Ben&amp;#39;s story, there is some background info, diver jargon, and technical aspects of scuba diving, that I feel is necessary to really discuss this case. Here&amp;#39;s a bit of info to give clarification for those of us who prefer dry land...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, to get us all acquainted with the dangers of cave diving, &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Z1iaa04rCf0\"&gt;here is an educational video&lt;/a&gt; that explains the dangers of how non certified divers can easily meet their doom by venturing into an underwater cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just north of Ponce De Leon, FL, Vortex Spring is a freshwater spring that gently flows outwards. It remains a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit all year. The cave and spring are a part of a resort with beautifully clear water for fledgling and seasoned scuba divers, a dive shop, a favorite swimming hole, and camping grounds. The underwater cave stretches over 1600 feet (now believed to be over 1700ft)  into the earth, at a depth of about 160 feet at the deepest point. Since every map of VS online is potato quality, I&amp;#39;ve drawn both the painted one above, and a simple one in the next link for us to reference throughout this series. My scale isn&amp;#39;t exact, but I got as close as I could without being a cave diver myself.  I made it by overlaying screen shots of the map from the disappeared episode, then drawing a new map on top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a small album of my simple map, the potato map, and some shots of a diver at the gate, and in the tight confines to the cave: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/KdnZJ\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/KdnZJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VS is shaped much like a bathroom sink: there is a basin with a large cavern at the bottom like the bowl of a sink. Then there is a gate (like a drain cover) that blocks the entrance to the cave (which is like the pipe).  As you sink to the bottom, there is an opening below, like the drain of our sink metaphor, followed by a cavern. The tunnel after the Piano Room then leads to the cave. (As a fun side note, the piano room was named so because that section of the cave makes neat sounds from divers exhaled breath). The passage turns and tightens like a J-pipe as it leads to a locked gate. While the gate isn&amp;#39;t actually the beginning of the cave, the gate was placed in a section where it&amp;#39;d fit best. The gate area is pitch black, with a little string of LEDs. Divers without the proper certification are warned not to enter the deeper caverns, then warned again not to enter the cave&amp;#39;s opening well before one would reach the gate. VS has a pipe (used for sand dredging as needed) that lays on the cave&amp;#39;s floor, to act as a guide. Cave divers also use lines, which are reels of wire/cable/rope that they lay out in the cave as they explore, so that they can find their way out if they become disoriented or lose their light source/visibility. When laying line, they sink connectors into the rock, and unspool as they make their way in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Open Water diving (OW) is where there is always water/sky stays above you. Over Head diving (OH) is any diving where there is anything but water/sky above you, including large caverns or ship wrecks. Cave diving, (CD) or penatration diving is when there is overhead and restrictions in movement. I marked on the map what OW and OH sections of the spring are approx. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th marks on the map are the restrictions, where it is incredibly difficult to squeeze through. Backmount is where a diver wears tanks on the back, Sidemount is where the tanks are positioned under the armpits along your flanks (which is necessary in order to get past the 2nd restriction.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dives over 30 meters (100ft )deep require special training involving stops at depths and/or the mixing different gasses to prevent decompression sickness, or &amp;quot;the bends&amp;quot;. Divers usually get the bends when they don&amp;#39;t allow enough time and/or dont use the special gas mixes for deep dives. The water pressure causes the dissolved nitrogen gasses normally found in the bloodstream to collect, creating bubbles that tend to pool in joints, and sometimes even causing embolisms. The bends can be as mild as pain in joints, paralysis, but also as scary as embolisms, and death. Diving past the gate at VS would require special gas mixes (the dive shop sells one called Nitrox), to help prevent the bends.  Deep dives also run rhe risk of nitrogen narcosis at depth too. For some dives, helium is added to the mix to &amp;quot;take the place&amp;quot; of nitrogen. Too much nitrogen in the body causes Nitrogen narcosis, which is similar to feeling drunk, often disorienting the diver, causing the diver to make mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now on to Ben&amp;#39;s background and his disappearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ben was an avid open water (OW) scuba diver, and was a frequent face at Vortex Spring during the 4 months prior to his disappearance. He was on a bit of a sabbatical after a particularly difficult time in his life. Ben comes from an affluent family near Memphis, TN consisting of his mom and dad, Patti (PM) and Shelby (SM), and two brothers Tim (TM) and Paul (PMD). Ben tried a few different &amp;quot;hats&amp;quot; trying to find his place in the world, but often found himself in trouble. He had a successful construction business, but an untrustworthy business partner and the US housing crash left Ben in ruins. He owed the IRS about $50,000 in taxes, jobs were left unfisnished, he had legal troubles, his marriage dissolved, he had to sell his $450,000 home (which was gifted to him by his grandfather for a mere $10) that he&amp;#39;d taken a $200,000 mortgage on. On top of all this, he suffered an even greater blow. When Ben arrived at his parent&amp;#39;s home one day, he found his youngest brother, Paul (22), unresponsive. Paul was hospitalized immediately, but was found to be brain dead. His family decided to take Paul off of life support, and nobly donate his organs. Paul&amp;#39;s death, along with his other woes, caused Ben to spiral into depression. His parents offered to support Ben financially, while also letting him move into their beach home down in Florida, as a way to sort out his life and emotional well being. Right before Ben dissappeared, he spent time with his family and girlfriend in TN for his mother&amp;#39;s birthday, where he expressed his tremendous appreciation for his parent&amp;#39;s help. The sunshine, fresh air, and scuba diving seemed to be doing wonders for him. Little did they know this was the last time they&amp;#39;d see Ben. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On that hot summer Wednesday, August 18th, Ben arrived at VS and began his first 2 of 3 dives of the day. Other divers at the spring noticed that it looked like he was prepping for a big 3rd dive. While VS closed around 5-6pm, divers are allowed to dive later in the evening as long as they purchased the right kind of pass. At 7pm, Ben began his dive into the bottom of the cavern, making his way to the gate. The locked gate blocks the entrance of the cave from uncertified divers. CD is incredibly dangerous, so VS requires a key rented from the dive shop (where one would present their certification, pay fees, and fill tanks). Ben was last seen at the gate, under 58 feet of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last people to see Ben alive were two divers: Eduardo Taran (ET) and Chuck Cronin (CC), who were employees of VS&amp;#39;s dive shop. ET and CC were enjoying their weekly relaxing after-work dive after shop had closed for the evening. On their way out of the cave, they passed Ben as he was trying to force his way into/around the gate. Ben, while a skilled diver, did not have the required certification to rent the key. ET and other employees suspected Ben of forcing or sneaking through the gate prior to the 18th. Ben did not have a CD cert, but he used sidemount, a line, and a helmet, which are caving tools. Ben also apparently &amp;quot;show boated&amp;quot; a bit, and gave others at VS the impression that Ben had a big ego.  As ET and CC reached  the cavern that opens into the basin, ET decided to go back and unlock the gate for Ben, feeling that was the safer option. He worried without access, Ben would try to force his way in and without a diving buddy, and being the last diver of the day, ET worried Ben would get himself tangled up or stuck in the gate. The number one rule in scuba diving is to not dive beyond your limits. While Ben didn&amp;#39;t have his caving cert, ET had seen him diving before, and suspected him of getting past the gate anyways. It would be safe to think that ET let Ben in to save him a bit of air, and that Ben would explore around a bit near the front of the cave, then head out. Though ET knew Ben should not be in the cave, he felt it was safer to let the man in and trust him to only go as far as he safely could, rather than Ben getting tangled up in the gate and drowning. ET and CC left Ben to his dive, and headed out for coffee. No one has seen Ben since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the gate, &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/R4hsFm772II\"&gt;here is a video&lt;/a&gt; where a diver shows how one could get past the gate without a key. Skip ahead to a little before the 9 minute mark if you don&amp;#39;t want to watch the whole video. It&amp;#39;s not the best video -poor lighting with a bit of jumbling about, but right after 9 mins you can see the diver successfully getting past the locked gate. (This diver is one from the initial search teams- he helped with delivering the ROV past certain restrictions, which will get to later)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Employees noticed Ben&amp;#39;s truck was in the same spot in the parking lot the next day, but thought nothing of it. It was a hot busy August day, and Ben visited VS very often. In 4 months, he&amp;#39;d logged over 250 dives. When ET arrived to work on Friday Morning, he noticed the truck again in the same spot, and got worried. He called the police fearing the worst for Ben. Law Enforcement (LE) put together a trio of recovery teams, working in rotation, to find and bring Ben&amp;#39;s body back up to the surface. ET had helped the search efforts, along with several experienced, certified cave and recovery divers. Ben&amp;#39;s family was notified. Upset and scared, Ben&amp;#39;s parents and girlfriend Emily Greer (EG) quickly drove down to FL. The rotating teams of volenteer certified recovery/cave divers searched every possible spot they could for 36 days. Some of the best cave and recovery divers from all over the world, as well as the man who surveyed and mapped the cave in 2003, but they all said the same thing- Ben is &lt;strong&gt;not in the cave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most caves in Florida are like &amp;quot;Swiss cheese&amp;quot; with lots of small spots, but VS is more like a tube, with few nooks and crannies to hide a drowned diver. The long cave is described of having one turn and 4 major restrictions- considered by some cave divers as not that interesting (some even call it the &amp;quot;Bore-tex&amp;quot;),but in the furthest reaches, it gets very tight and dangerous. CC has said that while Ben had the gear required and was a knowledgeable diver, his lack of a cert in cave diving was troubling. It typically takes over 125 hours of dives with an instructor, costing about a $1000 of training to be certified in CD. Ascending too quickly without the right gas mix is also extremely dangerous and requires it&amp;#39;s own training and certs. Just going into the caverns and overhead environments require training and certification. At first, everyone feared that with Ben&amp;#39;s lack of the proper training, he got stuck in a tight squeeze, panicked, and drowned. The cave can get as tight as 10 inches in some places. It&amp;#39;s also known amongst cave divers that when a person panics while cave diving, they could accidentally get squeezed into crevices where divers cannot go. Ben&amp;#39;s size, 6&amp;#39; 1&amp;quot; tall and 210lbs, combined with his gear and VS&amp;#39;s relative lack of nooks and crannies, divers don&amp;#39;t believe he is in the cave. If Ben is not in the cave, then where can he be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep on the lookout for part 2 of this series, where I&amp;#39;ll go over the Search for Ben, and the  evidence found. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edits: just fixing typos or missed punctuation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "On August 18th, 2010, 30 year old Ben McDaniel disappeared.

Here's a bit of info to give clarification for those of us who prefer dry land...\n\nFirst, to get us all acquainted with the dangers of cave diving, [here is an educational video](https://youtu.be/Z1iaa04rCf0) that explains the dangers of how non certified divers can easily meet their doom by venturing into an underwater cave.\n\nJust north of Ponce De Leon, FL, Vortex Spring is a freshwater spring that gently flows outwards.

The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th marks on the map are the restrictions, where it is incredibly difficult to squeeze through. Backmount is where a diver wears tanks on the back, Sidemount is where the tanks are positioned under the armpits along your flanks (which is necessary in order to get past the 2nd restriction.)\n\nDives over 30 meters (100ft )deep require special training involving stops at depths and/or the mixing different gasses to prevent decompression sickness, or \"the bends\". Divers usually get the bends when they don't allow enough time and/or dont use the special gas mixes for deep dives. The water pressure causes the dissolved nitrogen gasses normally found in the bloodstream to collect, creating bubbles that tend to pool in joints, and sometimes even causing embolisms. The bends can be as mild as pain in joints, paralysis, but also as scary as embolisms, and death. Diving past the gate at VS would require special gas mixes (the dive shop sells one called Nitrox), to help prevent the bends.  Deep dives also run rhe risk of nitrogen narcosis at depth too. For some dives, helium is added to the mix to \"take the place\" of nitrogen. Too much nitrogen in the body causes Nitrogen narcosis, which is similar to feeling drunk, often disorienting the diver, causing the diver to make mistakes. \n______________\n\n**Now on to Ben's background and his disappearance**\n\nBen was an avid open water (OW) scuba diver, and was a frequent face at Vortex Spring during the 4 months prior to his disappearance. He was on a bit of a sabbatical after a particularly difficult time in his life. Ben comes from an affluent family near Memphis, TN consisting of his mom and dad, Patti (PM) and Shelby (SM), and two brothers Tim (TM) and Paul (PMD). Ben tried a few different \"hats\" trying to find his place in the world, but often found himself in trouble. He had a successful construction business, but an untrustworthy business partner and the US housing crash left Ben in ruins. He owed the IRS about $50,000 in taxes, jobs were left unfisnished, he had legal troubles, his marriage dissolved, he had to sell his $450,000 home (which was gifted to him by his grandfather for a mere $10) that he'd taken a $200,000 mortgage on. On top of all this, he suffered an even greater blow. When Ben arrived at his parent's home one day, he found his youngest brother, Paul (22), unresponsive. Paul was hospitalized immediately, but was found to be brain dead. His family decided to take Paul off of life support, and nobly donate his organs. Paul's death, along with his other woes, caused Ben to spiral into depression. His parents offered to support Ben financially, while also letting him move into their beach home down in Florida, as a way to sort out his life and emotional well being. Right before Ben dissappeared, he spent time with his family and girlfriend in TN for his mother's birthday, where he expressed his tremendous appreciation for his parent's help. The sunshine, fresh air, and scuba diving seemed to be doing wonders for him. Little did they know this was the last time they'd see Ben. \n\nOn that hot summer Wednesday, August 18th, Ben arrived at VS and began his first 2 of 3 dives of the day. Other divers at the spring noticed that it looked like he was prepping for a big 3rd dive. While VS closed around 5-6pm, divers are allowed to dive later in the evening as long as they purchased the right kind of pass. At 7pm, Ben began his dive into the bottom of the cavern, making his way to the gate. The locked gate blocks the entrance of the cave from uncertified divers. CD is incredibly dangerous, so VS requires a key rented from the dive shop (where one would present their certification, pay fees, and fill tanks). Ben was last seen at the gate, under 58 feet of water.\n\nThe last people to see Ben alive were two divers: Eduardo Taran (ET) and Chuck Cronin (CC), who were employees of VS's dive shop. ET and CC were enjoying their weekly relaxing after-work dive after shop had closed for the evening. On their way out of the cave, they passed Ben as he was trying to force his way into/around the gate. Ben, while a skilled diver, did not have the required certification to rent the key. ET and other employees suspected Ben of forcing or sneaking through the gate prior to the 18th. Ben did not have a CD cert, but he used sidemount, a line, and a helmet, which are caving tools. Ben also apparently \"show boated\" a bit, and gave others at VS the impression that Ben had a big ego.  As ET and CC reached  the cavern that opens into the basin, ET decided to go back and unlock the gate for Ben, feeling that was the safer option. He worried without access, Ben would try to force his way in and without a diving buddy, and being the last diver of the day, ET worried Ben would get himself tangled up or stuck in the gate. The number one rule in scuba diving is to not dive beyond your limits. While Ben didn't have his caving cert, ET had seen him diving before, and suspected him of getting past the gate anyways. It would be safe to think that ET let Ben in to save him a bit of air, and that Ben would explore around a bit near the front of the cave, then head out. Though ET knew Ben should not be in the cave, he felt it was safer to let the man in and trust him to only go as far as he safely could, rather than Ben getting tangled up in the gate and drowning. ET and CC left Ben to his dive, and headed out for coffee. No one has seen Ben since.\n\nFor those interested in the gate, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/R4hsFm772II) where a diver shows how one could get past the gate without a key. Skip ahead to a little before the 9 minute mark if you don't want to watch the whole video. It's not the best video -poor lighting with a bit of jumbling about, but right after 9 mins you can see the diver successfully getting past the locked gate. (This diver is one from the initial search teams- he helped with delivering the ROV past certain restrictions, which will get to later)\n\nEmployees noticed Ben's truck was in the same spot in the parking lot the next day, but thought nothing of it. It was a hot busy August day, and Ben visited VS very often. In 4 months, he'd logged over 250 dives. When ET arrived to work on Friday Morning, he noticed the truck again in the same spot, and got worried. He called the police fearing the worst for Ben. Law Enforcement (LE) put together a trio of recovery teams, working in rotation, to find and bring Ben's body back up to the surface. ET had helped the search efforts, along with several experienced, certified cave and recovery divers. Ben's family was notified. Upset and scared, Ben's parents and girlfriend Emily Greer (EG) quickly drove down to FL. The rotating teams of volenteer certified recovery/cave divers searched every possible spot they could for 36 days. Some of the best cave and recovery divers from all over the world, as well as the man who surveyed and mapped the cave in 2003, but they all said the same thing- Ben is **not in the cave**.\n\nMost caves in Florida are like \"Swiss cheese\" with lots of small spots, but VS is more like a tube, with few nooks and crannies to hide a drowned diver. The long cave is described of having one turn and 4 major restrictions- considered by some cave divers as not that interesting (some even call it the \"Bore-tex\"),but in the furthest reaches, it gets very tight and dangerous. CC has said that while Ben had the gear required and was a knowledgeable diver, his lack of a cert in cave diving was troubling. It typically takes over 125 hours of dives with an instructor, costing about a $1000 of training to be certified in CD. Ascending too quickly without the right gas mix is also extremely dangerous and requires it's own training and certs. Just going into the caverns and overhead environments require training and certification. At first, everyone feared that with Ben's lack of the proper training, he got stuck in a tight squeeze, panicked, and drowned. The cave can get as tight as 10 inches in some places. It's also known amongst cave divers that when a person panics while cave diving, they could accidentally get squeezed into crevices where divers cannot go. Ben's size, 6' 1\" tall and 210lbs, combined with his gear and VS's relative lack of nooks and crannies, divers don't believe he is in the cave. If Ben is not in the cave, then where can he be?\n \nKeep on the lookout for part 2 of this series, where I'll go over the Search for Ben, and the  evidence found. \n\nEdits: just fixing typos or missed punctuation.
