It always has been fun and a great experience to go there (before I went vegan). I am vegan for ~4 months now. My intention for going vegan was 100% ethical after watching earthlings, Cowspiracy, Food Choices etc... When I made my decision my GF was completely against it but now she is like 90-95% plant based and cut meat completely. Her family are literally the definition of carnism, you&amp;#39;ve got meat at every meal. Everytime I went there I haven&amp;#39;t talked about my veganism nor my reasons ever. Though my GF&amp;#39;s father is talking everytime about how important it is to eat meat and that every other food tastes bad without it and we should at least be vegetarians. I remained silent out of respect and not wanting to be &amp;quot;that vegan&amp;quot;. For two days I did very well. Then at lunch at my GF&amp;#39;s grandma&amp;#39;s house everything changed. Everyone but my GF and I had duck; we both ate potatoes with asparagus. It was delicious. Nonetheless her father started again by saying his usual omni bullshit. I thought &amp;#39;yeah whatever&amp;#39; until he started to being offensive against me by telling me how much of a pain it is to adjust to my food choices. I literally exploded and threw at him that I didn&amp;#39;t made this decision because I did&amp;#39;t like the taste of meat. I made the switch to avoid suffer and dead to animals etc and that I want to be respected for it like I respect him by remaining quiet all the time. He didn&amp;#39;t understand what I was talking about. I was completely enraged because of the disrespect he threw at me. I felt so unwanted and unrespected after what he said. I made the decision to drive home. During this argument my GF said no word. When I entered my car she came to the window and basically broke up with me. We had no talk about it. We just talked the morning before that I feel offended by her dad&amp;#39;s shit-talk. Though she didn&amp;#39;t even try to understand my point of view, didn&amp;#39;t even had an own opinion and just threw me in the trash. I feel so enraged you can&amp;#39;t imagine. I can&amp;#39;t understand why I am not allowed to stand up for my principles and get the same respect I give to others. I guess that&amp;#39;s life and especially veganism is a huge contentious point. I feel betrayed by my GF and disrespected on so many levels that I hadn&amp;#39;t even the chance talking to her.
