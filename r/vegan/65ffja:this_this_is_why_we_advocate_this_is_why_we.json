You don't even need it to be happy; you may derive happiness from it, but there are other foods that would also bring you happiness in it's place. So the only thing you are protecting yourself from by eating meat is change.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [...]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hunting, as you mention, involves fewer of those consequences. There is less physical suffering, but the animals that we hunt still have social bonds. You would feel sad if someone killed your mother. Animals do too. Yes, animals will still eat other, and there will still be suffering, but that doesn't make it ok for you to cause more of it.\n\nDoes that make sense as an answer, do you think, /u/MetaMake? Or did I not grok something in all this?\n\n_\n&gt; That in itself would be a change that reaches the same target. It's a far step away from completely cutting all meat and living things from your diet of course.\n\nBut hey, while we're making changes, why not just go all the way? ^**=oD**\n\n_\n&gt; Is over population of wild life not a serious question? If we don't kill any of the deer or elks, would they not run rampant? The animals that feed on them would grow in numbers and size based on the mass amount of extra food around. Unless nature has developed some sort of equilibrium to balance out populations.\n\nAs it turns out, the population of \"sport animals\" is carefully manipulated in order to create a \"problem\" that is then \"fixed\" by killing these beings. So even if forcibly taking the lives of others might be put aside as an ethical consideration, hunting doesn't stand up as an ethically defensible activity. For more on this, [check out this well sources report on the issue](http://bitesizevegan.com/environmental-societal-impact/deer-hunting-overpopulation-solution-or-cause/). And here's [a report by the same author on the question of whether hunting is \"better\" than factory farming](http://bitesizevegan.com/ethics-and-morality/is-hunting-more-ethical-than-factory-farming/).\n\n_\n&gt; Also, how would the entire world converting to veganism prevent something like world hunger? Even with all the veggies and fruits, added with the meats, we have today isn't preventing famine. I believe that is a whole other issue that has to do with monetary gain, and greed isn't going anywhere because the world is vegan.\n\nWe're actually generating enough food in the world presently to feed every single person several times over. The problem is distribution, not production. However, even if that wasn't and issue, then ([quoting from our page on this issue](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/humans-would-starve-in-a-vegan-world/resources)) food scarcity is an argument for veganism, not against it. As the world\u2019s population grows and more people are able to afford meat, less food is available overall. This is because we filter protein and energy-rich crops like soy and grain through animals at a substantial loss before eating them. Depending on the numbers you want to trust and the type of animal it comes from, each pound of meat requires four to thirteen pounds of feed to produce. By switching to a plant-based diet, the farms that presently grow that feed are able to grow food for people instead.\n\nIn all, roughly 40% of the world's arable land is used for food production, while only a quarter of that food is for human consumption. The rest, a staggering 30% of the world's arable land, is used to produce animal feed and commands a third of the world's fresh water. Worse, the meat resulting from this industrialized animal agriculture is not divided evenly. For instance, Americans eat 270 lbs. of meat a year on average, while Bangladeshis eat 4 lbs. Meanwhile, much of the world gets no food at all or raises livestock feed for export to countries with a high demand for meat, creating an unequal burden of production versus consumption between the poorest and richest people on the planet. This is why even conservative researchers are calling for a global decrease in the consumption of meat, while most are calling for the widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet in order to create and sustain food security for the world's growing population. Widespread adoption of a plant-based diet would leave the Earth's arable land and fresh water for use in the production of food crops for people and not feed crops for livestock.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m understanding this correctly, you don&amp;#39;t really have an issue with people eating meat, you have an issue in which the meat is obtained and distributed.

Yes, animals will still eat other, and there will still be suffering, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make it ok for you to cause more of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense as an answer, do you think, &lt;a href=\"/u/MetaMake\"&gt;/u/MetaMake&lt;/a&gt;? Or did I not grok something in all this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That in itself would be a change that reaches the same target. It&amp;#39;s a far step away from completely cutting all meat and living things from your diet of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey, while we&amp;#39;re making changes, why not just go all the way? &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=oD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is over population of wild life not a serious question? If we don&amp;#39;t kill any of the deer or elks, would they not run rampant? The animals that feed on them would grow in numbers and size based on the mass amount of extra food around. Unless nature has developed some sort of equilibrium to balance out populations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the population of &amp;quot;sport animals&amp;quot; is carefully manipulated in order to create a &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; that is then &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; by killing these beings. So even if forcibly taking the lives of others might be put aside as an ethical consideration, hunting doesn&amp;#39;t stand up as an ethically defensible activity. For more on this, &lt;a href=\"http://bitesizevegan.com/environmental-societal-impact/deer-hunting-overpopulation-solution-or-cause/\"&gt;check out this well sources report on the issue&lt;/a&gt;. And here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://bitesizevegan.com/ethics-and-morality/is-hunting-more-ethical-than-factory-farming/\"&gt;a report by the same author on the question of whether hunting is &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; than factory farming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, how would the entire world converting to veganism prevent something like world hunger? Even with all the veggies and fruits, added with the meats, we have today isn&amp;#39;t preventing famine. I believe that is a whole other issue that has to do with monetary gain, and greed isn&amp;#39;t going anywhere because the world is vegan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re actually generating enough food in the world presently to feed every single person several times over. The problem is distribution, not production. However, even if that wasn&amp;#39;t and issue, then (&lt;a href=\"http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/humans-would-starve-in-a-vegan-world/resources\"&gt;quoting from our page on this issue&lt;/a&gt;) food scarcity is an argument for veganism, not against it. As the world\u2019s population grows and more people are able to afford meat, less food is available overall. This is because we filter protein and energy-rich crops like soy and grain through animals at a substantial loss before eating them. Depending on the numbers you want to trust and the type of animal it comes from, each pound of meat requires four to thirteen pounds of feed to produce. By switching to a plant-based diet, the farms that presently grow that feed are able to grow food for people instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all, roughly 40% of the world&amp;#39;s arable land is used for food production, while only a quarter of that food is for human consumption. The rest, a staggering 30% of the world&amp;#39;s arable land, is used to produce animal feed and commands a third of the world&amp;#39;s fresh water. Worse, the meat resulting from this industrialized animal agriculture is not divided evenly. For instance, Americans eat 270 lbs. of meat a year on average, while Bangladeshis eat 4 lbs. Meanwhile, much of the world gets no food at all or raises livestock feed for export to countries with a high demand for meat, creating an unequal burden of production versus consumption between the poorest and richest people on the planet. This is why even conservative researchers are calling for a global decrease in the consumption of meat, while most are calling for the widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet in order to create and sustain food security for the world&amp;#39;s growing population. Widespread adoption of a plant-based diet would leave the Earth&amp;#39;s arable land and fresh water for use in the production of food crops for people and not feed crops for livestock.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dgbcvtu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328485.0, "created_utc": 1492299685.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ffja", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbfzew", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_Real_Mongoose", "parent_id": "t1_dgav3zk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, I think you misunderstood.

If you believe these animals have a right not to be mistreated, then you believe they are self aware individuals -- or else what is experiencing the suffering in question?

Note the &amp;quot;sources cited&amp;quot; link just to the right of the video:\nnutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, maybe you don&amp;#39;t care to spend a full hour on this and would rather view more targeted reports. That&amp;#39;s OK -- at around the 8:00 mark in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; video, he covers the topic of &amp;quot;endotoxemia&amp;quot;, which is one of the real &amp;quot;smoking guns&amp;quot; with regard to the claim that &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;eating animal sourced products in any quantity has a direct negative impact on human health&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. You can skip straight to this set of reports here:\nnutritionfacts.org/?s=endotoxemia&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you prefer, you can search the site for yourself; here are a few searches for popular animal products:\nnutritionfacts.org/?s=milk\nnutritionfacts.org/?s=pork\nnutritionfacts.org/?s=beef\nnutritionfacts.org/?s=chicken&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, he has a collection of short written reports, each on a theme, and each being chock full of links to the particular reports backing up the statements made:\nnutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/\nnutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/\nnutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/\nnutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer\nnutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if Dr. Greger is unsatisfactory for some reason, then I&amp;#39;ll be moving on to Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn&amp;#39;s work, then Dr. John A. McDougall&amp;#39;s, then Dr. T. Colin Campbell&amp;#39;s... and the list goes on, but the common denominator is the the conclusion that eating animal&amp;#39;s bodies, menses, and secretions has a direct and unambiguous &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; effect on human health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I recognize this is a &lt;em&gt;mountain&lt;/em&gt; of data to look through, but that&amp;#39;s kind of the point: the only reports that animal products are somehow &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; for human health are inevitably funded by the meat and dairy industries. If you doubt the truth of this, then I invite you to dig in to those sources and discover the truth for yourself; I&amp;#39;ve done so time and time again, and have found this to be so every single time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ps- Kinda all over with this post, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No worries! &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=o)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dgav0k4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492303795.0, "created_utc": 1492274995.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ffja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ffja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ffja", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavyv6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zeshiki", "parent_id": "t1_dgavdkn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, we also don't grow all our own vegetables.
