You can directly understand why it saves you money, and how it saves you money. And it&amp;#39;s easy to calculate how much money it will save you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Non of these things can be said about health arguments. Health is really hard to measure specifically. But there is a bigger issue: conflicting science. Right now the &amp;#39;market&amp;#39; on food-science is over saturated (or under saturated depending on how you view it). There is&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A. Too much conflicting research&lt;br/&gt;\nB. A massive lack of scientific understanding in the general public&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you bring up health arguments you&amp;#39;re either going to get someone who&amp;#39;s going to cite conflicting research. Or even worse they are citing conflicting research that merely proves a correlation between eating a certain type of food and health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point being, in my experience it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to convince someone that veganism is the healthy choice unless they are already willing to believe that. If you try this argument you&amp;#39;re just going to get a response like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I read in the news paper that eating 1 egg per day is very healthy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there is just no way to argue with these people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dgal3u4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492287560.0, "created_utc": 1492258760.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaa30h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "littlemissbabybear", "parent_id": "t1_dg7bbpq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oookay!
