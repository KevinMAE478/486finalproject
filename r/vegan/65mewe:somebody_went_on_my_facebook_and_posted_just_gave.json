So in that post you may have been outnumbered, which is why it was a really hard and emotional battle to fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time though, you&amp;#39;re on the right side, so no matter what they say, you save more animals, you do less harm to the environment, you are much healthier than they are, and you are always the winner in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also don&amp;#39;t worry about stress. Throughout history people have always had stress from war, from famine, from family problems, from starvation, etc. People&amp;#39;s lives aren&amp;#39;t damaged by the stress, it&amp;#39;s what they do when they&amp;#39;re stressful (smoking, overeating, drugs) that causes damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After your kind of situation, I would have watched vegan-friendly YouTube videos or post here on &lt;a href=\"/r/vegan\"&gt;/r/vegan&lt;/a&gt;, which is what you did, to chill out. Don&amp;#39;t take anything that they said personally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep living your life, become more successful than they ever will be, and be an example.
