I do enjoy them occasionally but can only offer advice UK wise and if I say so myself, I know some pretty good cheap mock stuff that my anti-vegan mom even loves and buys for herself. This list can make you everything and it\u2019s cheap and it does not require cooking skills. [Vegan Junk On A Budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MnwTfnVqqo)\n\n**Other**\n\n* Fortified Plant milk (soy/hemp/almond/cashew/oat). [Wanna know how they do in beverages?]( http://www.peta.org.uk/blog/vegans-guide-non-dairy-milks/). I prefer soy and it makes an unbelievable [mayo]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzP5Mkpjzc). Please don\u2019t buy vegan mayo, you are wasting your money. Soy milk is 59p in the UK. Oil is a \u00a31. \n* Tofu. It\u2019s cheap and so versatile. I always buy firm. [Scramble]( https://www.elephantasticvegan.com/basic-tofu-scramble/) is my favourite way.\n* [Black Strap Molasses]( http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/calcium.php). So damn high in minerals and amazing in oatmeal.\n* [Nutritional Yeast]( http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2011/10/what-the-heck-is-nutritional-yeast.html): vegan crack, fairy dust, just sprinkle it on whatever. A tablespoon or so and watch your life transform. \n\n*I know canned is so much easier but dried gives you far more for your money. \nExample: Dried Kidney Beans = \u00a31.65 (500g) while a can is 50p (240g). Learn how to [soak](http://www.wikihow.com/Cook-Dried-Beans). It\u2019s easy and they can be stored very well.\n\n**Whatever you can think off but seasonal is cheaper and better for the environment.\n\n***I don\u2019t have a gluten allergy and don\u2019t get the gluten free hype but bread is awesome. I depend on it.

Seeds provide similar nutrients but you do you and cashews are awesome I have heard.\n\n*****For the sake of everything vegan and beautiful buy whole and grind them yourself. I do mine in a spice mill and you get far more for your buck. I buy organic flax for \u00a32, - (500g). The non-organic I can get for less and they are US grown. \n\n**Desert situations**\nVeganism is easy. But if you go out be prepared. Especially when you are just starting out. Some of my favourite lifesavers:\nBagels; bananas; dates; seeds; peanut butter. And when I have no time for breakfast I throw in 2 cups of fresh spinach, \u00bd cup orange juice, 1 banana and 2tbsp oats and tbsp. flax seeds. Iron and fiber bomb.\n\n**Dessert situations**\nYou see what I did there ;) But I\u2019m serious. Whoever thinks vegans can\u2019t have dessert deserves a hardcover library book thrown on their head or a slice of good vegan cake to pull them over to the green side. These are my favourite; some are even low fat *gasp*. Everything after and inc the brownies isn\u2019t but you deserve treats. Also they are all easy. Baking soda and vinegar replace what eggs do and that is vegan baking most of the time. Flour and baking soda but is so damn tasty. If you are super lazy, just get an accidentally vegan cake mix box and add soda.
