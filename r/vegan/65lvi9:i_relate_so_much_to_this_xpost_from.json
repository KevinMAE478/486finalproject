I suppose it depends where you draw the line? I appreciate you strongly disagree with zoos but I think veganism is a very personal journey (apologies for sounding like a total hippie) and if you feel that an ethically conscious zoo which truly cares about and helps animals as much as humanly possible, whilst attempting to make a profit from entry fees is okay then more power to you. My advice to people would just be to choose wisely, research and make sure you&amp;#39;re doing what&amp;#39;s right by you and the animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dgbutje", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492360650.0, "created_utc": 1492331850.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lvi9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxwdw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HigHog", "parent_id": "t1_dgbuefz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is an issue which I don\u2019t think is as black and white as that.
