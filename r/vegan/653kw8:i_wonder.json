Probably not much. They might go up a little bit, but the cost of the food is not the actual cost of the final products. But if we\u2019re trying to look for something political that might make a difference, try subsidizing fruit and vegetable growers so the cost is comparatively lower for better foods.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WaPo: &amp;quot;U.S. touts fruit and vegetables while subsidizing animals that become meat&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-touts-fruit-and-vegetables-while-subsidizing-animals-that-become-meat/2011/08/22/gIQATFG5IL_story.html?utm_term=.767f0733942d\"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-touts-fruit-and-vegetables-while-subsidizing-animals-that-become-meat/2011/08/22/gIQATFG5IL_story.html?utm_term=.767f0733942d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will look for more when I have more time.

Another important key takeaway is that they, like many faulty nutritionional cases, only checked for food items that includes what you wanted, but not if it was bad for you in any other way i.e. no one would have cared if they knew meat causes cancer because the nutrition contents is still the same. From today&amp;#39;s knowledge, if you think eating all different sorts of meat every week would be better than eating lentils or beans exclusively, then you&amp;#39;ve gotten it wrong...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing is deceitful sometimes, it is not a coincidence that the pyramid just happens to include just about every food industry that was working back in the last century, including the fighting-for-their-life dairy industry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes most people misunderstand nutrition because of this is also because they think food items only have 1 type of nutrients in them, like meat only contains protein and then just water and empty calories, but look at vegetables and you have carbs, protein, fiber and occasional fats.

Additional strong evidence shows that it is not necessary to eliminate food groups or conform to a single dietary pattern to achieve healthy dietary patterns. Rather, individuals can combine foods in a variety of \ufb02exible ways to achieve healthy dietary patterns, and these strategies should be tailored to meet the individual\u2019s health needs, dietary preferences and cultural traditions. Current research also strongly demonstrates that regular physical activity promotes health and reduces chronic disease risk. (Source: 2015 DGAC summary wording)\n\nSustainability is essential. We emphatically support the inclusion of sustainability in the 2015 DGAC report, and a\ufb03rm the appropriateness and importance of this imperative in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans because food insecurity cannot be solved without sustainable food systems. Inattention to sustainability is willful disregard for the quality and quantity of food available to the next generation, i.e., our own children.\n\nA transparent process, beyond politics. The Scientists of Oldways Common Ground lend strong, collective support to the overall process, as well as the overall product, of the 2015 DGAC. We express con\ufb01dence in their approach to the weight of evidence. We support a transparent process where the evidence-based report of the scientists is translated directly into policy without political manipulation.\n\nGood x 3. Food can and should be:\n\u2022 Good for human health\n\u2022 Good for the planet (sustainability; ecosystem conservation; biodiversity)\n\u2022 And simply\u2026good \u2013 unapologetically delicious.\n\nCommon Ground over confusion. We express strong concern for the high level of apparent confusion prevailing, and propagated among the public about what constitutes a healthy eating pattern. Despite uncertainty about some details, much of this confusion is unnecessary, and at odds with the understanding of experts and the weight of evidence. We a\ufb03rm that experts with diverse perspectives and priorities can \ufb01nd common ground. \nSolid evidence, of all kinds. Fundamentals and current understanding do NOT change every time a new study makes headlines. The Oldways Common Ground Scientists emphasize the importance of basing understanding of diet and health on the weight of evidence, including ALL relevant research methods. Biology (adaptation, evolution, plausibility) is a relevant source of evidence. Heritage (cultural traditions) are an additional, relevant source of real-world information on long-term feasibility and health e\ufb00ects of diet.\n\nAvoid sensationalism. Representations of new diet studies to the public should be made in the context of the prevailing consensus. New evidence should be added to what was known before, not substituted for it sequentially. Accurate reporting is the responsibility of both scientists and the media.\n\nCompared to what? To make recommendations for dietary changes meaningful, we strongly endorse the general principle of specifying practical dietary substitutions \u2013 a \u201ccompared to what\u201d approach. e.g, Instead of simply saying, \u201cDrink less soda,\u201d for instance, say \u201cDrink water instead of soda.\u201d What we consume and what we don\u2019t consume instead, both contribute to health outcomes.\nFrom rules to practical tools. Oldways Common Ground Scientists recommend that education programming, policy, and legislation in support of these goals be implemented widely and in a timely manner, with regular monitoring and evaluation. For example, in the U.S., we urge compliance with 7 USC Sec. 5341, which calls for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to \u201cbe promoted by each Federal agency in carrying out any Federal food, nutrition, or health program\u201d \u2013 including food assistance programs.\n\nFood Literacy. We support the cultivation of widespread \u201cfood literacy\u201d and believe that individuals bene\ufb01t from becoming knowledgeable about the origins of their food, the conditions under which it is produced, and its impact on their health and the health of the planet. A knowledge of and respect for food traditions and the cultural context of food \u2013 health through heritage \u2013 is also bene\ufb01cial, and can be a powerful motivator for better eating, as well as a means of imparting crucial life skills (e.g., cooking).\nFood Systems. Oldways Common Ground Scientists agree that food systems (production, manufacture, food waste, etc.) should align with priorities for human and planetary health while supporting social responsibility/justice and animal welfare. Diverse, localized/regionalized  solutions, that re\ufb02ect site-speci\ufb01c priorities and capabilities are more resilient and democratic.

Food can and should be:\n\u2022 Good for human health\n\u2022 Good for the planet (sustainability; ecosystem conservation; biodiversity)\n\u2022 And simply\u2026good \u2013 unapologetically delicious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common Ground over confusion. We express strong concern for the high level of apparent confusion prevailing, and propagated among the public about what constitutes a healthy eating pattern. Despite uncertainty about some details, much of this confusion is unnecessary, and at odds with the understanding of experts and the weight of evidence. We a\ufb03rm that experts with diverse perspectives and priorities can \ufb01nd common ground. \nSolid evidence, of all kinds. Fundamentals and current understanding do NOT change every time a new study makes headlines. The Oldways Common Ground Scientists emphasize the importance of basing understanding of diet and health on the weight of evidence, including ALL relevant research methods. Biology (adaptation, evolution, plausibility) is a relevant source of evidence. Heritage (cultural traditions) are an additional, relevant source of real-world information on long-term feasibility and health e\ufb00ects of diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid sensationalism. Representations of new diet studies to the public should be made in the context of the prevailing consensus. New evidence should be added to what was known before, not substituted for it sequentially. Accurate reporting is the responsibility of both scientists and the media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to what? To make recommendations for dietary changes meaningful, we strongly endorse the general principle of specifying practical dietary substitutions \u2013 a \u201ccompared to what\u201d approach. e.g, Instead of simply saying, \u201cDrink less soda,\u201d for instance, say \u201cDrink water instead of soda.\u201d What we consume and what we don\u2019t consume instead, both contribute to health outcomes.\nFrom rules to practical tools. Oldways Common Ground Scientists recommend that education programming, policy, and legislation in support of these goals be implemented widely and in a timely manner, with regular monitoring and evaluation. For example, in the U.S., we urge compliance with 7 USC Sec. 5341, which calls for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to \u201cbe promoted by each Federal agency in carrying out any Federal food, nutrition, or health program\u201d \u2013 including food assistance programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Food Literacy. We support the cultivation of widespread \u201cfood literacy\u201d and believe that individuals bene\ufb01t from becoming knowledgeable about the origins of their food, the conditions under which it is produced, and its impact on their health and the health of the planet. A knowledge of and respect for food traditions and the cultural context of food \u2013 health through heritage \u2013 is also bene\ufb01cial, and can be a powerful motivator for better eating, as well as a means of imparting crucial life skills (e.g., cooking).\nFood Systems. Oldways Common Ground Scientists agree that food systems (production, manufacture, food waste, etc.) should align with priorities for human and planetary health while supporting social responsibility/justice and animal welfare. Diverse, localized/regionalized  solutions, that re\ufb02ect site-speci\ufb01c priorities and capabilities are more resilient and democratic. Each of us has a role to play in ensuring a healthy and sustainable global food supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dg7qmu2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492127408.0, "created_utc": 1492098608.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kw8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653kw8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8zd3h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WeRtheBork", "parent_id": "t1_dg8a9zr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "oh jesus that's a tedious thing to address so the answer right away is that we aren't pathetic omnivores.\n\nThe human ancestor species were omnivores and weren't pathetic.
