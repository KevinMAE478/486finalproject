And yet, these things still apply here:\n\n- 1/3 of the year cows can be locked inside, standing in often dark stalls in their own shit\n- Cows are repeatedly impregnated (by shoving an arm up their ass and a rod into their vagina) to keep their milk flow steady\n- Their calves are immediately taken away from them because the milk is a commodity for humans\n- Male calves (bobby calves) are either raised for meat and killed after just a few months or they are shot immediately, because they are basically worthless (they don't make milk and also don't grow as meaty as the breeds for beef) \n- Calves are often kept in separate hutches where they can't run around or interact with each other (at least in the first few weeks)\n- Cows can cry for days for their kids. I have 3 small (organic and whatnot) dairy farms close to where I live. I always hear one scream nonstop when I drive past them with my bike\n- Cows are sent to slaughter after only 4-6 years or sooner if they can't get pregnant anymore, because they'll be spent by then, as producing these enormous quantities of milk they were bred for, as well as the repeated pregnancies, is really taxing on their bodies\n- On top of all this, cows are often dehorned, which is very painful\n\nSo no, cows in the industry hardly live a healthy and happy life. Don't buy into all the commercials and paid articles. What we do to dairy cows, even on 'nice' farms, is pretty cruel and....well, absolutely unnecessary, as no adult needs baby milk, let alone of another species. \n\nSo to prevent cruelty and for the environment (and your own health), I'd say it's always worth to avoid dairy.
