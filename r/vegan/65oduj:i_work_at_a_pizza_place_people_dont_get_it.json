I use to work at Dairy Queen because that was the only job I could find at the time. I also use to work at a grocery store that sold meat when I was in high school to save money for university, and it was my first job and the only place that was willing to hire me at that age. It did suck working for places that support animal cruelty, and I&amp;#39;m sure OP does not love having to work with those products but its just a fact of life that right now it is going to be difficult to work at a place that is going to not be dealing with &amp;quot;blood money&amp;quot; of some sort. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dgccx74", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395300.0, "created_utc": 1492366500.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oduj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oduj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oduj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oduj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcehdv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ijui", "parent_id": "t1_dgcegsr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Who used the word need?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who used the word need?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vegan", "name": "t1_dgcehdv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492397405.0, "created_utc": 1492368605.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oduj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oduj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgceqcm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stiltzkin_the_moogle", "parent_id": "t1_dgcel1k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vegan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've said my piece.
