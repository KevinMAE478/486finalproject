I've been looking for a shimmer/glitter palette with few to no mattes in it. \n\nThe Tarte Make Believe in Yourself: Eye and Cheek Palette is a limited edition eyeshadow/highlighter palette with ten eyeshadows and one highlighter. I haven't had a chance to try them all (because just got it a couple hours ago lol) but they all swatched so nicely, with a finger and brush.\n\nThe packaging is so pretty. It feels fairly sturdy and is about the size of my hand. It clicks shut and doesn't flop open. The mirror goes all the way back to lay flat.\n\nThe first picture of swatches is over Milani Eyeshadow Primer with one or two swipes with my finger. The next picture is over nyx milk, with one or two swipes of my finger. Only two of the shades (dream and pixie) needed a couple more swipes to build up. There is only one matte shade, which I'm not sure why they included. The order of shades is the same as the previous picture. the pictures were taken in my bathroom, where i have \"natural light\" bulbs. I can take pictures later in natural light if anyone would like, but it's night here right now.\n\nI only have eye makeup on in these pictures.\n\nIn the first picture of my eye, the products are Milani eyeshadow primer, Marvel in the inner corner, KVD Pastel Goth shades gloom and dagger in the outer corner, star above the inner corner, and milani eye tech eyeliner. Marvel applied smoothly with a brush, then i built it up even more with my finger. It did have fallout, and i would recommend doing eyes before face makeup\n\nin the second picture, i have on Milani eyeshadow primer, the shade Mystic in the inner corner layered with Dream, Limecrime venus shades venus in the outer corner, muse in the crease and out corner, and Milani eye tech eyeliner. Mystic and Dream had less fallout then Marvel, but i would still recommend doing eyeshadow first.
