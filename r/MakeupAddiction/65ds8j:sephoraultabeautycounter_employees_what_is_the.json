So the basic anatomy of an electronic cigarette is that it consists of two parts:  the battery, and the \"atomizer\".  The original incarnation of the electronic cigarette was that it looked like an actual cigarette.  The front of the cigarette contained a battery, and the butt part contained the atomizer, which you could screw on and off the battery.\n\nInside of the atomizer was wicking material (a sheet of poly fill) soaked in a carrier fluid (composed of propylene glycol and/or glycerine) containing flavoring and nicotine.  It also contains a coil of resistance wire.  Electricity from the battery runs through the resistance wire, heating the wire up.  The wicking material was wrapped around the coil, so the fluid gets heated up, vaporizing it.  \n\nAt some point people started modifying them so that they could hook bigger batteries up to the atomizers, heating the coil up hotter and lasting longer.  Then they started modifying the atomizers.  Yada yada yada, it evolved to something where you could build the coil yourself and make your own wick.  What this looks like is a [coil of wire hooked up to two posts, with a small roll of cotton threaded through the center](https://vvapour.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rebuildable-atomizer-coils-set-up.jpg).  Design of atomizers varies, but the basic idea is that one or both ends of the cotton have contact with a reservoir of liquid, or you just drip liquid right onto it.  The entire atomizer is enclosed with either a tank to hold liquids or a cap to cover it, and then there's a mouthpiece.  Any atomizer designed so that you make and mount the coil yourself is called \"rebuildable\".\n\nAt the time that rebuildable atomizers first became popular, it was common to see people wicking their ecigs with braided silica or even stainless steel mesh.  The main properties that people were looking for is how well it holds and wicks liquid, how neutral it tastes, and how easily it would end up just burning.  Cotton became popular for a couple of reasons.  The primary reason is that it is absorbant, and so it is excellent at wicking.  It holds a lot of liquid and wicks it pretty quickly.  Since it absorbs so much and so quickly, it doesn't burn very easily (as long as there is liquid to wick) and it maintains a lot of surface area with the coil, so there are no \"hot spots\" of coil overheating in the absence of liquid.  Second reason is that it is readily available and very accessible.  And it is pretty easy to find cotton that is not chemically treated or bleached (such as those made by Shiseido).  Third reason is that it has no flavor.\n\nAFAIK cotton is the standard wicking material now, not just with DIYers.  But manufactured e-cig cartridges use it now too.
