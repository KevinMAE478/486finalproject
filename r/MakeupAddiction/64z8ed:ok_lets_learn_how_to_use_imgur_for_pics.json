So people on that site take it upon themselves to &amp;quot;enforce&amp;quot; their self-made rule by bombarding the selfie-taker with vile, degrading (and often, because most of the offenders are women, misogynistic) abuse. I think the &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is stupid and Imgur is largely responsible for the shameful actions of its users because 1) they changed their model so now, instead of being merely an image host for Reddit and private users, they are a community and the &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; option for uploads is &amp;quot;public.&amp;quot; On mobile, at least, the only other option is &amp;quot;only me.&amp;quot; Naturally, new users are confused! 2) they don&amp;#39;t make &amp;quot;no selfies&amp;quot; a rule, but they tolerate the openly abusive behavior of their users toward people who post selfies, and 3) they don&amp;#39;t separate their content into subsections. Everything is supposed to have mass appeal. Look at Reddit and compare: Selfies are welcome in many subreddits but discouraged or not permitted in the larger, &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; subreddits. Since Imgur doesn&amp;#39;t divide itself into smaller communities, the majority rules. And chances are, they don&amp;#39;t like your hobbies or your face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get the impression, when I read the disgusting comments that Imgur users post under selfies, that there&amp;#39;s a lot of crossover with Reddit. Most of the users seem to be boys and young men who spend a lot of time at the keyboard. For some reason, they are deeply offended by the idea that a woman might have the confidence to post a photo &amp;quot;for attention,&amp;quot; so they are absolutely vicious when they attack. It&amp;#39;s not unusual for them to not only insult the OP&amp;#39;s appearance, but to say sexually degrading things. That&amp;#39;s why I can&amp;#39;t stand when someone here accidentally posts publicly on Imgur. It&amp;#39;s painful and cringe-inducing to witness how revolting and toxic Imgur&amp;#39;s community is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MakeupAddiction", "name": "t1_dg6ozk7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065692.0, "created_utc": 1492036892.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rww2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z8ed", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rww2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z8ed", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rww2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z8ed", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6vf59", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "milk-rose", "parent_id": "t1_dg6tani", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MakeupAddiction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, they're assholes.
