Sound sorta familiar? That&amp;#39;s because it is. In real life Japan in the late 1800s, Emperor Meji decided to modernise and centralise Japan&amp;#39;s military to be more like the West. Up until his reforms, each Daimyo had their own small armies led by Samurai. But with the increasing availability of guns after Japan re-opened to the West, highly skilled troops like Samurai were no longer needed. You could just give peasants guns to do the trick.

He&amp;#39;ll try to end the age of Shinobi just like the age of Samurai was ended in Japan. Kawaki would want to do this for the same reasons Emperor Meji did in real life - no longer would these semi-independent vassals(Daimyos IRL - the Hokage in Naruto) get their own autonomous armies, instead the Daimyo would have an army loyal only to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What d&amp;#39;you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So in Boruto we're hearing a lot about how it's the \"End of Shinobi\".
