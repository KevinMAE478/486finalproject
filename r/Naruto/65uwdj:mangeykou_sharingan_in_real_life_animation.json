Both of it's abilities are directly tied to genjutsu that end the conflict in one use. I don't exactly know how the 10 year cooldown could fit into this or perhaps it has no meaning at all and just serves as a balancing device. \n\nFor Itachi we can see that the pacifistic teachings of Shisui also left their mark on his MS with Tsukuyomi being much similar int that it's a genjutsu that can end the fight in one glance. Possible further meaning can be found in the fact that Tsukuyomi differs from Koto in that it takes the target to Itachi's personal world. This could be interpreted in a way such as that Itachi has a direct image of how he wants the world to be but of course that image only exists in his mind. But yeah that last part about Tsukuyomi I still haven't managed to fully dissect it, feel free to add on to that part. Amaterasu black flames that never go out represent Itachi's persevering nature that never gives up and the black color of the flames could reference the fact that he had to be in the dark for the rest of his life.\n\nSasuke also getting Amaterasu(other than the fact that Itachi actually just gave it to him) could be a sign of how he is pledging to pick up Itachi's lifestyle of darkness and solitude. Kagatsuchi could also be a further expansion on the meaning of Amaterasu(literally and figuratively), where Sasuke vows and plans to pick up what Itachi started and expand on it, turning it potentially into something much bigger than it originally was and changing it to how he sees fit. \n\nMadara doesn't have any unique MS abilities so there's nothing for me to interpret here. \n\nObito/Kakashi's Kamui might just be the hardest one for me to interpret. So for the right eye(Aka short range version) that could represent Obito's lament at not being able to make it to Rin in time(the teleporting part at least). If he had the ability to travel wherever he wanted, Rin wouldn't have died. I'm not so sure how the intangibility part can be interpreted though. Kamui Dimension in itself is also tricky. I feel like it represents Obito's view on the word, being a blank desolate place with no other meaning other than a place to be. It's kind of like a blank canvas, and as we know with Project Tsuki no Me, Obito was planning on \"painting over that canvas\" and creating his ideal world. As for Obito's/Kakashi's left eye(Aka long range version) I don't really have much of a clue. \n\nFeel free to post any interpretations you guys come up with, it's very interesting to hear other people's thoughts on subjects like this.
