Although I still think there's room for him to be a decent character. I just would have preferred someone more original.\n\nSo, opinions. Here's all I can recall disagreeing with people over, minus all of the wishy washy stuff that I'm just neutral toward.\n\n1. Not sure if this is a popular opinion or not, but Orochimaru's last-minute change and his total amnesty given by Hidden Leaf frustrates the hell out of me. I could just be stuck in the past here, though; I'll always think of Orochimaru as the ultimate evil of the series in a way since the height of my love for Naruto was from Chunin Exams to Sasuke Retrieval. I was holding out for an awesome final battle between Naruto and Orochimaru back then. Even ignoring that, it flies in the face of the way Kishimoto developed Orochimaru all throughout part 1 *and* 2: a selfish man who, unlike say Nagato or Madara, didn't have a noble motive behind what he did, all he cared about was his own greed and power. Then this same person just decides to live a quiet life and make peace with the society he worked to destroy his entire life.\n\n2. Yamato is, in the greater scheme of things, is a useless character. Would anyone else have just preferred that Anko had been the center of the Hashirama cell plotline? It would have been a very easy way to make her character useful again.\n\n3. The ultimate decline of the series started with Sasuke Retrieval. Not the arc itself, I absolutely love everything about the beginning and middle of it, all the way up to Naruto and Sasuke's amazing final battle. It's the resolution that bothers me; it shirks realism and believability to keep Choji and Neji alive with no lasting injuries. I was also very bothered by the fact that not one member of the Sound Four was kept alive, there was a lot of room to develop Orochimaru's history and have a character be a case study on one of his minions, possibly to even further motivate Naruto to save Sasuke when he sees the damage that being a slave of Orochimaru can do to someone. Hell, it would've been easy to have Tayuya just get her legs broken by Temari's Drop a Forest on You-jutsu, or they could have toned down Kimimaro's illness to make him live after he tried killing Gaara. But I simply can't look at anything after Sasuke Retrieval the same way I look at the majority of Part 1; anyone who says Pain Invasion or the war were the start of the downfall should realize that the problems with the war and Pain arc were only extensions of SR arc's problems.\n\nI believe that's all I have right now; I have other major criticisms of the series such as Kaguya being a lame and stock villain, Naruto and Sasuke become far too much like superheroes and DBZ heroes later on because of their insane power, but I've heard others make those complaints before, so I don't think they're completely out of left field for Naruto fans to hear.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think Sarada or Himawari would have been a better choice for the main character than Boruto&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boruto is too much like Naruto to be a great protagonist; we&amp;#39;ve already seen three separate takes on a Naruto-like character raised in a privileged position instead of destitution in movies and filler, and it worked fine then. Although I still think there&amp;#39;s room for him to be a decent character. I just would have preferred someone more original.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, opinions. Here&amp;#39;s all I can recall disagreeing with people over, minus all of the wishy washy stuff that I&amp;#39;m just neutral toward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if this is a popular opinion or not, but Orochimaru&amp;#39;s last-minute change and his total amnesty given by Hidden Leaf frustrates the hell out of me. I could just be stuck in the past here, though; I&amp;#39;ll always think of Orochimaru as the ultimate evil of the series in a way since the height of my love for Naruto was from Chunin Exams to Sasuke Retrieval. I was holding out for an awesome final battle between Naruto and Orochimaru back then. Even ignoring that, it flies in the face of the way Kishimoto developed Orochimaru all throughout part 1 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 2: a selfish man who, unlike say Nagato or Madara, didn&amp;#39;t have a noble motive behind what he did, all he cared about was his own greed and power. Then this same person just decides to live a quiet life and make peace with the society he worked to destroy his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamato is, in the greater scheme of things, is a useless character. Would anyone else have just preferred that Anko had been the center of the Hashirama cell plotline? It would have been a very easy way to make her character useful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate decline of the series started with Sasuke Retrieval. Not the arc itself, I absolutely love everything about the beginning and middle of it, all the way up to Naruto and Sasuke&amp;#39;s amazing final battle. It&amp;#39;s the resolution that bothers me; it shirks realism and believability to keep Choji and Neji alive with no lasting injuries.
