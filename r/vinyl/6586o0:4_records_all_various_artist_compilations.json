The compilation is a scaled-down single LP release by Rhino records in 1984. This version contains fourteen of the original twenty-seven tracks found on the classic 2xLP compilation released by Elektra in 1972: *Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era*. The fourteen songs found on the compilation are meant to represent the biggest \u201chits\u201d of original twenty-seven as the title states. All the tracks are fantastic and showcase some of my favorite garage and psychedelic singles from 1960s. My favorite tracks are: [The Standells \u2013 \u201cDirty Water\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62XRy-jFCm8), [The Barbarians \u2013 \u201cAre You A Boy Or Are You A Girl\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDpGsFI3WNg), [The Seeds \u2013 \u201cPushin\u2019 Too Hard\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IReb27tFqMg), [The Music Machine \u2013 \u201cTalk Talk\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpAt-KgBCA), [The Count Five \u2013 \u201cPsychotic Reaction\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0xsuaeXbU), [The Nazz \u2013 \u201cOpen My Eyes\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apW-fj11T_k). \nListen to the [full compilation on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq5hRF2djqo). On a side note, Rhino did release a 4xCD box set in \t1998, which includes the original twenty-seven tracks with an additional ninety-one songs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[VA \u2013 Open Mind Surgery](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Open-Mind-Surgery/release/835317) (Bluurg Records, 1985). A great compilation album released in 1985 by Bluurg Records, run by Dick Lucas singer of the Subhumans, Culture Shock, and Citizen Fish. It showcases eighteen songs from seven British punk and new wave artists as well as one American punk band, Scream, and the Auckland New Zealand-based post-punk band, K4. Each artist contributes two songs each, including Lucas\u2019s post-Subhumans dub/ska/punk band, Culture Shock. The compilation is truly a great representation of early to mid-1980s independent punk and new wave especially in the UK. My favorite tracks are: [Smart Pils \u2013 \u201cLife Cycle\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_kL_0hBndg), [Depraved \u2013 \u201cMirror of Society\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqqLCfTrCj4), [Steve L. \u2013 \u201cSong of Freedom\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFicmzTdn8U), [Steve L. \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s a Place\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZM3-Q68qN4), [Instigators \u2013 \u201cDark and Lonely\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz6Wgbs-MuU), [K4 \u2013 \u201cKiwi Animal\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcoUO8Qm0Bk), [Culture Shock \u2013 \u201cPunks on Postcards\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQdlAkHqR3w).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[VA \u2013 Someone Got Their Head Kicked In!](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Someone-Got-Their-Head-Kicked-In/release/404021) (BYO Records, 1982). This is A Better Youth Organization (BYO) records compilation released in 1982. It is a mix of eighteen tracks from seven punk and hardcore punk bands from southern California in the early 1980s. The LP includes big names such as Youth Brigade (founders of BYO records), Bad Religion, Adolescents, and Social Distortion. Midsized and smaller acts are also prevalent as well: Aggression, a staple in Oxnard\u2019s nardcore scene, has three songs; San Diego hardcore band, Battalion of Saints, has three songs; the Joneses, an LA garage rock band has two songs; and the Blades, a band I can\u2019t find much any information on except for the fact they were from Huntington Beach, also contributed three songs. My favorite tracks are: [Youth Brigade \u2013 \u201cViolence\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTuaYJIkeLM), [Bad Religion \u2013 \u201cIn the Night\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND9UGIne2lw), [Aggression \u2013 \u201cDear John Letter\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVCtsBE07As), [Adolescents \u2013 \u201cWrecking Crew\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMhZCD85c-A), [Blades \u2013 \u201cHad Enough\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9XnUvTcL8k), [Youth Brigade \u2013 \u201cLook into the Mirror\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb9VSGTjShI), [Battalion of Saints \u2013 \u201cCops are Out\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwhqEKeC4ME).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[VA \u2013 Punk and Disorderly](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Punk-And-Disorderly/release/1985549) (Posh Boy, 1982 [Originally Released on Abstract Sounds in 1981]). Classic punk and Oi! compilation that contains sixteen archetypal punk songs from fifteen UK-based bands along with the Dead Kennedys. What surprises me about the compilation is when it was released. The amount of amazing songs compiled together seems like something that would have been thrown together in the late 1980s or 1990s, not in 1981, only one or two years after most of the tracks had been released. Listed to the [full album on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2rWM7OV-Ig) (this audio is a little choppy in areas).

My favorite tracks are: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62XRy-jFCm8\"&gt;The Standells \u2013 \u201cDirty Water\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDpGsFI3WNg\"&gt;The Barbarians \u2013 \u201cAre You A Boy Or Are You A Girl\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IReb27tFqMg\"&gt;The Seeds \u2013 \u201cPushin\u2019 Too Hard\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpAt-KgBCA\"&gt;The Music Machine \u2013 \u201cTalk Talk\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0xsuaeXbU\"&gt;The Count Five \u2013 \u201cPsychotic Reaction\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apW-fj11T_k\"&gt;The Nazz \u2013 \u201cOpen My Eyes\u201d&lt;/a&gt;. \nListen to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq5hRF2djqo\"&gt;full compilation on youtube&lt;/a&gt;. On a side note, Rhino did release a 4xCD box set in   1998, which includes the original twenty-seven tracks with an additional ninety-one songs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-Open-Mind-Surgery/release/835317\"&gt;VA \u2013 Open Mind Surgery&lt;/a&gt; (Bluurg Records, 1985). A great compilation album released in 1985 by Bluurg Records, run by Dick Lucas singer of the Subhumans, Culture Shock, and Citizen Fish. It showcases eighteen songs from seven British punk and new wave artists as well as one American punk band, Scream, and the Auckland New Zealand-based post-punk band, K4. Each artist contributes two songs each, including Lucas\u2019s post-Subhumans dub/ska/punk band, Culture Shock. The compilation is truly a great representation of early to mid-1980s independent punk and new wave especially in the UK.

This is A Better Youth Organization (BYO) records compilation released in 1982. It is a mix of eighteen tracks from seven punk and hardcore punk bands from southern California in the early 1980s. The LP includes big names such as Youth Brigade (founders of BYO records), Bad Religion, Adolescents, and Social Distortion. Midsized and smaller acts are also prevalent as well: Aggression, a staple in Oxnard\u2019s nardcore scene, has three songs; San Diego hardcore band, Battalion of Saints, has three songs; the Joneses, an LA garage rock band has two songs; and the Blades, a band I can\u2019t find much any information on except for the fact they were from Huntington Beach, also contributed three songs. My favorite tracks are: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTuaYJIkeLM\"&gt;Youth Brigade \u2013 \u201cViolence\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND9UGIne2lw\"&gt;Bad Religion \u2013 \u201cIn the Night\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVCtsBE07As\"&gt;Aggression \u2013 \u201cDear John Letter\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMhZCD85c-A\"&gt;Adolescents \u2013 \u201cWrecking Crew\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9XnUvTcL8k\"&gt;Blades \u2013 \u201cHad Enough\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb9VSGTjShI\"&gt;Youth Brigade \u2013 \u201cLook into the Mirror\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwhqEKeC4ME\"&gt;Battalion of Saints \u2013 \u201cCops are Out\u201d&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-Punk-And-Disorderly/release/1985549\"&gt;VA \u2013 Punk and Disorderly&lt;/a&gt; (Posh Boy, 1982 [Originally Released on Abstract Sounds in 1981]). Classic punk and Oi! compilation that contains sixteen archetypal punk songs from fifteen UK-based bands along with the Dead Kennedys. What surprises me about the compilation is when it was released. The amount of amazing songs compiled together seems like something that would have been thrown together in the late 1980s or 1990s, not in 1981, only one or two years after most of the tracks had been released.
