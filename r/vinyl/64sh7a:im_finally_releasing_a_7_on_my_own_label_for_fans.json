Some of the bands I've been in we've produced home-made CD-R's and would distribute to friends, but I never had anything pressed to vinyl. I've wanted to release a proper record since the early 2000's but never had the courage to go through with it until now...\n\nI recorded about a dozen songs with Bad Bob from around 2004-2007 and never did anything with the recordings. All the songs recorded (on 4-track cassette tape) feature only bass and drums or keyboard and drums (no regular 6-string guitars). I played most of the instruments and Bad Bob sang. They all have a lo-fi garage-rock punk-rock feel. None of the the lyrics are serious, just about Bob being a drunk asshole. I always got a kick out of the recordings and figured let's try releasing a 7\" and see how it does? The A-side comes from these recording sessions. The B-side is exclusive to this record and comes from a live recording of Bad Bob playing solo (he is playing a 2-string guitar for this performance). \n\nI've finally finished production of the 7\". I had 150 copies made. The official release date is this Friday, April 14th. You can listen to it on [Bandcamp](https://badbob.bandcamp.com).\n\nFor the front cover artwork I found someone on Instagram (@Get_Deer) (who I really liked the artwork he had posted on his account) and contacted him. He was happy to help out. I told him I just wanted an image of Bad Bob knocking someone out and gave him complete freedom to draw whatever he felt. I think he did an exceptional job and really nailed the look and feel I wanted. In exchange for his time and service, I'm giving him a test press and a bunch of copies of the record.\n\nFor the back cover, I came up with the design and layout. I used a photo my girlfriend took of the Philadelphia skyline and had her darken it in photoshop (that way it kind of matched the theme of the front cover with the skyline). I then printed out the image, then I cut and pasted the text onto the photo.\n\nFor the label on the record I wanted to go with a 60's private press feel (I'm a huge fan of collecting older private press 45's).\n\nI'm really happy with how this record turned out and I'm excited to hear what others think about it. I know the music may not be for everyone here, but as long as one person gets a kick out of it my day is made. Also, if people show interest I'd really like to release a full album of all the songs recorded.\n\nIf you have taken the time to read this far, then Thank you! I've also set-up a discount code on Bandcamp to save 5% off your order if you enter promo code \"reddit\" at check-out.
