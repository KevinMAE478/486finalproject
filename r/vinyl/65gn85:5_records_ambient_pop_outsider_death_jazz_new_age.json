Fits between progressive electronic music, experimental ambient and some dreamy pop moments. Achingly beautiful and with enough substance and compositional movement to keep all music fans interested.\n\n**Kenneth Higney - \u201cAttic Demonstration\u201d**\n\nLabel: Kebrutney, Re: One Kind Favor / Year: 1976\nGenre: Outsider, Psych Rock\nListen: http://www.cavebears.suchfun.net/OKFmp3/Kenneth%20Higney%20-No%20Heavy%20Trucking.mp3\n\nKenneth Higney was an American trucker who wanted to be a songwriter. So in the \u201870s, he recorded some demos of his own tunes in the hopes of getting a record deal to write for others. Unfortunately Ken was not much of a player or singer. The result is a perfect blend of naivet\u00e9, ambition and simply not giving a fuck. Ramshackle rock tunes about trucking, drinking and lost love. Eventually these demos were discovered by Paul Major and he shared them with his weirdo record collector circles seeking \u201creal people\u201d music. The rest is history.\n\n**Steven Halpern &amp; Georgia Kelly - \u201cAncient Echoes\u201d**\n\nLabel: Heru Records, Halpern Sounds, Year: 1978\nGenre: Ambient, New Age\nListen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILDPbfvSDUM&amp;list=PLsdKvE75kymZKFgX8-5Yekc4LVsvVm1JN\n\nNew age legend Steven Halpern pairing up with Georgia Kelly. Halpern plays electric piano, synths and provides the ancient chant, Kelly performs on her harp. It\u2019s a thoughtful, healing and meditative affair, a classic within the new age community. The compositions were inspired by ancient Greece, Egypt and China awaken feelings of d\u00e9ja vu and eternal delight. Bliss out.\n\n**Supersilent - \u201c13\u201d**\n\nLabel: Smalltown Supersound, Year: 2016\nGenre: Free Improvisation, Death Jazz\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/smalltownsupersound/supersilent-139\n\nThis is the Oslo, Norway based group, Supersilent. This is their 10th album since their debut \u201c1-3\u201d in 1998. The music is all freely improvised avant-garde jazz, with apparently no practice and only a bit of talk before the recordings take place. Sonically the music has a far-out otherworldly feel; blending synths, organs, noise, textural samples, trumpet and falsetto voices. Depending on any given moment, they can make your ears bleed or create heavenly atmospherics. One of the most fiercely unique groups I know. \n\n**The Shaggs - \u201cShaggs\u2019 Own Thing\u201d**\n\nLabel: Rounder Records, Red Rooster, Year: 1982\nGenre: Outsider, Garage Rock\nListen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m79b2gpwcSg\n\nBy now everyone knows \u201cPhilosophy of the World\u201d, but have you heard \u201cShaggs\u2019 Own Thing\u201d? It\u2019s a collection of unreleased tunes that were recorded in 1975 but were abandoned because of their father, Austin Wiggin\u2019s passing. The album has some covers on it, \u201cYesterday Once More\u201d by the Carpenters, \u201cI Love\u201d by Tom T. Hall and the band\u2019s playing has definitely improved since the debut. In the youtube link above, you can hear one of the weirdest Shaggs songs. \u201cShaggs\u2019 Own Thing (Vocal Version)\u201d which includes their father and brother\u2019s singy-talky back and forth about sleeping with another man\u2019s girl (?!). Bizarre and well worth a listen for fans of the Shaggs.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought I&amp;#39;d put down a few words and talk about some albums I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying recently.

The result is a perfect blend of naivet\u00e9, ambition and simply not giving a fuck. Ramshackle rock tunes about trucking, drinking and lost love. Eventually these demos were discovered by Paul Major and he shared them with his weirdo record collector circles seeking \u201creal people\u201d music. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steven Halpern &amp;amp; Georgia Kelly - \u201cAncient Echoes\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Label: Heru Records, Halpern Sounds, Year: 1978\nGenre: Ambient, New Age\nListen: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILDPbfvSDUM&amp;amp;list=PLsdKvE75kymZKFgX8-5Yekc4LVsvVm1JN\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILDPbfvSDUM&amp;amp;list=PLsdKvE75kymZKFgX8-5Yekc4LVsvVm1JN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New age legend Steven Halpern pairing up with Georgia Kelly. Halpern plays electric piano, synths and provides the ancient chant, Kelly performs on her harp. It\u2019s a thoughtful, healing and meditative affair, a classic within the new age community. The compositions were inspired by ancient Greece, Egypt and China awaken feelings of d\u00e9ja vu and eternal delight. Bliss out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supersilent - \u201c13\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Label: Smalltown Supersound, Year: 2016\nGenre: Free Improvisation, Death Jazz\nListen: &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/smalltownsupersound/supersilent-139\"&gt;https://soundcloud.com/smalltownsupersound/supersilent-139&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the Oslo, Norway based group, Supersilent. This is their 10th album since their debut \u201c1-3\u201d in 1998. The music is all freely improvised avant-garde jazz, with apparently no practice and only a bit of talk before the recordings take place. Sonically the music has a far-out otherworldly feel; blending synths, organs, noise, textural samples, trumpet and falsetto voices. Depending on any given moment, they can make your ears bleed or create heavenly atmospherics. One of the most fiercely unique groups I know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shaggs - \u201cShaggs\u2019 Own Thing\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Label: Rounder Records, Red Rooster, Year: 1982\nGenre: Outsider, Garage Rock\nListen: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m79b2gpwcSg\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m79b2gpwcSg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now everyone knows \u201cPhilosophy of the World\u201d, but have you heard \u201cShaggs\u2019 Own Thing\u201d? It\u2019s a collection of unreleased tunes that were recorded in 1975 but were abandoned because of their father, Austin Wiggin\u2019s passing. The album has some covers on it, \u201cYesterday Once More\u201d by the Carpenters, \u201cI Love\u201d by Tom T. Hall and the band\u2019s playing has definitely improved since the debut. In the youtube link above, you can hear one of the weirdest Shaggs songs. \u201cShaggs\u2019 Own Thing (Vocal Version)\u201d which includes their father and brother\u2019s singy-talky back and forth about sleeping with another man\u2019s girl (?!). Bizarre and well worth a listen for fans of the Shaggs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "vinyl", "name": "t1_dga3xwm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249799.0, "created_utc": 1492220999.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gn85", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gn85", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga7d9y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "omnigardens", "parent_id": "t1_dga78yc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/vinyl", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol I'm going to take you at face value.
