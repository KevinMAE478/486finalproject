"body": "**The Uranium Club - \"All of Them Naturals\" | 2016**\nUS press on Fashionable Idiots Records\n\n\nThis has probably been my most played album after discovering it late last year. These guys sound a bit like early Devo, early Wire and maybe some Minute Men and Swell Maps mixed in as well. They have that straight forward punk/post punk sound that you would expect to hear from their late 70's - early 80's influences with some incredibly catchy riffs and hilariously stupid-on-purpose lyrics that make for some great one-liners. \n\n\nThere's not much info out  there about this band, and I think they like keeping it that way. They don't have a website and the only social media page I found was a facebook page that rarely gets updated. The packaging for the album also doesn't give away much information either. The front has the name of the band and the album, but both sides are made up of phony advertisements for made up products. It comes with a two sided insert which has lyrics and two more goofy ads. My favorite part is probably the labels on the records which are designed to look like a mail order form and they completely omit any information about the band or the track list. Overall, I really loved opening this up when I first got it and reading through all the phony ads and things. It's stuff like this where bands and labels go the extra mile on their physical releases to make their albums so much more than just a collection of songs. \n\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this band to anyone who likes early punk rock and music that doesn't take itself too seriously. \n\n\nCheck out the track [Opus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8k4fz05mf8).\n\n\n**Parquet Courts - \"Light Up Gold\" | 2012**\n2013 repress on What's your Rapture? Records\n\n\nI first heard of this band last year after their 2016 album \"Human Performance\" created a lot of buzz and was received really well by critics. The album didn't do it for me, as I thought it wore it's influences too boldly on its sleeve (way too Pavement sounding) and failed to bring enough energy or originality to the table for me. One day at work I was talking music with a co-worker and he mentioned that Parquet Courts' \"Live at Third Man\" album was one of his recent pick ups that hes been spinning a lot, and he also described it as punk and garage sounding. This wasn't a band that I would've thought he would be into or enthusiastic about, so I decided to give their live stuff another shot. Since I couldn't find the Third Man recording online, I went with an older [Live at KEXP set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rEwOhbSbeI&amp;t=633s) and it was like I was seeing a completely different band than I heard on \"HP\". They had so much raw energy and the guitarists both had really interesting styles that worked so well together. The fact that they played super cheap squire guitars made them even more cool too me. From there I went through the bands older albums and eventually became a fan of their entire catalog, including \"HP\". If you've never given this band a listen, I would say this album here, \"Light Up Gold\" is a great place to start. It's full of really catchy and interesting guitar riffs and some great lyrics. What I like about the guitar playing on this album is that they don't use a ton of notes, but still keep it really interesting in a sort of \"less is more\" type of way. \n\n\nThe artwork and packaging on this is pretty cool. I believe Andrew Savage, the guitarist and lead singer, does all the bands artwork. I picked this up pretty cheap on amazon for about $13, so its a good one to grab if you get a giftcard or something. If you like indie/alternative and early post punk, definitely give this one a shot. \n\n\nCheck out the song [\"Master of My Craft\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UFzde_Y_t0)\n\n\n**The Holydrug Couple - \"Moonlust\" | 2015**\nSacred Bones Records\n\n\nThese guys are a sort of psych/dream pop duo from Chile. I discovered this album going through the Sacred Bones Records website and thinking that the cover looked cool. This was one of those albums that I couldn't stop playing after I heard it because it's just so beautiful. I'm not going waste a lot of time talking about the music because I suggest that you just listen for yourself. I'd say if you like Beach House or Tame Impala's more mellow stuff, than you'll like this. Very pretty and mellow stuff. \n\n\nI've had this one in my amazon wishlist for a while, but every time I go to buy it, it's sold out. Fortunately I found this copy brand new at one of my local record stores one day and happily snatched it up. Theres not much to the packaging or design on this one, but I think thats typical of all Sacred Bones releases. \n\n\nCheck out the track [Late or Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OSYwYk5EGg)\n\n\nWarpaint - \"Heads Up\" | 2016\nRough Trade Records\n\n\nThese girls rock. I first discovered them after hearing the single \"Disco/Very\" from their previous self titled album and have been a fan since. \"Heads Up\" is their newest album that goes in a bit more poppy direction in a similar vein as \"Disco/Very\" had on their last album. Some fans were put off but this direction the band chose to go, but I really dig it. This album is loads of fun from front to back and definitely something that can turn a good time into a great time. If you've never heard them before, I highly suggest you check out their [live on KEXP set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0JqmAbe0jw) on youtube (seriously if you dont subscribe to KEXP, you're missing out). These girls are all amazing musicians and play so well together. They way they harmonize both vocally and with their instruments is truly amazing to hear and see. The bass player is amazing!\n\n\nI ordered the deluxe version of the album from the band back when it dropped last year. It's a double LP with a gatefold jacket, and disc one is on a very pretty blush pink color. It also came with a bonus 7\" which I forgot to photograph and a little packet of some kid of seeds that you can plant. A little weird, but pretty cool. You don't get those kinds of things with digital music.\n\n\nCheck out [\"White Out\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1BqwONm4TE)\n\n\n**Iggy Pop - \"Lust For Life\" | 1977**\nRCA Victor\n\n\nI'll end on a Classic. I'm sure everyone is familiar with The Stooges legendary albums, and if you're not, stop what you're doing and go listen to \"Fun House\" right now. Seriously kids, its the best rock and roll album of all time. Anyway, Iggy has put out tons of records since his time in the Stooges, and quite a few of those albums a pretty terrible, but his late 70's stuff that he worked on with Bowie are some of the best work he's ever done in my opinion. This album would be my choice for his best solo album as it's rock solid from start to finish. Everyone has probably heard the title track \"Lust For Life\" and \"The Passenger\" at some point down the line, but it's the other lesser know songs on here that really make this album something great for me. The raw energy of \"Sweet 16\", the bitter sarcasm of \"Success\" and the just overall catchiness of \"Fall in Love With Me\" make this album worth coming back to time and time again. \n\n\nI picked this one up at a flea market for $12. It's an original pressing and the cover isn't in the best shape, but the vinyl sounds great. One of my favorite albums in my collection for sure. \n\n\nI can't really pick one song to check out on this one, just listen to the whole thing. Iggy is one of my rock and roll heroes and I've had the chance to see him live twice, once with the Stooges and once with Josh Homme (another one of my all time favorites) when they toured for their \"Post Pop Depression\" album. The later one was one of the best performances I've ever seen and Iggy is still just as much of a showman now as he has ever been. I expected them to play a lot of the new songs and some old classics like \"Lust for Life\", but I think the third song in the pulled out \"Sweet 16\" and I just lost myself. His set was almost two hours long and covered almost all of the late 70's material, songs that I never thought I'd hear live, and it was just so incredible. So happy to have been there and see him play. \n\n\n[Listen to Iggy, kids.
