Low Life is on the left and was released in 1984. The one in the middle is their 1986 album Brotherhood. The right one is Devo's 1990 album Smooth Noodle Maps.\n\nLow-Life is a fantastic album, and it's the album where New Order starts moving to favor synths over guitar. It's one of their best in my opinion, although I absolutely despise the first track on the album, Love Vigilantes. That being said, though, I seem to be the only person in the world with that opinion, so don't get your hopes too low in the track if you haven't heard it before. My favorite track is Sunrise, and my other favorites are Subculture, The Perfect Kiss, This Time of Night, and Elegia. Elegia is notable for being featured in several works outside of the album itself, most notably Stranger Things and Metal Gear Solid V (Hideo Kojima is a huge New Order fan).\n\nBrotherhood is better than Low-Life in my opinion. Better tracks overall. Side A is dedicated to guitars, and side B is dedicated to synths. Every track on this album is phenomenal. There are also less dark and sad tracks on this album than previous ones, showing how New Order has shifted away from Joy Division more and more with each record. My favorite track on the album is Bizarre Love Triangle, which is probably New Order's 2nd biggest hit besides Blue Monday. This is actually my favorite song of all time, no joke. I have no idea why it took me this long to get this record. Other favorites include Paradise, Weirdo, and Angel Dust. I should also note that State of the Nation is listed as a track on the album but it isn't actually on there. This was part of a cruel joke the band plays at the end of Every Little Counts, the actual last song of the album, where they make it sound like the record scratches and skips followed by an abrupt end of the album and the song. A bit disappointed that State of the Nation isn't on here because I love that song, but I have it on Substance (1987) so it's no big deal.\n\nThe final record is Devo's Smooth Noodle Maps, their criminally underrated album and probably their worst selling album. This was released at the end of Enigma Records', their label, very brief lifespan, so not much attention was garnered for it. The version I ordered is the Hispavox release from Spain because it was cheaper than the UK release and I couldn't find any vinyl releases from the US, which is where I live. This album ditched the sampler used on the past 2 albums, Shout and Total Devo, and as a result the sound is fresh, crisp, and unique. All of the tracks on here are fantastic, but my favorites are Stuck in a Loop, Post Post-Modern Man, Morning Dew (which is actually a cover), and Jimmy. Jimmy is notable in that the song is absolutely hilarious, with it being about a corrupt CEO of a company named Jimmy, who abuses his wife and dog. Eventually karma catches up to Jimmy and he ends up in a wheelchair and his life is made miserable. Sounds awful and totally not funny, but the zany instruments and lyrics really contrast the message. My favorite record on the album is Spin the Wheel, which is a total banger in my opinion. The chord progression is great.\n\nThat's it, I guess. This is actually my first time posting to this subreddit despite being a subscriber to it for a while now, so hopefully this post isn't bad.
