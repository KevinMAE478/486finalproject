I had an amazon gift card and wasn't sure what else to do with it. I can't remember how vinyl got inceptioned into my mind, but here we are.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Setup**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Turntable*: Used Dual 1225 bought from a guy with a bunch of TTs in Jenkintown, PA. Cracked dust cover and automatic functions half work, but I deal with it.\n\n*Cartridge*: AT95e. Seemed like a reasonable budget first cartridge to see if I liked this. Does its job.\n\n*Amplifier*: Used Technics SU-7300. Had to clean it up and change out some caps, resisters, and a zener diode to get the right channel working on the phono stage. It has a nice vintage look and is leagues ahead of the 90s Pioneer CX-4000 I ~~inherited~~ stole from my parents.\n\n*Speakers*: Used Bose 141 series bookshelf speakers. I needed something cheap to pump out music. My wife does not care about why separate components are better, so this is the best I can do with the limited space I have at the moment. They are nice little speakers, but nothing to write home about.\n\n*Stands*: I picked up various pieces of free wood either off the street or at a table-making company that was having to move warehouses. Each stand is a two column diagonal design with square base and speaker platform. Stained with Miniwax Red Mahogany (at request of wife to match the  room decor--I was initially planning on just using boiled linseed oil). These are not examples of fine craftsmanship, so I did not go through the effort of placing finishing coats of polyurethane. Maybe next time when I have better materials and have developed better woodworking skills.\n\n*Accessories*: Made a cork mat from the planter mats from Home Depot. The plastic backing comes right off, put a hole in the middle, sanded the cork disc down to a more appropriate thickness, and applied some Day of the Dead themed cloth I got at Wal-Mart with spray adhesive. It's fun with clear vinyl albums.\n\n*Album storage*: Wine crate on a bar stool. Still working on this part...\n\n*Shelf album*: Lindsey Stirling's third album *Brave Enough.* If you don't know about Lindsey Stirling, she is a hip hip/dance music violinist who was booted off one of the early seasons of America's Got Talent near the end because Piers Morgan thought no one would pay to watch her dance around a play violin. She worked her ass off, put her stuff on YouTube, and took off. To me, this 3rd album is a continuing middle finger and big FU to Piers. Don't let anyone but (or especially not) you discourage yourself from pursuing your dreams. As for the music, this one has a lot more collaborations where she plays second fiddle to the guest vocalists. It's not bad, just a little more pop than what I'm used to from the first two records.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHappy early Good Friday (or just a good Friday, if you prefer)! Keep living life just one side at a time :)\n\nEdit: formatting", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally got my speakers off the dresser where my turntable was sitting.
