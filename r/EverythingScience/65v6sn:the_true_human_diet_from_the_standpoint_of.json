I've combined this kind of diet with serious weightlifting, and it's changed my body and health for the better. \n\nEssentially the idea is that you don't almost completely cut down on carbs like the popular diets (such as paleo) have you do, but you instead eat your carbs when your body is at a point where it doesn't tend to convert its intake into fat (in the backloading regime that's after your workout, ideally in the late afternoon - early evening); also, you eat simpler carbs and don't combine them with foods that take a long time to digest (fats or fiber), so that they don't stay in your system for a long time. \n\nIn simple terms, your morning and lunch meals: Protein and fats (and all your veggies), evening meals: Protein and (as simple and as healthy as possible) carbs. Best simple and healthy carbs are rice, potatoes, bread, sweet potatoes, things like that. Simplicity of carbs is tough to gauge, but a good indicator is glycemic index. \n\nOne of the main proponents of carb backloading, John Kiefer, advocates eating even traditionally unhealthy things if you combine them with high-intensity workouts, such as pizzas, donuts, french fries, and so on. But of course since that can impact your health in other ways than mere weight and muscle, you should take care to eat the carbs that are healthier for you and fit into your lifestyle.

I&amp;#39;ve combined this kind of diet with serious weightlifting, and it&amp;#39;s changed my body and health for the better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially the idea is that you don&amp;#39;t almost completely cut down on carbs like the popular diets (such as paleo) have you do, but you instead eat your carbs when your body is at a point where it doesn&amp;#39;t tend to convert its intake into fat (in the backloading regime that&amp;#39;s after your workout, ideally in the late afternoon - early evening); also, you eat simpler carbs and don&amp;#39;t combine them with foods that take a long time to digest (fats or fiber), so that they don&amp;#39;t stay in your system for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, your morning and lunch meals: Protein and fats (and all your veggies), evening meals: Protein and (as simple and as healthy as possible) carbs. Best simple and healthy carbs are rice, potatoes, bread, sweet potatoes, things like that. Simplicity of carbs is tough to gauge, but a good indicator is glycemic index. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the main proponents of carb backloading, John Kiefer, advocates eating even traditionally unhealthy things if you combine them with high-intensity workouts, such as pizzas, donuts, french fries, and so on. But of course since that can impact your health in other ways than mere weight and muscle, you should take care to eat the carbs that are healthier for you and fit into your lifestyle.
