Sessions is also a man who has blatantly and outspokenly repeated falsehoods about the \"danger\" of marijuana that are counter to current scientific understanding. Whether he technically followed the committee's official recommendation is immaterial because the administration has the capacity to revive the commission anyway and maybe you know actually populate it with real scientists instead of lawyers and forensics industry representatives.\n\nAll of the reporting in the OP's article is fair and accurate. /u/oscar_the_couch  I'm sorry but you basically have been duped by a shitty shill-level opinion piece and are helping to misinform people with this kind of misguided \"well, actually...\" nonsense.", "edited": 1492199225.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, not good catch.
