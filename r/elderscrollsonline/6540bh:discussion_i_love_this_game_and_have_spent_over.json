Why are these things player requested, rather than built in by default? These things are pretty standard. I mean, do you remember the older versions of Group Finder? Where you could only queue up for one, or all, nothing in between? Or that it didn't work cross-faction, which cut your pool by 2/3rds (depending on faction size). Do you remember how if the leader DCd or left, nobody else had the power to remove people or re-queue? I mean, that kind of shit is absolutely infantile. There's older, F2P games that had better group finders than this, by far, with fewer issues. So were these changes player-requested? Yes, I guess. But the question is, why weren't they fixed, by design, before the product was even released? As bad as group finder is now, it's head and shoulders better than the abject piece of shit that it was at launch.\n\n\nStamina/Magicka imbalance? Again, isn't it obvious? Can you explain to me, logically and succinctly, why a Nightblade has 5 stamina morphs, with at least one per tree, whereas DK has 2, and both are DoTs, and both are in the same tree? Players didn't design this. ZOS developers did. Do I need to point out that 5 != 2 and that it's an imbalance? Not just in strength but just on the fundamental level as the number of potential build permutations?\n\n\nSame goes with proc sets. Many games have them. And yes, it does add spice and make things more fun. When done right. It's like water. Do you drink water? I bet you do. But did you know that drinking too much water will literally kill you? Some years ago there was a radio show competition to drink the most water because the organizers failed their high school biology class, and one of the participants (just as dimwitted) died from water intoxication. This doesn't mean water is bad, or that you shouldn't drink water. It's the question of degrees. One cup is good for you. Ten oil drum-fulls is not. Same with proc sets. Done right, whether player requested or not, would have been fine. Done wrong (and lest we forget, done by ZOS, whilst simultaneously ignoring player feedback) it's bad. \n\n\nAnd so on, and so forth. The way I see it, player feedback is always a good thing. You may not always agree (I sure as sunny-side-up fuck don't), but usually there's a point to it. Case in points, recent Coag Blood fiasco, and the Curse buff. The original ZOS idea for new Coag Blood morph was beyond idiotic (heal for 33% of missing magicka). Verifiably so. You're riding across Cyrodiil. You suddenly realize a Nightblade just inserted a two handed sword into your anus. And that's assuming you didn't get 1-shot outright, which is a whole other discussion. Your health plummets, and you need a heal. You cast Coag Dragon Blood and...get 0 healing, because you have 0 missing magicka. Brilliant design right there. Does it really need a scholar to explain to them why this design choice was idiotic? Well, regardless, players stepped in, wrote pages and pages of examples, videos, etc., and it got changed. Conversely, Sorc Curse was about to be nerfed, they cried, and the nerf turned into a buff objectively, or at least a wash subjectively. But that's a case of devs listening to just one class, and worse (by their own admission on video) maining that class. It's really tough to balance the game with multiple classes when you just main the one. Which, incidentally, I believe is one of the cruxes of current balance issues. I can't imagine the same dev running vMA in sequence on mSorc, mNB and then switching to DK, and thinking this is fine. Any metrics taken (time, damage taken, just fucking keystrokes per minute and abilities executed) would tell them the balance is off. So they either haven't done it, which is a QA issue, or don't give a fuck, which is even more grave.\n\n\nAlthough I do take your point. This way there's risk of too-many-cooks-in-one-kitchen syndrome. But hopefully there are some glaring issues that literally everyone can agree on. Eliminating those before release goes a long way.\n\n\nEDIT: I realize I used boo-hoo-poor-DKs in some examples, and what sounds like OP-5-morph-Nightblades in others. No. This is not a heavily disguised buff DKs or nerf NBs. Both have issues. Case in point, Grim Resolve is both clunky and has no other class equivalent in complexity. By clunky I mean, if you activate it, get the buff, fire off 4 lights, activate the proc, and do 4 more lights, you will not get the second proc, despite the buff still active. That is counter-intuitive. Either firing up the proc should remove the buff, refresh it, or second sequence of 4 attacks should generate another proc. As it is, NBs blow 2 GCDs on proc activation and refresh. Further, the problem arises if you get a proc, but no target. You are unable to use the proc or refresh the ability, it is essentially \"locked\" until it expires. And like I mentioned, it has no equivalent in complexity for any other class.\n\n\nEDIT2: This also cuts both ways. Some stuff has been player-requested, with nobody saying no, since launch. And hasn't been done. And with no good reason. And it's not hard. Case in point, colorblind mode! One of the most requested features. Most games, from WoW to Witcher 3, have it. It's piss-easy to do (allow us to change the RGB value triplet of the telegraphs). There's absolutely zero reason not to do it. Quality of life improvements for actual colorblind players would be astounding, and improvements for average players who might prefer a different shade to telegraphs nice also.

Especially in conjunction with animation cancelling. It's a two-step problem. Weapon switch by itself isn't too bad, but it also works as animation cancel, which is why people use it to shortcut any long animations, which leads to needless switching, which is further exacerbated by the fact that most abilities only affect the active bar, and bonuses for weapons are uneven (dual wield counting as two items, staff counting as one, that old saw). All of these together create a perfect storm. If weapon switching did not work as animation cancel (which can be easily fixed by dropping its priority below that of abilities), we would see a lot less of it. Currently people have to switch weapons simply to re-buff every 6-15 seconds. That's not really necessary, it's just a flawed design of the system. I really don't think the devs originally intended for people to constantly switch back and forth. The game has a lot of other issues directly linked to that. They couldn't figure out how to make charge work, so they put a root on it, which ignores root immunities. Which looks and feels weird. They couldn't figure out how to fix animation canceling, so they're allowing it, and we have people charging up another attack while the first is still technically in progress, but becomes invisible. And so on. These are all problems.

They spend so much time creating those animations. They just did ESO Live a few weeks back, showing unique Warden animations. Why make those, if we're meant to animation cancel them anyhow? Nobody worth their salt isn't going to see them, we'll be canceling them all. And worst of all, in PvP, you get hit by attacks which lack the visual, because they've been canceled. Which makes ESO PvP extremely newbie-unfriendly. You need experience to know what's coming, because against a good player you will not see it coming, because of animation canceling. Whereas the original game's design was \"you see him winding up A, you counter with B\". Now it's \"get B up, before he gets you with A and you die\". And then they threw in proc sets. Which are fun, I'll give you that, but things like Tremorscale or Velidreth or Viper?
