Bethesda is working out on 2 new IPs (like Elder Scrolls and Fallout, just something new). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they were to announce and release the 1st one (rumoured starfield - sci-fi rpg) this year, then the next one will be around 2022 (considering they need at least 5 years to develop a game). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if ES6 is a plan after that, then we&amp;#39;ll see it in 2027 (10 years from now) at the earliest. I still doubt we&amp;#39;ll see ES6 before 2030 though. I think a lot of it depends on how popular ESO remains over the years to carry that ES torch on it&amp;#39;s own. No reason why it shouldn&amp;#39;t stay relevant for the next 10 years though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dgdw9dt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492482738.0, "created_utc": 1492453938.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdk8j4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "North_South_Side", "parent_id": "t1_dgdgvqq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd wager tes6 will be out sooner than 5 years.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d wager tes6 will be out sooner than 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dgdk8j4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469042.0, "created_utc": 1492440242.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uo8n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdvoqy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guitardz", "parent_id": "t1_dgdgvqq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh was double bank space for subs confirmed?
