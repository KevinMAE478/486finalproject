Family and Friends mostly. We used to be a 500 member trading guild but the stress of guild bids and lack of dues and donations to support it led to a purge and reboot with a new focus on just playing. We currently have about 100 members, and are looking for ACTIVE, DEDICATED players who are willing to pitch in when and where they can. We have some master crafters in all fields, we can craft 50% xp potions and give you tips on how to make gold/level up characters, help with dungeons or pvp as well.

The Strategist meets these requirements.\n\n* **Strategic.** We do not just sigh and point fingers on a wipe. Strats is salt-free - we learn from our mistakes and adjust our playstyles accordingly and plan a different strategy. We know when to push on and fight, but we also know when the challenge is bigger than us and we need time to regroup.\n* **Mature.** We do not grovel and beg for loot or a level boost. We realize that most of our guildmates have lives outside the game or have personal leveling and questing to do, and we respect that.\n* **Inclusive.** All the bigots, racists, and homophobes do not have a place in our guild. We welcome gamers of all ages, skills, and backgrounds - it's what helps us grow!\n* **Friendly.** We do our best to answer any questions other guildmates may have, and we help as much as we can. We go the extra mile to help new people - ask for an axe and we might craft you an entire set! \n\n###Join #teamstrats!\n\nWe are looking for initiates from all over Tamriel regardless of faction.

We, friends, are those Fools!\n\nHomestead Update:  Yes, we have a massive Guild Hall with all amenities available for the exclusive use of our members.  We also have a guild hall dedicated to dueling and training.\n\n* **We're a community.** Fool's Errand is a day one guild, founded on June 9, 2015.  We have grown into one of the largest and most active guilds on the XB1/NA Megaserver.  Fool's Errand isn't just a Guild, it's a community.  We have an active Discord Chat server for out-of-game communications, which helps guild members plan for events, group up, buy/sell/trade gear with other guildies, etc...\n\n* **We're mature.**  Fool's Errand players are mature, ranging in age from their 20s to their 50s, and hail from all over North America, Europe, and beyond. We are veterans, active duty military, parents, and all sorts of other 'grown ups' who are committed to friendly, mature, and team-oriented PvE and PvP gameplay.\n\n* **We're for those willing to put in the effort.**  Our experience indicates that this guild is NOT a good fit for:  Players that don\u2019t participate in guild events, don\u2019t use guild chat, and aren\u2019t interested in playing the game with others.  This guild is vibrant and active, and requires a certain level of investment of time, interest, and activity for a player to get the best experience.\n\nOur job is to help our members get to CP600, to have excellent top-tier builds, and to help them get best-in-slot gear.\n\nOur members' job is to be active in guild chat, to help fellow guild members, to participate in guild events, and...most importantly...to have FUN playing!\n\n* **Trials** We run non-vet Trials three times per week, so we are also looking for players who are ready, willing, and able to hit Trials.  We also run vet Trials at least twice per week and have a progression-based Trials group for the toughest content in the game.\n\n*  **Crafters** We have dedicated crafters to help you get the gear you need and to help you research your own crafting!\n\n*  **Guild events** We host guild events *at least* five nights a week, alternating between PvP content and PvE content, including endgame content.  Guild events are also hosted on weekends from time to time, to accommodate those who can't join us during the week.\n\nWe host a weekly public event focused on helping other players grab skyshards, clear content, and gain XP.\n\nWe are looking for more players from Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania to expand our \u2018overnight crew.\u2019\n\nWe are actively looking for like-minded players to join our ranks.

Dungeons, Trials, World Bosses, Imperial City Sewers and Districts, Dolmens and more are part of our rotating nightly events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although we have a large casual membership, we create space for more hard core and focused play and manage the mix well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Active TeamSpeak  / Guild Facebook Group&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Website:  displacedninjas.gamerlaunch.com&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We host PvP events with Aldmeri Dominion (AD) toons, but always CROSS ALLIANCE for dungeons / trials and all alliances are welcome.
