Eventually the NDA will drop and people will outline precisely what's changed and what that means for the meta. At best it'll be prioritising resource management enchants and skills, at worst it'll be prioritising resource management sets. We'll just need to tweak and adjust builds, and we'll still be good.\n\nIn my experience as a mostly solo player, the whole \"we had infinite resources\" thing people are throwing around is ignorant to the entire game. Resource management is a very real thing in solo and even in the most unoptimised groups, it's still a thing. Having ran in a group on a stam sorc that has to heavy attack several times to get 20% of his stamina back, only to burn through it in one cycle of the rotation, orbs does help tremendously.
