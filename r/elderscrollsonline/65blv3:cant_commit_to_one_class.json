Specifically you want to unlock Cleave as quick as possible, and morph it into Brawler. Brawler is so wonderful for leveling. Basically it's a bleed, it's cone in front of you. And it shields you. Further, the shield gets stronger per enemy hit. Makes leveling a breeze. And then you unlock Momentum, and morph it into Rally, and those two by themselves will carry you through the rest of the game. You don't even have to hit an enemy with Brawler for a single-strength shield to appear, you can just swing in the air and get a shield that way as you approach the enemy. Invaluable skill, for leveling, in my opinion.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, Dual Wield just doesn't have enough healing. Yes, there's Blood Craze morph of Twin Slashes and Bloodthirst morph of Flurry, but they're not nearly enough when you have 6+ enemies bashing your face in, which is common in public dungeons such as Rezak's Wheel. \n\n\nNightblade feels quite different from DK. DK feels naturally tanky, and the abilities support it. Like Magma Armor ultimate, for example, makes you pretty much unkillable for about 9 seconds. But Nightblade has a lot of on-kill heals which are nice. That is, if you kill something with your Killer's Blade execute ability, you get healed for 17% of your health. If that target was marked with Mark Target, depending on the morph you get healed for 40-60% of your health. Though it should be noted that Mark Target and its morphs are magicka abilities, so you can't use them often on stamina NB. Also something has to die, because it's on-kill. So when you are fighting a single hard enemy (boss or player), it does you no good.\n\n\nA lot of abilities you'll use will be the same, both on NB and DK. So the class just adds flavour and passives. NB is much more bursty and has better GTFOutability. But DK is more naturally tanky and can survive situations where any other class will be pushing up daisies.\n\n\nAs far as relative strength right now, I think DK is a little bit ahead in terms of DPS, and makes a vastly superior tank. But in PvP, if you want to gank someone, kill them before they can even react, NB will be better. More reliable, anyway. And getting away afterwards is easier on NB. Also like I said, this is the situation **right now**. In 2 months Morrowind comes out and we may be looking at an entirely different picture, as we're pretty much guaranteed some more class balancing. And I expect even more than that before the end of the year, because the addition of battlegrounds will pretty much force them into it (I expect them to be virtually unplayable due to cheese, and very unenjoyable at launch).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For leveling, I really recommend 2H, yes.

You don&amp;#39;t even have to hit an enemy with Brawler for a single-strength shield to appear, you can just swing in the air and get a shield that way as you approach the enemy. Invaluable skill, for leveling, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Dual Wield just doesn&amp;#39;t have enough healing. Yes, there&amp;#39;s Blood Craze morph of Twin Slashes and Bloodthirst morph of Flurry, but they&amp;#39;re not nearly enough when you have 6+ enemies bashing your face in, which is common in public dungeons such as Rezak&amp;#39;s Wheel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nightblade feels quite different from DK. DK feels naturally tanky, and the abilities support it. Like Magma Armor ultimate, for example, makes you pretty much unkillable for about 9 seconds. But Nightblade has a lot of on-kill heals which are nice. That is, if you kill something with your Killer&amp;#39;s Blade execute ability, you get healed for 17% of your health. If that target was marked with Mark Target, depending on the morph you get healed for 40-60% of your health. Though it should be noted that Mark Target and its morphs are magicka abilities, so you can&amp;#39;t use them often on stamina NB. Also something has to die, because it&amp;#39;s on-kill. So when you are fighting a single hard enemy (boss or player), it does you no good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of abilities you&amp;#39;ll use will be the same, both on NB and DK. So the class just adds flavour and passives. NB is much more bursty and has better GTFOutability. But DK is more naturally tanky and can survive situations where any other class will be pushing up daisies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as relative strength right now, I think DK is a little bit ahead in terms of DPS, and makes a vastly superior tank. But in PvP, if you want to gank someone, kill them before they can even react, NB will be better. More reliable, anyway. And getting away afterwards is easier on NB. Also like I said, this is the situation &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2 months Morrowind comes out and we may be looking at an entirely different picture, as we&amp;#39;re pretty much guaranteed some more class balancing. And I expect even more than that before the end of the year, because the addition of battlegrounds will pretty much force them into it (I expect them to be virtually unplayable due to cheese, and very unenjoyable at launch).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dg9uepe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236999.0, "created_utc": 1492208199.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hzat", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Seytai", "parent_id": "t1_dg93fgh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really appreciate this post.

So with DW you end up with 2 + 5 + 5 set pieces, which gives you 2 5-piece bonuses. And with 2H you  get 2 + 5 + 4 which only gives 1, or you go 1 + 5 + 5 and miss out on the monster set bonus.

Especially the whopping TWO stamina class morphs you get (compared to 5 on a Nightblade). Hail, Injection, etc., are all good fun and part of DPS rotation even on high end content. But I've yet to see a bow/bow build that can put out DPS that comes even close to that of other weapons, and it's nowhere even within shouting distance of what staves can do. Needs to be buffed.

If you're good, nobody will kick you out, but you may be passive-aggressively hinted that your performance would be oh-so-much-better if you just switched to magicka like a good boy.
