Right click on item, select turn imperial, blammo you reskinned the item into Imperial motif. Mechanically it's already in there. Would it be so horrible to allow the same for other motifs? This is not devs disagreeing with me, or devs not having enough time. The system is already 3/4 there. Has been since beta.\n\n\nSecond, why is it counter-intuitive? They sell motifs for real money in crown store. BUT the best items in the game cannot be reskinned. Which devalues those motifs immensely. Simply allowing us to reskin any item with a motif that you have (or can buy with crowns) would result in a huge influx of cash. They are literally shooting themselves in both feet with this shit.\n\n\nYou may despise it, but the ability to tweak character appearance in an MMO or an RPG are mandatory these days. Even single player RPGs where nobody else sees your char, even those have barber shops to change hair styles, different armor appearances, etc. That you don't use the feature does nothing as an argument. My argument is that ZOS is directly harming the player base that DO want it, AND harming themselves financially by neutering motifs they're trying to sell for crowns. It's idiotic. It's asinine. There's no possible cogent argument against it aside from \"I won't use it\".\n\n\nThe difference between vet and normal rewards are negligible loot-wise, and identical XP-wise. Needs fixing. Vets (especially newer ones) are tough. Doing vet or better yet HM vet should result in better rewards. What's more, I would say rewards need to be dynamic and de-coupled from group finder entirely. So, for example, if you group up with your friends and walk into a dungeon, if it is your first one today, the game should *automatically* detect it and give you a commensurate reward, including normal/vet, and regular/HM. Would be so much easier, for people who get fucked by the broken Group Finder on regular basis.\n\n\nAnd yes, I absolutely believe that some aspects of the game could have been better done  by a 6-year-old. As far as playing, it's quite simple - I already bought the game back in '14, so that money is gone. I can play it, the way it is now, for no additional cost. And there's nothing better out there right now *that is subscription-free* (still waiting on Crowfall, Star Citizen, etc) Maybe not even that, maybe I'm just in the mood for Elder Scrolls. It's really that simple. There's no MMO out there that I feel currently deserves to be subscribed to. So my playing this game is absolutely not a positive statement about its state.\n\n\nThe rest? Eh. Especially if you bring the costs into it. If recouping the money is an issue, then transmog should be #1 to fix. Considering 3/4 of it is already in the game (crafting window already lets you choose item appearance), simply adding another tab and allowing you to re-skin items would take a competent team a few days, a week at most, including QC. Which as I mentioned would dramatically increase likelihood of people buying motifs (possibly with crowns). But the devs are either out of touch, blind or stupid. \n\n\nAnother big problem, which they acknowledged as a problem already, is all the RNG. Again, same window as transmog - allow the crafter to change the trait. Blam. Done. Huge chunk of the RNG complaints gone. How much work would this take? A couple of days? A week? C'mon. And this is a bandaid-level fix. We're not even talking a large scale systemic fix here.\n\n\nAnd reality? I mean...yeah, to be fair, the game is not a total disaster. It's shitty, sure. The client (even the new 64 bit one) doesn't take full advantage of available hardware (client crashes before it makes my PC break a sweat), we still get stuck in forever-loading-screens in Cyrodiil which goes back 3 years. The group finder still doesn't work (join -&gt; activity complete -&gt; but if you leave the party you get 15 min deserter debuff, even though activity IS complete according to the fucking thing). This is all \"some reality\" you mention. I'm aware of it. I don't need more of it. Reality is shitty enough as it is.\n\n\nSpeaking of reality. Color blind mode. Change RGB from (1,0,0) to some other user-selected permutation of those 3 numbers. Bam, now ~8% of the population (those affected by some form of color blindness) can enjoy the game. I'm not color blind myself (yet), but even I have difficulty in places like City of Ash, which is red as fuck to begin with, and having a party of 4 mDKs makes those red telegraphs pretty fucking difficult to see.
