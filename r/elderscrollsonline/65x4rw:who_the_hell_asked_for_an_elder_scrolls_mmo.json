Sorry man. I'm just deeply, deeply frustrated with GW2 as a whole right now :( It's going in a direction that isn't fun for me personally anymore -- everything outside raids feels like this endless grind for whatever the map currency du jour is, and raids are super, super unforgiving in GW2 and most raid groups I've encountered have this hyper-toxic attitude of \"if you miss ONE step you're never invited again\" and the thing is, the raids THEMSELVES are *so* deeply unforgiving that they're actually justified in gatekeeping like that. So like... it *feels* my options are \"play the old content again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and AGAIN and AGAIN for barely any rewards; OR give yourself anxiety attacks while trying to raid.\"\n\nThis may be related to me being an Engineer main -- feeling locked into the hyper-complex Condigineer build while *also* considered second-fiddle to basically everybody but Revenants (sorry, Revenants :(  ) is deeply frustrating. Like, I have to do 4x the work to be considered 60% as good as your average Elementalist, and feeling like I bring less utility and flexibility. \n\nWhich isn't to say ESO doesn't have flaws -- it does. But the direction ESO is going in feels more like one *I* am interested in long-term right now -- one where I can play any class in any role decently effectively, where there's still tons of content I haven't done and tons of stuff to do outside Veteran Trials.\n\nAnd like idk. I feel like if the GW2 meta were a bit closer to ESO's meta, I, an engineer, could create an *effective* and desirable Healing build using, say, Gyros and Elixirs; or an *effective* and desirable tank build... but I can't, because of how GW2's meta is currently tuned.

It did seem like the top-tier raid groups stopped bothering with tanks, but again, I haven&amp;#39;t been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry man. I&amp;#39;m just deeply, deeply frustrated with GW2 as a whole right now :( It&amp;#39;s going in a direction that isn&amp;#39;t fun for me personally anymore -- everything outside raids feels like this endless grind for whatever the map currency du jour is, and raids are super, super unforgiving in GW2 and most raid groups I&amp;#39;ve encountered have this hyper-toxic attitude of &amp;quot;if you miss ONE step you&amp;#39;re never invited again&amp;quot; and the thing is, the raids THEMSELVES are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; deeply unforgiving that they&amp;#39;re actually justified in gatekeeping like that. So like... it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; my options are &amp;quot;play the old content again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and AGAIN and AGAIN for barely any rewards; OR give yourself anxiety attacks while trying to raid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may be related to me being an Engineer main -- feeling locked into the hyper-complex Condigineer build while &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; considered second-fiddle to basically everybody but Revenants (sorry, Revenants :(  ) is deeply frustrating. Like, I have to do 4x the work to be considered 60% as good as your average Elementalist, and feeling like I bring less utility and flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which isn&amp;#39;t to say ESO doesn&amp;#39;t have flaws -- it does. But the direction ESO is going in feels more like one &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am interested in long-term right now -- one where I can play any class in any role decently effectively, where there&amp;#39;s still tons of content I haven&amp;#39;t done and tons of stuff to do outside Veteran Trials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like idk. I feel like if the GW2 meta were a bit closer to ESO&amp;#39;s meta, I, an engineer, could create an &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; and desirable Healing build using, say, Gyros and Elixirs; or an &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; and desirable tank build... but I can&amp;#39;t, because of how GW2&amp;#39;s meta is currently tuned.
