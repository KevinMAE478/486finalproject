The fate of the island of Vvardenfell hangs in the balance and needs a hero help Vivec, the legendary warrior-poet god, who suffers from a mysterious illness. For this week&amp;#39;s first PTS testing cycle, we&amp;#39;ll be focusing on the new player experience. To help us test the Vvardenfell story, please create a new character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to Vvardenfell, the largest landmass addition to date, we\u2019re also introducing the first new class since ESO launched: the Warden. This class is an adaptable, support-orientated option for players who want to be able to fill a specific role while simultaneously providing assistance to others. If you are interested in a class that uses the wilds of Tamriel to protect, heal, or deal damage (occasionally all at the same time) the Warden is for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morrowind also brings a new PvP mode \u2013 Battlegrounds \u2013 which are small-scale, fast-paced battles with three teams of four players. If you\u2019re looking for a real challenge, head to our newest 12-player Trial, Halls of Fabrication, featuring a Normal and Veteran version. You&amp;#39;re welcome to utilize an existing, copied character or template to test these new systems. You\u2019ll also find a host of new item sets, Motifs, homes and furnishings, collectibles, titles, and even dyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that\u2019s not all! The base game brings many new updates as well including updates to the Champion System, the Master Writ Merchant, Cyrodiil Rewards, a new Inverse Kinematic System, and more. And as always, we have a number of bug fixes and general improvements to the overall game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please remember if you are participating on the PTS and giving us feedback, the entire update is currently covered under a strict NDA.

The Champion Point experience curve has been automatically adjusted with this new cap, so that earlier Champion Points require less experience and can be earned faster.\n\n**Champion System Rebalancing**\n\nThe Champion System has undergone significant rebalancing in this update.\n\n- Stronger, more useful passives have had their maximum values reduced, while weaker, more niche passives have had their maximum values increased.\n\n- All passive values are now significantly more frontloaded and have much greater diminishing returns as you invest an increasing number of points into them.\n\n- The overall goal of these changes is to improve the balance and diversity of Champion Point picks, while also raising the power floor so that those with less Champion Points will be more effective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Skill Line Unlocking**\n\nNewly-created characters will now have all skill lines hidden except for the 3 from their class, the goal being to improve a new player\u2019s experience by reducing the initial number of skill line choices to a more manageable number.\n\n- Skill lines will now unlock when your character takes specific actions.\n\n    - Armor skill lines unlock when you equip 3 pieces of a given armor type (light/medium/heavy).\n\n    - Weapon skill lines unlock when you get a killing blow while the weapon is equipped.\n\n    - Crafting skill lines are unlocked when you visit the appropriate crafting station.\n\n    - Your racial skill line unlocks at level 5.\n\n    - The AvA skill lines now unlock when you gain Alliance Points.\n\n    - Other skill lines will continue to unlock as they did previously, such as the Mages Guild skill line when you join the guild.\n\n- We\u2019ve also added some new UI features to help identify new skill lines:\n\n    - When a skill line is added to the character, an exclamation mark will be displayed next to the Skills window.\n\n    - Skill lines granted through quests will now display in the quest dialogue.\n\n    - A message stating \u201cNew skill line gained\u201d now includes an icon for the skill line.\n\n- Note: This feature only applies to newly created characters; all existing characters will be unaffected.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Adjusted Experience (XP) for Levels 1 \u2013 50**\n\nThe experience needed to level from 1 to 50 has been adjusted. Earlier levels now require less experience to obtain, while later levels will require more.\n\n- The total time to level from 1 to 50 should generally remain unchanged, and anyone currently leveling should not see any decrease to their current level progress \u2013 in some cases you may see an increase in level depending on progress.\n\n- Additionally, all quests now provide more experience to help even the leveling time between those that complete quests versus simply killing monsters.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Master Writ Merchant Update**\n\nRolis Hlaalu, the Master Mediator, has expanded his inventory. He now sells plans for two Target Centurions suitable for evaluating the DPS of an entire Trial group, as well as two separate tiers of Furnisher\u2019s Documents.\n\n- The \u201cTarget Centurion, Dwarf-Brass\u201d is a little tougher than the Veteran Yokeda Kai from Hel Ra Citadel, with nearly 26 million health. In addition to learning the praxis, this requires four Animus Stones as well as 12 Dwarven Construct Repair Parts, which can be found as weekly rewards from the Halls of Fabrication or acquired from other players.\n\n- The \u201cTarget Centurion, Robust Refabricated\u201d is nearly half as tough as Ozara from Sanctum Ophidia, with over 51 million health. This behemoth requires a total of eight Animus Stones, as well as a whopping 120 Dwarven Construct Repair Parts.\n\n- The Hlaalu Furnisher\u2019s Document is now known as the Hlaalu Master\u2019s Furnisher Document, and is now sold for 25 Writ Vouchers.\n\n- A new item known as the Hlaalu Journeyman Furnisher\u2019s Document is now available in exchange for 10 Writ Vouchers, and contains a random blue furnishing recipe.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Normal Mode Dungeon Trophies**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to display the head of a Daedric Titan on a wall in your home, you\u2019re in luck! The Undaunted have started taking trophies home to memorialize their kills, and you are encouraged to do the same.\n\n- The final boss of every dungeon, Trial, and Arena now awards a unique Undaunted Trophy associated with one of the iconic monsters from the encounter. Similar to the Undaunted Busts already available in Veteran Mode, these can be placed once per home, and are account-wide.\n\n- To help keep things organized, there are now separate sub-sections of the Furnishings category for Undaunted Trophies and Undaunted Busts. Similarly, the Gallery section of the Housing Editor has separate subsections for each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**New Hireling Mails**\n\nEach hireling skill now has roughly 100 more unique messages, telling a brand new set of stories. These will start to appear after you\u2019ve exhausted the current pool of messages.\n\n**Cyrodiil Reward Updates**\n\nWe've updated the Cyrodiil Leaderboards rewards! Now, you will receive jewelry from the item sets listed below for placing on the leaderboard, or for your Alliance being in first place. \n\n- The quality of the items you gain are unchanged: placing in the upper echelons of the individual leaderboards will reward you gold-quality items, as always, while lower leaderboard levels gain purple items.\n\n- The amount is unchanged, as well: the 4-week campaigns will award five items, while the 1-week campaigns will award only one item. \n\n- Rewards for the Worthy now provide a single armor piece (but not weapons or jewelry) for one of the item sets listed below. Equipment from Rewards for the Worthy mails will always be at least Blue quality, with a chance at being Purple quality.\n\n- The included item sets are as follows: \n\n    - Affliction\n\n    - Alessian Order\n\n    - Almalexia's Mercy\n\n    - Arch-Mage\n\n    - Bastion of the Heartland\n\n    - Beckoning Steel\n\n    - Blessing of the Potentates\n\n    - Buffer of the Swift\n\n    - Crest of Cyrodiil\n\n    - Curse Eater\n\n    - Deadly Strike\n\n    - Desert Rose\n\n    - Eagle Eye\n\n    - Elf Bane\n\n    - Fasalla's Guile\n\n    - Grace of the Ancients\n\n    - Hawk's Eye\n\n    - Juggernaut\n\n    - Kyne's Kiss\n\n    - Leki's Focus\n\n    - Light of Cyrodiil\n\n    - Marksman's Crest\n\n    - Ravager\n\n    - Robes of Alteration Mastery\n\n    - Sentry\n\n    - Shadow Walker\n\n    - Shield of the Valiant\n\n    - The Morag Tong\n\n    - Vengeance Leech\n\n    - Vicious Death\n\n    - Ward of Cyrodiil\n\n    - Warrior's Fury\n\n    - Wrath of the Imperium\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**New ESO Plus Benefit: Double Bank Capacity**\n\nESO Plus members will now automatically receive twice the banking inventory slots. This includes both the base banking capacity as well as all bank slot upgrades purchased from Bankers or the Crown Store. That means 20 additional slots per upgrade instead of 10!\n\n- If your subscription lapses, your bank capacity will return to the standard limit. If this puts you over the limit, you will still be able to withdraw items, but will not be able to add items until you are no longer above the limit (similar to the way the Craft Bag currently works).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Additional Purchasable Character Slots**\n\nWith the release of Morrowind and the Warden class, we\u2019ve added two more character slots up for sale in the Crown Store. This brings the new maximum character count to 14!\n\n**Inverse Kinematic System (Beta)**\n\nThe Inverse Kinematic (IK) System is a new feature in development that helps connect your character\u2019s feet to the ground.\n\n- This system can be toggled on or off in the Settings menu, but is defaulted to on.\n\n- It is currently enabled only for player characters and their mounts, and disabled in Cyrodiil, Imperial City, Battlegrounds and Group Dungeons and Trials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Miscellaneous UI Updates**\n\nWe\u2019ve added several new features and options, called out below, that will better improve your UI experience.\n\n- You can now enable buff and debuff trackers! These are found in Settings under the Combat section.\n\n    - You can track debuffs on your target from everyone or just from yourself, or track buffs and debuffs on just yourself.\n\n    - You can also toggle the visibility of permanent effects with no defined duration (such as Mundus Stones) and effects lasting longer than a minute (such as food buffs).\n\n    - With the addition of this system, Major and Minor effects have updated with more consistent iconography. Viewing the effect in the character sheet will show the source of the buff.\n\n- Added a new setting to control the visibility of Attribute Bars. In addition to the current behavior, you can always hide them or always show them.\n\n- Added a new settings category, \"Combat\". This category includes combat-related UI elements such as \"Combat Text\" and \u201cResource Numbers\u201d.\n\n- Added a new section to the Collections menu called \"Stories\". This section includes both DLC and Chapters.\n\n    - The introductory quest for Chapters can be started from this menu, similar to how it works for DLC.\n\n- Added a new section to the Activity Finder for Battlegrounds.\n", "edited": 1492462413.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion Point Increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Champion Point cap has been raised by a total of 30 points (10 in each red/blue/green constellation) for a maximum of 630 Champion Points.

Earlier levels now require less experience to obtain, while later levels will require more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total time to level from 1 to 50 should generally remain unchanged, and anyone currently leveling should not see any decrease to their current level progress \u2013 in some cases you may see an increase in level depending on progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all quests now provide more experience to help even the leveling time between those that complete quests versus simply killing monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Writ Merchant Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rolis Hlaalu, the Master Mediator, has expanded his inventory. He now sells plans for two Target Centurions suitable for evaluating the DPS of an entire Trial group, as well as two separate tiers of Furnisher\u2019s Documents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The \u201cTarget Centurion, Dwarf-Brass\u201d is a little tougher than the Veteran Yokeda Kai from Hel Ra Citadel, with nearly 26 million health. In addition to learning the praxis, this requires four Animus Stones as well as 12 Dwarven Construct Repair Parts, which can be found as weekly rewards from the Halls of Fabrication or acquired from other players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The \u201cTarget Centurion, Robust Refabricated\u201d is nearly half as tough as Ozara from Sanctum Ophidia, with over 51 million health. This behemoth requires a total of eight Animus Stones, as well as a whopping 120 Dwarven Construct Repair Parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hlaalu Furnisher\u2019s Document is now known as the Hlaalu Master\u2019s Furnisher Document, and is now sold for 25 Writ Vouchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new item known as the Hlaalu Journeyman Furnisher\u2019s Document is now available in exchange for 10 Writ Vouchers, and contains a random blue furnishing recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Mode Dungeon Trophies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve ever wanted to display the head of a Daedric Titan on a wall in your home, you\u2019re in luck! The Undaunted have started taking trophies home to memorialize their kills, and you are encouraged to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final boss of every dungeon, Trial, and Arena now awards a unique Undaunted Trophy associated with one of the iconic monsters from the encounter. Similar to the Undaunted Busts already available in Veteran Mode, these can be placed once per home, and are account-wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help keep things organized, there are now separate sub-sections of the Furnishings category for Undaunted Trophies and Undaunted Busts. Similarly, the Gallery section of the Housing Editor has separate subsections for each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Hireling Mails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each hireling skill now has roughly 100 more unique messages, telling a brand new set of stories.

Unofficially, Sixth House cultists in the Forgotten Wastes have been identified with fragments of these ancient robes in their possession.

Battlegrounds are fast-paced, small-scale PVP zones designed for three teams of four players each.\u00a0Alliance affiliation doesn\u2019t matter in this new PVP mode, so feel free to play with or against your friends and foes from Cyrodiil! To get into the fight quickly, simply open your Activity Finder, navigate to the Battlegrounds option, and queue. For a bit more information, keep on reading!\n\n- You can queue solo or with a group of 2, 3 or 4 players into a Battleground. Large groups cannot queue for Battlegrounds.\u00a0\n\n- When queued, you\u2019ll be placed into one of three maps:\n\n    - Foyada Quarry: Solid ground and lava pools play a key role in this open field battleground.\n\n    - Ald Carac: An ancient Dwemer site recently excavated which offers close quarter battles and tight spaces.\n\n    - Ularra: This overgrown Daedric site still resonates with ancient portals.\n\n- One of three game modes will be chosen at random when going into a Battleground:\n\n    - Team Deathmatch: Get points for killing other player characters! This game mode also features Sigils of Power that spawn randomly during the match.\n\n    - Capture the Flag: Grab the enemy relic and bring it back to yours, but your relic must be safe at home to capture an enemy\u2019s relic.\n\n    - Domination: Land grab at its purest.\u00a0 There are four capture points to battle over to earn points.\n\n- There are three teams you\u2019ll be assigned to when in a Battleground: Pit Daemons, Storm Lords or Fire Drakes.\u00a0 The colors associated with these teams are Green, Purple and Orange, respectively.\n\n- Battleground matches last a maximum of 15 minutes, but can end early if the maximum score is reached. Game modes currently have a maximum score of 500 points.\n\n- When a Battleground ends, you\u2019ll earn rewards based on whether your team came in first, second or third. Rewards include items, gold, XP and Alliance Points.\n\n- During a Battleground, you\u2019ll earn Medals which are granted based on your actions to progress your team towards victory specific to each game mode.\u00a0For example, in a Team Deathmatch game, you\u2019ll earn Medals for getting killing blows or healing allies.

Stronger, more globally-useful passives such as Mighty, Quick Recovery, and Mooncalf have had their end-point values reduced. Moderately powerful passives such as Thaumaturge, Precise Strikes, and Bastion remain the same. Weaker, more niche passives such as Expert Defender, Sprinter, or Bashing Focus have had their end-point values increased. Below is a list of all Champion abilities and their new 100-point values:\n\n- 15%: Hardy, Elemental Defender, Quick Recovery, Siphoner, Mooncalf, Arcanist, Health, Tenacity, Tumbling, Blessed, Elemental Expert, Mighty\n\n- 25%: Ironclad, Thick Skinned, Bastion, Warlord, Shadow Ward, Elfborn, Shattering Blows, Master-at-Arms, Thaumaturge, Precise Strikes\n\n- 35%: Expert Defender, Sprinter, Bashing Focus, Shade, Physical Weapon Expert, Staff Expert\n\n- 55%: Befoul\n\n- 5280: Spell Shield, Light Armor Focus, Medium Armor Focus, Heavy Armor Focus, Spell Erosion, Piercing\n\n- 1650: Resistant\n\nIn order to lower the gap between players with high and low CP, all Champion passive values are now significantly more frontloaded. This means that earlier points are worth much more, while later points are worth much less. In general, at the halfway mark of 50 points invested, you will obtain roughly 75% of an individual Champion ability\u2019s total bonus (for example, at 50 points invested in Thaumaturge, you will have an 18.75% bonus to your damage over time effects). This new value curve also applies to the Health, Magicka, and Stamina gains by investing in the red, blue, and green constellations.\n\nThis change is designed to discourage allotting all of your Champion Points into any single star, and should encourage more varied and interesting Champion Point spending. You can still choose to invest 100 points into a particular passive, but it comes at a much larger opportunity cost of not investing points elsewhere. This also means players with lower CP will see better initial returns and will not be quite as far behind a player with much higher CP.\n\n- General\n\n    - Updated tooltips for all 10, 30, 70, and 120-point unlock passive abilities to better reflect their functionality.\n\n    - Champion passive abilities now display their bonuses to the hundredth decimal place instead of the tenth.\n\n    - The Health, Magicka, and Stamina percentage increases from investing in the red, blue, and green constellations now cap at 20%, obtained by reaching CP300 (100 in each constellation).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n", "edited": 1492461129.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawn\u2019s Wrath&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This ability and its morphs now last for 3.5 seconds, down from 6 seconds, but can no longer be removed with Break Free.

Stronger, more globally-useful passives such as Mighty, Quick Recovery, and Mooncalf have had their end-point values reduced. Moderately powerful passives such as Thaumaturge, Precise Strikes, and Bastion remain the same. Weaker, more niche passives such as Expert Defender, Sprinter, or Bashing Focus have had their end-point values increased. Below is a list of all Champion abilities and their new 100-point values:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;15%: Hardy, Elemental Defender, Quick Recovery, Siphoner, Mooncalf, Arcanist, Health, Tenacity, Tumbling, Blessed, Elemental Expert, Mighty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;25%: Ironclad, Thick Skinned, Bastion, Warlord, Shadow Ward, Elfborn, Shattering Blows, Master-at-Arms, Thaumaturge, Precise Strikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;35%: Expert Defender, Sprinter, Bashing Focus, Shade, Physical Weapon Expert, Staff Expert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;55%: Befoul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5280: Spell Shield, Light Armor Focus, Medium Armor Focus, Heavy Armor Focus, Spell Erosion, Piercing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1650: Resistant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to lower the gap between players with high and low CP, all Champion passive values are now significantly more frontloaded. This means that earlier points are worth much more, while later points are worth much less. In general, at the halfway mark of 50 points invested, you will obtain roughly 75% of an individual Champion ability\u2019s total bonus (for example, at 50 points invested in Thaumaturge, you will have an 18.75% bonus to your damage over time effects). This new value curve also applies to the Health, Magicka, and Stamina gains by investing in the red, blue, and green constellations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This change is designed to discourage allotting all of your Champion Points into any single star, and should encourage more varied and interesting Champion Point spending. You can still choose to invest 100 points into a particular passive, but it comes at a much larger opportunity cost of not investing points elsewhere. This also means players with lower CP will see better initial returns and will not be quite as far behind a player with much higher CP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;General&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Updated tooltips for all 10, 30, 70, and 120-point unlock passive abilities to better reflect their functionality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Champion passive abilities now display their bonuses to the hundredth decimal place instead of the tenth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Health, Magicka, and Stamina percentage increases from investing in the red, blue, and green constellations now cap at 20%, obtained by reaching CP300 (100 in each constellation).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dge29iv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489518.0, "created_utc": 1492460718.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge28hm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dominoid73", "parent_id": "t3_65y14l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Combat &amp; Gameplay\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***Resource Recovery Changes***\n\nCombat in ESO is, and has always been, about fast-paced action where resource management plays a large part in performing effectively. Player abilities in ESO specifically do not have cooldowns for this very reason - resource management is key and is a core pillar of the system. Due to the number of balance changes we have made over time, this core pillar of resource management has become somewhat trivial; it\u2019s become easier than ever to have nearly infinite sustainability while still being fully maximized for damage.\n\nAs such, some significant changes to resource recovery are being made. In general, each of the changes falls into one of four major categories:\n\n- Restores based on the maximum resource pool - These abilities were simply too effective once you obtained a significant pool size.\n\n- Cost reduction &amp; recovery passives - Several of these passives were over-performing and have been adjusted.\n\n- Group based buffs/synergies - Several of these abilities were near-mandatory in end-game situations and have been adjusted.\n\n- Resource spend/gain rates - Abilities that cost either too much or too little were adjusted to ensure that each class and build type are spending and gaining resources at roughly the same rate.\n\nOur goal with these changes is to have a combat system that reinforces decision making and resource management. Having players make choices between abilities, buffs and gear that provide more damage, or ones that provide more resource sustain, ultimately helps ensure that ESO's combat stays balanced and healthy for years to come.\n\n*General*\n\n- Fixed numerous ability tooltips for grammar, spelling, and formatting. Any significant tooltip revisions will be called out specifically below.\n\n- Synergy prompts will now display the icon of the ability that granted the synergy.\n\n- Fixed an issue where abilities and bonuses that allow you to ignore the Movement Speed penalty from sneak would stack, causing you to sneak at extremely high speeds.\n\n- Reduced the duration of the charge snare to 0.5 seconds from 0.75 seconds, and reduced the effectiveness of the charge snare to a 30% snare from 60%.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- ***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; Reducing the duration and strength of the charge snare ensures that charge abilities still reliably reach their target while making it less punishing for the charge victim, especially if they are being charged by multiple different enemies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Reduced the cooldown for being charged Stamina or Magicka to block an attack to 0.25 seconds from 0.5 seconds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- ***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; Due to how powerful Block is, being able to near-permanently block numerous attacks was posing significant balance issues. In PvP situations, this change will provide more counterplay against targets trying to block all of your attacks \u2013 you can rapidly attack them in order to drain their Stamina faster. In PvE encounters, this will encourage tanks to use Block more tactically for the larger, more deadly hits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Sneak attacks no longer grant a bonus to Critical Damage when used against other players. Sneak attacks will continue to guarantee a Critical Strike and stun the target, and will also still grant a bonus to Critical Damage when used against monsters.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- ***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; Even though Sneak attacks currently have a lower Critical Damage bonus against players than against monsters, they still allow you to burst another player down in a matter of seconds without granting them enough time to react. Removing the Critical Damage bonus against players grants victims of sneak attacks more counterplay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Roll Dodge now grants a 2 second immunity to immobilizations after the roll is complete.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- ***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; Roll Dodge providing a brief immunity to roots should prevent situations where enemies are able to repeatedly cast root abilities to completely prevent you from moving.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Stamina abilities are now universally 15% cheaper than their Magicka counterparts, originally being 20% cheaper. This includes class abilities that morph into Stamina abilities, in addition to the Weapon Skill Line passive abilities which reduce the cost of abilities in that Skill Line (Balanced Blade, Controlled Fury, etc.)\n\n- Experience-boosting consumable items, such as Crown Experience Scrolls, Psijic Ambrosia, Aetherial Ambrosia, and Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia, can now be used while mounted without causing you to dismount.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Buffs and Debuffs*\n\n- Fixed an issue where consuming a potion of Magicka, Stamina, or Health would not correctly refresh the effect duration for the Major Fortitude, Major Endurance, or Major Intellect buffs.\n\n- Minor Magickasteal: Reduced the amount of Magicka this debuff restores to the attacker to 300 Magicka from 400 Magicka.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Dragonknight*\n\n- Ardent Flame\n\n    - Inferno: Reduced the cost of this ability and its morphs by approximately 33%.\n\n    - Lava Whip: Reduced the cost of this ability and its morphs by approximately 10%.\n\n- Earthen Heart\n\n    - Battle Roar: This passive ability now restores an equal amount of Health, Magicka, and Stamina when you use an Ultimate ability, and the amounts are now based on your character level instead of your Max Resource(s).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; This will be a buff for each particular resource if your maximum is below 26,000, and a reduction if it is above. This will generally result in a buff to overall resources restored, but a reduction to the specific resource you are stacking.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- \n\n    - Helping Hands: This passive ability now restores Stamina based on your character level instead of your Max Stamina.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; This will be a buff if your Maximum Stamina is below 19,800 and a reduction if it is above.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- \n\n    - Igneous Shield (Obsidian Shield morph): The Major Mending buff granted by this morph is now tied to your own damage shield. If the damage shield is removed, the Major Mending bonus will also be removed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- ***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; Major Mending is an extremely potent buff category for healing. The ease at which you are able to maintain it creates a system where only extreme damage can kill you because your health bar rapidly swings from near-empty to full. Adjusting the uptime on Igneous Shield\u2019s Major Mending means you will need to think more tactically about when to use your healing abilities while also giving enemies counterplay towards stopping them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- \n\n    - Obsidian Shard (Stonefist morph): Fixed an issue where the friendly heal from this morph could be dodged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Nightblade*\n\n- Shadow\n\n    - Shadow Cloak: Fixed an issue where the invisibility from this ability and its morphs was being broken by numerous abilities including Reflective Light, Silver Shards, and Burning Talon\u2019s damage over time effect.\n\n    - Shadow Image (Summon Shade morph): Fixed an issue where the pet summoned by this morph was not critically striking based on your Spell Critical.\n\n- Siphoning\n\n    - Leeching Strikes (Siphoning Strikes morph): This morph now converts the ability into a Stamina ability and causes your Light and Heavy Attacks to restore Stamina based on your character level.\n\n    - Siphoning Attacks (Siphoning Strikes morph): This morph now causes your Light and Heavy Attacks to also restore Magicka based on your character level.\n\n    - Siphoning Strikes:\n\n        - This ability now causes your Light and Heavy Attacks to restore Health instead of Magicka or Stamina.\n\n        - Increased the duration of this ability and its morphs to 20 seconds from 15 seconds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; This is a significant reduction to the Magicka and Stamina restored by these abilities, but the addition of Health restore should give Nightblades more healing to improve their survivability.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*Sorcerer*\n\n- Dark Magic\n\n    - Dark Exchange: This ability and its morphs now have 0.2 seconds of animation blending time at the end of their cast.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***Developer Comments:***\n\n&gt; All cast time and channeled abilities have 0.2 seconds after their cast is complete where you cannot cast another ability while the animations complete.

The amount restored is now based on your character level instead of your Max Resource.

In general, each of the changes falls into one of four major categories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restores based on the maximum resource pool - These abilities were simply too effective once you obtained a significant pool size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost reduction &amp;amp; recovery passives - Several of these passives were over-performing and have been adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group based buffs/synergies - Several of these abilities were near-mandatory in end-game situations and have been adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resource spend/gain rates - Abilities that cost either too much or too little were adjusted to ensure that each class and build type are spending and gaining resources at roughly the same rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal with these changes is to have a combat system that reinforces decision making and resource management. Having players make choices between abilities, buffs and gear that provide more damage, or ones that provide more resource sustain, ultimately helps ensure that ESO&amp;#39;s combat stays balanced and healthy for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed numerous ability tooltips for grammar, spelling, and formatting. Any significant tooltip revisions will be called out specifically below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy prompts will now display the icon of the ability that granted the synergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where abilities and bonuses that allow you to ignore the Movement Speed penalty from sneak would stack, causing you to sneak at extremely high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced the duration of the charge snare to 0.5 seconds from 0.75 seconds, and reduced the effectiveness of the charge snare to a 30% snare from 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reducing the duration and strength of the charge snare ensures that charge abilities still reliably reach their target while making it less punishing for the charge victim, especially if they are being charged by multiple different enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduced the cooldown for being charged Stamina or Magicka to block an attack to 0.25 seconds from 0.5 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to how powerful Block is, being able to near-permanently block numerous attacks was posing significant balance issues. In PvP situations, this change will provide more counterplay against targets trying to block all of your attacks \u2013 you can rapidly attack them in order to drain their Stamina faster. In PvE encounters, this will encourage tanks to use Block more tactically for the larger, more deadly hits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sneak attacks no longer grant a bonus to Critical Damage when used against other players. Sneak attacks will continue to guarantee a Critical Strike and stun the target, and will also still grant a bonus to Critical Damage when used against monsters.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even though Sneak attacks currently have a lower Critical Damage bonus against players than against monsters, they still allow you to burst another player down in a matter of seconds without granting them enough time to react. Removing the Critical Damage bonus against players grants victims of sneak attacks more counterplay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Roll Dodge now grants a 2 second immunity to immobilizations after the roll is complete.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Roll Dodge providing a brief immunity to roots should prevent situations where enemies are able to repeatedly cast root abilities to completely prevent you from moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamina abilities are now universally 15% cheaper than their Magicka counterparts, originally being 20% cheaper. This includes class abilities that morph into Stamina abilities, in addition to the Weapon Skill Line passive abilities which reduce the cost of abilities in that Skill Line (Balanced Blade, Controlled Fury, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience-boosting consumable items, such as Crown Experience Scrolls, Psijic Ambrosia, Aetherial Ambrosia, and Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia, can now be used while mounted without causing you to dismount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffs and Debuffs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where consuming a potion of Magicka, Stamina, or Health would not correctly refresh the effect duration for the Major Fortitude, Major Endurance, or Major Intellect buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor Magickasteal: Reduced the amount of Magicka this debuff restores to the attacker to 300 Magicka from 400 Magicka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragonknight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ardent Flame&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inferno: Reduced the cost of this ability and its morphs by approximately 33%.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lava Whip: Reduced the cost of this ability and its morphs by approximately 10%.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthen Heart&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Battle Roar: This passive ability now restores an equal amount of Health, Magicka, and Stamina when you use an Ultimate ability, and the amounts are now based on your character level instead of your Max Resource(s).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will be a buff for each particular resource if your maximum is below 26,000, and a reduction if it is above. This will generally result in a buff to overall resources restored, but a reduction to the specific resource you are stacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Helping Hands: This passive ability now restores Stamina based on your character level instead of your Max Stamina.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will be a buff if your Maximum Stamina is below 19,800 and a reduction if it is above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Igneous Shield (Obsidian Shield morph): The Major Mending buff granted by this morph is now tied to your own damage shield. If the damage shield is removed, the Major Mending bonus will also be removed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Major Mending is an extremely potent buff category for healing. The ease at which you are able to maintain it creates a system where only extreme damage can kill you because your health bar rapidly swings from near-empty to full. Adjusting the uptime on Igneous Shield\u2019s Major Mending means you will need to think more tactically about when to use your healing abilities while also giving enemies counterplay towards stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Obsidian Shard (Stonefist morph): Fixed an issue where the friendly heal from this morph could be dodged.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightblade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadow&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shadow Cloak: Fixed an issue where the invisibility from this ability and its morphs was being broken by numerous abilities including Reflective Light, Silver Shards, and Burning Talon\u2019s damage over time effect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shadow Image (Summon Shade morph): Fixed an issue where the pet summoned by this morph was not critically striking based on your Spell Critical.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siphoning&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leeching Strikes (Siphoning Strikes morph): This morph now converts the ability into a Stamina ability and causes your Light and Heavy Attacks to restore Stamina based on your character level.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Siphoning Attacks (Siphoning Strikes morph): This morph now causes your Light and Heavy Attacks to also restore Magicka based on your character level.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siphoning Strikes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This ability now causes your Light and Heavy Attacks to restore Health instead of Magicka or Stamina.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increased the duration of this ability and its morphs to 20 seconds from 15 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a significant reduction to the Magicka and Stamina restored by these abilities, but the addition of Health restore should give Nightblades more healing to improve their survivability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark Magic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dark Exchange: This ability and its morphs now have 0.2 seconds of animation blending time at the end of their cast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All cast time and channeled abilities have 0.2 seconds after their cast is complete where you cannot cast another ability while the animations complete.

The amount restored is now based on your character level instead of your Max Resource. The synergy also has a shared cooldown with the Necrotic Orb synergy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Luminous Shards (Spear Shards morph): This morph now causes the synergy to also restore an equal amount of Magicka or Stamina to the casting Templar, with a 20-second cooldown.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developer Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This reduces the need to have a Templar to constantly feed Stamina to your Stamina DPS and Tank, while making the Spear Shards synergy more useful to Magicka builds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dge28hm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489486.0, "created_utc": 1492460686.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y14l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y14l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y14l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dger6eh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NovaPixel", "parent_id": "t1_dgepf49", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Make that 0.1%", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make that 0.1%&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dger6eh", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492521788.0, "created_utc": 1492492988.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgepf49", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Forest_Chump", "parent_id": "t1_dge5e9q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because the 1% of the game can complete veteran Maw on hard mode it's \"too easy\" for the rest of us, right?!

The entire game is designed around resource management (if you consider veteran-difficulty PvE and competitive PvP to be the &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot; of the game).

I get this patch effects some people more than others, and I can see why a lot of the changes would upset some people, but having a seizure over it isn't going to help. We've had big changes like this before, nerfs, buffs etc, and a majority of players dealt with it, and millions are still enjoying the game today. I'm tired of these \"everything has to be perfect and you must give me everything you promised or I QUIIIIIIT\" player mentalities. ZOS are a bunch humans just like us, they make mistakes, and are attempting to keep millions of players happy (not just the crybabies). I see a ton of potential issues with the patch too but nothing quit worthy. For example I see mega proc set burst damage builds being used more than ever before in PvP, but I also see a much more varied PvP experience, I mean at CP 630 and near Max potential out of only 50 points into a CP passive, you never know what kind of CP build people will be running anymore. The resource management drop will encourage Stam users to use Medium, Magick to use Light, and Tanks to use Heavy, not every one use Heavy or GG like the current meta. Looks like good thinking to me. I'm way more concerned about the PVE hit. A lot of inexperienced players are queing into dungeons nowadays and more difficult tanking and resource management will be an issue for those of us who heal and tank to deal with but in time those players will better learn how to play and manage resources as well. It will just be a rough year. I know myself and the few hundred people in my GMs guild are looking forward to morrowind, and the challenges it comes with. For those you peeing blood over the changes, I'm sorry you didn't get your way?

We&amp;#39;ve had big changes like this before, nerfs, buffs etc, and a majority of players dealt with it, and millions are still enjoying the game today. I&amp;#39;m tired of these &amp;quot;everything has to be perfect and you must give me everything you promised or I QUIIIIIIT&amp;quot; player mentalities. ZOS are a bunch humans just like us, they make mistakes, and are attempting to keep millions of players happy (not just the crybabies). I see a ton of potential issues with the patch too but nothing quit worthy. For example I see mega proc set burst damage builds being used more than ever before in PvP, but I also see a much more varied PvP experience, I mean at CP 630 and near Max potential out of only 50 points into a CP passive, you never know what kind of CP build people will be running anymore. The resource management drop will encourage Stam users to use Medium, Magick to use Light, and Tanks to use Heavy, not every one use Heavy or GG like the current meta. Looks like good thinking to me. I&amp;#39;m way more concerned about the PVE hit. A lot of inexperienced players are queing into dungeons nowadays and more difficult tanking and resource management will be an issue for those of us who heal and tank to deal with but in time those players will better learn how to play and manage resources as well. It will just be a rough year. I know myself and the few hundred people in my GMs guild are looking forward to morrowind, and the challenges it comes with. For those you peeing blood over the changes, I&amp;#39;m sorry you didn&amp;#39;t get your way? I&amp;#39;m expecting a ton of downvotes and frothing mouth responses here but that&amp;#39;s okay lol, 90% of the comments on here are over-the-top, explosively negative. Hardly a single post with any resemblance of reason or will to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dgee5rt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492504306.0, "created_utc": 1492475506.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y14l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgedaxl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheRiverBlues", "parent_id": "t3_65y14l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This skill line unlock change, a similar structure to it didn't work very well in GW2 I highly doubt it would work in this game.

Then the next question is, will impen still be the way to go fro PVP, or is now divine/infused better due to the impact to the resource hit?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dge8ntd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497197.0, "created_utc": 1492468397.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y14l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y14l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgenrvz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IntelligentFlame", "parent_id": "t1_dgea58k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, but look at this shiny new mount for 4,000 crowns!

You get attacked. Your health plummets. You need a heal. You cast your heal and...get zero health. Why? Because your magicka is at 100%. So 0% missing. And 33% of 0% is 0. So you just die.
