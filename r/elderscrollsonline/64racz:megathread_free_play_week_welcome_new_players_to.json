The second best place is [Vulkwasten](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Vulkwasten) in the same zone, because it still has low guard-density but all the lockboxes are pretty close together (oh noez I just gave away my secret). The third best is the upstairs at the [Waxing Crescent](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Waxing_Crescent), because of a high density of containers likely to contain good loot (ie, trunks, wardrobes, nightstands) and, again, low NPC density. The FOURTH best is [Shornhelm](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Shornhelm), for reasons that are kind of hard to explain but mostly \"lots of houses to break into\" and \"convenient Refuge location\" (tbh Shornhelm is better for leveling Legerdemain in general, not for fast money; the fastest money is still Vulkwasten in my experience). \n\nNo, I don't know why there's three places in the Aldmeri Dominion which are Super Great for stealing people's stuff.

Buy the base game now and the morrowind expansion later. Gold edition includes some DLC that you can also buy for crowns in the crown store. Since there is a crown sale, the DLC is also on sale by a similar percentage.\n\n**Q: Should I come back?**\n\nTry it. It's changed a lot. You might like it, you might not. \n\n**Q: Should I play this game?**\n\nSeriously? It's F2P right now. Why are you asking? You know what? No. Since you have to ask instead of signing up for the free account, downloading the free game, and playing it in your free time during the free weekend, No. This game isn't for you. It's mine. You can't have any.\n\n**Q: What's the community like?**\n\nThe community is thriving and healthy. It continues to grow and is not toxic.\n\n**Q: How big of a download is the game?**\n\nExpect a 40gb download when you first install it.\n\n**Q: How do I level? How do I grind XP?**\n\nDon't grind XP on your first character, with the double XP event, you can probably get from 1-50 in 12 hours of playing through storyline quests.\n\n**Q: Something something PVP?**\n\nYou have to be at least level 10 to get into PvP areas and you are free to try it. Get someone to craft you a set of impen gear and sharpened weapons before you enter Blackwater Blade. Also, read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/6318t2/hitchhikers_guide_to_cyrodiil_surviving_your/) before going into PvP.\n\n**Q: Can I get a mount without using crowns?**\n\nMounts can be bought in game for 10,000 gold from the stablemaster. Other than cosmetics, it runs just as fast as a crown store mount.\n\n**Q: What add-on (plugin) should I look into?**\n\nIf you are on PC, at a minimum, look for the Skyshards add-on and lorebooks add-on as collecting those will both help you find points of interest on the map and improve your character. There are crafting add-ons, guild store add-ons, UI redress plugins (I'm running LUI right now), and all sorts of addins. I use minion from ESOUI to manage my add-ons.\n\n**Q: How do I get started?**\n\nAs a new character, run all the quests on the starter island, and once you get to your first city (Davon's Watch, Vukhel Guard, Daggerfall), craft a new set of armor for your character's level at the crafting station (there are guides for that). Medium from rawhide scraps for sword/bow/dual wield/one hand+shield characters, light from jute for mages and healers. Heavy from iron for tanks. (Life will be easier if you level as a mage or sword/bow/dual wielder vs a tank or healer)\n\n**Q: Why do I die so much?**\n\nIf you are dying a lot, improve your armor, look into self heal skills for your class, or adjust your rotation. \n\n**Q: How do I amass vast amounts of virtual currency?**\n\nFarming gold is for suckers. Don't ask because the devs occasionally nerf gold farming areas to prevent gold bots. Though there is a far better reply than this which actually tells you one way of earning gold: [Actual, Informative Answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/64racz/megathread_free_play_week_welcome_new_players_to/dg6pyg8/)\n\n**Q: Is this game playable as a single player RPG experience?**\n\nYes, the quest storylines and voice acting are pretty good and the \"rpg\" element of this game is better than some singleplayer games, but no, it is not \"Skyrim Online\". It is an MMO and MMO considerations to the quest system and world had to be made.\n\n**Q: Do I need the DLC/Gold Edition?**\n\nThe base game has a ton of things to do and tons of hours for a player to enjoy. However, the DLC does have self contained story lines that are well voice-acted and filled with memorable characters. You can also craft and obtain sets unique to the DLC areas, but even if you don't have access, you can still buy and equip the equipment from guild vendors and other players. If you want to experience the DLC, it's a question of money. You can buy individual or a bunch of it all at once with [the Gold edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/656e1u/need_help_deciding_which_copy_of_the_game_to_buy/). An ESO+ unlocks all the DLC, but not Morrowind, because that will be an expansion. I don't know how the upgrade from existing accounts to gold editions works though since I get my DLC fix from my ESO+. \n\n**Q: I just leveled all the way to 50. What should I know about doing Vet Dungeons?**\n\nDon't. There is a significant bump in difficulty and you are dipping your toe into the part of the game that begins punishing players who don't have the best gear, rotations, stats, or tactics. The closest way to approximate the experience of pugging into a vet dungeon when you aren't ready for it would be to try to solo a world boss (Skull and crossed swords icons on the map) while 3 other players yell at you because you're dying too much and any gear you collect will be too low level for them to use. If you want to do vet dungeons (and you can!), do your homework first. Run through all the dungeons on normal, learn the boss mechanics and what it takes to survive. Then, evaluate your build. Optimize it for end-game, get your gear up to purple, and try to do at least 15k damage as a DPS. Once you have all that, then you can do vet level dungeons. Also, most people aren't really good in vet dungeons until they hit cp300.\n\n**Q: What class and Race should I play?**\n\nPlayers have this fear of making a choice that will \"gimp\" them later on. The good news is that in the grand scheme of things, the choices you make on a single character don't matter. You're not a min/maxer and min/maxing doesn't matter until you have put in hundreds of hours. After those hundreds of hours, you will be in a far better position to make the \"right\" choice and will probably have learned more from squeezing every last drop of game-play out of a sub-optimal character than if you blindly followed someone's recommendation. Play what you think looks cool and/or fun. Don't worry about how the NB doesn't get invited to play any end-game reindeer games, you're quite a ways away from getting invited yourself. The racial passives are only good for a few percentage points and whether you pick magicka or stamina or tank or healer will have a bigger impact on how you play than dk, sorc, templar, or nb. Sure, NB is better at stealth ganking in PvP, Sorcs are better at raw damage, DK is better at tanking, and templar is better at healing, any class can do any role. I personally play an NB tank for dungeons. By the time you are ready for end-game content and NEED the optimal race/class combo, you can roll a new character and level it in a day or two. Characters are cheap, you have 8 slots, use them all.\n\n**Q: What should I buy with crowns?** \n\nThere are four main categories of crown store items. The first is the crown crate which is a gamble and a lot of people feel gambling crates prey on people and is a scummy business practice in any game. In-Game (Shortcut) items are things like werewolf bites, riding lessons, potions, and stuff that you can get in game, but require effort. Skip these unless you are a high powered executive who needs everything done right now. The next are account upgrades like access to DLC, extra character slots, and the imperial and adventurer pack which influence how you create characters. The adventurer pack was worthwhile back before one tamriel, but now only affects PvP alliance. The imperial pack unlocks the imperial race which is a thing, it's good for some roles and not for others. The cosmetics are stuff like hair styles, costumes, mounts, houses, and all that stuff. They don't make your character better, but they do make you prettier. I would say that you should buy stuff that makes you happy, but skip the shortcut items because half the fun is the journey it takes to get them.", "edited": 1492105404.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answers to some common questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I want to buy, should I buy Morrowind or Tamriel Unlimited/Gold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you buy the Morrowind edition that comes bundled with the base game, you will not be able to play the base game until Morrowind releases in June.

If you want to experience the DLC, it&amp;#39;s a question of money. You can buy individual or a bunch of it all at once with &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/656e1u/need_help_deciding_which_copy_of_the_game_to_buy/\"&gt;the Gold edition&lt;/a&gt;. An ESO+ unlocks all the DLC, but not Morrowind, because that will be an expansion. I don&amp;#39;t know how the upgrade from existing accounts to gold editions works though since I get my DLC fix from my ESO+. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I just leveled all the way to 50. What should I know about doing Vet Dungeons?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t. There is a significant bump in difficulty and you are dipping your toe into the part of the game that begins punishing players who don&amp;#39;t have the best gear, rotations, stats, or tactics. The closest way to approximate the experience of pugging into a vet dungeon when you aren&amp;#39;t ready for it would be to try to solo a world boss (Skull and crossed swords icons on the map) while 3 other players yell at you because you&amp;#39;re dying too much and any gear you collect will be too low level for them to use. If you want to do vet dungeons (and you can!), do your homework first. Run through all the dungeons on normal, learn the boss mechanics and what it takes to survive. Then, evaluate your build. Optimize it for end-game, get your gear up to purple, and try to do at least 15k damage as a DPS. Once you have all that, then you can do vet level dungeons. Also, most people aren&amp;#39;t really good in vet dungeons until they hit cp300.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What class and Race should I play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Players have this fear of making a choice that will &amp;quot;gimp&amp;quot; them later on. The good news is that in the grand scheme of things, the choices you make on a single character don&amp;#39;t matter. You&amp;#39;re not a min/maxer and min/maxing doesn&amp;#39;t matter until you have put in hundreds of hours. After those hundreds of hours, you will be in a far better position to make the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; choice and will probably have learned more from squeezing every last drop of game-play out of a sub-optimal character than if you blindly followed someone&amp;#39;s recommendation. Play what you think looks cool and/or fun. Don&amp;#39;t worry about how the NB doesn&amp;#39;t get invited to play any end-game reindeer games, you&amp;#39;re quite a ways away from getting invited yourself. The racial passives are only good for a few percentage points and whether you pick magicka or stamina or tank or healer will have a bigger impact on how you play than dk, sorc, templar, or nb. Sure, NB is better at stealth ganking in PvP, Sorcs are better at raw damage, DK is better at tanking, and templar is better at healing, any class can do any role. I personally play an NB tank for dungeons. By the time you are ready for end-game content and NEED the optimal race/class combo, you can roll a new character and level it in a day or two. Characters are cheap, you have 8 slots, use them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What should I buy with crowns?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are four main categories of crown store items. The first is the crown crate which is a gamble and a lot of people feel gambling crates prey on people and is a scummy business practice in any game. In-Game (Shortcut) items are things like werewolf bites, riding lessons, potions, and stuff that you can get in game, but require effort. Skip these unless you are a high powered executive who needs everything done right now. The next are account upgrades like access to DLC, extra character slots, and the imperial and adventurer pack which influence how you create characters. The adventurer pack was worthwhile back before one tamriel, but now only affects PvP alliance. The imperial pack unlocks the imperial race which is a thing, it&amp;#39;s good for some roles and not for others. The cosmetics are stuff like hair styles, costumes, mounts, houses, and all that stuff. They don&amp;#39;t make your character better, but they do make you prettier. I would say that you should buy stuff that makes you happy, but skip the shortcut items because half the fun is the journey it takes to get them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dg4dtus", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491952229.0, "created_utc": 1491923429.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64racz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ovv0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChaosOfAestheticism", "parent_id": "t3_64racz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Boy do I just love this community. \nSeeing everyone being so generous and helpful to everyone else is what keeps me coming back to this game, you don't see it that often in other games!

And you can do just fine in everything but the top-level speedrun Trials. My own character wears Julianos + Toryug&amp;#39;s Pact with regular Willpower jewelry for Vet dungeons. To be THE VERY BEST LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS, you will eventually need to grind out dungeon gear... but that&amp;#39;s done just by running the dungeon a lot, not some damned fool &amp;quot;YOU MUST GET TWO BILLION HARDENED LEATHER SQUARES&amp;quot; business. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dg6qvd4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068034.0, "created_utc": 1492039234.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64racz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64racz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5rkc3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "leet_name", "parent_id": "t1_dg5r5v9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the reply!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the reply!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dg5rkc3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492027171.0, "created_utc": 1491998371.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5r5v9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dominoid73", "parent_id": "t1_dg5h1s6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's only one jumping puzzle in a quest that I remember.
