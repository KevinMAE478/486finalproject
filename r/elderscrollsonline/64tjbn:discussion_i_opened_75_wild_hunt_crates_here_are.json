I also got the hircine banner too but traded that back for a nice bit of crown gems. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I ended up with a mount and enough gems to get one the next time they update the crates. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dg52o80", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491980267.0, "created_utc": 1491951467.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tjbn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tjbn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tjbn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tjbn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7vfgh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gitmuny", "parent_id": "t1_dg5rr36", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "because gamblers won't keep gambling if they are guaranteed the prize eventually.
