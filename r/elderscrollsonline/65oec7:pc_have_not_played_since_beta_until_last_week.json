You can buy and sell on the BLTC screen to any other players, or at least more than a single guild like ESO. This creates a wider, larger market with more items to buy and sell. \n\nThe biggest flaw for me is the market in ESO. I absolutely hate that i have to find and interact with a bank NPC every time i fill up my tiny inventory space with items, then have no idea of how much the market value of iron ingots, motif or piece of gear is; so i have to alt tab to google it, then alt tab back in before i get kicked for AFK, list it to only one of my guilds rather than everyone looking on the marketplace like BLTC, then get back to the grind. It's extremely bad, irritating and angering to interupt everything you're doing to leave the group and get to a shitty banker NPC to sell some shit so you can grind more. \n\n\nThe npc interaction is god awful, switching from the guild store -&gt; bank you have to hit esc, reinteract with the NPC, select bank. Rather than a tab on the top to click between, or not having to reinteract just to select a different menu to look at. But that's still having to go out of your way just to sell to an extremely small market.\n\n\nThis is my only complaint with the game but to me, it's a massive deal. I liked just grinding champs in GW2, and collecting gold from selling gear. It was relaxing and satisfying. ESO feels like it makes it as hard as possible to do that. \n\nIt's an MMO, they need to fix the market and expand it for streamline buying and selling.  \n\n\ne: downvote me, i don't care, but provide an argument to at least follow some amount of reddiquette.

This creates a wider, larger market with more items to buy and sell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest flaw for me is the market in ESO. I absolutely hate that i have to find and interact with a bank NPC every time i fill up my tiny inventory space with items, then have no idea of how much the market value of iron ingots, motif or piece of gear is; so i have to alt tab to google it, then alt tab back in before i get kicked for AFK, list it to only one of my guilds rather than everyone looking on the marketplace like BLTC, then get back to the grind. It&amp;#39;s extremely bad, irritating and angering to interupt everything you&amp;#39;re doing to leave the group and get to a shitty banker NPC to sell some shit so you can grind more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The npc interaction is god awful, switching from the guild store -&amp;gt; bank you have to hit esc, reinteract with the NPC, select bank. Rather than a tab on the top to click between, or not having to reinteract just to select a different menu to look at. But that&amp;#39;s still having to go out of your way just to sell to an extremely small market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my only complaint with the game but to me, it&amp;#39;s a massive deal. I liked just grinding champs in GW2, and collecting gold from selling gear. It was relaxing and satisfying. ESO feels like it makes it as hard as possible to do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an MMO, they need to fix the market and expand it for streamline buying and selling.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;e: downvote me, i don&amp;#39;t care, but provide an argument to at least follow some amount of reddiquette. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dgcdxgs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492396662.0, "created_utc": 1492367862.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oec7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oec7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oec7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc6p1j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kedz54", "parent_id": "t1_dgc675b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Arguably WOW.

I actually left for a full year as a result of it, and a friend of mine can't even try it again because of how burned he was.\n\nSo what's changed?\n\nWell, firstly, the game launched with some pretty severe bugs. It was normal to come across a quest NPC that couldn't be spoken to or interacted with; especially tedious in the first few weeks since those quests were required to move from one zone to the next, and staying in the same zone for too long made it difficult to gain the XP to level.\nWhat's Changed: A few things. While bugs will always exist, I haven't personally come across a broken NPC in weeks so the number is FAR fewer. Also, with the way One Tamriel works, zones no longer have levels so you can just keep going until YOU'RE ready to leave, not when the mobs are too low level to give XP - even better, is the map isn't content locked so you can just go roaming!\n\nThere was also an issue with the instancing tech used; basically you and a party member could be in different instances of the same zone, with no way to switch between them. In fact, you could start in the same instance, but due to quests/locations/etc you could be separated and completely unable to interact.\nWhat's Changed: I wasn't there for a lot of the fixes and changes, but the instancing has certainly been updated to function better, which makes grouping MUCH smoother.\n\nThen there were the abomination known as Vet levels (Note: This is subjective, but I HATED the vet levels). Essentially, once you reached 50 and beat the main story line, you got the \"opportunity\" to do it again for the other factions. At a snale's pace. The rewards were minor for leveling the vet ranks, but required to access certain parts of the content.\nWhat's Changed: Champion Points. These are earned MUCH faster than Vet ranks, and every so often the game updates to help newer players catchup. They also come in smaller pieces, making earning them feel like less of a grind. Plus you get \"enlightenment\" each day, which is a set amount of xp bonus towards champ points that allows you to earn them even faster. On top of that, the points provide small bonuses to the character that provide more customization. My favorite part? Earning champion points is account-wide, so if you love having alts or want to try something new you're not penalized.\n\nDungeons are something else that had a pretty big change. Originally, you would gain access to a set of 3 dungeons every 5-15 levels. Once you reach veteran ranks, you could play a second chapter for some of those dungeons known as \"Veteran Mode\". Leveling in dungeons was thus impossible, since you could literally only do a dungeon for a few levels, and it'd stop giving XP long before the next set unlocked. There was also no real reason to visit a defeated dungeon.\nWhat's Changed: Well, all of the original \"veteran dungeons\" are now considered a \"second Chapter\"; ie Fungal Grotto and Fungal Grotto II, and now all of them have a \"Veteran Mode\" which just increases the difficulty and rewards. There's no levels on the dungeons, so they ALWAYS provide good XP. Also, there's a \"random dungeon\" button on the group finder that provides bonus XP for completing a dungeon once a day. It is now COMPLETELY possible to level from 10-50 (can't do them until 10) doing only dungeons. Side note that it's still not advised since you'll be missing Skills points needed to be effective, but if you combine skyshard hunting with Dungeons, it's certainly an option.\n\nThe game's balance is also radically different. Originally, Stamina was a dead stat. All class abilities were Magicka based (including morphs) and things like Heavy Attacks (they used to COST stamina), dodging, blocking, and CC-Break all cost a percentage of you stamina bar. So, a pure magicka Nightblade could sprint just as far as a full stamina one, but could still use staff weapon skills when they arrived, whereas the character focused on stamina would be unable to use Two-handed attacks until they recharged. (Note: Regen rates made an impact, but not enough of one to consider the two on parity).\nWhat's Changed: Firstly, no game will ever be fully balanced. Not even chess has perfect parity between the two sides. But Zeni has done a GREAT job on pushing the game forward. Firstly, every class has stamina options now. Some skills can morph into skills that cost stamina. The \"default stamina\" stuff (sneaking, sprinting, etc) all have a flat cost now, so a bigger bar means using them more. Heavy attacks now restore resources (stamina for melee/bows, magicka for staves), which was originally unique to the resto staff. They created a set of major/minor buffs and reworked skills to make comparing values and abilities easier. Set bonuses, Drops, and itemization have all been altered to make them more fluid.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to point out as having changed is content. I don't just mean more maps; Elder Scrolls has certain things that people look forward to in the games, like the DarkBrotherhood/Morag Tong, Thieves Guild, etc. None of that was present on launch. NPCs in cities couldn't be killed, you couldn't steal, the items around enemy camps were just for decoration, etc. Heck, the center of the Cyrodiil map was just a walled off area with no access.\nWhat's Change: Over time, much of this has been fixed. The crime system is a part of the base game, but Thieve's Guild and DB are in DLC (included with ESO+) as is the Imperial City. You can take the weapons and armor on the ground from enemy camps (though they aren't worth much!). It feels FAR more like an Elder Scrolls game as a result; especially since you can jump to different areas and just explore without being quest-locked!\n\nThere's a ton not listed here. Things like the Collections Tab, riding skills, Cyrodiil Campaigns, the full scope of One Tamriel. I just wanted to give a glimpse into how radically different of a game it is now.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this to someone &amp;#39;recently&amp;#39;; it&amp;#39;s far from comprehensive but should give an idea of just how much has changed:\n&amp;quot;ESO&amp;#39;s launch was a disaster, &amp;#39;tis true.
