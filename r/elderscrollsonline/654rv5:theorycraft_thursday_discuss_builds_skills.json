Haven't had much chance to test it but here it is:\n\n5 medium armor, 1 heavy, and 1 light armor to take advantage of undaunted passives. The monster set you use with this is flexible, Blood Spawn, Selene's, and Velidreth are all good options, you'll just want 1 heavy and 1 light if you are undaunted rank 9.  I ended up trying 2 Mighty Chudan to be more tanky, 1 in impenetrable and the other in divines (since that was my only decent headgear trait). \n\nThe other armor sets are Bone Pirate's Tatters and Salvation. Both sets give you stamina and stamina regen and have good 5 piece bonuses that work for the build. Bone Pirate drops from dungeon bosses in Blackheart Haven and for its 5 piece bonus gives 2k stamina and 300 stamina regen when you have a drink buff active. Thanks to the jester festival we now have the best drink for this build: Dubious Camoran Throne which adds health, stamina, and stamina regen.  The Salvation set drops in Malabal Tor which makes it a lot easier to farm. I recommend finding as many Bone Pirate pieces as you can and then building your Salvation pieces around it. I actually found it really easy to get Salvation through guild traders, even sharpened weapons were found for just 1000 gold (this is because so many people are already farming Malabal Tor for Spinners). The 5 piece bonus is 33% cost reduction of your werewolf ultimate and an extra 150 weapon damage when in werewolf form. The cost reduction changes the ultimate cost from 400 all the way down to 268 which is a huge improvement. \n\nNow I'm running it as 2h and dual wield. I recommend using Salvation weapons for a couple reasons. First they are way easier to get in good traits since Bone Pirate weapons only have a chance to drop from the final dungeon boss. Second, we don't need to have the 5th piece bonus for Salvation on both bars. This means on my 2h bar I have 5 Bone Pirate and 4 Salvation but switching to dual wield we get that 5th piece bonus for Salvation and slot werewolf as our ultimate there. We could use sword and board instead of dual wield but with dual wield we will have more damage while in werewolf form so I recommend that.\n\nYou have a lot of flexibility with skills. I use the 2h bar for my damage and dw for buffs. I'm still not entirely satisfied with the skills I've selected so this is a work in progress. Currently I run:\n\n2H:  Crit Rush, Dizzying swing, reverse slice, Rally, Fossilize, and Take flight.  (DBoS is another option for ult)\n\nDW:  Rapids, Shuffle, Vigor, 2 flex slots, and Werewolf ultimate. Make sure to hit shuffle and any other long buffs before transforming. \n\nIn Azura's with major brutality I had 22k health, 33k stamina, 2200 stamina regen, and 2600 weapon damage.
