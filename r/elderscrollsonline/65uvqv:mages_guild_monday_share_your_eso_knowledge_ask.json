We almost always get the bug where we get teleported out of the dungeon as soon as we get summoned in and we aren&amp;#39;t familiar enough with the game to be able to just run to each instance quickly.  Is this something that will likely be fixed soon?  It is the one major negative thing I have to say about the game so far, it seems like this issue is something that would be fixed right and I&amp;#39;m wondering what else might need fixing it and if this is a major issue with the game (things being really buggy and not getting fixed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When using the dungeon finder I sometimes get put into a &amp;quot;II&amp;quot; version of the dungeon which is much harder (especially on me as I&amp;#39;m a healer and my friend is a tank we are still learning the game).  Is there any way around getting put into these?  Sometimes they are manageable if the normal version of the dungeon isn&amp;#39;t that difficult to begin with, but some of the dungeons are somewhat difficult on normal and the &amp;quot;II&amp;quot; version is basically impossible right now.  These sometimes impossible dungeons for us coupled with the dungeon finder bugs has made doing dungeons pretty hit or miss for us even though it&amp;#39;s basically the aspect of the game we have the most fun with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dgdkq2l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469665.0, "created_utc": 1492440865.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uvqv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uvqv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdecw5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PacmanAlt", "parent_id": "t1_dgdd879", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "NPCs have metas too", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPCs have metas too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "name": "t1_dgdecw5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492459455.0, "created_utc": 1492430655.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tqi0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uvqv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdee70", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Connortsunami", "parent_id": "t1_dgdd879", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elderscrollsonline", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dragonknights are bundles of crowd control.

There is normally some mechanic to watch out for, such as OHKO moves or some other special mechanic.

Each boss fight has some mechanic that makes them difficult. For instance, the first boss in White Gold Tower will lock a random person in a cage that they (or someone else) needs to lockpick out of (it's an intermediate lock) while that caged person is getting hit by a fire DoT. Or the final boss in Cradle of Shadows has a move where you need to stop moving and dodge roll at the right moment to avoid a OHKO.

Like the Lightning Storm Atro in Aetherian Archive; you gotta move to the light to avoid the lightning storm. Or Starfall from the Warrior in Hel Ra; you gotta lose stack or else you get wiped.
