Remember when you take the steak off of the hot pan, and onto a plate to rest, the internal temp will continue to rise. So, regardless of which order you choose, cook to about 115-120. As it rests, it will come up to about 120-125. If you cook until it reaches 125, even off the stove, your steak will continue to cook beyond medium rare while it is resting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskCulinary", "name": "t1_dgeekaw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492504806.0, "created_utc": 1492476006.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ytbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgem0l0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kracivaya", "parent_id": "t3_65ytbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskCulinary", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thermapens are instant read, and the sensor is at the tip of the probe, so it's easy to use.
