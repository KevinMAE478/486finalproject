At this point, I can consistently hit a quality that beats out all but the best restaurants, so I like to think I know what I am talking about when it comes to pasta.\n\nDon't leave the noodles in the water.  Take them out and strain the water away.  You then want to put them back in the pot with a lid on it and leave it off the heat.  The noodles should stay mostly moist and warm thanks to the lid keeping the steam in without them getting too soft.  It is the noodles starting to dry out that is causing your noodle monster issue.  If you leave it sit there for hours, you might have a problem, but in the time it would take to serve 10 people it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI would not rinse the noodles at all, as this removes the excess starch from them.  This starch helps the sauce thicken up and stick to the noodles.\n\nYou then want to let each portion heat up in a saucepan with whatever sauce and additional ingredients they are adding. This helps the sauce stick better and also heats the noodles back up if they are a bit too cool.  A minute or two of the noodles being tossed with the sauce on heat should be sufficient.\n\nSeveral people are advising adding oil to the noodles to keep them from drying, but I would say not to do this.  Depending on what sauce you are using, this can make it very difficult to get the sauce to stick.  A sauce with a decent oil content you can get to stick, but for other sauces it will form a barrier between the oil and the sauce which will make it very difficult to stick.  If you had one sauce you were using, you could make sure it works but in a setting where people are adding different sauces this is difficult.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never worked in a restaurant, but I have been cooking pasta for myself and sometimes groups of friends/family several times a week for the last 15 years.

Take them out and strain the water away.  You then want to put them back in the pot with a lid on it and leave it off the heat.  The noodles should stay mostly moist and warm thanks to the lid keeping the steam in without them getting too soft.  It is the noodles starting to dry out that is causing your noodle monster issue.  If you leave it sit there for hours, you might have a problem, but in the time it would take to serve 10 people it shouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would not rinse the noodles at all, as this removes the excess starch from them.  This starch helps the sauce thicken up and stick to the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You then want to let each portion heat up in a saucepan with whatever sauce and additional ingredients they are adding.
