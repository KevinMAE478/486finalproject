I still can&amp;#39;t figure it out, but after a lot of experimenting I&amp;#39;ve discovered that adding just a dash of sesame oil to the rice while it&amp;#39;s cooking does something that seems to get it closer. Do you add salt btw? That&amp;#39;s definitely a must. For a cup of rice start with 1/2 a tsp and see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking like 1.5tsp of oil to a cup of rice (and 1.5c water, I saw you mentioned you lived at a high altitude so do your own thing with the rice/water ratio, I can spit in the atlantic from my kitchen window so definitely different).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The washing advice is spot on. Wash your rice really well (I usually put it in the pot I&amp;#39;m gonna cook it in, fill the pot with water, swish it around a ton, pour out the water, and repeat until the water comes out clear).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the oil helps keep the de-starched and separated grains a bit more...together during the post-cook fluffing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just my experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskCulinary", "name": "t1_dg8rpok", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173638.0, "created_utc": 1492144838.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659ma5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659ma5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659ma5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659ma5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg90oni", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ledanator", "parent_id": "t1_dg900xv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskCulinary", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm Chinese and this is what I was taught too.

Boil the cup of water, and make sure it comes to a soft rolling boil. Add the rice in, and let the water come back to a soft rolling boil and turn the stove way down to a low heat. It takes about 20-30 mins, while periodically checking it every 10 mins. Make sure to have a lid on the whole time. Once it gets to the consistency I like, I take it off the heat, and fluff it with a fork and put the lid on for another 5/10 mins. If it&amp;#39;s too hard, add just a bit more water and stir. If you add a lot of water, the rice will be clumping. Experiment a bit, and after a few tries you&amp;#39;ll know how much water to add from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chinese places around here use a rice cooker. Eating rice my whole life, I guess we always use 1:1 ratio. Always fluff the rice once it&amp;#39;s cook, even in the rice cooker. We had a defective rice cooker where it would heat too fast so the rice would be clumpy. We use used less water and it turned out fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskCulinary", "name": "t1_dg8tkn6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492177215.0, "created_utc": 1492148415.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659ma5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg90mkc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gingorthedestroyer", "parent_id": "t3_659ma5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskCulinary", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a chef I prefer cooking rice like pasta.
