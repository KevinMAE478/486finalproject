Braises and roasts are not exact. The biggest thing to worry about is over or under-seasoning. I usually get whatever sounds good. For lamb, I like: pickled carrot, pickled garlic, onion (pickled too if you have it) cook all these hard veggies off in a pan (diced), season with salt, pepper, red pepper flake, and allspice. Deglaze with red wine (I like malbec) add chicken (or other) stock and finally pour over your lamb until it's about an inch covered. Add a sprig or two of rosemary and maybe thyme.
