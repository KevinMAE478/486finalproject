Drop in some refined peanut oil or other high temp oil, just enough to prevent sticking. Gently place the steak in the hot pan, lightly pressing it down. Let the steak sear for 1-2 minutes (again I'm assuming this thing is a 2\" thick tenderloin). Then sear each \"edge\" for less than a minute each (depending on cut there will be 3-4 somewhat defined edges). Finally, sear the remaining face of the steak for 1 minute, then dump in a tablespoon of butter. The butter will foam quickly. Use a spoon to baste the steak with the butter for about 30 seconds.

This is fine... everything is fine. :) Let the alcohol burn off. You'll be left with a small amount of liquid and perfect shallots.
