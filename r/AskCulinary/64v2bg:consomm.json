Allowing any amount of fat to emulsify into the stock will make it basically impossible to make consomme by any method.  \n\n-Your original stock needs to contain enough gelatin that it definitely makes a jelly, but not so much that the jelly is firm.  The biggest disadvantage to this method of consomme-making is that the yield is lower than the traditional egg-white method.  The more gelatin you use, the smaller your yield.  The advantage is that more of the flavor components remain in the final product and, correctly done, it is more intense.  If your stock doesn't gel well, you need to add gelatin.  (FYI, you can create a vegetarian version of these types of consommes by using agar-agar, but the technique is a little different.)\n\n-It is important that you realize that \"consomme\" is a binary thing - it either is consomme, and it is absolutely clear, or it is not consomme.

If it looks like the stuff in the picture of the \"finished product\" on that link, which is cloudy and has stuff floating in it, it isn't consomme. \n\n-Consomme is \"easy\" to make, in the sense that all the steps are fairly simple, but it is very detail-oriented, and fucking up anywhere along the way is going to make it impossible to get the result you're looking for.  I know this because I have wasted a lot of time trying to rescue cloudy stocks or messed up the clarification process, and have had to change courses at the last minute because the consomme didn't turn out properly.
