Cooks has no doubt got better physical skills than either Welker or Edelman, however playing WR is about more than that. The technical aspects of the game are really important too. How important depends on the QB. A lot of QBs, even very good ones (for example Rodgers), will wait for someone to get open, and then throw the ball. Brady is not liek that tho, Brady throws the ball before the WR gets open, based on the coverage the WR is in, and his knowledge of the WRs route. That means that any imperfection in the route running will essentially mean an incompletion. So for a QB like Brady technical perfection as a route runner is more important than physical traits. The complexity of NEs system exacerbates that effect even more.  \n\nWhat speed and quickness do for you is they help you get open earlier, so a QB that wait for you to get open can get the ball out faster, it helps you get open when you are covered, Which, again is really important if you have a QB that waits for a WR to get open. And lastly it helps you stay open, especially downfield. All of those things are extremely important if you have a QB like Newton or Rodgers, however if you have a QB like Brady or Manning (Peyton, not Eli), Physical traits become less valuable and technical perfection becomes more valuable. \n\nI know what you're thinking: If Cooks skillset doesn't fit that well with NE, why would they trade a first rounder for him? The answer is that he brings something to the table that they don't have, someone that can stretch the field. All of NEs weapons (Edelman, Gronk, Lewis, White and Blount in the Running game) work best in the middle of the field. That means safeties can play close to the box and make it hard for you. Last year they countered that by sending Gronk and Bennett down the field a lot. With Bennett gone they needed someone that can prevent the defense from clogging up the middle. No offense to Hogan he had a great playoffs, but I don't think defensive coordinators are going to pull a safety out of teh box in fear of Hogan beating them. With Cooks that is a different story. I think Cooks will be used mainly on deep routes in a sort of DeSean Jackson type of role. If a defense decides to leave him one on one the entire game, Brady will throw to him a bunch and he will end up with 180 yards and 2 TDs. However, nore liekly than not, defenses will keep a safety deep and to Cooks' side to prevent that from happening. They would rather give up the 9 yard gain to Edelman than the 35 yard bomb to Cooks. I think Cooks is going to make NE as a whole much scarier and harder to gameplan against, but I think he will be a chess piece in what might be one of the best offenses of all time, and he won't be force fed the ball. My prediction is that he has a DeSean Jackson type of season where there will be a couple of games where the defense decides to leave Cooks 1 on 1 and he will go off, but I think there will also be plenty of games where he is essentially a decoy that opens up the middle of the field for Gronk and co. \n\nAlright this turned into an essay length post I hope it's worth the read.

If a WR runs his route to fast or too slow, or at a slightly wrong angle, he doesn&amp;#39;t just mess up his route, but he also messes up the other WRs routes. Hill doesn&amp;#39;t run precise routes, so his role in the offense will be routes that are isolated, making him a very limited/flawed piece for that offense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: write long detailed response with arguments, get downvoted by Tyreek Hill circlejerkers.
