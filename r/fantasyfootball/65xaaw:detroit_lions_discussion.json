However, I don't think he'll finish where he did last year (7th in ESPN Standard.)  Right now I've seen him drafted between the 8th-10th rounds which I think is downright criminal, that's where Manning/Rivers were drafted last year and I think he's got way higher upside than those two again.  With that new O-line I think things are looking up for him, but right now the scheme is still conservative and that hurts his stock fantasy wise.  If there still are doubters, he's crazy good value in the 9th round, but I'd be fine taking him mid 7th or 8th, even as your only QB.  I think he finishes 9th PRK.\n\n&gt;  Will Tate still be safe in ppr in the way he finished the season? Will Marvin Jones have the Megatron role he had at the beginning of the season? \n\nI don't play PPR so I'm gonna pass on the first one.  As for the second question - no.  That was a huge outlier.  Although, I don't think he'll be as bad as he was in the second half of the season (the part where Lions actually played good defenses.)  Marvin Jones has a really low ADP of 130ish right now, but he's got the most upside out of any receiver past the 9th round, and its his second year with Stafford in the Lions offense as a downfield threat (something the Lions have sorely missed since relying on Calvin \"decoy\" Johnson.)  He'll be a great Flex in most formats imo, should easily finish top 36 if he stays healthy.\n\n&gt; Do we like the running backs? Will Abdullah have his early down role back, and will riddick still be a must start in ppr?\n\nZenner and Washington should not be owned in any formats, even if one of Abdullah or Riddick go down.  I couldn't believe the hype trains everyone had for them last year, and although Zenner showed promise, I don't expect that at all if everyone is going to take Detroit as a playoff threat seriously.  Abdullah and Gordon were valued similarly their rookie seasons, but Gordon's season before the injury last year shows great promise for Abdullah's upside, and I do think that Abdullah can be just as good, especially in this offense.  I think his current value as a 6th/7th rounder is justified in Standard, but if you're looking for a flier I would definitely hop on the bandwagon; you just have to pray every night that he stays on the field.  Can't talk about Riddick in PPR but the fact that he's played in standard still and is as productive as Forte has to mean something.  Compare Reddick to Woodhead a couple years back and you'll see how much value you can get out of him.\n\n&gt;  Is Ebron a low end te1?\n\nYes.  He gets too much flack for being such a high pick, but he has been serviceable, even with the annoying drops.  You really can't be too picky about which TE you want if you're not gonna take Gronk/Kelce/Reed/Olsen/Eifert, (some of which are still injury prone) so unless you want to waste a pick in the middle rounds on a TE who might produce, you might as well wait until late and scoop up Ebron.  If healthy, he could get around 1000 yards this season, and it looks like he's gonna take up more roles in this offense.  It could be like Fauria all over again but with more yards.  Even if he finishes top 12 I wouldn't be too upset given his current ADP - I'm sure there's gonna be some TE on the waivers anyways who finishes top 7.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will Stafford remain a QB1 this year?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If by QB1, you mean top 12 QBs, then yes.
