There are a few articles about people making composting drums out of 55 gallon barrels. &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherearthnews.com/diy/compost-tumblers-zmaz79mazraw\"&gt;Here is an article with a few designs from 1979&lt;/a&gt;. One (Cloverleaf tumbler) is actually similar to your but avoids the issues with the voided areas. These would make it seem like you don&amp;#39;t quite need as much volume as I&amp;#39;m used to, as they are obviously much smaller than 64 cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ArtisanVideos", "name": "t1_dgayvmf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492309038.0, "created_utc": 1492280238.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaxuej", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "samsc2", "parent_id": "t1_dgaxilx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ArtisanVideos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's no gaps in the drums?
