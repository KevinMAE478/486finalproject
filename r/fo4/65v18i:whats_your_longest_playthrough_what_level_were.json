There are experimental weapons from the old world scattered throughout the Fallout series; the bat is not a weapon, but an artifact of peace and sportsmanship.  It&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;d prize in real life (unlike the MIRV which I&amp;#39;d want to stay far away from).  It immediately cues you to wonder about the fate of the 2077 World Series, which was probably just about to be played before the world ended.  And when the player character gives it new bloody purpose, driving nails through it, wrapping it in chains, laughing like an idiot savant when it sends raiders flying off roofs... it&amp;#39;s just the perfect distillation of the world gone mad.

I played double-agent with the railroad and institute until about level 70? I actually tried both rr and institute endings with that character. I wasn't really sure about my SPECIALS; i think it was mostly I and A; with some C and E. Heavy on the settlements; based out of red-rocket, but moved to the castle once we took it. I used power armor quite a lot (and i always went commando) and tried all the different guns (although I found myself using the deliverer a *lot*). She's level 90ish now and i'm pretty bored with her, although she might try to unite far harbor now. The survival update dropped when I was almost at the endgame and I hadn't gotten any DLCs. I sorta went through all the companions and ditched them at sanctuary once we hooked up and I got the perk.\n\n12days, level 92 so far on a MUCH MORE FUN 'raider' character, survival mode from the start, with the DLCs. (I used a start mod that removed a lot of the \"it's my son\" storyline; but honestly didn't really make much difference)Mostly invested in C and L, and leveled up the E so i could turn ghoulish after going in naked to the glowing sea (I wasn't kidding Dr Amari!). I did just enough of the minutemen line to get sanctuary/redrocket settled and have Preston permanently pace the grounds (AND NOT BUG ME). I've taken over nuka world, destroyed far harbor (PRAISE ATOM!!!), and am working on being *the* chem-lord of the commonwealth. I just made it to the institute at level 90 and shot father in the face while he was talking (and everyone else on the way out) and it's pretty much been the only time I've used Power Armor. I mostly run around with Kellogg's outfit and gun (maxed toughness, and pistols perks, and all those crit-luck perks) and a ton of chems and booze and soda. Sometimes I use my deadeye plasma pistol just because the effect is so damn fun. I did *only* wear the robes of the devoted during my \"spiritual awakening\" at far harbor, but it was just a phase. I mostly travel alone or occasionally my hacked Mr.Frothy whirlwind of death \"Killbot\" (between three buzzblades and two auto lasers, it's hard to beat). I'm going to *try* and use the brotherhood to blow up the institute (and RR) and then go back and finally get preston out of limbo to get the minutemen to blow up the brotherhood but I'm not sure if all the plots will line up right. EDIT: Oh, and I kind of had a \"rolling base\" using linked supply lines and an automatron 'mule' as I worked my way south, and now I just kinda sleep wherever I find a bed (and leave a wake of random junk behind me). I do truck all my uniques and mags and bobbleheads and souvenirs back to home-plate periodically; but it's really more of a trophy-room than a base.\n\nOn both characters I really tried to get into using Vault88 as my base, and even finished the quest; but now I just have the jankiest bare-minimum vault that looks terrible and have zero-motivation to do anything with it even though it really feels like there's so much potential.

I played double-agent with the railroad and institute until about level 70? I actually tried both rr and institute endings with that character. I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure about my SPECIALS; i think it was mostly I and A; with some C and E. Heavy on the settlements; based out of red-rocket, but moved to the castle once we took it. I used power armor quite a lot (and i always went commando) and tried all the different guns (although I found myself using the deliverer a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;). She&amp;#39;s level 90ish now and i&amp;#39;m pretty bored with her, although she might try to unite far harbor now. The survival update dropped when I was almost at the endgame and I hadn&amp;#39;t gotten any DLCs. I sorta went through all the companions and ditched them at sanctuary once we hooked up and I got the perk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12days, level 92 so far on a MUCH MORE FUN &amp;#39;raider&amp;#39; character, survival mode from the start, with the DLCs. (I used a start mod that removed a lot of the &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s my son&amp;quot; storyline; but honestly didn&amp;#39;t really make much difference)Mostly invested in C and L, and leveled up the E so i could turn ghoulish after going in naked to the glowing sea (I wasn&amp;#39;t kidding Dr Amari!). I did just enough of the minutemen line to get sanctuary/redrocket settled and have Preston permanently pace the grounds (AND NOT BUG ME). I&amp;#39;ve taken over nuka world, destroyed far harbor (PRAISE ATOM!!!), and am working on being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; chem-lord of the commonwealth. I just made it to the institute at level 90 and shot father in the face while he was talking (and everyone else on the way out) and it&amp;#39;s pretty much been the only time I&amp;#39;ve used Power Armor. I mostly run around with Kellogg&amp;#39;s outfit and gun (maxed toughness, and pistols perks, and all those crit-luck perks) and a ton of chems and booze and soda. Sometimes I use my deadeye plasma pistol just because the effect is so damn fun. I did &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; wear the robes of the devoted during my &amp;quot;spiritual awakening&amp;quot; at far harbor, but it was just a phase. I mostly travel alone or occasionally my hacked Mr.Frothy whirlwind of death &amp;quot;Killbot&amp;quot; (between three buzzblades and two auto lasers, it&amp;#39;s hard to beat). I&amp;#39;m going to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; and use the brotherhood to blow up the institute (and RR) and then go back and finally get preston out of limbo to get the minutemen to blow up the brotherhood but I&amp;#39;m not sure if all the plots will line up right.
