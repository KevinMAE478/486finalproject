The single moment you really get to tell him how ashamed you are of him after you know what is going on (shooting him the first time you meet does not really give you perspective enough to judge things from his point of view) is on the roof of CIT after the Battle of Bunker Hill, and he has so much invested at that point that he just cuts you out of his life entirely, rather than admit his mistakes. It's the sunk-cost fallacy at its finest. \n\nAnd perhaps all the more bittersweet is the fact that of anyone who could truly understand his unique circumstance, it was you, and if you expressed how disappointed you were in who he had become, then it only confirms that he has always been alone in this world.

And it's not like you would have even been there to judge him had it not been for him thawing you from cryo in the first place. You have the authority of a parent, but any argument you could make to convince him that what he has worked toward his entire life is a waste, they are all utterly meaningless.\n\nYou didn't raise him to be this way? You didn't raise him at all. This isn't what you and your spouse had wanted for him? Nobody chooses their destiny, and given that you were involuntarily trapped in cryo for 210 years, you should know that better than anyone. You are disappointed in him? Your dated ideology and inability to see the strides science has made are a disappointment to him. And he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you? Yes, you provided breeding stock and created him, but he also would not be speaking to you had he not made the decision to free you from cryosleep. By what other authority do you have to question him? He assumes none, and never asks. And if you do not choose to go along with him, then no greater loss than he had already experienced before he was a year old. He does not seek your approval, he is purely curious what it would be like to have a family. If you do not want to be a part of his family in his last months or even weeks, then you are just a nusance that helped him to clean up loose ends like Kellogg.\n\nTruth be told, in my first playthrough I had that discussion on the roof of CIT, and told him that he was a disappointment. And knowing afterward that even the shame of not living up to your estranged mother's expectations would not be enough to dissuade him from that path, as he teleported away I sent a .223 round through his skull along with him. His body flew off the roof, but never hit the ground, and I can only imagine left a considerable mess wherever he teleported to on the inside of the Institute. If there is so much suffering that can be caused by one human being, even if they are your child, and even if they have been twisted into this grotesque human by circumstances beyond their control, then in a lawless society where you can count on no authority to extradite justice on the most vile type of human being who showed no hint of remorse... the only option was to end the suffering and brainwashing he had endured. Humanely, without prejudice. I knew by the time I reached the rooftop that he would either recant or die with the rest, and he made the decision for me. No regrets.\n\nI understand his frame of mind.

You have the authority of a parent, but any argument you could make to convince him that what he has worked toward his entire life is a waste, they are all utterly meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t raise him to be this way? You didn&amp;#39;t raise him at all. This isn&amp;#39;t what you and your spouse had wanted for him? Nobody chooses their destiny, and given that you were involuntarily trapped in cryo for 210 years, you should know that better than anyone. You are disappointed in him? Your dated ideology and inability to see the strides science has made are a disappointment to him. And he wouldn&amp;#39;t be here if it weren&amp;#39;t for you? Yes, you provided breeding stock and created him, but he also would not be speaking to you had he not made the decision to free you from cryosleep. By what other authority do you have to question him? He assumes none, and never asks. And if you do not choose to go along with him, then no greater loss than he had already experienced before he was a year old. He does not seek your approval, he is purely curious what it would be like to have a family. If you do not want to be a part of his family in his last months or even weeks, then you are just a nusance that helped him to clean up loose ends like Kellogg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, in my first playthrough I had that discussion on the roof of CIT, and told him that he was a disappointment. And knowing afterward that even the shame of not living up to your estranged mother&amp;#39;s expectations would not be enough to dissuade him from that path, as he teleported away I sent a .223 round through his skull along with him. His body flew off the roof, but never hit the ground, and I can only imagine left a considerable mess wherever he teleported to on the inside of the Institute. If there is so much suffering that can be caused by one human being, even if they are your child, and even if they have been twisted into this grotesque human by circumstances beyond their control, then in a lawless society where you can count on no authority to extradite justice on the most vile type of human being who showed no hint of remorse... the only option was to end the suffering and brainwashing he had endured. Humanely, without prejudice. I knew by the time I reached the rooftop that he would either recant or die with the rest, and he made the decision for me. No regrets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand his frame of mind. But understanding and acceptance are two separate measures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fo4", "name": "t1_dgbmgu9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492342410.0, "created_utc": 1492313610.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb1vsr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Riomaki", "parent_id": "t1_dgai565", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fo4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; And Bethesda's corpse physics undermined the emotional impact a bit by flinging her corpse across the room on death. \n\nTalk about ruining the moment.

Then, when finding out you&amp;#39;re going to be Father&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;heir&amp;quot; at the Institute, that sealed it. You will be the Director FOREVER, years if not decades, centuries, or spanning generations. I figure with the sympathies already in place at the Institute, turning the place around shouldn&amp;#39;t be that much of an issue.\nNow, imagine living forever with the other factions. The BOS? Really? When they see that after 20 years you haven&amp;#39;t aged a day, how are they going to react? Not well I bet. I actually see another split, like in the Lyons era of the BOS, if they don&amp;#39;t flat out give you the boot. Remember, we&amp;#39;re not seeing the whole BOS here. With the Railroad, I imagine you&amp;#39;d run the place eventually, as you are with the Minutemen, but do either of those places really have the tools to change anything?   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fo4", "name": "t1_dgako5e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492286493.0, "created_utc": 1492257693.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tzv4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gmhc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgalj5r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fishdump", "parent_id": "t3_65gmhc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fo4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For me it was when I was in the nursing home.
