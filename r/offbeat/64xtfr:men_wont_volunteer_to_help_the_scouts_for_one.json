One member of the board approached me at a council campout and told me that when asked, I should just say I believed in a &amp;quot;higher power&amp;quot;, or something similarly vague.  He figured no one could prove I &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; feel that way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t have done that, since I took the oath very seriously, but it was moot: another member of the board approached me later, and told me he knew I wasn&amp;#39;t religious, and that I shouldn&amp;#39;t try lying about it.  This guy was older and particularly conservative.  He was the one who asked me about my religion at my board of review.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scouting had a hugely positive influence on me as I was growing up, but this part still hurts, 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offbeat", "name": "t1_dg64fvb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043688.0, "created_utc": 1492014888.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5y41f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 138, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hattmeister", "parent_id": "t1_dg5v0kr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offbeat", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eagle Scout here.
