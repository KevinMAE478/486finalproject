After watching BBC's documentary *Extreme Pilgrim* [Shaolin Temple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLv54SsktIE) , I can no longer refer to an airbender in TLOK as a monk or nun, not from the point of view of buddhism. Call me orthodox, but I'm fascinated with the experience of Peter Owen Jones with chinese buddhism in *Extreme Pilgrim*. Meelo could be an airbending master in TLOK, but never a monk.

Now I can explain why Meelo bothered me several times while watching TLOK, despite his amusing moments, why not all air nomads can be monks/nuns, and why the concept of the Air Acolytes bothers me.\n\n1. Why Bryke shouldn't have used the word \"monk\" in TLOK.\nThe buddhist concept of a monk explains everything. According to Wikipedia:\n\n* *Sangha*: buddhist monastic community.\n\n* *Bhikkhu*: the Pali word for \"beggar\", \"one who lives by alms\". Bhikkhu: monk, Bhikkhuni: nun. A Bhikkhu is a person who seeks ordination to obtain release from the cycle of rebirth. (The only character I remember being a beggar is Uncle Iroh in ATLA).\n\n* \"A person under the age of 20 cannot be ordained as a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni\" [Bhikkhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu). Before becoming a monk/ nun, a person must be trained and experience the rank of \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era(\u012b).\n\n* *\u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era* (male novice), *\u015br\u0101ma\u1e47er\u012b* (female novice). In Wikipedia, the sanskrit word \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era is translated as \"small or young renunciate\".\n\nMeelo does not fit with this description of a \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era. He is only a good airbender and fighter, he's like any other kid who excels in his Karate school. Even Jinora couldn't be considered as a \"young renunciate\". \n\n2. Meelo is haughty and selfish.\nJust an example: In Book 4, episode The Calling, when Meelo told Ikki he had thrown away in the river the food their mother gave them in order to go in search for Korra, I thought this: \"you stupid kid, Kuvira might've solved some problems in the Earth Kingdom, but there are thousands of people still starving. Why didn't you share your food instead of throwing it away? Yes Meelo, you've learned good values, good work Tenzin.\"\n\nNow I'm sure Bryke ignored the core values of the Zen/Chan School and the core knowledge of buddhism in general when they designed the concept of the Air Nomads.
