Characters in the LOK developed more mixed forms of bending if they had parents from two different elements. Another way to develop more advanced bending techniques was just by pure genetics or skill. The key point is that during the times of these series, especially in LOK, these subtypes were special and rare. This means that only a select few in your RP should have these skills, and their childhood backgrounds or personal attributes should have a connection. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "name": "t1_dg6jt5v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492059473.0, "created_utc": 1492030673.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
