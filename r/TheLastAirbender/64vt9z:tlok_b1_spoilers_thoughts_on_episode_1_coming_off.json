Obviously, it will take more time to see how the Avatar World is enriched by this series, but it&amp;#39;s already pretty clear that there are some really interesting characters. I think it will be especially exciting to watch Tenzin, and some tension is already being built up around his desire to continue his father&amp;#39;s vision while also preparing the new avatar for leadership. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m excited to be starting TLOK.
