I'd love to see Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen. More about Wan, the 3 avatars after Wan. Also from which tribe is Wan anyways? Also seeing how we already know Avatars like Roku and such, I think people would love to see those more than another avatar after Aang. People somewhat disliked Korra because no1 knew her and not much was shown about Aang, we already knew Roku and the others so people wouldn't compare them to Aang as much because he learned from them. Now for what I'd like to see from each Avatar.\n\nRoku, a bit of his youth with Firelord Sozin, his time with Gyatzo, I don't care too much about him learning the elements, except for the fact that I want to see him communicate with Kyoshi, and see how that went. Then him coming home, getting married and maybe add something in with Sozin. Then the fight with Sozin when he first took a city from the Earth Kingdom, then his fight with the volcano and his demise. Then they should add Aang his time at the air temple, and a fight between the air/fire benders. Show how some airbenders escaped and were caught by traps. then maybe show a bit of the war itself before Aang comes back. Cause personally I'd love to see Iroh at the walls of Ba Sing Se. \n\nKyoshi, a bit of information about her learning the elements would be nice, would like to see Chin the Conqueror fight and get cities under his command and then him dying. Kyoshi Island being formed, she formed the Dai Li and has a daughter, so I'd like to see who the father is and a bit of her daughter.  \n\nKuruk, a small bit of him learning the elements and where he met his girlfriend, but the best part would be Koh the Face Stealer. I'd like to see how this happened, when this happened, some history of Koh along with this. Like how did Koh lose contact with the Mother of Faces, I'd love to see that here cause would make sense Imo. Also how did Koh lure Ummi (Kuruk his gf) to the spiritworld, and why did he think of Kuruk as arrogant. Would love information about that. Also in the comics we see a man without a face trying to get to the Mother of Faces, to get another face, and in ATLA we see, Idk what that was but I assume a monkey, without a face. So if they can live without face, what happened to Ummi? Where did she go. The fog of lost spirits maybe? \n\nYangchen, would like to see her learning the elements, how she was different from Aang and her life at the air temple. Her fight with General Old Iron, including history of General Old Iron and Lady Tienhai, which would be where he protected her during the Era of Raava, which would be interesting to say the least. Also about her fight with General Old Iron, she used the same form as Aang used to fight Ozai in the Avatar State, so what is this form with air around you and all the other elements and stuff. Was it a signature of Air avatars? Also her ritual she did for Lady Tienhai, that'd be nice to see, how it was setup and all that. \n\nWan, I'd like to know what tribe he counts as, a full story of him traveling and learning elements, what actually happens if Raava goes through him, his fight with Vaatu. We saw Wan die at some place that looked like war, what happened? Maybe put a story on that. And who came up with the name ''Avatar'' and did Wan tell people about it and did Wan know Raava would live on with him before passing away, also Wan was able to talk with Raava it seems like, seeing how Raava says at the end ''I'll be with your for all of your lives'' Why did Aang never communicate with her like that, Korra seems to have done it though. Also how did people start to become benders at birth, what happened to Lion turtles? Did Wan have something to do with that just like Korra and air bending? Lots of history about Raava and Vaatu could be included in this story line, like a fight before the one with Wan, I wonder how Raava defeated Vaatu alone, maybe she's like a really strong overpowered monster, we don't know... But it'd sure be enjoyable to watch a potential 20 minutes long fight between the 20, maybe inbetween the fight they could show how it might affect the rest of the world, for example, why did Lady Tienhai need General Old Iron his protection during this fight, was it something with spirits becoming bad during the fight so he protected her. And why weren't they affected then, or maybe they helped Raava, who knows I mean they were giants they have some powers, why not use it.  \n\nSecond Avatar, show us how he got to communicate with Wan, how'd he learn he could do that, how did he learn that he was the Avatar. How did people even know the name Avatar how did that all happen. How did tribes start to form, where did the lore come from that we know. How come the cycle works like this, going to all tribes. How did Raava even know what tribe to go to next and how did she follow Wan's next life. And show us how he learned the elements too, it'd be interesting to see, did he learn from Wan or anything at all?\n\nThird Avatar, the same as number 2 really, just some lore and how did he find out and how was it all spread.\n\nFourth Avatar, same as number 2/3. Also why number 1/2/3/4? Because then we are through all tribes and we'll see how it all started.\n\nAlso for all avatars counts one thing, they could add some extra stuff in like fights and conflicts, as long as it doesn't become nonsense, like it still has to be true in ATLA, or it should be something not mentioned. So we haven't seen it yet and have yet to learn. And their love lifes, children etc. \n\nthen I'd like to see Aang as grown up, the comics on tv would be insanely fun to watch honestly. Also not many people seem to know about the comics that do enjoy Avatar, so it'd be so good to put them on tv. Also seeing the relationship between Aang and Katara, I'd love to see that those 2 are just the best. Also the past of Guru Pathik would be nice, he was friends with Gyatzo?? Like come on show us some of that please.  \n\nAnd now that we know Korra already, might as well make something about her the way she gets her past life connections back, I'd love to see that happen honestly. I wonder how she'd do it and what would be needed, we'd learn a lot from that because to be fair, Korra has brought us a lot of interesting things especially the one about Wan. But also other things, Zaheer his past and the past of The Red Lotus, would be so interesting. How did Zaheer learn about Vaatu and Raava, and what about Unalaq, their past would be interesting to see as well. Also Zaheer was able to fly, the past of Guru Laghima wouldn't hurt. How did he learn to fly and did others know about it etc. \n\nHonestly I think so many people would love to watch all of this and so much more, but one can only dream sadly. But I know that if they ever decide to do stuff like this, they'll be busy for years and years. And I think that's perfect because then we'd get so many years of interesting lore about Avatar, I just hope this happens one day even if I'm like 30 by the time it happens. I just want it to happen.. Hope you took the time to read I took like an hour writing this, if you did then thanks :). I always love reading other people their stuff cause it brings me good ideas of what I'd like to see, and I kinda added this into one post of my own with new ideas included. Reply if you Reddit (read it :)) and tell me what you think or what you would add to it. Cause I'd love to see more ideas haha.  I'm gonna edit stuff once I think of/read more ideas :). \n\nEDIT: How did any Avatar find out that once killed in the Avatar State, the Avatar ceases to exist?  Who found out? How did they find out? How do they know about the Avatar State at all anyways, and how did they learn how to master it.\n\nEDIT: First bloodbenders and lavabenders. Was any Airbender evil? Except Zaheer, did any of them kill? Did Gyatzo or any other airbender use the trick Zaheer used to kill the Earth Queen? Was Aang truly the first Avatar to Energy bend? \n\nEDIT: What if they showed Aang practicing energy bending with Raava, Wan had to go through a lot to learn elements and Raava had to go through him, what if they show Aang doing that while he was still gone. Raava talking to him and helping him learn Energy bending, they'd have to find a way to kinda sneak it all in, but that'd be so huge.", "edited": 1492125074.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man this question, have fun reading this is gonna be long and I&amp;#39;m sorry for that.

However, there is a lot of distrust from the actual head of Ba Sing Sae PD, an earth bender forced to accept the non-Bender by Chief Beifong in Republic City. As they start working, they encounter a string of murders of prominent Bender officials by a seemingly invisible assailant. In a first few episodes, Korra helps establish that the murderer isn&amp;#39;t a spirit, but the twist is tied in to the Harmonic Convergence...I won&amp;#39;t ruin it here, still hoping to post a fic/pilot script at some point :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "name": "t1_dgdi5so", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492466187.0, "created_utc": 1492437387.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650fi3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650fi3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650fi3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gscj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blockpro156", "parent_id": "t1_dg6hom1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheLastAirbender", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Plus, isn't it cooler to see how the world changes based off the actions of the previous Avatar?  \n\nYeah I totally agree with that, Korra (and Aang) made some huge changes to the world, it would be a waste if they go back to an earlier state of the world rather than showing how Korra's changes pan out.
