There are five regions, but four starting regions (fire, earth, water, air.) The player chooses one to start in. That one gives the player his/her initial \"race\" (baseline cosmetic/physical features.)\n2. Player chooses a gender.\n3. Player customizes character cosmetics/backstory/name/whatever.\n\nThe world/goal: think breath of the wild. It's a fantastic model for open world--it's truly open. The player starts wherever he/she wants and progresses at his/her own pace. The player can literally run to the final boss if they want. The player's starting region, (1) from above, determines where the player begins and what bending technique they learn first (which means puzzles in that region would revolve around that technique.) The player must visit each of the other three starting regions to learn the other three bending techniques/do some task that makes the final boss easier. The end goal is to get to the last region (perhaps smaller than the others, similar to Hyrule castle) to defeat the main evil. A large part of this game will be solving puzzles using the different elements to manipulate the world around the avatar.\n\nCombat: action. Again, think BotW. There's a reason why it hit the top of the charts--it's a good formula. One difference being less focus on weapon durability (there should still be weapon durability, but there should also be unarmed combat) and more focus on resource management (focus, which fuels your martial arts and bending.)\n\nFocus (resources): focus is what the avatar/player needs to bend the elements and perform bending combos. Similar to stamina in BotW, if the player runs out of focus, the player must rest or regenerate before more actions can be taken. The difference here being as focus gets lower, the effectiveness of bending and martial arts decreases (i.e. the damage / size of a fireball decreases, the duration of freeze traps decreases, because tired muscles lead to sloppy movement.)\n\nCharacter progression: Now, one thing we can do with this game is give the player upgrades. BotW was great and all, but it still suffered from what other Zelda games suffered from: no sense of character strength increase. There should be a challenge in the end game, but over time the player should feel like going around killin' shit / knocking shit out matters and helps the player. A talent \"tree\"/circle (think a very simplified PoE talents) that combines the various elements and allows the player to modify their bending abilities can be added. Obtaining talents comes from completing puzzles, helping people (or hurting them), or just killing things / knocking stuff out. Perhaps there's a talent between water and fire that allows the avatar to make steam, or a talent deep in earth bending that allows the avatar to gain control (simplified grab and throw) of his/her enemy's steel weapons, or even modifies the basic earth block manipulation technique to manipulate steel blocks as well. One person mentioned they want to specialize and make the player's choice in bending matter--maybe where you start on the tree depends on where you start in the game, and expanding beyond your main branch requires time, where it's nearly impossible to become a master of everything without devoting a ton of time/dedication to it (which means if you want to become a great water bender, start in the water bender's region. This will decrease the work it takes to get all of the water bending talents, but heavily increase the time investment to master both water and earth.)\n\nAs any ol' bender, the developer wouldn't have the ability to generalize the game for puzzle solving. You might be able to, but you'd have to create four solutions to the same puzzle if that puzzle required bending to be solved, which increases the work required to make the game by a factor of 4. \n\nWith avatar model, the player can skip to the final boss because it wouldn't require all four bending techniques (just one at most), and we don't have to force generalization across every puzzle. It's one of the reasons why BotW gave the player all of the puzzle-solving abilities in the first hour before allowing progression.\n\nHonestly I'd love to play as a new avatar, learning the ropes behind every art and the moral consequences of my actions and how they affect those around me.\n\nPlus it'd be dope to raise a fire barrier to incinerate arrows headed towards me, and then throwing earth spikes through said shield to make molten globs of lava incinerate my enemies.\n\nEdit: I don't care if people see this, I just want to write it down (plus I like typing and this kind of thought game.) \n\nAn alternative follows a bit closer to TES:III-V. In TES:III-V, the player is a hero of that era (Nevarim, Hero of Kvatch, Dragonborn), but the quest leading to those roles (which are effectively just titles, save the demi-god like power of shouting in Skyrim) is easily skipable, making the game playable without interacting with the main quest at all.\n\nNow, in this Avatar game, the player may start off with a few initial quests to learn some basic martial arts, how to use weapons, how to make food/sleep/whatever, but the main story doesn't start until the second town (similar to TES:III-V) and is completely skipable. Imagine the main story being broken up in to two parts, where if the first is taken the second is skipable: the first part discovering that the player is a bender (relatively short, teaches the basics of your region's bending abilities), and the second discovering the player is the Avatar (longer, leads to saving the world or whatever.) Puzzles can be solved with bending or without, but there must always be a \"without bending\" option for generality (let's call it hard mode, because in that world it pretty much is.)\n\nWith this model you can experience a world with bending as someone that can't bend. It might be possible to get to the last boss somehow without bending, but I'm guessing this model might be a bit weirder to write up (why even have the avatar option in the first place if you don't have to be it?)\n\nThat said, maybe just an action game of a non-bender in a bending world where you \"command\" a party of benders (third person action combat where you can give orders to your team; think Mass Effect) would be just as fun.

One person mentioned they want to specialize and make the player&amp;#39;s choice in bending matter--maybe where you start on the tree depends on where you start in the game, and expanding beyond your main branch requires time, where it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to become a master of everything without devoting a ton of time/dedication to it (which means if you want to become a great water bender, start in the water bender&amp;#39;s region. This will decrease the work it takes to get all of the water bending talents, but heavily increase the time investment to master both water and earth.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As any ol&amp;#39; bender, the developer wouldn&amp;#39;t have the ability to generalize the game for puzzle solving. You might be able to, but you&amp;#39;d have to create four solutions to the same puzzle if that puzzle required bending to be solved, which increases the work required to make the game by a factor of 4. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With avatar model, the player can skip to the final boss because it wouldn&amp;#39;t require all four bending techniques (just one at most), and we don&amp;#39;t have to force generalization across every puzzle. It&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why BotW gave the player all of the puzzle-solving abilities in the first hour before allowing progression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly I&amp;#39;d love to play as a new avatar, learning the ropes behind every art and the moral consequences of my actions and how they affect those around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus it&amp;#39;d be dope to raise a fire barrier to incinerate arrows headed towards me, and then throwing earth spikes through said shield to make molten globs of lava incinerate my enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I don&amp;#39;t care if people see this, I just want to write it down (plus I like typing and this kind of thought game.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An alternative follows a bit closer to TES:III-V. In TES:III-V, the player is a hero of that era (Nevarim, Hero of Kvatch, Dragonborn), but the quest leading to those roles (which are effectively just titles, save the demi-god like power of shouting in Skyrim) is easily skipable, making the game playable without interacting with the main quest at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, in this Avatar game, the player may start off with a few initial quests to learn some basic martial arts, how to use weapons, how to make food/sleep/whatever, but the main story doesn&amp;#39;t start until the second town (similar to TES:III-V) and is completely skipable. Imagine the main story being broken up in to two parts, where if the first is taken the second is skipable: the first part discovering that the player is a bender (relatively short, teaches the basics of your region&amp;#39;s bending abilities), and the second discovering the player is the Avatar (longer, leads to saving the world or whatever.) Puzzles can be solved with bending or without, but there must always be a &amp;quot;without bending&amp;quot; option for generality (let&amp;#39;s call it hard mode, because in that world it pretty much is.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this model you can experience a world with bending as someone that can&amp;#39;t bend. It might be possible to get to the last boss somehow without bending, but I&amp;#39;m guessing this model might be a bit weirder to write up (why even have the avatar option in the first place if you don&amp;#39;t have to be it?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, maybe just an action game of a non-bender in a bending world where you &amp;quot;command&amp;quot; a party of benders (third person action combat where you can give orders to your team; think Mass Effect) would be just as fun. Who knows? \u00af\\&lt;em&gt;(\u30c4)&lt;/em&gt;/\u00af&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "name": "t1_dg8phwj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492169963.0, "created_utc": 1492141163.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6586aj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8k0xc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SpraynardKrugerIWB", "parent_id": "t1_dg89nx4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheLastAirbender", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So I like not being the avatar in this scenario, however, if you were the avatar in this game you shouldn't be able to choose what nation you're born into or what sex you are, the Avatar is so much more than just the person's body the spirit occupies.
