People have been trying to solve the problem of how to shoot quicker for a long time. Prior to magazine fed repeating arms one solution was to add barrels. Some of the guns took the shape of stacked charge designs or double lock designs (like the side hammer in the album), but one of our favorite ways were swivel breech designs sometimes called turnover guns. Aside from one, all of the guns in the album have more barrels than locks. To fire all the barrels the shooter pulled a spring tab (often the front of the trigger guard functioned as the release) that allowed the barrels to rotate into position. Each shot just required re-priming the lock before being ready to fire.

People have been trying to solve the problem of how to shoot quicker for a long time. Prior to magazine fed repeating arms one solution was to add barrels. Some of the guns took the shape of stacked charge designs or double lock designs (like the side hammer in the album), but one of our favorite ways were swivel breech designs sometimes called turnover guns. Aside from one, all of the guns in the album have more barrels than locks.
