If somebody is targeting you, and is making a deliberate and planned attack against your firearm collection, then you are more likely boned, but that second scenario is much less likely and is why proper insurance is more preferable. The second scenario is also mitigated by common sense discretion, i.e. not making people aware of your firearms and where they are. Carry guitar cases/bags to your car instead of gun specific cases, don&amp;#39;t plaster firearm related stickers on your car or house, tell Midway to use more discrete packaging, etc.  Loose lips sink ships. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "guns", "name": "t1_dg7n44q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123578.0, "created_utc": 1492094778.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652wh6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652wh6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652wh6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652wh6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652wh6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7yxyq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cryptic99", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ulz1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/guns", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks dude", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks dude&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "guns", "name": "t1_dg7yxyq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136246.0, "created_utc": 1492107446.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ulz1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chucknorrisjoke", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qr4h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/guns", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Gotcha.
