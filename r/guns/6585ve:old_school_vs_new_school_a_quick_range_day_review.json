An assault rifle must be select fire in an intermediate cartridge, the AR-15 is just in an intermediate cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AR-15 in 5.56 is the safest home defensive firearm available currently, the round it uses is effective on soft targets, and tumbles and breaks up when hitting solid targets and dry wall. There&amp;#39;s less chance of hurting an innocent bystander using this compared to, say, a 12 gauge shotgun, a handgun, or any other non-5.56 rifle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also comfortable to use, light recoiling, and useable by disabled, smaller framed men and women, larger framed men and women, and it&amp;#39;s super customiseable for any purpose, such as with a light for positive target identification. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The civilian AR-15 is not capable of even being converted to fully automatic without a drill press and some milling work, and all of the proper (hard to get/illegal) parts to put in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a MILITARY WEAPON that we&amp;#39;re able to get, easily, in the states, that has killed millions of people, and many that are available have human blood in their history? The Mosin Nagant. 300 bucks at any pawn shop you might go in, 400 with a case of ammo, sling, and bayonet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AR-15 has never been a military weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "guns", "name": "t1_dg9010e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492195714.0, "created_utc": 1492166914.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6585ve", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6585ve", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6585ve", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9jini", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Michael1492", "parent_id": "t1_dg99659", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/guns", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, for example the term silencer does a real disservice to what a suppressor really does and it creates a false belief in non gun owning community.
