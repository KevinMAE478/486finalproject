So they designed the S&amp;amp;W .500 which was like a guitar riff backed wheelie burnout to the American shooting public. It was EVERYWHERE. In all the magazines, on the news, and every LGS had to have one. America figured out really quickly that S&amp;amp;W was here to kick ass and chew bubble gum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New S&amp;amp;W pretty much waggled their dick at the Clinton deal. I don&amp;#39;t know that they do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; from the Clinton deal to all their guns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/New/html/20000317_2.html\"&gt;https://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/New/html/20000317_2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t even put internal locks on all their revolvers, like the TRR8.  If they were compelled by contract the TRR8 would have one but it doesn&amp;#39;t, which tells me the reason the rest of the guns have locks is because S&amp;amp;W wants them there.  I&amp;#39;m willing to bet someone from the original Saf-T-Hammer company has some sweet compensation package that&amp;#39;s tied to licensing their product. Since they have the weight of S&amp;amp;W behind them they can compel the licensing of their safety product and somebody or somebodies are making fat stacks of cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "guns", "name": "t1_dg8dtbe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492153572.0, "created_utc": 1492124772.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ibcq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cheese_Bits", "parent_id": "t1_dg7hrym", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/guns", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I'm saying if they weren't owned by a company whom specializes in safeties, they'd probably not have safeties at this point.\n\nAnd without the political climate imposed by the AWB S&amp;W wouldnt have been in a possition to be bought out by them nor would saf-t have any reason to buy the company without the previous agreement to install integral locks having set the stage.
