IPSC, join competitions, take courses, stay active within IPSC community and compete in IPSC a specific amount. After you complete course and competed once, you can apply for a license for one gun after you competed with a borrow-gun. It's a bit tricky, see /u/Saxit response.\n2. Hunting license, you can only buy shotguns and bolt actions, in some cases semi-autos but pistols are very difficult. AR-15s or \"military-like\" guns are a no-go basically. \n3. Target shooting. You shoot with 5 rounds of .22 at 25 metres (27 yards) one handed (one \"sequence\"), and have to score a certain amount one time during a 6 month period before you can apply for a .22 pistol. If you want a 9mm or larger you have to wait another 6 months and pass a shooting test made by the association just like a .22. And you have to shoot a certain score every year.

You shoot (or several people at the same time) 5 shots of .22 one handed at 25 metres, then stop, go  and put stickers on the targets and count the score, and then go back, reload, and another sequence. Sometimes people shoot 9mm alongside .22. Mostly police do that though, to improve their shooting skills. Noone is allowed to do anything but target shooting in there, except for very rare cases when the Range Officer is OK with it.\n\nI am not a member in the Air Defense shooting association, but I have a friend who has been and I went shooting there with him sometimes. AMA and I'll try to answer as much as I can, not so much about thee license things though.\n\nAbout the ventilation: If you only shoot .22 it's adequate, but after a few hours of shooting, yes, it does get quite bad.
