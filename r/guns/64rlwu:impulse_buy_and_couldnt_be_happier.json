It is also why POF makes a reverse stretch instead of a K model, as they never received the machines to make a K model gun.\n\nAlso part of the difference between the MP5 and the Scorpion Evo and most AR's in 9mm is that the MP5 uses a delaying mechanism in the bolt.  The Scorpion and most AR's use a straight blowback system, similar to the UZI.  Straight blowback is cheaper to make (always has been) and that is reflected in the price.
