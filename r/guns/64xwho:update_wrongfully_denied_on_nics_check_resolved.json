I was very irritated when I discovered that the feds had stopped processing appeals for any NICS denials. They were currently processing appeals that were over a YEAR old. For those who don&amp;#39;t know getting denied on a Brady check (NICS) means that you can neither purchase NOR POSSESS a firearm until you are cleared of the denial. Well...you can imagine how well telling a gun owner that they can&amp;#39;t have their guns because the federal government screwed up went with me. I had to surrender my guns to someone where I wouldn&amp;#39;t have access to them (at the recommendation of a lawyer). &lt;del&gt;This is important because if you are found to be in possession of a firearm after being denied on a NICS check the local PD can take and destroy your guns&lt;/del&gt;. So, my initial thought was to sue the feds to restore my rights as I was recommended to do on here. I contacted &lt;a href=\"/u/2alitigator\"&gt;/u/2alitigator&lt;/a&gt;. He was INCREDIBLY helpful and responsive. Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#39;t have the money to sue at that time so I was waiting to see if any of his pending cases resulted in the feds paying the legal fees (because again THEIR screw up). So I unfortunately had to hold off suing (but I highly recommend anyone in this situation that can afford to sue to contact him. He is very knowledgeable and straightforward). So I got fingerprinted and then submitted my initial appeal not expecting much to come of it. Then I sat on it for a few months. Fast forward to last month. Fed up with lack of due process I submitted my Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) with prints to the FBI. Then about a week and a half ago I went to the office of my local congressman and submitted a form that allows them to follow up directly with the FBI. I don&amp;#39;t know which of these resolved the issue (VAF or representative) but last night I got my letter clearing me for purchases and providing my UPIN for the VAF. I am so glad to have my rights back that I am going to go buy a celebratory stripped lower :-).

I read it in HS in AP gov and it is a decent insight into the American electorate. at the risk of painting in too broad of strokes, it discusses that as the voter has become more and more centrist in viewpoint the parties have become more and more polarized. This has resulted in a lack of congruence between the viewpoint of most voters whose opinions fall left and right of center on different issues and the candidates running for office. Eventually, as I am sure anyone with a brain can figure out, this will have to result in a reform of one or both the primary parties or the emergence of an actually competitive third party that will rise in acceptance and influence as it aligns itself more closely with the ideology of voters.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "guns", "name": "t1_dg7refm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128225.0, "created_utc": 1492099425.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6vpq5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChopperIndacar", "parent_id": "t1_dg6mwr1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/guns", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tell us how voting for someone who promises gun control as part of their official platform does not constitute \"working against gun rights\".
