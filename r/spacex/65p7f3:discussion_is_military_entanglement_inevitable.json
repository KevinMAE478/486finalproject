You bring up, or at least hint at, the possibility of space piracy. In the near term (20-50 years) this is very unlikely to represent a serious problem for a few reasons. The first reason is that a lot of industry (inclusive of ships) that is going to get built out there is going to be built and operated by large corporations or governments. We certainly have such groups acting unethically down here on the Earth, but if Nokia was found to be actively stealing cargo from Samsung flagged ships, that is either something that the countries in question would have to own up to and punish, or it would be considered a straight up act of war. Somalia and such gets a bit of a pass on the piracy front simply because they don't have the ability to stop it, but the government tends to help where it can. Without researching though, I wouldn't be surprised if there were ways in which the Somalian government WAS punished for it anyway. Secondly, this is going to sound odd, but in many ways (for now) Earth's oceans are bigger than space. There is a LOT more stuff down there acting in unpredictable ways (IE: If you look at another countries spy satellite on Monday and don't look for it again till Friday, there's a fairly reasonable chance it will be exactly where you expect it to be.), even WITH spy satellites and radar, we are still just STARTING to get a global continuous tracking system for ships in place. Most of what we have relies on the ships in question to be squawking a beacon, which can be turned off, anyway. So, it is a LOT easier to \"get lost\" in Earth's ocean than it is in space. As an extension of this, which comes up quite frequently in various sci-fi discussion areas, is that stealth in space is unfortunately, basically impossible. ESPECIALLY for manned spacecraft. Yes, you can hide yourself from radar and lidar as perfectly as possible...but you cannot escape the fact that you are emitting heat. It is not very cold in space...it is very nothing in space. I don't have the source info, but one factoid that frequently gets brought up on the stealth discussion is that our thermal imaging systems are so good, that even if we didn't specifically know where to look (super-focused imaging systems would be even better), we'd be able to clearly spot the Shuttle's maneuvering thrusters fire....even if it was out near Pluto. Not even just the engines, but the plume as well. So by the time space is busy enough that space piracy might even begin to be an issue, there will be enough \"traffic control\" thermal systems around to keep an eye on any ship that exists. So...since nobody can get anywhere without everyone knowing who went where, the only way for space piracy to exist would be for there to be some (space)country that just didn't care everyone knew they were attacking other stuff, which is guaranteed to get a military response.\n\nPoint 3 - Part 1 tldr: Space piracy is not going to really be able to happen anytime soon as there is no way to hide who has done it and what they've done.\n\nPoint 3 - Part 2: A space military, in and of itself is also an interesting concept. By and large, militaries exist to protect what their country finds valuable and, if need be, to attack what other countries find valuable. While the ITS is more than capable of launching a real honest-to-god warship into space, the question must be asked...what would it be for? Protecting/attacking anything beyond Earth orbit is a bit of a stretch. Almost everything out there (in the near term anyway) is going to have to come back here in order to be valuable, so why bother spending the money to head out when you can just take it or deal with it when it comes to you? For anything in Earth orbit itself, you are probably perfectly safe with just some battle-ready space stations. Give them some nice thrusters so they can kick themselves around their orbital track to dodge ballistic weapons, but there's no real need for them to be \"ships\" in the traditional sense of the word. Think of them more like the Coast Guard, armed and dangerous, sure, but not really intended for the front line of war. Similarly, you can put such stations in Lunar orbit to handle any moon-action might go on. You are probably likely to see some ships intended for Earth-Moon action, but I think it is a safe bet that these are going to primarily be troop transports meant to deal with action happening on the lunar surface rather than in the space above it. Between the various battle platforms and ground-to-space weaponry, there isn't any real need for a \"battleship\" (and carriers are pretty much right out in any near-future) per se in Earth-Moon space. For any targets beyond this zone, you are most likely fine sending out largely ballistic weapons that have terminal thruster abilities (if you really wanted to blow up an asteroid mining facility...it's not likely to move very far). In the future, there COULD be the possibility of wanting to send warships between planets (Ex: The traditional Earth/Mars revolutionary gambit.), but this is far enough off into the future that we'd probably be on the ITS Mk-4 by then, so it isn't really pertinent to our discussion. Finally, of course, there is the Outer Space Treaty (and various other treaties) which give a bit of a stink-eye towards countries that weaponize space. Taking pictures is generally agreed upon to be fine, guns is another. Russia once put an anti-aircraft cannon on a space station to shoot down a satellite they had as a test, but that was before the treaties and they haven't done it since. Sure, it could have been done in secret, but that is a different can of worms. While \"owning the high ground\" is not just a meme and is quite a necessity, any major countries actively engaging in a fight for orbital supremacy are likely to be capable of so much other methods of destruction (ICBMs or nuclear tipped cruise missiles [for that low altitude feel], etc) that the discussion gets moot pretty quick.\n\nPoint 3 - Part 2 tldr: Other than armed battle stations and troop carriers for Earth-Moon activities, there really isn't a NEED for ships. Sure, the ITS could launch the battle platforms, but there is still the legal issue and diplomatic relations problems to this (pretty blatant) provocation to deal with.\n\nOverall TLDR: The ITS is going to change a lot of things, but probably not a whole lot with respect to the military approach to space. There are complications the ITS still couldn't cheaply address, and simultaneously the military taking advantage of the system would cause a huge amount of non-technology based problems in its own right. Finally, for a lot of possibilities, there just isn't much of a NEED for a space-navy...yet.\n\n[2 of 2]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point 3 - Part 1: While it is certainly a given that we will see increased militarization of space as time goes on, we need to make sure our assumptions on what conditions will exist to cause this to happen.

Some company, possibly SpaceX but possibly others, are going to see the same potential and work towards it. The military will likely just contract them out, same as they do for building and launching their satellites already. On another note, while a mobile satellite workshop could be extremely useful, one thing to note is that a fair number of satellites are in widely disparate orbits. As an overly ridiculous example, you probably wouldn't shift the workshop from working on a satellite in geosync orbit to one in polar orbit, the phase change would require a ridiculous amount of dV, and while a ship like the ITS-transit stage has more than enough fuel to do something like that, it is still obscenely expensive cost-wise. Chances are decent that for some of the \"primary\" orbits (like geosync) you'd have one or two of these things poking around and then for other orbits you'd use something smaller/cheaper than the ITS (probably something for the Falcon Heavy). Additionally, the lifespan of satellites is now often such that by the time one needs replacing, the increase in capabilities from replacing it with a \"modern\" satellite quite likely outweighs the opportunity cost of just disposing of the older one. Finally, very few, if any, satellites are currently designed to support being upgraded (swapping out hardware), partly because of my last statement.

While orbital cleanup IS going to be something required in the (near?) future, it isn't going to be economical (even with SpaceX's advancements) to go around chasing every lost bolt or panel. One other issue with this industry (which HAS been in development for at least a decade or more already) is that most major countries view any device which can de-orbit space debris (such as a disabled satellite) as a device with offensive military purposes. EX: Russia is worried that the US could use such a device to destroy the Russian GPS system. And unfortunately, again, just about nothing in space was designed with this sort of system in mind. So to a decent degree, you are going to have to build semi-specialized hardware for each object you are planning to collect. While orbital manufacturing would be a wonderful way to recycle these materials and \"cheaply\" construct new things in orbit, we have barely begun to scratch the surface of the technologies required. An example of this, is that we've relatively recently found that the amount of gravity a given metal is exposed to as it solidifies/cools can drastically alter its crystalline structure, and thus its material properties.
