Noticing the (wood?) laid under the treads of the large crane - presumably to reduce the risk of such damage.\n\n- Image 4: I've seen very few recent photos of SLC-40 during the repair work following the AMOS-6 anomaly, glad to see this photo. Can't see much at that distance, but looks like they cleaned up the sooty lightning tower, and at least one large crane in use.\n\n- Excellent image of the Roomba - good exposure and lots of detail visible. Interesting to see it completely folded flat. There has been discussion that the treads are rubber - they do look different from the steel treads on the crane in Image 1 - rubber treads might cause issues with the stability of the rocket while it's being held, unless the Roomba puts down metal \"feet\". The cable with the floats (to prevent going under the Roomba) is barely visible near the upper right corner of the Roomba. Not being covered, some pretty sophisticated robot parts will be exposed to salt spray for much of the time - they must be designed to withstand it - impressive!\n\n**Edit:**\n\n- *'rubber treads might cause issues with the stability of the rocket while it's being held, unless the Roomba puts down metal \"feet\"'* - Sorry I forgot to complete the thought on that. Elon said during the SES-10 post-flight press conference that the Roomba (he said droids) would be used when there were rough seas and danger of the booster sliding around, to grab the booster so people could board the ASDS and \"safe\" the booster. There doesn't appear to be any way to install jacks and get the Roomba out from under the rocket, so if it's used, then it has to hold the booster all the way back to port, which will take up to several days (again, on rough seas, because that's why it was used). Moving parts of the Roomba, for example the metal parts in the tracks, must have a little bit of \"play\" in them so that they can move. As the ASDS rocks on the waves, the booster tilts back and forth, shifting the weight and the torque on whatever is holding it (in this case the Roomba). Because the moving parts of the Roomba have to be a little bit loose (otherwise they couldn't move), they will slide back and forth a little bit, causing a small amount of wear and fatigue on the moving parts, which will accumulate over time. Putting down \"feet\" which are then locked in place would avoid the repeated motion of parts against other parts, and thus prolong the life of the Roomba drive system. (Rubber treads will compress slightly when the motion of the ASDS causes the booster to tilt in a way to exert more force on them, exaggerating the motion of the booster but reducing the peak stresses on the booster at the peak of each swing. Come to think of it, I'm not sure whether absolute motion or peak stress would have a greater effect on causing wear in the Roomba drive system.) I expect that SpaceX has considered the issues of using a tracked drive system to hold a booster for several days at time, and either they've concluded that it's acceptable, or we'll see some kind of feet extended when it catches the booster (or alternatively, the tracks could be raised, so that the body of the Roomba rests on the deck).\n\n- I'd been thinking in terms of the Roomba being fairly slow to move and fairly slow to catch the booster, possibly remote controlled by a human operator. That could be the case, but it occurs to me that if the booster is actually sliding on the deck, there could be an advantage to making the Roomba as quick and agile as possible, which could mean making it largely self-controlled (or maybe that's the plan for a future \"Roomba II\"). I hope eventually we have a movie of it in action so we can see how quickly it moves.", "edited": 1492263027.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great photos (as many others have said), and impressive to get them from a moving platform on a six-minute flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for technical details from the images:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image 1: There was previous discussion that the heavy equipment had been damaging the paved surfaces at the port. Noticing the (wood?) laid under the treads of the large crane - presumably to reduce the risk of such damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image 4: I&amp;#39;ve seen very few recent photos of SLC-40 during the repair work following the AMOS-6 anomaly, glad to see this photo. Can&amp;#39;t see much at that distance, but looks like they cleaned up the sooty lightning tower, and at least one large crane in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent image of the Roomba - good exposure and lots of detail visible. Interesting to see it completely folded flat. There has been discussion that the treads are rubber - they do look different from the steel treads on the crane in Image 1 - rubber treads might cause issues with the stability of the rocket while it&amp;#39;s being held, unless the Roomba puts down metal &amp;quot;feet&amp;quot;. The cable with the floats (to prevent going under the Roomba) is barely visible near the upper right corner of the Roomba. Not being covered, some pretty sophisticated robot parts will be exposed to salt spray for much of the time - they must be designed to withstand it - impressive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;rubber treads might cause issues with the stability of the rocket while it&amp;#39;s being held, unless the Roomba puts down metal &amp;quot;feet&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; - Sorry I forgot to complete the thought on that. Elon said during the SES-10 post-flight press conference that the Roomba (he said droids) would be used when there were rough seas and danger of the booster sliding around, to grab the booster so people could board the ASDS and &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; the booster. There doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be any way to install jacks and get the Roomba out from under the rocket, so if it&amp;#39;s used, then it has to hold the booster all the way back to port, which will take up to several days (again, on rough seas, because that&amp;#39;s why it was used). Moving parts of the Roomba, for example the metal parts in the tracks, must have a little bit of &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; in them so that they can move. As the ASDS rocks on the waves, the booster tilts back and forth, shifting the weight and the torque on whatever is holding it (in this case the Roomba). Because the moving parts of the Roomba have to be a little bit loose (otherwise they couldn&amp;#39;t move), they will slide back and forth a little bit, causing a small amount of wear and fatigue on the moving parts, which will accumulate over time. Putting down &amp;quot;feet&amp;quot; which are then locked in place would avoid the repeated motion of parts against other parts, and thus prolong the life of the Roomba drive system. (Rubber treads will compress slightly when the motion of the ASDS causes the booster to tilt in a way to exert more force on them, exaggerating the motion of the booster but reducing the peak stresses on the booster at the peak of each swing. Come to think of it, I&amp;#39;m not sure whether absolute motion or peak stress would have a greater effect on causing wear in the Roomba drive system.)
