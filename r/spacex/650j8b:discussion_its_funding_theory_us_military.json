The launch capacity of the ITS allows for rapid and decisive militarization of space.\n\nThe USAF has done extensive testing and development of orbit based anti-missile defense under the Brilliant Pebbles program, and continued that research into the modern day. The Exo-Atmospheric kinetic kill vehicle developed for the SM-3 and GMD anti-ballistic-missile programs is functionally exactly the same as a Brilliant Pebbles kinetic interceptor. A lightweight, compact homing sensor/thruster package that can maneuver to intercept an evasive target in a vacuum. The modifications to convert the Exo-Amospheric kill vehicle from a ground missile launched-on-demand, to a permanently on station orbital munition are minimal. It would need an additional small boost stage to give it the DeltaV for de-orbiting into intercept trajectory, a solar insulation jacket, and a communications package.\n\nThe Brilliant Pebbles concept in the 90s worked out an estimated 50 - 100 kilogram mini-satellite containing a single interceptor package. The mini satellites volume would be around a cubic meter with it's solar panel folded. The plan for total orbital coverage giving sufficient interception capability to defeat large scale ICBM launches, was a fleet of 5000 - 10,000 in low earth orbit.\n\nThe problem with this program is that it is massively disruptive to MAD, and with existing space lift capacity, it would take a long time and many launches to get the system up to operational effectiveness. If it takes you years of continual launches to get the fleet up to effective strength, that gives plenty of time for your strategic rivals to apply political pressure and threaten a first strike if you continue to build the system that could render their ICBM deterrent force useless.\n\nWith the throw weight and cargo volume of the ITS you could launch a total orbital defense grid of Brilliant Pebbles interceptors, in under a month, with a single launcher. If you have sufficient launchers available (say the USAF buys/operates a dozen ITS vehicles) you could launch thousands of them in a day.\n\nThis fundamentally changes the strategic value of Mutually Assured Destruction. With space lift capacity like the ITS, you could preemptively mass produce the Brilliant Pebbles satellites, package them into a launch configuration, and have it sitting in storage waiting for short notice cargo integration. Sitting in a storage factory, it has nowhere near the diplomatic controversy of being in orbit, and could conceivably be kept a classified secret. When a diplomatic crisis blows up, and nuclear war begins to look likely, the President has the option to make the call, and within a few days has a large strategic anti-ballistic missile system in orbit. This gives rival powers very little time to respond with diplomacy or force.\n\nIt is for this reason that China and Russia will be working very hard to acquire their own reusable heavy lift launch capability like ITS, because not only does ITS render their commercial launch systems obsolete, it has the potential to render their entire strategic nuclear deterrent obsolete.\n\nThis is going to become a hot topic in international politics. If a single company/country has massive dominance of space launch, it upsets the strategic balance of power in the world and the stability of MAD between the Nuclear Powers. I expect that we may see an international treaty, like START, that will deal with the uncertainty and instability this brings. Perhaps an international treaty on military space launches, so no matter what the platform used to launch is, the nuclear powers each get a determined share of launch capacity. Eg: USAF contracts Space X to launch 1000 metric tons to orbit, Russia and China are given a proportional share of launch capacity in the same time frame. This would (theoretically) allow the major nuclear power to keep an even pace in their militarization of space rather than one power rushing ahead of the others while they try catchup causing strategic instability.\n\n\nOther potential military uses are orbital artillery. ITS makes the tungsten telephone pole from orbit a cost effective weapon. You could launch kinetic rod weapons to low orbit and have them hang out waiting for orders, when targeted fire their de-orbit boosters and now you have a very very effective non-nuclear weapon that can hit a surface target in only a few minutes from the order given. Numbers i've seen discussed had a ~20 ton metal pole being able to destroy bunkers hundreds of meters below the surface. Or if designed to split up into fragments before impact, ruin a tank battalions day.

It's just an inversion of the past where it was the military who developed space launch technology and civilian programs followed. Space technology has the potentially to profoundly affect strategic balance between earth nations, so they will seek to maintain their strategic security by expanding military operations to this new theater. ITS or vehicles copied/derived from ITS will be adapted for military use.\n\nEven without anyone building a single interceptor sat, this will be a political issue.\n\nBecause as spacelift capacity grows, particularly reusable lift, the potential arises for a nation to, on very short notice without warning, launch enough orbital munitions to deny space access to anyone they don't like. If there isn't a comprehensive treaty detailing inspections and reporting of cargos, it will cause a lot of paranoia by strategic planners worried that tomorrows scheduled 3 dozen launchers from USA could all just be fuel, raw material and station sections for commercial customers, or they could be packed full of weapon sats and suddenly no more space for you.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Military offset potential.

I believe the income forecast for the internet business was USD$30B, but this is essentially figuring that a really significant fraction of the world starts getting their internet from SpaceX at first-world prices, and that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "spacex", "name": "t1_dg89ja2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148021.0, "created_utc": 1492119221.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650j8b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650j8b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650j8b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8cym", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zucal", "parent_id": "t1_dg9jbr4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/spacex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Interns are paid.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interns are paid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "spacex", "name": "t1_dga8cym", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492256326.0, "created_utc": 1492227526.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9jbr4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BrucePerens", "parent_id": "t1_dg896k4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/spacex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "OK, but that might mean 5000 on the payroll rather than 6000.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, but that might mean 5000 on the payroll rather than 6000.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "spacex", "name": "t1_dg9jbr4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492223344.0, "created_utc": 1492194544.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg896k4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zucal", "parent_id": "t1_dg889lv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/spacex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The 6,000 number includes interns.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6,000 number includes interns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "spacex", "name": "t1_dg896k4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492147586.0, "created_utc": 1492118786.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650j8b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga90ce", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Intro24", "parent_id": "t1_dg889lv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/spacex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I think the financials aspect of the ITS presentation was definitely the weak point\n\nThis is exactly why I think the secret funding source is the US government.
