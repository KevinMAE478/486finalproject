If you are willing to delay the launch a few years, you can wait until the planets&amp;#39; positions are more convenient for quicker or higher velocity gravity assists. Having extra propellant for the initial burn might allow you to skip one of the gravity assists &amp;amp; save time, or to launch sooner instead of waiting for better planetary alignments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in reality, the &amp;quot;biggest&amp;quot; rover Falcon 9 can send to Pluto is a subjective thing. Theoretically Falcon 9 can launch quite a large payload to anywhere in the solar system, so long as there are no time limits &amp;amp; it has enough energy to reach the first gravity assist. The mass limit of your payload depends on the alignment of the planets when you launch, and how many years you are willing to spend doing skateboard tricks around the solar system. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "spacex", "name": "t1_dg79vh8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492096486.0, "created_utc": 1492067686.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 51}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650tg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650tg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2srow", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650tg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7escf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CapMSFC", "parent_id": "t1_dg72v50", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/spacex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It would have to be a really small rover/lander for the rocket equation to say yes.

Falcon Heavy is not the core money making business. It gets put on hold, when extra talent is needed to get Falcon 9 flying again. I would guess CRS-7 set FH development back at least 6 months, and AMOS-6 set it back another 6-9 months.
