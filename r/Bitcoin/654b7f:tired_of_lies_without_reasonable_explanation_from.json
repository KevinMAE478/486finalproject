This majority would consist of:\n\n* Bitcoin investors, or anyone who deliberately holds bitcoins instead of immediately selling them for fiat. In the event of a chain split, an investor will own coins on both sides of the split. They can sell the coins on the chain that they do not support in order to buy more coins on the chain that they do support. Doing this drives up the price on their favored chain, while driving the price on the other chain down. The more bitcoins an investor owns, the greater their contribution to the economic majority.\n\n* Bitcoin merchants, or anyone willing to accept bitcoins in exchange for goods, services, or other currencies. In the event of a chain split, a merchant can choose to accept as payment only coins from the chain that they support.

Some metrics are better than others.\n\n* Counting nodes is a low-quality (but not irrelevant) metric. Mostly you can conclude that if there are very few nodes supporting a proposal, then there is a lack of support. Few nodes opposing a proposal would indicate a lack of opposition. Many nodes supporting or opposing doesn't necessarily mean much either way though.\n\n* Statements from Bitcoin businesses are a better, but still somewhat fuzzy metric. You can weigh statements by the size of the businesses making them. You can also assume a certain level of agreement from their customers.\n\n* Futures markets, such as the BCC/BCU tokens on Bitfinex, are probably the best way to measure support. The market would pay out in whichever coin type you had bet on, once the proposal goes into effect.
