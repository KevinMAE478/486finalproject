We need to start this sooner than later if we have any hope of winning this battle. There are some *very* valid questions being posed in this thread by /u/BobAlison . It brings about the fact that there are currently many unanswered questions and that we need to satisfy these questions with a formal game plan.\n\nMost importantly, we need to act with unity on this issue or there will be wide spread chaos in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nI suggest that we use uasf.co as a or https://coin.dance/poli as a sounding board to lobby, but that we need \"rules\" to lobby for. We need industry leaders saying that they will support this measure, as well as define the circumstances, dates and times that they will no longer support the measure if we cannot reach industry consensus on the issue.\n\nThe good news is that the more support we get, the more risk that those who do not support it will absorb by accepting non-SW signaling blocks against a UASF. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea's on where we should move discussion for creating a game plan? Should we create a new subreddit, should we use Slack, IRC, or bitcointalk forums? We cannot do this unless we all agree to start, and then start sounding out idea's and slowly evolve into a solid game plan. But most importantly, we need **all of you**. Including all the wonderful people that I have forgotten to tag.\n\n/u/coblee has already stated [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/64jsw6/hi_im_mkwia_a_contributor_to_uasf_on_github_and_i/dg2znv3/)\n\n&gt;Coinbase doesn't have a position for UASF yet. I haven't talked to anyone at Coinbase about it. Don't expect Coinbase to have an official position anytime soon.\n\nBut we can change that if we put together a solid game plan and successfully lobby other economic actors to support the plan. The risk of a reorg against coinbases custodian holdings, as well as any other exchanges, is a very serious risk and the more people we have on board, the more likely they will support\u200b the plan, for the right economic reasons.", "edited": 1491965589.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/BobAlison\"&gt;/u/BobAlison&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/moral_agent\"&gt;/u/moral_agent&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/belcher_\"&gt;/u/belcher_&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/BashCo\"&gt;/u/BashCo&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/nopara73\"&gt;/u/nopara73&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/jonny1000\"&gt;/u/jonny1000&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/bitcoinreminder_com\"&gt;/u/bitcoinreminder_com&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/jratcliff63367\"&gt;/u/jratcliff63367&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/rhavar\"&gt;/u/rhavar&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/iwilcox\"&gt;/u/iwilcox&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/nullc\"&gt;/u/nullc&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/luke-jr\"&gt;/u/luke-jr&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/throckmortonsign\"&gt;/u/throckmortonsign&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/13057123841\"&gt;/u/13057123841&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/GratefulTony\"&gt;/u/GratefulTony&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/thieflar\"&gt;/u/thieflar&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/granatheus\"&gt;/u/granatheus&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/FrancisPouliot\"&gt;/u/FrancisPouliot&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/cpgilliard78\"&gt;/u/cpgilliard78&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/paleh0rse\"&gt;/u/paleh0rse&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/adam3us\"&gt;/u/adam3us&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/coblee\"&gt;/u/coblee&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/theymos\"&gt;/u/theymos&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/MeniRosenfeld\"&gt;/u/MeniRosenfeld&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/Natanael_L\"&gt;/u/Natanael_L&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"/u/shaolinfry\"&gt;/u/shaolinfry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think its time that we all work together as a community and properly brain storm and apply game theory to build a document that we can reach consensus on going forward.

We need to start this sooner than later if we have any hope of winning this battle. There are some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; valid questions being posed in this thread by &lt;a href=\"/u/BobAlison\"&gt;/u/BobAlison&lt;/a&gt; . It brings about the fact that there are currently many unanswered questions and that we need to satisfy these questions with a formal game plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we need to act with unity on this issue or there will be wide spread chaos in the bitcoin ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that we use uasf.co as a or &lt;a href=\"https://coin.dance/poli\"&gt;https://coin.dance/poli&lt;/a&gt; as a sounding board to lobby, but that we need &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; to lobby for. We need industry leaders saying that they will support this measure, as well as define the circumstances, dates and times that they will no longer support the measure if we cannot reach industry consensus on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the more support we get, the more risk that those who do not support it will absorb by accepting non-SW signaling blocks against a UASF. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any idea&amp;#39;s on where we should move discussion for creating a game plan? Should we create a new subreddit, should we use Slack, IRC, or bitcointalk forums? We cannot do this unless we all agree to start, and then start sounding out idea&amp;#39;s and slowly evolve into a solid game plan. But most importantly, we need &lt;strong&gt;all of you&lt;/strong&gt;. Including all the wonderful people that I have forgotten to tag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/coblee\"&gt;/u/coblee&lt;/a&gt; has already stated &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/64jsw6/hi_im_mkwia_a_contributor_to_uasf_on_github_and_i/dg2znv3/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Coinbase doesn&amp;#39;t have a position for UASF yet. I haven&amp;#39;t talked to anyone at Coinbase about it. Don&amp;#39;t expect Coinbase to have an official position anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can change that if we put together a solid game plan and successfully lobby other economic actors to support the plan. The risk of a reorg against coinbases custodian holdings, as well as any other exchanges, is a very serious risk and the more people we have on board, the more likely they will support\u200b the plan, for the right economic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg59xzl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491989892.0, "created_utc": 1491961092.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52qyv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "belcher_", "parent_id": "t1_dg4v59m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A UASF should only be attempted if the view of the economic majority is very clear and near-undeniable, otherwise it would be confusing as you point out.\n\nA general rule would be to ask the services you intend to trade with what their position on the different proposals will be.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UASF should only be attempted if the view of the economic majority is very clear and near-undeniable, otherwise it would be confusing as you point out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A general rule would be to ask the services you intend to trade with what their position on the different proposals will be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg52qyv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491980367.0, "created_utc": 1491951567.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4v59m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "modern_life_blues", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ltgx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "BobAlison still has a point: when the chain splits how will my little poor node know which chain to follow?
