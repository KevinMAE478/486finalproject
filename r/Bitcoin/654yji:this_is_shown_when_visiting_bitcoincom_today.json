Some of the Core developers are funded by Blockstream, and many are funded by other companies. Some aren't funded at all.\n\n&gt; is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with Satoshi's original white paper\n\nCore proposed Segregated Witness, which is the most promising improvement I'm aware of. It fixes many of the existing problems with the protocol, is a stop-gap effective blocksize increase, and paves the way for enormous scaling in the future.\n\n&gt; and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nThe efforts you are referring to are dangerous hard forks which make an already bad centralized mining problem much much worse.\n\n&gt; Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call \"a settlement layer\", defined by high fees, unreliable transactions, and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require third-party trust on top of the basic system.\n\nThis is nonsense. Core's plan is to keep the base layer as secure and decentralized as possible while allowing safe trustless almost-free offchain transactions to be layered on top of it. \"Scaling\" by simply making the blocks bigger whenever they get full isn't really scaling at all. Scaling implies increasing the throughput without correspondingly increasing the resource requirements. Making the blocks ever bigger isn't safe. Using off-chain solutions is clearly the better solution to the scaling problem.\n\n&gt; This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin's largest discussion forums\n\nThe development team doesn't have any control over discussion forums. The people who do have control for the most part don't want to see your dangerous anti-Bitcoin propaganda, and so disallow it from their forums. I don't have a problem with that. Go spread your lies elsewhere.\n\n&gt; along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core's current roadmap.\n\nHow do you \"ban\" a developer? Mike Hearn quit of his own free will. Gavin lost his commit privs after a year or so of inactivity but is still allowed to contribute to the project.\n\n&gt; After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core's tactics.\n\nPositive change is constantly coming from the Core project. Just check the release notes of any recent release. Huge amounts of work are ongoing, with real tangible improvements in every release. If it wasn't for big miner blocking of SegWit we would already have a much more functional Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; The following article cites a thorough history with specific examples of the rampant censorship on the \"r/bitcoin\" sub-reddit\n\nPromotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. Nobody denies that. Call it censorship if you like. I call it moderation.\n\n&gt; As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:\n&gt; By unsubscribing to /r/bitcoin, and subscribing to sub-reddit \\r\\btc you take a stand against censorship.\n\n\\r\\btc is a cesspoll of lies and hate. I lose several IQ posts each time I visit. No thanks.\n\n&gt; By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, or Bcoin, you are casting a vote against the current development team.\n\nBU is poorly developed and has already been found to have multiple critical bugs in its official releases.\n\n&gt; There are currently cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin.\n\nThey perform better than Bitcoin because they are mostly unused. If they ever gain widespread use they will face the same scaling problems that Bitcoin is currently facing.\n\n&gt; The single and only remaining quality that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies is first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo stop blocking progress. Get out of the way of the experts who understand the system.\n\n&gt; We encourage all members of the Bitcoin community to make their voices heard, and to stand up for what is right.\n\nI do.

Some aren&amp;#39;t funded at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with Satoshi&amp;#39;s original white paper&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Core proposed Segregated Witness, which is the most promising improvement I&amp;#39;m aware of. It fixes many of the existing problems with the protocol, is a stop-gap effective blocksize increase, and paves the way for enormous scaling in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin\u2019s most pressing problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The efforts you are referring to are dangerous hard forks which make an already bad centralized mining problem much much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call &amp;quot;a settlement layer&amp;quot;, defined by high fees, unreliable transactions, and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require third-party trust on top of the basic system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is nonsense. Core&amp;#39;s plan is to keep the base layer as secure and decentralized as possible while allowing safe trustless almost-free offchain transactions to be layered on top of it. &amp;quot;Scaling&amp;quot; by simply making the blocks bigger whenever they get full isn&amp;#39;t really scaling at all. Scaling implies increasing the throughput without correspondingly increasing the resource requirements. Making the blocks ever bigger isn&amp;#39;t safe. Using off-chain solutions is clearly the better solution to the scaling problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin&amp;#39;s largest discussion forums&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The development team doesn&amp;#39;t have any control over discussion forums. The people who do have control for the most part don&amp;#39;t want to see your dangerous anti-Bitcoin propaganda, and so disallow it from their forums. I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with that. Go spread your lies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core&amp;#39;s current roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you &amp;quot;ban&amp;quot; a developer? Mike Hearn quit of his own free will. Gavin lost his commit privs after a year or so of inactivity but is still allowed to contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core&amp;#39;s tactics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Positive change is constantly coming from the Core project. Just check the release notes of any recent release. Huge amounts of work are ongoing, with real tangible improvements in every release. If it wasn&amp;#39;t for big miner blocking of SegWit we would already have a much more functional Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following article cites a thorough history with specific examples of the rampant censorship on the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoin\"&gt;r/bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; sub-reddit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. Nobody denies that. Call it censorship if you like. I call it moderation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:\nBy unsubscribing to &lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoin\"&gt;/r/bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, and subscribing to sub-reddit \\r\\btc you take a stand against censorship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\btc is a cesspoll of lies and hate. I lose several IQ posts each time I visit. No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, or Bcoin, you are casting a vote against the current development team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BU is poorly developed and has already been found to have multiple critical bugs in its official releases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are currently cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They perform better than Bitcoin because they are mostly unused. If they ever gain widespread use they will face the same scaling problems that Bitcoin is currently facing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The single and only remaining quality that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies is first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So stop blocking progress. Get out of the way of the experts who understand the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We encourage all members of the Bitcoin community to make their voices heard, and to stand up for what is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do.

Here's what you need to know:\n\nBitcoin transactions aren't secured until they are in a block. On average a block is found every 10 minutes, so even if you pay a priority fee to get included ASAP there's still a waiting period that's not convenient. Some people think zero-confirmation transactions are an acceptable risk for most uses but there's still a risk involved.\n\nOn the other hand, 2nd layer solutions only have this kind of a waiting period for the opening of a payment channel, after that, every transaction is as instant as sending an IM, completely secured without any third party trust involved. And better yet, when people have multiple channels open they can relay transactions, which means that a network can be created to send payments to anyone who is on the network without needing a direct channel.\n\nHow? Well, I'm still reading up on the exact cryptographic details myself, but the idea is that using so-called \"smart contracts\", you hand eachother the ability to punish eachother for being unfair. We both have an amount of Bitcoin \"tied up\" in the channel; if either of us breaches the contract and tries to cheat the other, the other gets to claim all of the Bitcoins in the channel, so we are both incentivized to be honest.\n\nUsing this system, we can send eachother payments by sending \"promises\" of how the Bitcoins tied up in the channel will be redistributed between us if/when we decide to close the channel, and sending \"promises\" that we won't use the previous (now invalid) \"promise\". If at any point you try to claim a previous (now invalid) state is the currently valid one and try to steal coins from me by closing the channel in an unfair way, I can use the cryptographic evidence of your promise invalidation to claim all the Bitcoins in the channel. These promises are exchanged off-chain, so they don't have to wait to be included in a block, but are still effectively fully functional as transactions because of the mechanisms of invalidating the previous states.\n\nThere's also benefits to privacy; as you might know in Bitcoin all transactions are fundamentally public as they are recorded in the blockchain. They aren't tied to your name or anything, but they can still be traced, are subject to statistical analysis etc. In the Lightning Network they have implemented onion routing of payments which means that every payment node in the network between me and you (assuming no direct channel between us) only knows who they are receiving coins from and to whom they pass them, but have no information about the origin or final destination of those coins.\n\nHopefully this wasn't too rambling of an answer for you ;)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, you don&amp;#39;t need to understand the intricacies of the technical aspects of Bitcoin to use it, in the same way that you won&amp;#39;t need to understand the intricacies of things like Lightning Network to use it.
