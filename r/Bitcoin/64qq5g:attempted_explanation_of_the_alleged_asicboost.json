SHA256, which is the hashing algorithm used for Bitcoin's proof of work, splits the data into 64 byte chunks before computations occur.   The Bitcoin block header is 80 bytes and therefore there are two chunks.  The ASICBOOST methodology involves keeping the value of one of the chunks the same, for multiple hashing attempts, thereby reducing the work required by only partially doing the work for this chunk, for multiple hashing attempts.\n\n**\u201dNormal Hashing\u201d**\n\nThe miner varies the 4 byte nonce (in the block header) for each hashing attempt.  Once all the nonces have been exhausted, the extra nonce (in the coinbase transaction) is altered to provide more entropy.  Changing the coinbase transaction changes the Merkle root hash, which impacts both chunk 1 and chunk 2, such that work is required on each chunk.\n\n\n**Overt ASICBOOST**\n\nUsing this methodology, instead of changing the extra nonce the miner alters the 4 byte version bits in the block header instead.  This means chunk 2 remains unchanged for multiple hashing attempts and work is therefore saved.\n\n**Covert ASICBOOST**\n\nThe aim here is to keep the last 4 bytes of the Merkle root hash the same, while generating entropy by changing the first 28 bytes.  Therefore chunk 2 remains unchanged for multiple hashing attempts, and work is saved.  This means additional work must be done on the Merkle tree to find collisions for the last 4 bytes.  In order to find one such a collision the square root of 2^32 attempts are expected to be required (due to the \u201cbirthday paradox\u201d), this is 65,536 attempts.  (4 collisions is also an option)  Each attempt would require changing the extra nonce, however due to the structure of the Merkle tree, this would require an additional hash for each row of the Merkle tree.  For a large Bitcoin block, with perhaps 10 or more rows, this is a lot of work and therefore this is an inefficient process.  The following methodologies may make this process more efficient.\n\n* Option 1 \u2013 Produce empty or smaller blocks.  This simply reduces the size of the Merkle tree and therefore fewer hashing operations are required to generate a different Merkle root hash.  The extra nonce can therefore be varied in the normal way to produce more Merkle root hashes\n\n* Option 2 \u2013 Shuffling the branches of the right hand side of the Merkle tree.  An illustration of this is provided in the red circles in the explanatory image.  By shuffling the top of the right hand side of the Merkle tree, a new Merkle root hash is generated, by only doing 2 extra hashes, regardless of the size of the Merkle tree. (This may be possible, but there could be restrictions preventing such shuffling)\n\n* Option 3 \u2013 Shuffling the position of transactions on the right hand side of the tree, or swapping transactions\n\n(The above methodologies could be combined)\n\n**The impact of the Segregated Witness upgrade proposal**\n\nAs shown in blue in the explanatory image, the Segregated Witness proposal gives the miner the option (if they want to use SegWit) of adding a 2nd Merkle tree, with the Merkle root hash of this tree inside the coinbase transaction.  This 2nd Merkle tree is required to have the same structure as the main Merkle tree, the difference is that transaction inputs redeemed by segregating the witness,  have their signature in the 2nd Merkle tree (as well as the other transaction data), while only the version, inputs, outputs and locktime of the transactions remain in the main Merkle tree.

Therefore any efficiency gains from option 2 or option 3 above, are lost, and covert ASICBOOST becomes inefficient.  However, a miner could still do covert ASICBOOST, but only by either using option 1 or not including the witness commitment.  Doing either of these things, too often, may be suspicious.\n\n\n**Alleged evidence Antpool is doing covert ASICBOOST**\n\n* Antpool produces a much higher proportion of empty or smaller blocks than its mining peers (evidence of option 1)\n\n* The ability to do ASICBOOST is built inside Bitmain's products, this has been available for over a year and may be costly to include.  One could argue that cost would be wasted if ASICBOOST is not used.  However, this evidence does not point to **covert** ASICBOOST in particular, as far as I know\n\n* The **circumstantial evidence** is that this may be an explanation for Bitmain's desire to prevent SegWit being activated on Bitcoin (and even Litecoin)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "64qq5g", "gilded": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 154, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jonny1000", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64qq5g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Bitcoin", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/zKaVCapUi-AnvDneD0rAaiPWUWS4lqxSaEzEo30nZZ4.png?s=5950490acf9aca9a935a1cf7f10e3e51", "width": 1028, "height": 891}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/zKaVCapUi-AnvDneD0rAaiPWUWS4lqxSaEzEo30nZZ4.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=b6169e505371f993441d01a20dd44635", "width": 108, "height": 93}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/zKaVCapUi-AnvDneD0rAaiPWUWS4lqxSaEzEo30nZZ4.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=7213a2c30f903e390410665790a2e4d9", "width": 216, "height": 187}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/zKaVCapUi-AnvDneD0rAaiPWUWS4lqxSaEzEo30nZZ4.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=1de83aef370d33c7b6181bcc1cabc521", "width": 320, "height": 277}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/zKaVCapUi-AnvDneD0rAaiPWUWS4lqxSaEzEo30nZZ4.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=26d463089ebf56332974866b2ff88385", "width": 640, "height": 554}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/zKaVCapUi-AnvDneD0rAaiPWUWS4lqxSaEzEo30nZZ4.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=a6ef05ab83008cfe4b4dd7bb0fa00b2d", "width": 960, "height": 832}], "variants": {}, "id": "oT3XJdYe0yxf0Zfa23aqy8ZqTvZvgS2yynvsQR0Uq4k"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "edited": 1491924187.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/64qq5g/attempted_explanation_of_the_alleged_asicboost/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945203.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/64qq5g/attempted_explanation_of_the_alleged_asicboost/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Attempted explanation of the alleged ASICBOOST issue", "created_utc": 1491916403.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 107, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 154}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq5g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq5g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq5g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4jpqc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wachtwoord33", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fspy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg4jpqc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958696.0, "created_utc": 1491929896.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4fspy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "harda", "parent_id": "t1_dg4dgdk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Correct.

You don&amp;#39;t have to power that equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if your factory is ASICBOOST only, then you can just remove the part of the assembly line that isn&amp;#39;t used.  So the assembly lines are shorter.  They still run at the same speed, but they&amp;#39;re shorter and take up less space.  Since your factory is a fixed size, you decide &amp;quot;well, I&amp;#39;m saving all this space ... let&amp;#39;s add more assembly lines.&amp;quot;  If you had 100 assembly lines before, you were producing 1000 widgets per minute.  With the smaller assembly lines, you now fit 115 assembly lines.  That&amp;#39;s 1,150 widgets per minutes.  150 widgets more per second!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your factory &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, what if you needed to hide the fact that you use ASICBOOST?  You want it so your factory can work like a normal factory whenever the inspectors come.  So you can&amp;#39;t use your shorter assembly lines, you gotta keep the normal assembly lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, when the inspectors aren&amp;#39;t around, you can optimize your assembly lines.  Turn off the parts you can skip, and get the power savings.  However, since you haven&amp;#39;t added any assembly lines to your factor (you can&amp;#39;t, the assembly lines are the same size) you end up at the same widgets per minute as before (1,000).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitmain&amp;#39;s chips work in non-ASICBOOST mode for their customers (at least).  That means they need the ability to run the whole assembly line, so they can&amp;#39;t take advantage of any space savings that would result in an increased hashrate (per chip).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The popular theory is that Bitmain is, however, using ASICBOOST when they use the chips in their own farms.  So they get the power savings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg4h9hq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956028.0, "created_utc": 1491927228.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4h2yd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "harda", "parent_id": "t1_dg4g6kj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In software, your code gets compiled into a list of instructions that get executed in sequence by your CPU---one instruction per cycle---so removing code (instructions) results in overall faster operation.\n\nIn hardware, you print all the instructions directly on the chip, so each cycle completes the entire \"program\".

Maybe they're naively thinking Bitmain's chips contain both ASICBOOST-only cores and non-ASICBOOST cores.  That would definitely increase cost by 25-50%.  But that's not necessary.  They can just adjust the architecture and lay some logic on top to get option #2 without having two kinds of cores.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day, it's not about increased chip cost for Bitmain.

Probably 15%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know who or why people are saying the current chips, which are option #2, would cost 25-50% more.  Maybe they&amp;#39;re naively thinking Bitmain&amp;#39;s chips contain both ASICBOOST-only cores and non-ASICBOOST cores.  That would definitely increase cost by 25-50%.  But that&amp;#39;s not necessary.  They can just adjust the architecture and lay some logic on top to get option #2 without having two kinds of cores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s not about increased chip cost for Bitmain.
