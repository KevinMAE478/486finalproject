It&amp;#39;s frankly bizarre, and nobody has explained convincingly how it would lead to bigger blocks unless a majority is colluding (which we normally want to avoid). Even if it did, we know enough about the protocol characteristics to realize the value is a tradeoff, primarily against validation time, that merits rigorous study, not testing in production until it crashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in the best case where the colluding miners are all benevolent and everyone plays nice and decides not to exploit the situation, transactions would take a very long time to go through. Nobody knows how long, only that its way more than the current 6 confirmations. So even if it doesn&amp;#39;t crash, it would be less useful and the exchange value would suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a single user asked for any of this. (Except for one or two famous people on Twitter, who wants both this and zero-conf transactions. Too bad the wishes must at least make logical sense in the real world.) Users want that no one double spends their transactions. Users want no downtime. Users want more capactity and cheaper transactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an endless amount of practical reasons why miners should not design the protocol and its rules. No matter if 38 or even 99% of miners want the change, that doesn&amp;#39;t matter. They should go through the same peer review as everyone else. And anything that threatens end user funds or transaction integrity should be rightfully vetoed straight away. This is real people and real money we&amp;#39;re playing with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg6fzha", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055498.0, "created_utc": 1492026698.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xvge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xvge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xvge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xvge", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg78g3c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BitttBurger", "parent_id": "t1_dg777j2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If I had a dollar for every time someone in this sub proudly declared that \"non-technical\" people's input is not only irrelevant but unwelcome, I would be rich AF.
