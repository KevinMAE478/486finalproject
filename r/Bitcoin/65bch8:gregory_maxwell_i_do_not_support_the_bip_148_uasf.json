", "edited": 1492213876.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really boggles me is that people demand a faster upgrade cadence than is achieved for systems which are far easier to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent almost a decade at Juniper Networks-- Juniper has a multiple billion dollar a year revenue making big routers and switching equipment, the stuff that drives many ISPs backbones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Major system upgrades often had a life cycle that goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) New functionality is designed conceptually; this might be mere months if its customer local functionality or &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; if it&amp;#39;s a big protocol extension that impacts interoperability. (*)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The software is developed in a pipeline that has a length of 6 months to a year (depending on how major the feature is), with extensive verification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) A new major release is shipped to customers. Customers load it up in their own verification labs, and perform months of testing, sometimes requiring one more more additional fixes before they could deploy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Roll-out in a customer network might then take a month, and is done in phases splitting redundant system allowing an ultra-fast rollback if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The network deployments are centralized and can be rolled back, they always happen on a network by network basis or more fined grained. Internet wide synchronous upgrades &lt;em&gt;NEVER&lt;/em&gt; happen, and the few thing that even arguably come close to that (e.g. 32bit ASNs (**)) have caused massive outages. By contrast Bitcoin is highly distributed and any mechanism that could make everyone update at once could be exploited to hurt its security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The changes made on backbone routers were usually strictly simpler than changes to Bitcoin because they don&amp;#39;t run into complex security-critical incentives and game theory interactions and because whatever disruption they caused could always be undone where some kinds of bitcoin failures result in unrecoverable losses much worse than an outage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The funding for the development even in a &lt;em&gt;single vendor&lt;/em&gt; was orders of magnitude higher than we have today in Bitcoin.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And still some people seem to think that major changes should happen at a substantially lower latency.  I think this is absurd.  I can only explain it with the observation that people who have not been directly involved with developing and maintaining critical infrastructure only ever see the final steps, which make it look much faster than it actually is...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(*) For example, the specific proposal to extend ASN space to 4 bytes &lt;a href=\"http://smakd.potaroo.net/ietf/all-ids/draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-00.txt\"&gt;began in 2001&lt;/a&gt; (and, of course, there was a lot of discussion before then that lead up to that proposal), it didn&amp;#39;t become an RFC &lt;a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4893\"&gt;until 2007&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn&amp;#39;t supported in Juniper (who employed one of the proposals&amp;#39; authors) systems until May 2008, and wasn&amp;#39;t really widely deployed until ~2012 or so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(**) This change to BGP was essentially a soft-fork but complex corner conditions meant that with buggy or adversarial messages it was &lt;a href=\"https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2009-January/006925.html\"&gt;accidentally a hard-fork&lt;/a&gt; which caused some pretty substantial outages in 2009, and required a revision of the specification to make it actually backwards compatible.  A hard-fork in BGP is still significantly less of an issue than one in Bitcoin because because BGP doesn&amp;#39;t achieve nor try to achieve complete global consistency like Bitcoin does. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg9xfam", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241039.0, "created_utc": 1492212239.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9r2lf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SkyMarshal", "parent_id": "t1_dg93jtr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, mission critical infrastructure systems engineering like that probably has multiple examples.

If Bitcoin is to fail due to mining centralization, I would rather it happen earlier than later.  Delaying the battle does not make it go away.  If we need to change POW, we need to learn how to do this while the community is smaller rather than larger.  It&amp;#39;s similar to getting Chicken Pox as a kid vs. an adult.  You can avoid the risk and maybe you never get it, but much better to catch it young and build an immunity and become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg95y9f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207466.0, "created_utc": 1492178666.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bch8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93h96", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NigelClutterbuck", "parent_id": "t3_65bch8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Waiting it out and letting other initiatives like BU fail miserably might be the best strategy at this point, even though it is risky.\n\nToo bad the \"beta testers\" have decided to stall further development of the technology in such a non visionary way\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting it out and letting other initiatives like BU fail miserably might be the best strategy at this point, even though it is risky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad the &amp;quot;beta testers&amp;quot; have decided to stall further development of the technology in such a non visionary way&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg93h96", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203639.0, "created_utc": 1492174839.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bch8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94bff", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bitheyho", "parent_id": "t3_65bch8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the question is, how can we push bip148 harder without gregory maxwell?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the question is, how can we push bip148 harder without gregory maxwell?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dg94bff", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492205046.0, "created_utc": 1492176246.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bch8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9gpuz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PGerbil", "parent_id": "t3_65bch8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for another great contribution u/nullc !
