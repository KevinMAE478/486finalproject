Removing files is generally always best avoided and can lead to lots of problems if not done very carefully. Time and time again have developers got this wrong and caused deletion of other files/data. This is why you should always try to avoid removing files where possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t like it - don&amp;#39;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This reddit post is just that - people don&amp;#39;t like it, they are spreading why they don&amp;#39;t like it, and they are choosing not to use it. You can either take this feedback, learn from it, and improve the situation, or you can loose a bunch of users and damage your reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the most effective way. I just thought it would be fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m seeing that a lot in your responses, you seem to act like your code (and the peoples computers you are running it on) are some sort of game. Delete data from peoples computer, arbitrary code execution, no problem! It&amp;#39;s the type of mentality I expect to see from children/teenagers and not a grown adult. This kind of behaviour will only serve to damage your reputation. You should probably sort it out unless this is how you want people to see you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because I know of no alternative. If you do, I would like to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no need to use remote code execution. If you have problems, ask the internet. Code things the right way not the wrong way. This kind of thing can go extremely, horribly wrong. You should disable remote code execution, and any features that require it for the time being. Even if you aren&amp;#39;t abusing it yourself, it makes your server a target for attack, and puts your users at risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dgdpe9a", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475123.0, "created_utc": 1492446323.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdijiu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "therico666", "parent_id": "t1_dgdhl5r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; 1.)
