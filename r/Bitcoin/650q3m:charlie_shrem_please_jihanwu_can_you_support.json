It really makes me smile to know that you (and others like you) are willing to put in the legwork like that.\n\nI especially think it's prudent of you to hold off on pushing this proposal until November (a lot can change in Bitcoin in 6-8 months, after all). \n\nI don't have much commentary to input on the specifics of the proposal, though. I think the idea of a gradual blockweight calculation change is an interesting idea, but it also seems like it might be tricky to get consensus on, if for no other reason than complexity. I wish I had better advice or input to provide, but alas, nothing springs to mind.\n\nAs for the political/social traction (or lack thereof), I think it might be in large part due to the \"burnout\" that the developers probably generally feel, at this point, with regards to the scaling wars. There are many other interesting components of Bitcoin development that have (sadly enough) not received as much attention as the problem of \"how to increase capacity intelligently\", and it seems like so many people (from those who have never programmed even the simplest of programs, to the most qualified engineers in the space) have offered so much input that the topic is, in a word, *overloaded* by now. Again, sorry that you haven't gotten much attention or assistance (so far), but I think it's probably healthy to keep in mind some of the social reasons that might be the case.
