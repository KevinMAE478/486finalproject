I must say it was quite a good game like the rest but it sure was different. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of things I have to get used to was the inability to crawl. I was dumbfounded. Why did they take that out? Eh, I lived but damn! I missed that. But probably the biggest obstacle I had to overcome was the inability to aim in first-person. THAT was my biggest hurdle. I&amp;#39;ve grown so used to that with the other games. I was able to get used to it and I was still able to get a lot of headshots but I was nowhere near as accurate. But, as I quickly adapted I took account the lack of accurate aiming and the timing of the tranquilizers to move as I needed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the hub world system of the game with Mother Base. I always did like elements like recruiting soldiers and growing them etc, though it&amp;#39;s always a challenge at first. The new item system was a challenge. I was so used to having every item available though it was fun to prepare. But it came with its own problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boss battles were definitely a lot more challenging than the other boss in the other games.  The AI Weapons and the vehicles were a bit tedious. But the AI Weapons were a bit easier where I hated the fights with the tank and the chopper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the difficulty of those fights for me came after I beat Peace Walker and it  because of the limited item stock. The supply markers did help but when I tried to beat the AI weapons and the vehicles the second time, even they didn&amp;#39;t help. The tank battle just lasted on and on to the point where it seemed like it wouldn&amp;#39;t end and I quickly running out of everything and the same with the AI weapons. If I wasn&amp;#39;t forced to retreat because I ran out of everything, I was being nailed constantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially with the tank battle...that one still makes me feel bad....getting nailed at such a long range. Especially with the game not pausing when to you open the item and weapon menus and the commander still not appearing after damaging it with everything I had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, after so many attempts I gave up and looked up the prologue and the fight with Metal Gear ZEKE on youtube. I know I know, I probably gave up too quickly but I felt beaten senseless. \nThe story was interesting. I felt like I was learning about the Costa Rica and Nicaragua&amp;#39;s involvement during the Cold War while playing. Though it was challenging to grasp it all but that&amp;#39;s a given with the series as a whole. I understood Coldman&amp;#39;s deterrence theory and I believe that was a fool&amp;#39;s dream.  But I don&amp;#39;t want to get political. Coldman, overall, was a sick and hearing he was the one behind Operation Snake Eater made me hate him more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cecil was adorable(seriously, damn! She was pretty). Chico was amusing with his fantasies of hunting cryptids and other mythical creatures. I found his desire to help the Sandinistas take back his homeland admirable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amanda was also really pretty but I respected her as a soldier overall and I like how the game showed that even though she was a soldier leading the Sandinistas, she was also human and had her doubts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paz was really pretty but there a few things that made me think &amp;quot;What the hell, Kojima?&amp;quot; Like when you first meet her in the beginning and you&amp;#39;re able to zoom in on her during ght the cut scene and see past her clothes to her underwear. And the mission where you take her on a &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; and you end the mission by hiding under a box and having Paz come in with you.....seriously there&amp;#39;s tongue-in-cheek and then there&amp;#39;s that and THAT is just wrong. The girl is under aged ! And why was she in her underwear when she took over Metal Gear ZEKE? Why? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Anyway, I also liked StrangeLove but one thing I find about her that&amp;#39;s especially crazy is the concept of AIs and intelligent as the ones in Peace Walker existing during the 1970s! I mean damn! Computers and Computer Science was only in its infancy back during the 1970s and I doubt the concept of AIs was even a thought and StrangeLove already had weapons with AI intelligence? That&amp;#39;s fucking insane! And I loved it. Her dedication to the Boss was admirable but I found it funny that Big Boss just can&amp;#39;t seem to not get into a situation where he&amp;#39;s tortured with electricity. And I found the budding romance between her and Huey cute. And it was great seeing Hal&amp;#39;s father. But given what happened to Hal&amp;#39;s parents in MGS II, I wonder what caused StrangeLove and Huey to split.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the game was fun and definitely different conpared to the other games. Though there are two things bothering me. First, it becomes clear that Paz was sent by Cipher to infiltrate the MSF in order to get them to join Cipher as their own deterrent force and she was using Zadornov as a distraction for her to get close to ZEKE. But I doubt she planned for ZEKE to be developed, did she? Perhaps she just decided to use it as part of her plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;ve asked this before. But Portable Ops&amp;#39; canon status still bothers me. Going from from Snake Eater to Peace Walker seems kind of abrupt. Portable Ops shows how Big Boss obtained the means to create his PMC but from what I heard, Konami and Kojima don&amp;#39;t acknowledge it and it&amp;#39;s status as canon is ambiguous. With that said, if Portable Ops turns out to not be canon at all, then there&amp;#39;s a hole in the form of how Big Boss created the MSF plus it would make Kazuhira mentioning what happened in San Gieryonimo confusing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which: &amp;quot;Kojima is God! Kojima is God!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think you&amp;#39;re clever don&amp;#39;t you, Hideo?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I beat Peace Walker back last month after taking a break from Metal Gear Solid to return to some other games.

If you destroy any parts on it in that mission you just have to grind the boss battles again for those parts. You can&amp;#39;t get them all in one go. You have to repeatedly do the missions over and over again, destroying or not destroying parts you want to keep. For some bosses it&amp;#39;s pretty difficult to not hit parts you&amp;#39;re trying to get. Like Chrysalis almost comes down to dumb luck for getting its main weapon since Stingers and rockets tend to hit it and not just the pod. There&amp;#39;s also an element of randomness to what parts and boards drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend grinding S staff in missions where they spawn to develop high-grade rockets and AP machineguns before bothering with the boss grind.
