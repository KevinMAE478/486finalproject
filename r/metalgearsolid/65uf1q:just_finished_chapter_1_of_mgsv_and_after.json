He was bossy, paranoid, repetitive, grumpy, didn&amp;#39;t want me to do anything I wanted to do. Ocelot on the other hand, went from being annoying in Snake Eater to a badass gun-slinging Western hero who swoops in and saves you on his horse, then tells you to do everything that Kaz doesn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This really became obvious after I met Quiet and didn&amp;#39;t kill her.

He plays it like a game, he&amp;#39;s cool, touch, sly, everything Naked Snake was. He built himself up around pre-MSF Big Boss, and his opinion reflects that. You weren&amp;#39;t as damaged as Kaz was between games since you were in a coma, so your opinion usually leans towards Ocelot.

I know who he is so that won&amp;#39;t be spoiled but going from Big Boss where the DD staff thank you for knocking them out to this kid who tries to kill you when you first meet him. He refuses your hand twice, once on the floor and twice at the base.
