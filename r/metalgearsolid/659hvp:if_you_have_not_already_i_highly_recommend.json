When you become okay with one morally repugnant action, it isn't long before you can justify some truly evil stuff.  I maintain that TPSP is up there, but that's ultimately subjective.  I view it as evil because it takes a certain amount of evil to rationalize erasing a man from human memory and taking credit for their actions.  It's basic face value stuff.  Venom Snake existed, sure, but for a man who accomplished as much as he did, the only one anyone will ever remember is Big Boss.  It was another parallel between Venom Snake and Skull Face, because just before he died, Skull Face expressed the exact same concern, that Cipher would do the same to him, which they did, because Skull Face is never so much as mentioned again in any other game, for both practical reasons (he didn't exist yet), and story reasons that fit into things (Cipher altered whatever information they could about his actions).\n\n\nLetting The Phantom Snake Program makes Big Boss a massive hypocrite, yes.  Convincing Venom Snake to 'keep the dream alive' after the fact is another nail in the hypocritical coffin.  But it's not just passively letting the program happen, it's what it took to ensure it happened.  Which required passively letting hundreds of people die despite knowing well in advance from Ocelot that an attack from both XOF AND The Man on Fire was imminent, and the reason was specifically so they'd be used as a human shield between Venom Snake, Big Boss, and their enemies.  That's the part a lot of people don't immediately address.  When you have knowledge that lives are in danger, you have a responsibility to intervene.  Many would argue that keeping silent is just as bad as pulling the trigger yourself, because Big Boss all but ensured it happened by staying quiet.  Venom Snake NEEDED to be the target, for both XOF and The Man on Fire, and seeing him actively escape was essential to painting the bullseye on the back of his head, no matter how many people in that Hospital had to die in the process.\n\n\nWe can talk gray areas all we like, but there is nothing gray about passively letting hundreds of people die when you know an attack is coming, and bloodshed can be prevented.\n\n\nTo a lesser extent, it also required abandoning everyone who believed in Big Boss and the dream of Outer Heaven, but at least, their lives, he put in the capable hands of his Phantom.  Those in Cyprus?  They were expendable apparently.  And that isn't okay.  It's cowardly and wrong.\n\n\n&gt;the phantom snake program was conceived and initiated by zero while big boss was in a coma. So by that metric, if zero isn't a true villain and the phantom snake program is the worst thing big boss did up until that point then neither is he a villain. You can't have this both ways.\n\nZero being sympathetic doesn't make him not the villain.  It makes him, like Big Boss, misguided.  Because at the end of the day, both men don't consider themselves evil.  The best villains are the heroes of their own story, and both believed their actions were for some form of greater good.  Zero's stranglehold over information and the truth was conceived out of the idea that it was for mankind's own good.  Big Boss' nation of soldiers was conceived by the notion that fighting is what gave soldiers purpose, and a nation of soldiers was the only way soldiers could truly be free and alive.\n\n\nAnd at the end of the day, both their dreams came at the expense of others.  Zero's system eventually turned war into a business.  And Big Boss eventually became a war monger, because to him, war was life.\n\n\nThey may both have justifications for their actions, but at the end of the day, they're both still villains.  That's one thing I disagree with the author about, because Zero may be sympathetic, but he's still in the wrong.\n\n&gt;The idea of big boss as some sort of absolute evil in black and white terms just does not fit with kojimas carefully constructed narrative painted with so many shades of grey. \n\nKojima's narrative in this series is many things, carefully constructed is absolutely not one of them.  He said so himself, he goes with the flow.  Which isn't a bad thing, but it also means you have a canon that you can't always take at face value, because the finite details are typically lost in translation for the sake of whatever comes next.\n\n\nIf it wasn't, we wouldn't have had MGS3 or the entire Big Boss trilogy to begin with, because it's kind of hard to rationalize or humanize a character whom, if MG2 was to be taken at any kind of face value, WAS an irredeemable monster with an insane mindset, whom, as Snake put it, \"NEEDED to die.\"\n\n\n&gt;It's reductionist and utterly ignorant of the nuance of the character and the message overall. It's also a highly unoriginal argument that really doesn't hold up to any real scrutiny.\n\n\nBut is it really?  At the end of the day, Big Boss is a man who profits from war.  A lot of his staff members were prisoners, however comical their balloon related captures were.  He actively let children work within MSF.  He considered putting down the gun an act of betrayal and outside said he and his men would be terrorists who may have to do horrible things to ensure they survived against the Times.  He harbored a nuclear warhead, had a means to launch it, and maintained zero oversight from any governing body or nation of people, and then going out of his way to LIE to the U.N. and the rest of the world (or so he thought) about the existence of said nuke and Metal Gear.  He would then one day become a man who nearly brought the world to ruin.\n\n\nHis upbringing may have been sympathetic, and it may perfectly justify his disillusionment in his government.  But that sympathy wavers when Big Boss starts doing and saying some pretty questionable things.  We root for him because he's our protagonist.  Because he's a goofball who grumbles like an adorably pouty child because someone said Santa Claus didn't exist.  And simply put, because he's very likable, arguably more so than Solid Snake.  But it's because we like him that we don't notice these things happening right in front of our noses.  Big Boss' descent wasn't brought about from any kind of downfall or point of no return.  It was brought about through power, and power corrupted him.  If it didn't, he wouldn't still be holding onto a nuke one year after he said he and his guys would just hold onto it until they could dismantle it.  Nor would he be arrogant enough to think he could stand against the times, or justify potential terrorism to do so, as noted by the end of PW.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry, you're free to disagree but I was just pointing out a flaw in the authors argument.\n\nI don't see why you would apologize here.  This is merely a discussion between two people with different opinions.  There's nothing wrong with that, right?\n\n&gt;The whole 'fall of big boss' narrative we saw in previous and trailers was misdirection. \n\nIt was, and it wasn't.  It was because MGSV's trailers were still Kojima trailers, and they're ALL full of misdirection.  And because there was no fall of Big Boss, because Big Boss had already fallen by that point.  \n\n\nI say it wasn't because it WAS a moral falling.  A necessary one to demonstrate just what sort of things Big Boss was capable of allowing to happen for the sake of withstanding the times trying to erase him.  In this case, letting a man be robbed of his identity, dumping ALL of his problems onto him, and then letting an entire hospital full of people die to ensure all that happened so he wouldn't have to fight his own fight, is a pretty big moral falling from any metric.\n\n&gt;if you bother to pay attention to big bosses monologue at the end of 4 you know he was never the monster he was made out to be and never had the expectation that mgsv would turn him into one. \n\nBut that's Big Boss saying all this.  It's Big Boss who makes the claim that he was just misunderstood.  Without MGSV, I used to take that at face value that, somehow, Kojima completely back pedaled from the character he initially created in 1987, and wanted to make him a misunderstood anti-hero.  I didn't like that, but I accepted it.  But after MGSV, I can't take that end speech at face value anymore.  \n\n\nBig Boss might feel regret for his actions, but the fact remains, they still happened because of him, and the world at large is better off with him dead.  It's also highlighted by the fact that, to his dying breath, Big Boss never revealed the truth that his legend wasn't his to take credit for, but another man who all but sacrificed his entirety to elevate Big Boss into this Mercenary Jesus figure that the black ops world regarded him as.\n\n\nOf course, when MGS4 was conceived and written, Venom Snake didn't exist, but Kojima wrote him very specifically to exist and then be erased by the very man for whom he was created to protect.  Zero may have created Venom Snake, but Big Boss was still within his powers to make Venom Snake whole, to fight his own fights, and then, to not take credit for everything Venom Snake did.\n\n\nHis final monologue may have airs of truth to it at the end of MGS4, but it only solidifies the fact that Big Boss was a narcissistic, hypocritical butt hole.\n\n\nI'm not basing any of this off of his trailers.  Kojima's trailers always make a story or plot look better or more profound than it ever is.  But MGSV is part of the full picture now, and that means Big Boss isn't as misunderstood as he'd have you believe.  It's not that he's directly lying, because he believes what he says to Snake in those final moments, but he's omitting so much, and only looking at this war between him and Zero from a very filtered viewpoint, which leaves out a lot of those details that make it harder to rationalize or justify this war he started, regardless of the reasons.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At BEST you&amp;#39;re making a case for why big boss was a hypocrite, not how the phantom snake program makes him an irredeemable monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all a snowball effect.  When you become okay with one morally repugnant action, it isn&amp;#39;t long before you can justify some truly evil stuff.  I maintain that TPSP is up there, but that&amp;#39;s ultimately subjective.  I view it as evil because it takes a certain amount of evil to rationalize erasing a man from human memory and taking credit for their actions.  It&amp;#39;s basic face value stuff.  Venom Snake existed, sure, but for a man who accomplished as much as he did, the only one anyone will ever remember is Big Boss.  It was another parallel between Venom Snake and Skull Face, because just before he died, Skull Face expressed the exact same concern, that Cipher would do the same to him, which they did, because Skull Face is never so much as mentioned again in any other game, for both practical reasons (he didn&amp;#39;t exist yet), and story reasons that fit into things (Cipher altered whatever information they could about his actions).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Letting The Phantom Snake Program makes Big Boss a massive hypocrite, yes.  Convincing Venom Snake to &amp;#39;keep the dream alive&amp;#39; after the fact is another nail in the hypocritical coffin.  But it&amp;#39;s not just passively letting the program happen, it&amp;#39;s what it took to ensure it happened.  Which required passively letting hundreds of people die despite knowing well in advance from Ocelot that an attack from both XOF AND The Man on Fire was imminent, and the reason was specifically so they&amp;#39;d be used as a human shield between Venom Snake, Big Boss, and their enemies.  That&amp;#39;s the part a lot of people don&amp;#39;t immediately address.  When you have knowledge that lives are in danger, you have a responsibility to intervene.  Many would argue that keeping silent is just as bad as pulling the trigger yourself, because Big Boss all but ensured it happened by staying quiet.

The mere fact that he allowed it to happen, what he let happen for that to go off successfully, and then, persuaded the man to keep the ball rolling after the events of V, is a stark contrast of the man we thought we knew in MGS3.\n\n\nPW already did a good job of demonstrating how backwards Big Boss is.  The way he views The Boss putting down the gun as betrayal, how he brings children into his staff, recruits people left and right with his charismatic presence, and above all else, harbors a nuke, a means to launch it, and decides he'll do whatever it takes to keep from being erased by the times.  PW was Big Boss' turning point; the descent into villainy that people clearly overlooked when Big Boss was lying to what he thought was the U.N., and mowing down U.S. Marines to get his child staff member and enemy spy back.\n\n\nHis actions, passive or active, in V, are merely a byproduct and testament to that moral bankruptcy, and the fact that he'd do what he did to Venom Snake?  It may not be the WORST thing Big Boss has done, because most would argue letting a hospital full of people die when you have prior knowledge of an imminent attack...or harboring a NUKE and a means to launch it, are infinitely worse, but it's the most detrimental to the one thing Big Boss has always stood by; soldiers and the \"honor\" of fighting.  The Phantom Snake is more notable than everything else because it shows he doesn't even have THAT anymore.  \n\n\nMG2's fanning the flames of war moment is horrific and disgusting, but again, these were games made in 1990 and 1987.  How much of that really translated over to the MGS series, versus just becoming vague background noise in a series full of details it happily overlooks for whatever suits any given entry, has yet to be determined.

The way he views The Boss putting down the gun as betrayal, how he brings children into his staff, recruits people left and right with his charismatic presence, and above all else, harbors a nuke, a means to launch it, and decides he&amp;#39;ll do whatever it takes to keep from being erased by the times.  PW was Big Boss&amp;#39; turning point; the descent into villainy that people clearly overlooked when Big Boss was lying to what he thought was the U.N., and mowing down U.S. Marines to get his child staff member and enemy spy back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His actions, passive or active, in V, are merely a byproduct and testament to that moral bankruptcy, and the fact that he&amp;#39;d do what he did to Venom Snake?  It may not be the WORST thing Big Boss has done, because most would argue letting a hospital full of people die when you have prior knowledge of an imminent attack...or harboring a NUKE and a means to launch it, are infinitely worse, but it&amp;#39;s the most detrimental to the one thing Big Boss has always stood by; soldiers and the &amp;quot;honor&amp;quot; of fighting.  The Phantom Snake is more notable than everything else because it shows he doesn&amp;#39;t even have THAT anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MG2&amp;#39;s fanning the flames of war moment is horrific and disgusting, but again, these were games made in 1990 and 1987.  How much of that really translated over to the MGS series, versus just becoming vague background noise in a series full of details it happily overlooks for whatever suits any given entry, has yet to be determined.  Because of that, this is what most will stand by as the definitive &amp;quot;full heel&amp;quot; moment for Big Boss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "metalgearsolid", "name": "t1_dgd5b2u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492434728.0, "created_utc": 1492405928.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tmi5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Moon_frogger", "parent_id": "t1_dg9hauw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/metalgearsolid", "controversiality": 1, "body": "you're being overdramatic lol.

Should this be true, then it would have been extremely foolish of Big Boss to actively work for the United States government, should he actually want to remain hidden from the remainder of Cipher's influence. Given what we know about Big Boss's actions in *MGSV* and for his desire to operate from the shadows and let Venom act as the figurehead of Diamond Dogs, it would be out of character for him to return to active service in the US army, even if it was only to lead FOXHOUND. This is also supported by the fact that Kaz is present in *Metal Gear 2* as a part of the leadership of FOXHOUND. Meanwhile, Ocelot is not present in *Metal Gear 1 &amp; 2* (though he is present in *Metal Gear Solid*'s iteration of FOXHOUND that lacks any of the previously mentioned members of FOXHOUND, making it safe to assume Ocelot was not an active member during the 1990's (or the period of *Metal Gear 1 &amp; 2*)). What we know from the Truth tapes at the end of *MGSV* is that Ocelot sided with Big Boss, while Kaz believed in and held more allegiance toward Venom. Given these points, I would say it is safe to assume that the Big Boss of the 1990's FOXHOUND was none other than Venom Snake. \n\nAnother possibly more subtle point I would like to make is that Venom Snake's ideology and demeanor in *MGSV* is far closer to that of Solid Snake's. Granted, this point relies solely on the cut scenes and tapes in *MGSV* and not on player's decisions for Venom outside of those artifacts. In *MGSV*, Venom shows mercy toward Quiet, despite her attempt at his life. This does mirror Big Boss's first encounter with Ocelot in *Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater*, which is significant on its own. We are made to believe that Venom is Big Boss (or at least the Big Boss we as the player have followed through *MGS3*, *Peace Walker*, and *Ground Zeroes*) and naturally there are many similarities in Venom's story. As I stated at the start of this thesis, I agree with [the author's] thesis on this point: Venom's hypnosis-induced amnesia and hypnotherapy (to artificially introduce Big Boss's memories into Venom) was less than effective, or only partially so. Venom is an extremely stoic figure, and when he is outspoken his personality does leak through. In *MGS3* Big Boss does a number on the wildlife of the Soviet Union, effectively eating his way through the mission. Venom on the other hand does not consume the various animals throughout Africa and Afghanistan, but rather, he works with Diamond Dogs to create a wildlife preserve for rescued animals in both regions (at the behest of third party environmentalists). It should be noted that this decision might have been made solely because of the lack of any sort of health meter that needed replenishment, but nonetheless, it is a stark contrast to the behavior of Big Boss.\n\nI don't want to burden this counter-thesis with too many other points from [the author's] thesis. Where we differ is on the point of *Metal Gear 1 &amp; 2*. I do not believe that Venom ever became 'evil' (if you want to view Big Boss that way) or that he ever accepted Big Boss's ideology. I believe a lot of this can be seen in how Solid Snake carries himself. He is idealistic, peace-loving, and an animal lover (see his life as a musher as an example). I believe that Venom (as Big Boss) revived FOXHOUND and with the aid of Roy Campbell and Kaz worked to train Gray Fox and Solid Snake to execute various missions, possibly for the US government (which I believe is what FOXHOUND worked under prior to and during the events of *Metal Gear 1 &amp; 2*). Why Venom would want to do this is a mystery to me. It could be because he and Kaz believed that Solid Snake, being a clone of Big Boss, should be molded into not only an ideal operative (and possibly an eventual replacement for Venom?) but as a counter to Eli (later Liquid Snake) who Kaz knew that Ocelot had taken an interest in. Solid Snake might have been a contingency in the event that Big Boss or Eli ever needed to be dealt with. Should this be true, and Big Boss catch wind of it, then he would naturally aim to put an end to Kaz and Venom's ploy. He would easily be able to radio to Solid Snake and issue Operation Intrude N313. This might account for the limited radio interaction in *Metal Gear 1*, as the mission's main (or only) FOXHOUND communicator is Big Boss. While Outer Heaven in *Metal Gear 1* is stated to be in South Africa, it could just as easily have been retconned to be Mother Base from *MGSV*, or one of the FOB's operated by Diamond Dogs (I'll grant you, this is a very unreliable claim, but it's also not necessarily relevant either). Regardless, Big Boss orchestrated an attack on Venom, ultimately resulting in Venom's death at the hands of Solid Snake. This deception and betrayal would naturally set Kaz (and possibly Roy Campbell...and Snake, should Kaz have ever taken the time to explain who Venom really was between the end of *Metal Gear 1* and shortly before his death prior to *MGS*) on a path of revenge against Big Boss, culminating in the events of *Metal Gear 2*, where Solid Snake actually faces and defeats Big Boss. This 'death' of the real Big Boss would later lead to the events of *MGS1*, including Kaz's death, and the remainder of the events, chronologically, throughout the series.\n\n...\n\nSorry for the lengthiness, but I guess my key issues remain with who actually was a part of FOXHOUND. The ending of *MGSV* (especially the Truth tapes) make me feel like Kaz would not work with the real Big Boss again after his betrayal to Kaz and the Mother Base of *Peace Walker*. *Portable Ops* also naturally complicates matters, given its murky status among the *MGS* canon.
