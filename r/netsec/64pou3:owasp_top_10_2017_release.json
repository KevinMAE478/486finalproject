If you&amp;#39;re suitably mature, you really shouldn&amp;#39;t need one to save yourself from embarrassment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a site has a decent security posture, it simply doesn&amp;#39;t need to react when a person is trying to hack it, let alone an automated scanner. Take a look at internet giants that have massive web attack surface and take security seriously - Google, Facebook, Github, etc. To my knowledge none of them use WAFs, because they know it wouldn&amp;#39;t achieve anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also the increased attack surface they can cause - look to antivirus software to see how attempts to layer on security can backfire and cause a net harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why &amp;#39;Insufficient Attack Protection&amp;#39; has no place in that list. Every other item listed is clearly a net positive to a site&amp;#39;s security, whereas tacking on a WAF may be a great idea, a waste of resources or a net negative depending on the application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "netsec", "name": "t1_dg4v0bk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491970980.0, "created_utc": 1491942180.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg44zum", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crosssitepotato", "parent_id": "t1_dg432rv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/netsec", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I think #7 Insufficient Attack Protection is a dubious addition to this list.
