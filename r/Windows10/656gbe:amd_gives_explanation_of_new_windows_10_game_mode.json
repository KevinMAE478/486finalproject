TotalBiscuit occasionally upscales his 1080p videos to 4K and uploads those to YouTube and recommends the 4K quality preset over the 1080p quality preset even to 1080p display owners simply due to the fact that the higher bitrate of the 4K quality preset means the final image quality is less compressed than the 1080p quality preset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering techniques such as DVR (Nvidia) and VSR (AMD) renders a game at a higher resolution than the native resolution of the monitor, and then downscales the final image to the native resolution. This produces a much less aliased image as if you would render the game at the native resolution and apply various antialiasing techniques to minimize the aliasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But beyond that? The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; difference between a 480p and a 4K video being shown on the same 480p monitor would be due to the matemathical downscaling algoritm used for the 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Windows10", "name": "t1_dg8mlsp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492165620.0, "created_utc": 1492136820.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg89w60", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "umar4812", "parent_id": "t1_dg7wmh8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Windows10", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It is extremely more detailed than 480p though.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extremely more detailed than 480p though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Windows10", "name": "t1_dg89w60", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148467.0, "created_utc": 1492119667.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7wmh8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "belgarionx", "parent_id": "t1_dg7s6nd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Windows10", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Opening a 4K video on 480p screen won't make the result 4K", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening a 4K video on 480p screen won&amp;#39;t make the result 4K&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Windows10", "name": "t1_dg7wmh8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492133783.0, "created_utc": 1492104983.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u9xs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656gbe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u9xs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656gbe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8n33o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Aemony", "parent_id": "t1_dg7wtek", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Windows10", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In layman's terms the analogy works, but it's flawed due to the fact that the 4K quality preset on YouTube actually allows for a much higher bitrate than the 1080p quality preset.
