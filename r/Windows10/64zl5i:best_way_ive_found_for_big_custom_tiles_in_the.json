posted my Start menu and since then I've been getting tons of pms with questions on \"How to\" etc' on another subreddit. Although All the info was hidden in the comments I thought I'd put it all in one post for everyone to enjoy.\n\nTo achieve this I've used a small app called TileCreator from the Windows store. You'll also need to download TileCreator Proxy from [here](https://mega.nz/#!z4JlBRSZ!w4tMK8W7Rq5Rrb6F0NEXaOyosvmQvxp45IqkQzwHbyI)\n\n The only thing you need to care about is that the \"Name\" in \"TileCreator Proxy\" will be identical to the name under \"TileCreator proxy link name\" in TileCreator.\n\n* Don't point to the game exe, point to a shortcut of the game (.lnk filetype). I had a few games that acted weird when I tried to run them from TileCreator -&gt; exe but every game worked flawlessly with the shortcut. Example: C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop\\Games\\Assassins Creed Syndicate.lnk\n\n* For steam games I just use the steam url, for example this is my CS:GO path in TileCreator Proxy : steam://rungameid/730\n\n* Can't fit two wide tiles next to each other? Go to \"Start\" settings in \"Personalization\" and make sure \"Show more tiles\" is on. (If you don't have that option you'll need to Update your Windows 10.\n\n* Tiles can be found here: http://steambanners.booru.org/index.php\nor here: http://w8tiles.tumblr.com/\nBut I like better this guy on deviantart that does a pretty great job on all major releases: http://crussong.deviantart.com/\n\n* TileCreator will be opened and closed when you start a game. If that bothers you you can drag it to the lower right of your screen and forget about it. \n\n* TileCreator is the best Free tiles creator I've found. There's also Win10Tile which offers \"Native\" support but lacks the ability to create Large or wide Tiles. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/JxB2BWE.png)\n\nLike I already said though, Those sexy tiles are very hard to resist.
