Seriously. This is windows, more software have you installed, if not maintain properly, it will slow your pc down. In additon, desktop app installer also tend to include another unwanted software if you do not be careful like search bar, ad etc. So, as surface pro 3 user, I have a very fast and smooth operation in my PC especially with the newly launched Creators update. \n\nHeres my recommendation\n\n1. Use Windows Store Apps if posibble. Why? It's sandboxed , meaning, it's safe and will not bloat your PC no matter how much apps have you installed. Windows store apps have better touch input much like IOS version.\n\nFor Media Player, download ACG Player. Seriously, This is the most feature packed, beautiful and the smoothest media player that can play all format. Subtitle is supported internally and externally. Equalizer, Image enhancement and hell even subtitle speed adjustment are also available. You can see the feedback from the store.\n\nFor Zip or Rar or something like that, you can download 9zip. A lot of media social apps in the store like facebook, instagram, messenger, instapic etc, skype that you can download. Trust me, if you make yourself comfortable min tablet mode like me, you will prefer the apps than the browser. \n\nFor browser, try to use Microsoft Edge with adblocker installed as it's more efficent, and more battery saving but keep in mind Edge is a little bit buggy thought the situation has been much improved in the new Creator Update. As for my case, I installed Opera desktop installer as my backup browser.\n\nFor PDF, actually, microsoft Edge can still open that, but it offers basic functionalities. So, instead of installing adobe pdf reader dektop program. download xodo pdf from windows store as its scrolling is smooth like butter and it's light too as well as heavily features packed.\n\nFor torrent app, download torrex pro. Its visually beautifull and effective too and feel more modern.\n\nFor better touch screen input for desktop program, try download touchme gesture studio from the store. You can assign gestures for many fuction like minizing, maximizing, everything\n\nSo, anything app that you want, try to search through windows store first as its apps are automatically updated and more secure\n\n2. By saying that does not mean you have to ignore totally desktop apps. In  my case I have: \n\nMicrosoft office since the store version is pretty much lighter and does not have many features. Adobe Photoshop, and VLC media player as backup media player. VLC is battery hog be careful. Use ACG Player in store instead.\n\nSo, when you are forced to install dektop app then you can install but be careful not to always click next next next in the desktop installer as it will setup another unwanted software.\n\n3. Dont forget to organize your live tiles as if not, it will look messy seriously.\n\n4. If you have installed Creator Update, then you will have a new feature in which you can ALLOW THE APP FROM STORE ONLY much like in Mac OS gatekeeper. So, as for my case, after i have installed everthing from the store and desktop program, I turned the feature on to avoid virus from infecting my computer since the virus format usually will be .exe... Windows Defender is enough for me to keep myself from virus.
