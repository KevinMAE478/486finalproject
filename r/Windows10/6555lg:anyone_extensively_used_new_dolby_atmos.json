So far i started with the channel tests on Dolbys website. \nhttps://www.dolby.com/us/en/guide/test-tones.html\n\nSound is being tested from the sound port on my motherboard (GA-870A-USB3). The line is going from the PC to a set of Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II. I am using a pair of Sony V6's plugged into the speakers.\n\nWith the spatial sound set to \"None\" channel separation is present, but some channels seem louder or more overbearing than others. The Sub-woofer channel does not register at all during the test. I then switched the spatial sound to Dolby Atmos for Headphones.\n\nRadical change. Individual channels are noticeable less harsh but still loud. Other channels that were previously softer than others are at normal levels. I felt like there was better overall channel separation, but that may just be due to the softness of some of them being gone. The sub-woofer channel actually plays and provides a smooth but strong sound.\n\nI have also tested it with two Atmos enabled films. They were played using MPC-HC(madvr,lav filters, the works). The files are MKV files with the Atmos track enabled. The movies were Deepwater Horizon and 10 Cloverfield Lane. Both films have very well designed audio tracks and made it easy to notice even subtle differences. (note: I listened to a scene then restarted the same scene with the changed spatial sound, giving each scene its own test.)\n\nBoth films sounded alright without Atmos enabled. Channel separation was there. Bass felt a little thin but during key moments it picked up a bit. Nothing out of the ordinary, but a good listen none the less.\n\nThen i enabled Atmos and went over the same scenes. Some scenes didn't sound all that different. If anything, it felt softer and required turning up. Pretty quickly though, even dialog scenes were showing some pretty awesome changes. Separation of channels was radically improved even in quite scenes. There are many moments where It really sounded like I was in the same room as two characters talking. The bass was a huge upgrade. While it wasn't unpleasant by any means without Atmos enabled, enabling the Atmos for gave me that \"grab you by the balls\" bass that well calibrated theaters can provide. I decided to add in a couple more scenes with heavy bass to see if it became overpowered at times, but all that i noticed was just how well the bass fits into the track. \n\nI have also tested a couple of DD5.1 MKV files as well as a couple DTS5.1 files and intend to do more. First major one was the new release of Heat. Sounded great and less harsh with Atmos enabled. Basically the same findings as the Atmos enabled tracks earlier, but with slightly less channel separation(could just be me by this point, but its what I noticed.)\n\nOverall I'm loving every bit of this option. It burns me that it's not free. Absolute bullshit move but if my findings keep the same pattern, they'll probably get my money. 10 Cloverfield Lane was especially worth it. I have seen the film 3 times now and after the tests i did today, i have to watch the whole film with it on. The sound design of the film is brilliant but i had no idea just how brilliant until these tests. The sense of being in that bunker is absolutely unsettling with Atmos enabled. Changes the experience radically and for the better. I'm so pumped for what this could mean for other films.\n\nOne more note. I have more testing planned for the day using other equipment. I will be outputting the audio via HDMI from a PNY gtx970 to a Sony DH510 Receiver. Sony V6's will be plugged into the headphone port on the front of the receiver. i will then test the same films/scenes using the same process as above.\n\nEDIT: Tested with the HDMI output to the Sony receiver. The receiver recognizes the audio with Atmos for Headphones enabled as 2 channel and works perfectly with the V6's. The headphones are noticeably better with the receiver of course. The moment i heard the scenes from 10 Cloverfield Lane I began considering changing the layout of my room to accommodate better access to the receiver. The channel tests from Dolby worked perfectly. The changes from having the Atmos for headphones on to turning it off were a bit more noticeable than before, but it was about the same experience. Channel separation felt decent, but compared to Atmos, it felt like the changes were less...even may be the best word. Changes in direction or sudden direction effects felt too sharp. Atmos just seems to blend them into the environment perfectly. I have not really noticed any times when Atmos makes effects too muddy. Effects that should be in the background of a scene sound a bit more like they are actually in the back with Atmos. It may come off as a dampening or muddying of the sound and may not be everyone's preferred method but i highly suggest trying it out to compare. \n\nTLDR: So far it's pretty good and I hope further testing provides similar results.", "edited": 1492097406.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been doing some testing today and will be doing more.
