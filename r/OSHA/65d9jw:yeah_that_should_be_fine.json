You're either providing enough structural support to prevent a collapse, or providing a space that is strong enough to hold back shifting soils.\n\n\n\n\nYou might see some people in this thread saying \"if the soil was stable it's probably fine,\" but the thing about soil is that it often has what might be called a \"brittle failure.\" There is little or no warning before something catastrophic happens, much like if you break a brittle piece of plastic. You won't know something bad is happening until it actually starts to happen. (This would be the opposite of a \"ductile failure\" in which there is a lot of deformation/warning before something breaks.) So yeah you could be in a trench where the soil \"looks fine\" for hours and hours, but then in less than a second it falls in on someone.
