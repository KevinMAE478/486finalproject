You pushed to eliminate federal loans for higher education completely, because you thought millennials were just being whiny about the cost of college. You wasted your power and position on useless, egomaniacal ravings.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dave began to choke, electrical rivulets of terror starting to flow from his brain to his fingertips. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow\u2019s all of that working out for you now, Dave?
