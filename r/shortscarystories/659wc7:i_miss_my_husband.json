Up, down, up, down. The repetition likely would&amp;#39;ve have woken him by now, if not for his current situation. As always, I found myself admiring him. I&amp;#39;d always found him more attractive when he slept, something about the stillness, the slow rise and fall of his chest. But today there was no time for admiration, more pressing matters were at hand. I rose from the bed reluctantly and switched on the light. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wake up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes sprang open immediately and began to glance around frantically.

I rolled up my left sleeve exposing my forearm and leaned closer so he could see. I saw the confusion and terror drain from his face, replaced by recognition and sadness. I felt a wave of anger rush through me as I realized he really understood what was happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How could you do this?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shook his head uncertainly. I sighed. He hadn&amp;#39;t really known what would happen, even though I&amp;#39;d told him a hundred times. He didn&amp;#39;t deserve this; I didn&amp;#39;t deserve this.

I reached forward and slipped the rope from his mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry... I should have never touched it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His voice was raspy and worn sounding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s not your fault. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have made you so responsible.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and leaned his head back on the pillow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So now what?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now I summon him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked over at me and smiled weakly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I love you too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slid my hand down my exposed forearm and caressed the charred symbol.

I leaned over the sink and pressed the blade to my forearm. I pressed harder until the edges of the symbol started to bleed and tear.
