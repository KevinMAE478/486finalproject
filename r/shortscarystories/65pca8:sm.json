There is a huge difference between S&amp;amp;M and murder, and the whole &amp;quot;BDSM is evil&amp;quot; trope is really, really worn out by now. So that aspect of the story, that false equivalency borne out by ignorance, weakens the stronger portion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The writing is good. The idea is good. The execution overall is not great.. no pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There should always be downsides to deals with the devil, no matter who you are or what you like, or else everyone would make them, wouldn&amp;#39;t they? The idea is that convenience, or rewards, should be earned through hard work, not granted by magic; and that payments should be made up-front, not put off until they are massive and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: for the people saying &amp;quot;but BDSM was just a cover story!&amp;quot; -- The story (and its author) assumes that murders in progress could be disguised as BDSM, which is a ridiculous concept. You could, similarly, shit yourself and excuse it as a fart, but it&amp;#39;s pretty clear you&amp;#39;d be an obvious liar. Police and concerned citizens aren&amp;#39;t going to accept an obvious lie and go on about their business. If your bedroom activities are attracting the attention of concerned citizens and police officers, you&amp;#39;re doing it wrong -- even if (especially if?) you&amp;#39;re practicing BDSM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just do a bit of research next time, and maybe try using tropes in a fresh new way, that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m asking. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "shortscarystories", "name": "t1_dgco5nn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492410062.0, "created_utc": 1492381262.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t6kz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pca8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdrj9d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "alrightmaate", "parent_id": "t3_65pca8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/shortscarystories", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I assume he'll eventually find his wife on that table.
