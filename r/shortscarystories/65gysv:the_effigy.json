Joanie thought it was a strange feeling, standing in that cave, in the bubble of warmth. A few steps away she could feel a salty chill rush through her bones.

The stiff arm was twisted in a peculiar way, after Billy had tugged on it with all of his weight to move the corpse. It was around the wrong way, and the hand remained elevated as he slowly let go, gawking at the effigy in his left hand. It looked just like her.
