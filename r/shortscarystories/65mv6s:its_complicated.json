It had never taken me so long to work up the courage to be with someone. I usually fall very hard and very fast but Amanda was different. She was perfect in every discernable way and perfectly untouchable. I had spent long nights tucked away in her attic, just above her bed, listening to the tinkle in her laugh as she giggled at the television. The even longer days, waiting her return from work, were well spent touching all the silky clothes in her closet or drawing in the sweet aromas from her comforter. I knew she was out of my league but somone so sweet and so understanding would have to give me a chance right? Today would be the day I confess my love to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in her cheery kitchen and waited to hear the familiar click of her car door and the jingle of keys that normally ushered me into the crawlspace in the pantry. The nerves sent shivers down my arms, right into my sweaty palms that tucked a large knife into my waistband, just for good measure. Sometimes you have to be drastic to make sure they understand. Sadly some of them just couldn&amp;#39;t wrap their heads around the beautiful life we would have had together. They&amp;#39;re better off now, not part of this world. They won&amp;#39;t have to suffer anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I hear it! That beautiful jingle of keys signaling me that my love has returned to me! She opened the door and I smiled widely as she shut the door behind her and strode near my position. She stopped to eye me, but seemed remarkably unfazed by my presence. Butterflies spread through my being as she began to flash a smirk, showing just a hint of her beautiful, white teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh Amanda! I knew you were the one! You seem like you&amp;#39;ve known all along! People never react this calmly, you&amp;#39;re something special.&amp;quot; I nearly dropped to my knees to propose but then I was startled by the deadbolt on the door clicking into place, despite neither of us being near it. My stomach sank as her grin widened and twisted upwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right sweetheart. &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; never understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I had been watching her for months on end at this point.
