This fear that you aren\u2019t alone? That someone is watching you? If you ever get this feeling, chances are, you will look back to check if there is anyone there. Rookie mistake. Allow me to prove to you how looking back is a bad thing to do in this situation and it can get you killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the times you will look back, see nothing, and you will keep walking\u2026 But the feeling is still there. Obviously. Think for a second. If someone is watching you, do you really thing he would be watching in plain sight? Of course not, he would actually be hidden. Now, if the thing that is watching you is something inhuman, a supernatural entity, it simply will not let you see it using his demonic/alien/ghastly powers and whatnot. Now that we have established how pointless it is to look back, we will examine how it can get you killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s get in the mindset of a stalker for half a paragraph now shall we? Most of the time the stalker is a psychopathic horny middle-aged man, or a psychopathic ex-boyfriend/girlfriend that couldn\u2019t get over you, or one of those psychopathic people that like you but are too weird to actually talk to you. In one word, the stalker is, more often than not, a psychopath. What would one of those people do if they were discovered and confronted? Panic. They would think \u201cMy victim saw me, now they will tell everyone that I am stalking them and no one will want to be my friend and my parents will find out and no one will want to employ me etc etc. Well, only one way out of this, to silence them permanently with the knife I always carry in my back pocket\u201d. The point is, just don\u2019t look back. They will keep stalking you, and you will keep breathing. Everyone\u2019s a winner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us assume that the thing that is watching you is supernatural. Have you, dear reader, seen any horror movie ever? The demon/alien/ghost doesn\u2019t kill the victim right away. It lures him into a trap, into a place where the entity has the upper hand. Then it kills him. Seriously just walk away, it\u2019s not that hard. Someone should write a comedy, parody of horror movies, where the protagonist is haunted by an evil spirit and he just ignores it and lives. Now that I think of it I\u2019ll work on that when I finish with this, don\u2019t even think about stealing my idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to conclude the report with a special plea to the person that inspired me to write it. After reading the whole thing Magda you understand why you shouldn\u2019t look behind you when you feel like someone is watching you. So please don\u2019t do it.
