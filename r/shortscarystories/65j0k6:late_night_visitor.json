Before Joseph had grasped how unhinged Adam was, Joseph had started a rumor that Adam was gay. Adam had taken offence to that. So for a month after he\u2019d heard the rumour, Adam went around the city at night, raping and killing any girl he could get his hands on. Everytime he did it, he took a picture, and one morning he broke into Joseph&amp;#39;s office and hung them all up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a defeated voice, Joseph asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, Joseph,\u201d he said with that peculiar smile of his, \u201cWhat do you want? I can easily kick down your door, drag your wife and kid out by their hair and be off.
