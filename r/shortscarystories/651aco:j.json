He was wearing the pinstripe shirt he&amp;#39;d bought in our freshman year of college and all I could think was why they&amp;#39;d decided to bury him in it. Maggots wove between his teeth as he smiled with a jerking motion that cracked deep in his jaw. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t speak and I couldn&amp;#39;t even if I had wanted to. I&amp;#39;d just screamed the same jagged sounds until they broke off into whimpers. I was terrified. How could I not be with the shell of my past decaying in front of my eyes?

I met eyes that had gone entirely white, cracked through with yellow veins that pulsated. Nothing in me could react as his mouth unhinged to reveal a bloated purple tongue, impossibly slimy, rotating as if to sense out which flesh to bite into first. My hands had barely grabbed the hammer from the nightstand with an uncertain grasp when hands appeared. They belonged to men in white hazmats with clouded faces.

Watching from the window, I heard the crack of the baton that splattered his brains. He kept moving. It wasn&amp;#39;t until he barely had a fragment of bone resembling a skull that he fell into his own puddle of fluids and mush. All that was left was to breathe between the onslaught of flashbacks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The desperate way he&amp;#39;d looked as he was carried away reminded me of what he must of looked like the last day he&amp;#39;d been truly alive. Sounds of pleading hysteria over voicemails that I&amp;#39;d cleared from my feed and listened to when convenient so similar to his groans just a few minutes ago. My name whispered like it could save him from the bullet he had packed into his gun. But it hadn&amp;#39;t. Not then when he&amp;#39;d needed me most of all.
