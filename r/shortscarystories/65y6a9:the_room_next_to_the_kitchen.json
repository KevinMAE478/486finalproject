We\u2019ve lived here my whole life and not once has my parents even glanced at that door. Today is the day I\u2019m going to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey mom, why don\u2019t we ever unlock that door?\u201d I question as I point in the direction of the room. She places the lid back on the pot of marinara sauce she\u2019s cooking and looks down at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe door? Well, there wasn\u2019t a key for that door when we moved in. Daddy tried to remove it for a couple of months and we just couldn\u2019t get it unjammed; so we just left it. We have enough space here so that room isn\u2019t really necessary.\u201d  She turns back around and continues cooking. Leaving me even more curious than I was a couple minutes ago. I had to figure out what was in that room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mom is getting my pajamas out of the dryer for bed I look in the junk drawer for a screwdriver. The red handle glints against the other junk; I pocket it and dash up the stairs to my room to place it under my pillow for later. Once I\u2019m tucked into bed I wait for the right opportunity to play detective. An hour later the sounds of the house still and I figure it\u2019s now or never. I throw off my covers and, as ninja like as I can, tiptoe to the kitchen. Each step I take feels like hours, the silence of the house amplifying each breath I take. With screwdriver in hand I approach the kitchen and the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quietly push a chair up against the door and climb up. Despite mom telling me the lock was jammed it seemed to look okay. Six little screws hold the lock to the door, carefully I start twisting them to the left. One by one the screws tink to the floor, and finally the lock pops off into my hand. I gently set it on the counter and pull the chair away from the room. Turning the knob I open the door. I flip the switch next to the door and the room floods with light. My breath catches in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brown and burgundy stains covered the old mattress on the floor, the same colored spots covered the walls too. The bucket in the corner was so rusted it was more red than silver. I hesitantly take some steps into the room to take it all in. I couldn\u2019t figure out why this was here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was really hoping she would be the last one.\u201d Dad\u2019s voice rips through the silence as I whip around to meet my parents. They both block the doorway; their eyes slits against the harsh lighting of the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI guess we can try again.\u201d Mom sighs and turns around, closing the door behind her with me inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For as long as I can remember, the room next to the kitchen has been locked.
