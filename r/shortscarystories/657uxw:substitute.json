I was working on the wiring in an old building and managed to grab a live one. The blast knocked me off the balcony two stories down to the first floor. My buddy dialed 911 and his best to keep me awake. When they found me I was barely alive. The rookie paramedic that found me leaned in too close. I remember being hit with a sudden coughing fit, spraying blood into his unprotected eyes. I watched as he cried out in disgust, staggered backwards and fell down the long cement stairway leading to the street. And that&amp;#39;s when I saw my friend for the first time. He looked like a little boy barely old enough to speak. His eyes were nothing but empty sockets, but his face spoke volumes. He looks confused, scared, and even a little sad. He looked from me, to the paramedic, then back at me before seeming to flicker over to the poor rookie for a few moments. I laid there, heart racing, and watched the boy fade slowly away into nothing. I made a full recovery almost overnight. The doctors said it was a miracle. Not even a scratch. It was like nothing had happened to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was my blood. I found out later that the paramedic and I shared the same blood type. My blood entering his eyes, combined with his immediate death was enough to confuse this reaper. I was spared, and the poor rookie went in my place. But the reaper knows he&amp;#39;s been tricked, and he knows my blood. That&amp;#39;s when I started finding subsitutes. Heroin addicts are the best. It&amp;#39;s hard to find ones with my blood type but no one looks for them and they are happy with a safe place to stay where the needles are clean and the drugs cheap. Whenever I would hear that symphony start, I&amp;#39;d give my guest a free dose, wait for him to pass out, then put a little of my blood into a syringe along with a heavy dose of morphine and let them take my place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, of course, I was caught. 18 people. The most victims of any serial killer in my state, maybe even the country. So I sit here now, in my little cell, waiting for the symphony to start. I just hope he plays something good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Did you know you can hear death coming?
