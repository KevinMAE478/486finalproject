Maryanne starts sobbing, begging. They call out her score: \u201cTwenty-one.\u201d Ouch. Not even half of a perfect score. The sobbing ceases, and I want to piss myself right here in the wings. Silence is never good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLora Merci.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shyly emerge from the safe, dark curtains and step into the oppressive, blinding lights. A rig- one of many to keep us from performing at our best. \u201cStart whenever you\u2019re ready, Miss Merci.\u201d I take a deep breath, and close my eyes, shutting out as much of the lights as I can. I take my preparation stance, and begin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My slender, graceful body goes through the movements like a music-box machine, spinning and leaping and flying, sometimes. I can\u2019t afford to look, to observe the judges\u2019 expressions. Their terrifying masks are yet another ploy to throw off us performers. Maryanne no doubt made that mistake, despite all our warnings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shake off all thoughts of Maryanne, her being gone. Allowing those backstage to hear those who failed- their fates- is even more intimidation. But I refuse to be intimidated. I melt into my mental music, going through the motions and marrying them to the notes. Dancing in the dark of closed eyes is euphoric. I purse my lips a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something cuts off the music. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grating metal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My eyelids fly open, but I don\u2019t see the obstacle in time. I trip. Three sharp chirps are to sound- my three seconds\u2019 time to get up and finish my routine. I can\u2019t move. Blood stains my tights. My leg burns. So much. I glance back, and nearly scream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bear trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One chirp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still flail about onstage, as we\u2019re expected to stand before the judges, and manage to get to my feet- foot. In an odd stumble-drag, I just barely make it to front center stage. They make scritches with their judgmental pens. I wince, and try not to whimper, as they can still remove points at this stage. I hope the moves I did complete are enough to keep me from failing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judges hold up their signs in grim succession.

Those missed two points are the end of me. I dread whatever death they\u2019ve chosen for me. Electrocution? Poison darts? Or will they bring out the bear the trap was meant for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear chains- or ropes? The judges exit, refusing to spare me a second glance. The performance is over. My life is over.
