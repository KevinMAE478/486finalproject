There were people lined up along the walls of the long room, they were all slightly grey, it reminded me of a cathedral with statues but the people were too realistic to be just statues. We started walking and one of us made a small squeak with the toe of their shoe on the polished marble floor. The sound reverberated around the room and the people all snapped to attention and the nearest started to move towards us. They were inhumanly fast but the sound died quickly and they froze again. I bet they can only move when there was noise, a simple test of patience then, just move slowly and make as little noise as possible.

Keith cracked, he suddenly started yelling and running for the door at the end of the room, he must have thought he could make it. I tried to grab him but I was too slow. He was just out of reach, running for the door. They got to him before he made it. The first few tackled him, then they started tearing at any part of his body they could reach. They used their hands, teeth, anything they could use to rip him apart. Screaming filled the room. The rest joined them and started tearing at Keith with as much force as the first few. Screaming. Crimson liquid was flying over the people and pooling on the floor. Screaming. Keith was thrashing under the weight of the people, his chest starting to collapse under the weight of the people. Screaming. The noise echoed around us, like. Screaming. He started to spit up blood and choke on the fluid in his throat. Screaming.
