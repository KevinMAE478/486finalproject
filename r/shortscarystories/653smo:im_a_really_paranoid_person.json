The noise is too loud, and it drowns out everything.  That&amp;#39;s why I always have the music on really low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I notice little sounds, ordinary stuff. Like just right now, actually, I heard a car outside. Just sitting there with the engine running.  At first I didn&amp;#39;t think about it, but then I wondered, who would leave their car running that long? Why don&amp;#39;t they park, or drive away? I sat there listening, imagining what kind of horrors I might see if I pulled back the curtain, until my curiosity overpowered my fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went to the window and looked. There was a white truck parked on the curb opposite my house.  I think I saw someone in there too. I watched him for a while.  After about ten minutes, he drove away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how you spend the whole day ignoring everything around you, and then when you get into a high anxiety situation every single sound is the closest most terrifying thing you&amp;#39;ve ever heard.  Like when I heard the dogs barking, after I had gone back to my desk.  I hear them barking almost every night (annoying little shits.)  But tonight it was different, I thought, because they were &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; barking, and it was so loud, and of course the car had already freaked me out so I had to go and take a look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The car was back! It was actually parked this time, with nobody in there. As soon as I saw it my mind raced with dozens of ridiculous, improbable scenarios, like what if the guy had killed my neighbor&amp;#39;s dog, or maybe he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a dog or something, a werewolf...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I heard the gunshot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s actually not unusual; I hear gunshots all the time.  I live near a police training academy, and I guess that sound really carries because it&amp;#39;s about a mile away but I always hear it clear as crystal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you&amp;#39;re in a state of heightened anxiety sounds have a way of getting distorted, and that gun that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; is from the police academy sounds like it could be from the house across the street.  And even though I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it isn&amp;#39;t true it never fails to quicken my pulse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve learned to control myself. To sit down, and close the curtain and go back to reddit, and tell myself that absolutely nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t force myself to ignore the sounds outside. And I can&amp;#39;t get rid of those anxious feelings that are telling me that the creaks in my house mean it could topple any minute, and that my pulse means I have a heart condition, and that the police siren outside sounds like it&amp;#39;s in my neighborhood and coming toward my house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm a really paranoid person.
