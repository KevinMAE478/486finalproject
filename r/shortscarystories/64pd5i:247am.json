My heart pounding as if I had just done some short sprints. I could feel my white shirt stuck to my back from the sweat. I looked over at my alarm clock that read 2:47AM in neon red. It had sounded like the sliding door that leads to the backyard from what I heard of the loud sound that woke me up. Lying in bed extremely quiet, I listened to see if I could hear anything else. I had heard a noise that sounded like an object being placed on the glass table in the family room. I got out of bed and decided I\u2019d look and see who was up at this hour. It was weird that anyone was up at this hour, my dad or my 8-year old brother. I slowly turned the round door knob and silently opened my door. From upstairs I couldn\u2019t quite see down to the family room on the right of the stairs but I could certainly see the glowing light of the TV. I slowly crept down the carpeted stairs one careful step at a time. As I was approaching that half way point of the staircase I stopped behind what was the last of the wall that covered that top half of the stair case. One more step and I would be able to see all of the glowing front room. I stopped before that step and decided to glance around the corner of the wall. As I poked my head around I saw the TV first, it was just a fuzzy black and white channel. As I went further out I looked to the couch. There was my dad staring directly at me. His torso was fixed straight even with the TV in front of him, but his head had been twisted back, not a 180 degree turn backward but it had to be close, Staring right at me. He had... It had this terrifying scolding look on its face. I immediately ran upstairs and closed my door. I sat against the door, for it did not have a lock. I could hear his feet pounding up the stairs.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow, It was quiet but I knew it was outside my door. \n\u201cthe tiiime iiis yoouurrrsss..\u201d \nIt said that in a snake like whisper. Then it had strongly slammed against the door. Again, even harder. The door was beginning to give. Then it slammed once more into the door\u2026 CRACK!
