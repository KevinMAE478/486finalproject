The air was calm and the world around him was quiet. He tilted his face up towards the sky and the warm sun kissed his wrinkled skin. He smiled as he embraced the pleasures of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His smile quickly faded and turned to a puzzled scowl. He thought he saw a bee. He blinked tightly to erase the sun spots that darted through his vision. He scanned the sky. Sure enough, a bee was circling around his favorite lilac tree. It was a lilac tree that bloomed with the most vibrant purple flowers that smelled so sweet and wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He dashed inside and quickly locked his door. He dialed the number that he had secured next to his phone. The number he had hoped he would never need to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was immediately greeted by a pleasant voice. Dusty was thankful that he no longer needed to press a sequence of numbers that would navigate him through a maze of menus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained what he had seen. The voice assured him that help was on the way and hung up.\nDusty peered out the front window and focused his stare on the lilacs. The bee circled a few more times then came to rest atop one of the flowers. Dusty shifted sideways. Watching the bee made his skin crawl and his palms sweat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A van soon pulled up and a few men in white carefully eliminated the bee before climbing back in and driving away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dusty exhaled a sigh of relief. He returned to his spot on the porch and inhaled deeply. The scent of the lilacs tickled his nose. Mornings like this had always been his favorite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was beginning to nod off in the warmth of the sun when he detected movement once again. He looked up and saw hundreds of bees flying toward him. Their wings hummed against the air.\nHe spilled his coffee as he rushed inside. He dialed the number again and waited anxiously for the men to show up. Sure enough they did. They proceeded as they had before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dusty hesitantly returned to his spot on the porch. He had just gotten comfortable when the quiet was replaced with a deafening buzz. The sky darkened rapidly as millions of bees blocked out the sun. He shrieked as the bees flew directly toward him. He managed to get inside just as one stung at the back of his neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dusty struggled to dial the numbers as his body trembled in fear. They had warned him that this might happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They warned him that the Devil might find his way into Heaven and release everyone\u2019s greatest fears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice answered again, but this time it was different. It rasped into his ear before erupting into the most unpleasant laughter.  The laughter confirmed what Dusty had hoped wasn\u2019t true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heaven was no more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Dusty Pickles sat out on his front porch sipping his morning coffee.
