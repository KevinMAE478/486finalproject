I was reading short story books and drinking from my flask when the scream cut my peace like a knife. I was a 5 mile hike from anywhere, and not on any beaten path, but that was a woman\u2019s scream, not any wild animals. Unfortunately my conscience got the better of me, like it usually did, I grabbed my rifle and flashlight and set out in the direction the scream had come from. If some hiker had just hurt herself I couldn\u2019t just leave her to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear almost got the best of me as I jogged through the pine forest, I almost turned back but the scream came again, it was worse this time, it trailed off in a sickening gurgle, but it was closer. When I stepped out of the tree line I finally saw it. The cave was dark, it\u2019s entry hanging open like the maw of some great beast. I shook my head, I was reading too many stories. There was probably some girl in there spelunking and she\u2019d broken an ankle or something, and here I was getting freaked out by a cave. I rounded up my resolve and stepped through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there she was, just like I expected. Her straw blonde hair pulled back in a tight ponytail. Her thin frame covered by a blood stained yellow t-shirt, her hazel eyes darted around in panic. As I got closer I realized this girl was in desperate need of a bath, she smelled like holy hell, how long had she been out here? She looked like she was trying to speak as I ran to her and knelt down. \u201cOh thank god someone came\u201d her voice was high-pitched, almost childlike. I put a hand on her shoulder, trying to ignore the stench \u201cAre you ok? Can you walk? I have a campsite not far from here.\u201d I was kicking myself for not thinking to bring my first aid kit, but it was too late to worry about that. She let out a small cough and nodded \u201cI think so, but I\u2019ll need your help.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before long we were back at my camp, I sat her in my folding chair and handed her one of my many short story books, I checked the title \u201cSkin-walkers and other Native American Legends\u201d she took it happily and started to read as I set about bandaging her wounds. But it didn\u2019t take long for confusion to set in, for all the blood, I couldn\u2019t find a scratch on her. She flipped a page and chuckled, not the high-pitched girlish voice from before, something else \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not all these jerky-moving barely speaking idiots right?\u201d She sneered as she flipped another page, her eyes now devoid of color, pure white spheres too large for her face \u201cThat\u2019s just the young ones\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "The tranquility was beautiful at the base of the mountain, I\u2019m not sure which one I was at the base of, maybe it didn\u2019t have a name.
