These new VR headsets are legit! My friends and I have gotten into the habit of going out back to smoke cigarettes and play 360 horror games and videos. Watching each other get terrified while we laugh and smoke became a nightly ritual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pre loaded oculus videos got old real quick. Luckily you can find anything on the internet. I was surfing around looking for something to scare the pants off my friends when I found it. The perfect combination of AR and VR. The app requested access to my phone\u2019s camera so it could see my surroundings. The description really sold it; \u201cSee your friends and neighbors for the monsters they truly are!\u201d The site really went out of its way to build the atmosphere. All the reviews went along the lines of, \u201cI had no idea my mom was a vampire!\u201d \u201cRemember, if they are a zombie, go for the head!\u201d I downloaded it without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night I got to play first. We finished up dinner and moved to the back porch. As I slipped on the headset I hear the familiar flicking of lighters. Everything goes black for a moment before I see the porch in front of me. Everything looks just right, other than the crack on my camera making the world look like it\u2019s a little shattered. Looking around I see my friends smoking, the hammer still on the table from the fence we were fixing earlier, my half full beer in front of my usual seat. Nothing seems out of place. That\u2019s when I notice the eyes in the shadows. When I turn to them, they are gone. \u201cOhhh creepy.\u201d I love playing up the scares so they are more anxious when they put on the set. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The eyes flit around some more before landing behind Jared. He starts to smile while I stare at him, but the smile goes too wide. His eyes gradually redden and his face pales. Nothing else really happens for a while; just his smile getting bigger. The eyes behind them stopped moving and everything just seemed off. It was a bit of a letdown if I am being honest. Basically a horror snapchat filter in VR. I guess my face gave it away as I took off the headset since everyone kinda groaned, \u201cboooooring.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the headset left my vision though, I saw Jared\u2019s face. Of course his eyes were still brown, and his face full of color. His mouth on the other hand was still twisted in a smile that looked more hungry than happy. Calmly I sat in my usual spot handing off the gear and lighting a smoke of my own. As Jared put it on I considered my options, the hammer or my beer.
