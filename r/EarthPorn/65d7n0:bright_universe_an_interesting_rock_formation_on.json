Details! Details!\n--------------------------------\nFirst, the story!\n\nI was becoming seriously out of shape last summer and I had begun running again recently but felt the need to naturally push my body more.  I packed up my camera gear and got out of the city (Seattle, WA) and headed for one of my favorite places knowing it was going to be a bit of a death march toward the end -- High Camp on Mount Baker (I think it's at about 8,000 feet... maybe lower... felt like 8,000).  Anyway, its about a 5 mile hike.  I made camp, set up the tent AFTER setting up my tripods.  I set up my A7R II to begin some timelapse after I found a composition for it and then wandered (stumbled) around until I found a composition for my D810.  Even though it was summer the air temp was dropping pretty quick and this lower sort of marine layer started blowing in around 11.  I shot a lot and ended up catching an incoming storm.  It rained ice about 2 hours after the second of the photos for this composition was shot.  Long story short, borderline hypothermia all night, I packed up pretty quick after the sun rose and warmed things up a bit the next morning.  &lt;3\n\n\nNow Camera Stuff\n--------------------------------\nLarger image size should work nicely as a HQ phone wallpaper if you wanna save it ;)\n\nShot with a Nikon D810 14-24mm lens, 2 photo blend, same tripod location, foreground exposed for longer at lower ISO to draw out some of that post blue hour light and shot at 14mm, background shot at 14mm, higher ISO to bring out the brightness and colors in the Milky Way.  \n\n\nA picture of my actual camp that night under the Milky Way is on my IG today but doesn't work for EarthPorn per guidelines.  \n[I am @sky_folk on Insta](http://www.instagram.com/sky_folk)", "edited": 1492184874.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Details!
