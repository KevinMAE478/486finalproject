Dig around a little there and you will get all the details. Basically it's 20-21 people per day in groups of 1-6. 10 online, through a lottery done four months ahead. So this month (April)  they're auctioning off August. You have the whole month to submit, and anyone and everyone in your group can submit. It's $5/entry. You don't have to define the group at this point - but you do have to define the size (very different in person where only one entry per group). Basically on the first day of the next month, they draw out of the hat until they've drawn 10 people in however many groups were picked. So if a group of six is first, that only leaves four slots for the day. So imagine a group of six and then four. That's it - done. So you root for small groups to get picked. But hundreds of people apply online, so we figure the odds are around 50:1 to 100:1. But it happens. When we were out there last month, we ran into a gal coming out near Wire Pass who'd won in her first try online. Sigh. If you win a permit, you have a certain number of days to accept it, pay for it (by person), and confirm your group. Then just show up on the day in question and you're in. When you do the process, you can pick three days in the month up for auction. There are stats on the site that show you which days are most in demand etc.\n\nNow - in person works a little different. First of all, you show up at the BLM / Grand Staircase Escalante NM office in Kanab (just east of the cemetery). You are lottery picking for the next day - not the day of. It's one entry per group. When I was there on Tuesday March 21 through Thursday March 23, there were between 35-45 groups each day. And each day saw just 4-5 winners (by group). If they land on nine people in, they allow one extra person (so 11 in person) to discourage singles from going alone (although they allow it). All three days I was there, it lined up that 11 went in instead of 10. But basically show up, fill out the form, and wait for the lottery to start promptly at 9am. Know your timezones too as Arizona, Nevada and Utah all play by rules that will screw you up. The lottery takes no more than five minutes. If you lose, you leave and try again the next day. If you win, you pay for your group and in you go the next day. While I was 0-3 in person, there was great camaraderie within the room and you root for everyone to win at some point. On the last day, the last pair picked (#10-11) was on their 14th in person try... Happy to answer any other questions if desired.\n\nEdit to add: one other thing - so the site is about 28 miles from Kanab on the highway, and then another 8-10 miles off road (House Rock Rd.). You can drive the eight miles to Wire Pass parking without too much trouble although the road is not friendly and you might average 25-30mph. But once you pass the Wire Pass parking lot, you also leave Utah and enter Arizona, and the road is all sand. If you are going to Coyote Butte SOUTH, they will tell you you're an idiot if you don't take four-wheel drive in (and all points on House Rock Rd. south of Coyote Buttes South). The drive to North is 50/50. You can get there without 4WD, but hope it isn't too wet. They seem to delight at HQ of showing people pictures of getting completely stuck in softsand (and even a little quicksand under certain conditions) in their crossovers or small SUVs. You CAN park at Wire Pass (my buddy took his diesel passat down there and did fine) and still walk into the Wave from the north. About a mile down the wash to Wire Pass is an alternative route into North. Good luck - I'm trying again in the fall - online only - but may venture out in January or February to take my shot in person again... \n\nLast edit I swear: so the site above suggests ONLY entering from WirePass Wash and the easier parking lot.
