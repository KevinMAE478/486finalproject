millions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chorus\nThe flaming ribbons in his hat,\nThey looked so tearing fine, ah,\nI wanted dreadfully to get\nTo give to my Jemima.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chorus\nI see another snarl of men\nA digging graves they told me,\nSo &amp;#39;tarnal long, so &amp;#39;tarnal deep,\nThey &amp;#39;tended they should hold me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chorus\nIt scared me so, I hooked it off,\nNor stopped, as I remember,\nNor turned about till I got home,\nLocked up in mother&amp;#39;s chamber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chorus&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lego", "name":
