My younger brother and I shared a room at the time, at the end of the hallway. Somewhat of a visual, the hallway was kinda like a T intersection, one end of it was our room and the other end was my parent&amp;#39;s room. On the right side of the hall closest to our room was the bathroom, followed by my sister&amp;#39;s room. The &amp;quot;intersection&amp;quot; lead immediately to the living room. Well I would randomly wake up in the middle of the night to see a shadow cast on the hallway wall of a man wearing a brimmed hat. I would call to it thinking it was my dad and the bathroom light would immediately &amp;quot;turn off&amp;quot;. I putt it in quotes because the bathroom light switch was relatively oldand made an audible sound when it would turn off, but in the instances that I&amp;#39;d call to this shadow, no sound could be heard. After a few random nights of it happening I got out of bed and went to my dad&amp;#39;s room, to only find him asleep. That night in particular I proceeded to check the living room and my sister&amp;#39;s room, closed the bathroom door then went back to bed feeling very terrified. It had stopped a month or so, but then when my family decided to move to a different house it started happening almost every night leading up to the moment we moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the new house, I&amp;#39;m 12 now. The hallway in this home ends with the bathroom, brother and my room to the left of the bathroom, sister&amp;#39;s caddy corner to us, and my new baby brother caddy corner to them. I again wake up in the middle of the night, look up and see a shadow of a man in a brimmed hat. I call out asking who it is, with the same response as before. This continues to happen occasionally for a year, then stops. Fast forward again to age 14 going on 15. I&amp;#39;m now sleeping in my baby brothers old room as he&amp;#39;s now sleeping in my old room with my other brother. I always close my bedroom door both leaving and entering the room, so waking up in the middle of night with my door wide open and the shadow of the man visible is more unsettling as it ever has been. I call out with of course the same response, this time it happens every so often until I&amp;#39;m 17. The difference with this time however, is two of the nights I awaken to a man physically IN my room. He was wearing the same style hat as the shadow, but other than that I couldn&amp;#39;t really describe much detail. Features were visible, but I couldn&amp;#39;t and still can&amp;#39;t explain the Features themselves. When it was just the shadow, I had control of my body and could talk. The two times he was in my room, however, I couldn&amp;#39;t move. I could move my mouth to talk but I could hear what I felt like I was saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, I&amp;#39;m 26 going on 27. My gf and I live together, our room is right next to the bathroom. Last night I woke up to our bedroom door wide open, with the bathroom light casting a shadow of the man.. I&amp;#39;m the only man living here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked my dad when I was little about a man, he kept chalking it up to bad dreams so I never really brought it up to anyone after that. Also, not sure if it has any relevance to what I&amp;#39;ve already said but around age 16, on one night I heard a girl screaming two separate times. Both times I thought it was my sisters messing with me, but they denied it. A couple days later, my sister&amp;#39;s yelled at me sounding irritated. I came in asking what I had done and they told me to stop scaring them from the kitchen. Their bedroom had a sliding glass door that led to the patio and you could see the kitchen from inside their room. I kept insisting that I hadn&amp;#39;t been in the kitchen for at least an hour until they finally said that they saw what looked like a girl with shoulder length hair standing in front of the kitchen door staring through at them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone would have any suggestions as to what any of this could be, it would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have never went out of my way to ask anyone about something that has happened to me throughout my life, but it happened again last night so I figured I'd ask for opinions.\n\nIt all started when I was around 9-10 years old.
