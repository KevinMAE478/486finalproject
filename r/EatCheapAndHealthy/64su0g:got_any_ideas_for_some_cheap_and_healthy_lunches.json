You could have dinner -&gt; dinner leftovers and lunch -&gt; lunch if that makes sense? \n\n**Egg fried rice** \n\n1. Cook normal rice via boiling in pan or rice cooker, leave in fridge for later. \n1. Heat a bit of oil in pan, add frozen mixed veg (I have one that is peas, baby sweetcorn, peppers), let that at least defrost\n1. Chuck rice in + a bit of butter if you want, toss around a little, make a hole, add a couple of eggs, then scramble once they're part cooked, put a bit of salt in the eggs, then some soy sauce to taste to colour the rice. \n1.

Preheat a nonstick pan while whisking all the above together. \n1. Once pan is hot, pour some of the mixture in so it forms a thin crepe, the bottom should instantly cook/harden as it touches the pan, put lid on briefly, once the top is mostly solid, flip over.\n1.
