You absorb less of the nutrients without the fat. The nutrients in milk, vitamins D, E, and A, are fat-soluble, which means your body absorbs them better when they're delivered via fat. What's more, the vitamin K found naturally in butterfat gets left behind altogether.\n\n2. Skim and low-fat milk contain powdered milk, which is made with oxidised cholesterol, a carcinogen. Oxidised cholesterol can contribute to the build-up of plaque in your arteries. On the other hand, untreated cholesterol in whole milk is an antioxidant.\n\n3. Milk producers have started adding sugary flavouring to skim and low-fat milk to encourage kids to drink more of it. This means more empty calories in milk that releases fewer nutrients into your body. So that doesn't make a whole lotta sense.\n\n4. Skim can leave you feeling unsatisfied, which leads many people to fill up on less-healthy \"non-fat\" foods. This is because saturated fats like those found in whole milk trigger the release of the hormone cholecystokinin, which makes you feel full.\n\n5. Skim milk has been linked with \"transient\" weight loss in studies. This means you may lose some weight from cutting out whole milk at first, but then you're likely to gain back that weight.\n\n6. Fats slow the release of sugar into your bloodstream, reducing the amount that can be stored as fat. This is an argument for letting some \"healthy\" fats into your daily diet overall, and they don't have to come from milk. They can come from olive oil and nuts, for example.\n\nSo as counterintuitive as it sounds, it sounds like skim milk is only going to exacerbate the so-called obesity epidemic.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a large argument against drinking skim milk because it &lt;a href=\"http://time.com/3734033/whole-milk-dairy-fat/\"&gt;is associated with a higher obesity rate&lt;/a&gt; and the full-fat or semi-fat milk is actually better for you.
