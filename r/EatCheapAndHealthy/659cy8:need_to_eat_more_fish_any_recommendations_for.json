Here is a recipe that looks ok \nhttps://www.google.no/amp/www.food.com/amp/recipe/norsk-fiskegrateng-fish-au-gratin-113718 although you should add a little nutmeg in the sauce. when I do it I also add stuff like macaroni, leek or peas, but that is optional. I also beat the egg whites seperately and gently fold them into the rest of the mix to make the texture fluffier.\n\nSalmon in a white sauce based soup with carrots, leek, peas and chives is deilicious I think.\n\nSmoked fish is also something you should try. Cold smoked and hot smoked give very different results, you should see if you like either. Smoked fish is great on bread, with eggs, or in salads or pasta dishes I think.\n\n If you're willing to try raw fish you also open up a whole new world. Fish should be frozen before being eaten raw to kill any potential parasites, so I normally buy frozen cheap fish rather than the expensive \"sushi grade fresh fish\". My favourite is ceviche:\nfinely chopped red onion and fish (I use cod) in similar amounts, I use a little more fish than onion. Chop some coriander and chili for seasoning. Squeese some fresh lime and orange juice over and mix well. Only use enough to cover everything when mixed, it should not be soupy at all, a little goes a long way.

Just look at the fish content %, it varies quite a bit in my country at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fish balls: not what it sounds like! Common in scandinavia and china, its fish paste boiled in the shape of balls. You might get it in chinese shops. Here is a recipe &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.no/amp/s/thishungrykitten.com/2013/11/14/homemade-chinese-fish-balls-the-way-they-should-be-made/amp/Serve\"&gt;https://www.google.no/amp/s/thishungrykitten.com/2013/11/14/homemade-chinese-fish-balls-the-way-they-should-be-made/amp/Serve&lt;/a&gt; with simple white sauce with a little nutmeg, some potatoes or macaroni, raw shredded carrot or peas. White sauce with nutmeg and fresh veg balance out any fishy taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fish gratin: baked dish using the same white sauce trick as the balls but combining it with crispy breading om top. Here is a recipe that looks ok \n&lt;a href=\"https://www.google.no/amp/www.food.com/amp/recipe/norsk-fiskegrateng-fish-au-gratin-113718\"&gt;https://www.google.no/amp/www.food.com/amp/recipe/norsk-fiskegrateng-fish-au-gratin-113718&lt;/a&gt; although you should add a little nutmeg in the sauce. when I do it I also add stuff like macaroni, leek or peas, but that is optional. I also beat the egg whites seperately and gently fold them into the rest of the mix to make the texture fluffier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salmon in a white sauce based soup with carrots, leek, peas and chives is deilicious I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smoked fish is also something you should try. Cold smoked and hot smoked give very different results, you should see if you like either. Smoked fish is great on bread, with eggs, or in salads or pasta dishes I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re willing to try raw fish you also open up a whole new world. Fish should be frozen before being eaten raw to kill any potential parasites, so I normally buy frozen cheap fish rather than the expensive &amp;quot;sushi grade fresh fish&amp;quot;. My favourite is ceviche:\nfinely chopped red onion and fish (I use cod) in similar amounts, I use a little more fish than onion. Chop some coriander and chili for seasoning. Squeese some fresh lime and orange juice over and mix well. Only use enough to cover everything when mixed, it should not be soupy at all, a little goes a long way. The acid &amp;quot;cooks&amp;quot; the fish a little, and the fresh flavors remove any fishiness. I eat it with tortilla chips for crunch and a little salt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EatCheapAndHealthy", "name": "t1_dg8z1j5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492192550.0, "created_utc": 1492163750.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vvpi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659cy8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8mypx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TempAccount8891", "parent_id": "t3_659cy8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EatCheapAndHealthy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My boyfriend's mom hates the taste of fish, but she says that liquid smoke helps her actually enjoy milder fish like cod or flounder.
