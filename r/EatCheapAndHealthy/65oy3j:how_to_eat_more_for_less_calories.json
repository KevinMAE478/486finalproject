Slap it in a bowl.  810 calories.  Add 8oz of water.  Still 810 calories, but it takes up a lot more space.  It's essentially the same thing;  Water doesn't count as food.  Now add 100g of indigestible clay dirt to the mix.  Still 810 calories, but it's now also a fairly solid doughy mix.  We've added something else that _doesn't count_, because it's not food - it will exit your body as it entered.  It's still got the identical nutritional content as butter, but it will fill your belly a lot better.\n\nWho cares, though?  Filling your belly is a temporary thing.  If your body has persistent caloric deficits, it will find a way to inform your brainstem regardless of whether it's getting \"belly full\" signals.  We have an objective system to measure this stuff now - using it isn't a bad idea.  Count calories, not bites, not pounds.  Ten pounds of broccoli has ~1500 calories, which can be less than a single plateful of cookies.\n\nWith that said:\n\nTypically, long-term indigestion in an active, healthy person absent any autoimmune issues is believed to come from one of two things:\n\n* Complex carbohydrates, sugar alcohols, and fiber that is poorly digestible fermenting in the lower gut.\n\n* Complex carbohydrates, fiber, and protein that is not offset by a significant quantity of fat, or a high-fat diet that is not offset by these other things in turn.  Under this theory the digestion biproducts of foods that are not simple carbs need to balance each other out for the upper intestinal flora to aid in digestion;  If the ratio of one to the other is large, it's tricky for your intestinal flora to cope with, *particularly* if the ratio is not steady day to day, week to week.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I understand what you mean, here&amp;#39;s my perspective:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only really makes sense to quantify food primarily in terms of calories, while being aware of the macronutrient mix and the complex carbs/fibers as a secondary aspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a stick of butter.  Slap it in a bowl.  810 calories.  Add 8oz of water.  Still 810 calories, but it takes up a lot more space.  It&amp;#39;s essentially the same thing;  Water doesn&amp;#39;t count as food.  Now add 100g of indigestible clay dirt to the mix.  Still 810 calories, but it&amp;#39;s now also a fairly solid doughy mix.  We&amp;#39;ve added something else that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t count&lt;/em&gt;, because it&amp;#39;s not food - it will exit your body as it entered.  It&amp;#39;s still got the identical nutritional content as butter, but it will fill your belly a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who cares, though?  Filling your belly is a temporary thing.  If your body has persistent caloric deficits, it will find a way to inform your brainstem regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s getting &amp;quot;belly full&amp;quot; signals.
