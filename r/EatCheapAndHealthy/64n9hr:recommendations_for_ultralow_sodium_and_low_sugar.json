A very small portion of plain yogurt, cheese, or peanut butter can help make this type of snack feel more filling, so you are not left as hungry when it comes to the limited options for meals. For veggies - mixed frozen veg will usually be cheaper than fresh, yet still low in salt. Adding a bit of fat (oil, margarine, butter, whatever you normally use) can also help make them taste a little less boring, especially if you are also making use of herbs or other seasoning blends.

Some of your restrictions appear contradictory to me, some of the suggestions here are not necessarily kidney-friendly depending on what your nutrient restrictions are, and &amp;lt;1000 mg sodium seems awfully severe.  I don&amp;#39;t think my hospital even has a menu for that level of restriction and we have a dedicated renal inpatient unit and dialysis unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few tips that are hopefully useful - if you are ok with sugar from fruits, then canned peaches/pears (packed in water), apples, and berries (if in season) might be good options. A very small portion of plain yogurt, cheese, or peanut butter can help make this type of snack feel more filling, so you are not left as hungry when it comes to the limited options for meals. For veggies - mixed frozen veg will usually be cheaper than fresh, yet still low in salt. Adding a bit of fat (oil, margarine, butter, whatever you normally use) can also help make them taste a little less boring, especially if you are also making use of herbs or other seasoning blends. If I&amp;#39;m not mistaken, fat enhances our perception of flavour compounds.
