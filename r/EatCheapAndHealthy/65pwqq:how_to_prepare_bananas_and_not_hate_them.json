Maybe you've had some awful avocado, it's not hard to hate mushy overripe ones that make you gag.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biggest tip: eat just a little, you might find you start enjoying them more over time. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bananas and avocados are the same in that there is a ripeness preference. You can eat both in varying stages of ripeness. I&amp;#39;ve always preferred slightly green bananas, some people won&amp;#39;t touch them until they&amp;#39;re spotted. Underripe avocado is like latex rubber to me, I like a nutty and fruity sweetness to themed for them to be soft but not gooshy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avocado varieties and growing locations also make a huge difference. California grown Hass are my top pick. Flick the stem off, if it&amp;#39;s green underneath it&amp;#39;s a good one and you just have to let it ripen to your preference. Once ripe, they stay that same ripeness in a paper bag in the fridge for days. Takes a bit of experience to learn what color skin and softness you like.
