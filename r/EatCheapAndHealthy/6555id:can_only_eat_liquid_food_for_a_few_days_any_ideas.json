The nice thing about smooth soups is that they're very customizable and you can always add more water or stock to thin them out. You can even go really out of the box and do some sort of curry-coconut soup, add some sweet potato to blend in it as well - the fat in the coconut milk should help you feel full, and I feel like that would be delicious cold! Kefir always makes me feel extremely full since it's so rich, so I would also suggest that if you can find it (also can add to smoothies). You can try adding a nut butter, protein powder, dates, or oats to your smoothie to try and get a little more filling stuff in there.

Tsp or so.) \n- vege or chicken stock (depending on whether you want to go full veg or don't mind a bit of animal products) \n- coconut cream or milk (depending on how creamy you want it - milk for a lighter soup, cream for a creamier one)\n\nSaute off the onion, then add fresh spices, when all that is softened and cooked down, add the dry spices and get that curry base going. Chuck in your veggies - pumpkin and carrot, lentils or sweet potatoes can also be a good combo. Add in your stock, and let it simmer for minimum 30-40 mins, but honestly you can let it slow cook on a really low heat for as long as you want. Once everything is cooked and soft as hell, blend it all up (off the heat!) After you've blended and it's off the boil, add in your coconut milk/cream. \n\nAdjust all the quantities according to your taste. My mama's pumpkin soup doesn't have the spices (does have the onion) and uses chicken noodle packet soup as the stock basis. \n\n**Noodle soup** - look up Nigella Express and use the Noodle Soup For Needy People recipe/guide. It's basically udon noodles and whatever you have at hand cooked in a chicken stock. Her Chilli Con Carne recipe in this book is also what I use for chilli, and it's total comfort food. So good! \n\nSavoury mince... to be honest, it's one of those dishes where I've never managed to get it right! Mum's always tastes better, and mine tastes like a total fucking disaster AND HONESTLY... when I had my wisdom teeth out, I flew my mum over from Tassie to Victoria to look after me through the worst of it, so she made this for me! \n\nEDIT: reading the rest of the thread, the protein shakes are a really good idea and I so should have done that!

I'll copy and paste the content here for your convenience.\n\n&gt; Yeah, it's pretty good. My wife broke her jaw about a month ago and had her mouth wired shut, so we've been finding ways to make foods that she can eat. She has to let the croutons absorb some of the hollandaise before they're soft enough for her to smoosh on the roof of her mouth with her tongue and swallow. She *hates* soup. So we are finding non-soup foods that we can soupify. I found her a novelty size straw so she can suck up thick liquids and chunky foods through it. I think it's a \"boba tea\" straw or something like that. Anyway.\n\n&gt; Some of her other favorites have been\n\n&gt; * Pizza soup. This is basically just pizza sauce with minced olives, pepperoni, parmesan cheese, and more croutons.\n\n&gt; * Soup Rangoon. This is a soup of creamcheese mixed with lobster or seafood stock (too hard to find crab stock at my store) with green onion, garlic salt, and crispy fried wonton croutons (it's really just fried wonton shells that I put in the food processor for a few pulses.\n\n&gt; * Sunday Roast soup. This basically amounts to a big bowl of gravy with some overcooked peas floating in it and yorkshire pudding croutons on top.\n\n&gt; * Popcorn soup. We make this when we watch movies. For this we melt down a stick of butter and mix it with a slurry of cornstarch and water with a little ground up popcorn mixed in. I have to run the popcorn through the blender and a sieve to keep the kernels out of her throat (hard to get them out when your teeth are wired shut!)\n\n&gt; * Toast soup. We use a few big spoonfuls of margarine for this soup base, as she claims it somehow tastes better with toast than normal butter. We make a roux with flour, but we mix in a big spoonful of marmite for flavor and b vitamins. We've been adding crumpet croutons to this one lately.\n\n&gt; * Pancake soup. This 1 cup butter and 1 cup maple syrup with a sprinkling of spongecake croutons. \n\n&gt; * Shephard's soup. Watered down mashed potatoes with corn and peas and bits of carrot. You really have to water down the mashed potatoes so that you can get all the chunks through the straw.\n\n&gt; That's pretty much all we've been eating for the entire month.
