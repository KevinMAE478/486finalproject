I do recommend adding them dry instead of soaking them as you would usually do, but if you are using the smaller ones maybe you can rinse off some of the strong flavor before. It is really up to you, the recipe is very forgiving.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Add the olive oil to a hot pan, once it's hot add the chopped onions, carrots and bell pepper. Saute with a teaspoon of salt and black pepper until translucent (3-5 minutes)\n2. Add the garlic and dried spices, stir to combine and cook for another minute.

The pan will get dry quickly, just continue stirring for 30 seconds to a minute and then add the canned tomatoes. Stir to combine, taste and adjust the seasoning. Add the mung beans.\n5.
