Pickles will last about 1 month.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nerdswithknives.com/korean-bulgogi-burritos/\"&gt;http://www.nerdswithknives.com/korean-bulgogi-burritos/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love pickles of all kinds because it&amp;#39;s such a great way to make vegetables last. These radishes will keep for over a month just in the refrigerator. It&amp;#39;s a super simple pickle that is really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used it in Korean Burritos (that&amp;#39;s what the link is above) but you could use them any way you like regular pickles. I cut the daikon into strips because they would work better in the burritos but you could just slice them into rounds or half moons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes one large jar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1\u00bd cups (355ml) water&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1\u00bd cups (355ml) unseasoned rice vinegar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00bd cup (100g) sugar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 tablespoon (15g) kosher salt&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 medium cloves garlic, halved lengthwise&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon turmeric powder&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15 whole black peppercorns&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 bay leaves&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 pound (450g) daikon radish, peeled and cut into 4- by \u00bc-inch strips (or thin disks)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Directions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a medium saucepan, stir together water, vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, turmeric, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to ensure that sugar fully dissolves. Remove from heat and add daikon. Press a paper towel directly against the surface of the brine and let cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transfer pickles and brine to an airtight glass container and store in the refrigerator. (The turmeric will stain a plastic container yellow.)
