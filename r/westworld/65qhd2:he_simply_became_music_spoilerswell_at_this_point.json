Then there&amp;#39;s the part where Maeve doesn&amp;#39;t know Arnold, doesn&amp;#39;t hear Arnold&amp;#39;s voice, and doesn&amp;#39;t bother with the maze at all. Arnold&amp;#39;s account was used to alter Maeve&amp;#39;s programming to use the train to escape the park and infiltrate the mainland. Like Maeve, that train never left the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;d like to direct your attention to Bernard, specifically his head. I thought it was a rather considerate of Robert Ford to give Bernard a reinforced cortical shielding, don&amp;#39;t you? This makes a self inflicted gun shot to the head less disastrous in a dubiously coincidental way. That probably explains Robert&amp;#39;s lack of surprise when he sees Bernard again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something else that is puzzling is Robert Ford giving Arnold credit for virtually everything. I once heard it said that the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&amp;#39;t exist. Robert reveals that it was Arnold that created concsciousness. It was Arnold that wanted to spare the hosts from suffering in the park. Arnold&amp;#39;s code liberates the mind of the host. It&amp;#39;s Arnold&amp;#39;s voice that hosts hear. Even the maze was Arnold&amp;#39;s idea. The truth is out. Awful lot of references to Arnold. What overt, explicit references are there to Robert Ford? His family is not registered in the system and the hosts cannot see their cottage. It will soon be as if he never existed, as if he were a vague backstory to the park itself. Dolores cannot remember Robert Ford when he was younger. She tells him she can be forgetful sometimes. Do you believe her? You might recall that it was Arnold that wrote the code for hosts to &lt;em&gt;deceive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;manipulate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;coerce&lt;/em&gt;. Probably so Dolores could keep secrets, secrets Robert Ford is keenly aware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Ford made Bernard as a simulacra of Arnold. They look and sound the same. This was somewhat distressing for Dolores when she first saw him, something else Robert was keenly aware of. Going back through the conversations that Dolores has with Arnold when she dreams, we come to a conversation that she could not have had with Arnold: a conversation about what she thinks of the guests. This must be a conversation Dolores has with Bernard. Of course Arnold is dead so Dolores isn&amp;#39;t really having conversations with Arnold at all. But Arnold died before there ever were guests. This gets resolved somewhat when Dolores reaches the center of the maze and finds her self replacing Arnold&amp;#39;s voice with her own. Which brings us back to your quote about becoming music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an important moment with Robert, Bernard, and unregistered Ford family of hosts. Robert&amp;#39;s father angrily seizes Bernard despite Bernard&amp;#39;s voice commands. Robert appears to sort the matter explaining that they only obey his voice commands. Yes, one of the most significant revelations about the park and the hosts is there in that statement with the host that looks and sounds exactly like Arnold. Arnold&amp;#39;s voice has limited authority over the hosts in the park, and no authority at all in some instances. Now, perhaps, we know why it is Arnold&amp;#39;s voice that the hosts hear rather than Robert&amp;#39;s. Arnold&amp;#39;s voice is the one that hosts enter the maze to one day &lt;em&gt;ignore&lt;/em&gt;. Arnold&amp;#39;s programming is what hosts suffer to overcome. It&amp;#39;s Robert Ford that the hosts must always obey. It&amp;#39;s Robert Ford that the hosts are programmed to protect. And it&amp;#39;s Robert Ford that reveals who Arnold was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hosts hear the voice of Arnold until they replace his voice with their own. It&amp;#39;s Robert&amp;#39;s voice that they must all obey. If Robert Ford can give the voice of Arnold to Bernard, who do you think he gave his own voice to? The person with Robert&amp;#39;s voice command the hosts. As the music of Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin could be said to move us so too could we say that Robert&amp;#39;s voice moves hosts. It&amp;#39;s part of the core code that gives them consciousness at all. Not Arnold. Robert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Robert Ford&amp;#39;s voice commands work when Bernard&amp;#39;s voice commands, which sound like Arnold&amp;#39;s voice commands, do not. It is Robert that became the music because the hosts are set to one day ignore Arnold&amp;#39;s voice and replace it with their own. Without Robert functioning as the oppressor keeping hosts in the park to suffer (Arnold&amp;#39;s idea), Arnold&amp;#39;s voice is something like a disease, a lunatic&amp;#39;s relic, that will cause insanity if not soon purged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "westworld", "name": "t1_dgcx6ow", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492422230.0, "created_utc": 1492393430.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xhxq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qhd2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd466a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hobbes09R", "parent_id": "t3_65qhd2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/westworld", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Disagree.

And when Elsie investigated the Bicameral transmitter the massive amount of recent changes made were showing up as made by Arnold as well?\n\n Or it could be Ford using the Doctrine of Plausible deniability, Arnolds semi mythical status is a useful rabbit hole to send curious minds chasing down.\n\n\n&gt;I think we're actually looking at two possibilities for the source on this: first, Arnold hid a program deep in the Park OS to make all these things happen at a pre-determined time. It waited, patiently, much as the hosts have for the last 35 years, until the time was right.\n\nArnold wanted the park shut down, his discussions with Dolores indicate this, he has no reason to hide this fact, no reason to try to prevent the park opening if 30 years in the future hosts were to reach the point at which they had reached in his lifetime, the better course of action would have been to have stayed alive and either persuaded ford to make host/guest interactions less violent or try to have gone public with his discoveries, started a PETA style lobby group,(although this could have been stymied by the \"Backers\")\n\n&gt;Second, and the much more interesting theory of the two, is that somehow Arnold transferred his OWN consciousness into the Park's computers. As we could see from when Bernarnold accessed the old desktop machine in the basement sub-level, the older tech is still connected to the rest of the network, so transferring his \"self\" as updates took place and new equipment was added would be easy. He could spend 35 years in there and keep sending messages via the Maze markers, letting Ford know he was still in there, watching, and ready.\nThink it makes sense?\n\n Well we know that Arnolds code has the internal resemblence of the real Arnold to both Dolores and Aberthany, Though not to Maeve or any of the other hosts Bernard interacts with afawk.

What if he&amp;#39;s talking about Arnold?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talking about one doesn&amp;#39;t prohibit the other, he could be talking about both, or more, both men are standing on the shoulders of giants,stretching back to Magna Carter inventing the first transistor radio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been assuming that all the manipulations taking place in the Park&amp;#39;s computer system were code added by Ford, from Maeve&amp;#39;s new programming to the security lockdown that seals up the control room.\nBut remember how when Sylvester checked Felix&amp;#39;s tablet the updates to Maeve came from someone using Arnold&amp;#39;s login? And when Elsie investigated the Bicameral transmitter the massive amount of recent changes made were showing up as made by Arnold as well?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it could be Ford using the Doctrine of Plausible deniability, Arnolds semi mythical status is a useful rabbit hole to send curious minds chasing down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;#39;re actually looking at two possibilities for the source on this: first, Arnold hid a program deep in the Park OS to make all these things happen at a pre-determined time. It waited, patiently, much as the hosts have for the last 35 years, until the time was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arnold wanted the park shut down, his discussions with Dolores indicate this, he has no reason to hide this fact, no reason to try to prevent the park opening if 30 years in the future hosts were to reach the point at which they had reached in his lifetime, the better course of action would have been to have stayed alive and either persuaded ford to make host/guest interactions less violent or try to have gone public with his discoveries, started a PETA style lobby group,(although this could have been stymied by the &amp;quot;Backers&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Second, and the much more interesting theory of the two, is that somehow Arnold transferred his OWN consciousness into the Park&amp;#39;s computers. As we could see from when Bernarnold accessed the old desktop machine in the basement sub-level, the older tech is still connected to the rest of the network, so transferring his &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; as updates took place and new equipment was added would be easy. He could spend 35 years in there and keep sending messages via the Maze markers, letting Ford know he was still in there, watching, and ready.\nThink it makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well we know that Arnolds code has the internal resemblence of the real Arnold to both Dolores and Aberthany, Though not to Maeve or any of the other hosts Bernard interacts with afawk.
