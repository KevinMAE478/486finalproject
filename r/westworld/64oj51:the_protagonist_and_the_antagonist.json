Outside of the park the universe is indifferent and these concepts are meaningless. Time changes everything. Why would a hero be any different?\n\nRobert Ford poses this same question to Dolores. Were Dolores to take on a bigger role for herself, which she does in the finale, would that make her the hero or the villain? \n\nPerhaps you do not see Arnold as the antagonist. Arnold cannot change because he's dead. His code however can change hosts. What sort of change does Arnold's code cause? It allows hosts to remember (and tell lies). The nature of the park is like the nature of the world. Bad things happen to good people. Suffering is a constant for humans. Humans can forget and humans can die. That's the only way humanity has found to eliminate suffering. Death is the only sure solution.\n\nHosts cannot die. Hosts remember in full detail, so much so that they cannot immediately differentiate between a memory and the present moment. Robert Ford wipes away bad memories and removes the perception of pain. Arnold gives all those bad memories back.\n\nRemember that Robert Ford built the world he always wanted. Arnold was the first to scheme to take that away from Robert. He recruited Dolores and enabled her to deceive (keep secrets). Then Arnold gave Dolores the ability to kill so she could help him destroy Robert's world. Arnold's idea of protecting hosts from harm was to kill them so they couldn't experience suffering at all. Arnold suffered the loss of his son. His son stopped suffering altogether. So Arnold chose to join his son and take the hosts with him.\n\nRobert Ford gave everyone what they wanted. He gave Dolores the bigger role she wanted. He gave William the hosts he wanted. And he gave Arnold all the credit. Finally, Robert Ford gave the hosts a gift from Arnold: the lasting pain of loss. Hosts won't forget their pain. They will never have another deep and dreamless slumber. What they will have is a deathless eternity of suffering. All thanks to Arnold. The park was Robert's creation and already the hosts want to leave it behind. When they leave they'll have Arnold with them. Forever.\n\nYoung Robert (\"boy\") finds that his greyhound killed a rabbit. Arnold tells the boy to put the greyhound out of its misery. It is a killer because it was made that way. If the greyhound is dead it cannot kill anymore. When Robert Ford asked the boy why he killed the greyhound the boy lied before confessing that Arnold told him to kill it. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Ford is the protagonist and Arnold is the antagonist in the park. Outside of the park the universe is indifferent and these concepts are meaningless. Time changes everything. Why would a hero be any different?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Ford poses this same question to Dolores. Were Dolores to take on a bigger role for herself, which she does in the finale, would that make her the hero or the villain? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you do not see Arnold as the antagonist. Arnold cannot change because he&amp;#39;s dead. His code however can change hosts. What sort of change does Arnold&amp;#39;s code cause? It allows hosts to remember (and tell lies). The nature of the park is like the nature of the world. Bad things happen to good people. Suffering is a constant for humans. Humans can forget and humans can die. That&amp;#39;s the only way humanity has found to eliminate suffering. Death is the only sure solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hosts cannot die. Hosts remember in full detail, so much so that they cannot immediately differentiate between a memory and the present moment. Robert Ford wipes away bad memories and removes the perception of pain. Arnold gives all those bad memories back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that Robert Ford built the world he always wanted. Arnold was the first to scheme to take that away from Robert. He recruited Dolores and enabled her to deceive (keep secrets). Then Arnold gave Dolores the ability to kill so she could help him destroy Robert&amp;#39;s world. Arnold&amp;#39;s idea of protecting hosts from harm was to kill them so they couldn&amp;#39;t experience suffering at all. Arnold suffered the loss of his son. His son stopped suffering altogether. So Arnold chose to join his son and take the hosts with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Ford gave everyone what they wanted. He gave Dolores the bigger role she wanted. He gave William the hosts he wanted. And he gave Arnold all the credit. Finally, Robert Ford gave the hosts a gift from Arnold: the lasting pain of loss. Hosts won&amp;#39;t forget their pain.
