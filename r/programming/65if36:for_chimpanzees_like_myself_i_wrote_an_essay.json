Not just because of some inaccuracies, but because the tone and style are going to severely mislead people into thinking you've taught them more than you have.\n\nFirstly, I don't think your explanation of ANNs or deep learning are acceptable.\n\nThey *appear* to hit the mechanics of the linear algebra correctly (we'll come back to this, the semantic problems are more pressing imo), but they get the semantics all wrong, insofar as they *impose semantics on the ANN at all*. The \"cheat code\" that they make isn't something like the one you describe [1]. In fact, it's not something that can be interpreted by humans at all.\n\nI say that the mechanics *appear* to be correct because they're just not. Looking at [2] shows a deep misunderstanding of how neural networks work. First of all, that matrix multiplication doesn't even work; the result is not going to be a 1x1 matrix. The important fact that you're missing is that by *repeatedly applying transformations of this type* (i.e., layers), a sufficiently deep neural net can -- via repeated application of these linear operations, a nonlinear activation function, and sufficient training -- approximate any measurable function! [3]\n\nAdditionally, you say at the top of the post that \"The aim is to take you from \\*I\u2019ve heard about this\\* to \\*I could give a lecture at the nearest university about this\\*, in 20 minutes.\" Well that's just a lie. Nobody who reads this article is reasonably prepared to even start working with neural networks yet, let alone *teach* about them. To be honest, it seems clear to me that the *you* are not even qualified to lecture about them. I certainly don't think *I* am, and I seem to have a better grasp on the situation than you do.\n\nI don't know much about self-driving cars, but I can't trust anything I just read about them, because you punted pretty hard on the stuff I do know about.\n\nTL;DR: You don't understand the material you're purporting to be teaching about. \n\n[1] \"If you see anything that looks brown-ish from all angles, seems to have four leathery legs like pillars, large flapping ears, and a thick long nose coming out of its face like a big tube, and is fat and bigger than you are, then that\u2019s an elephant and you need to stay away.\"\n\n[2] https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kQtpSSS6H4Y24M81ChdCvA.png\n\n[3] https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2375/f6d71ce85a9ff457825e192c36045e994bdd.pdf\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention nonlinearities", "edited": 1492299756.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really, really dislike this post. Not just because of some inaccuracies, but because the tone and style are going to severely mislead people into thinking you&amp;#39;ve taught them more than you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I don&amp;#39;t think your explanation of ANNs or deep learning are acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to hit the mechanics of the linear algebra correctly (we&amp;#39;ll come back to this, the semantic problems are more pressing imo), but they get the semantics all wrong, insofar as they &lt;em&gt;impose semantics on the ANN at all&lt;/em&gt;. The &amp;quot;cheat code&amp;quot; that they make isn&amp;#39;t something like the one you describe [1]. In fact, it&amp;#39;s not something that can be interpreted by humans at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say that the mechanics &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be correct because they&amp;#39;re just not. Looking at [2] shows a deep misunderstanding of how neural networks work. First of all, that matrix multiplication doesn&amp;#39;t even work; the result is not going to be a 1x1 matrix. The important fact that you&amp;#39;re missing is that by &lt;em&gt;repeatedly applying transformations of this type&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., layers), a sufficiently deep neural net can -- via repeated application of these linear operations, a nonlinear activation function, and sufficient training -- approximate any measurable function! [3]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you say at the top of the post that &amp;quot;The aim is to take you from *I\u2019ve heard about this* to *I could give a lecture at the nearest university about this*, in 20 minutes.&amp;quot; Well that&amp;#39;s just a lie. Nobody who reads this article is reasonably prepared to even start working with neural networks yet, let alone &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; about them.

Humans evolved as a species that thrives in groups, and groups compete over scarce resources. And we do not have to look back at our ancestors to see this in practice. Even today, nations and groups within nations fight over access to limited resources (e.g., water, good land, ports, oil, etc). Classic social psychological research demonstrates that it is very easy to pit groups against one another if they are competing for a scarce resource. Remember the television show Survivor? Therefore, one cause of racism may be an innate proclivity towards group conflict in the service of resource acquisition. Of course, this is extremely problematic and maladaptive in the modern interconnected and mobile world. However, when humans evolved, our world was much different. Our brains evolved for that world, not the modern world we live in today. Therefore, we must strive to have belief systems that reject what may be a natural inclination to not trust or hold negative attitudes about people who look different than us. We have made a lot of progress, but we still have a long road ahead of us if there is any truth to the assertion that prejudice may be rooted in basic survival motives.\n\nThe government loves it when people overcome such biases, because such biases are bad for business in the short term; nobody cares about the long term political instabilities which will result from these policies. It's dogmatic, because you just behave according to how someone else wants you to behave without ever having heard a justification for such behaviour. I am sure people might say it's more \"fair\" or whatever. Fact is that mass immigration like in the EU is happening and mass segregation is a huge security risk. Not because of the tens of terrorists that we probably imported, but because those people are racists themselves, which means that the probability that I will be murdered in 50 years is increased, based on history. \n\nImmigration, which is not directly what this is about, but which is very relevant, is just a bad idea. The EU does not have the capacity to import 50 million people. I am not so much against helping people, but in that case we should have built a military which can intervene; apparently, we are just weak and preferred to exploit Africa for decades instead. If we decided long ago to just fuck Africa, why should we now then start helping them? It's insane, and honestly, I don't believe the EU on a political level wants to help in any way. There are some relief actions where the population gets to show that it cares, but the nation states themselves do not care.\n\nFact is, like I said, that mass immigration threatens the long term livelihood of EU citizens. There are some solutions to this problem; one is less breeding, another one is a war, and finally there is starvation. All of them are happening right now. \n\nThe refugee crisis is not a crisis. It's a result of foreign policy (keeping dictators in place such that we could rape Africa) in combination with climate change (which we have known about for decades). \n\nOne final point, let's assume that Africa is just a breeding machine which produces children at a higher rate than the EU (which is already the case) and we keep on allowing them to immigrate, it just means that there won't be a white race left within not too many decades.
