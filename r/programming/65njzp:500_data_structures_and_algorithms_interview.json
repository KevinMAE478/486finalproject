If you&amp;#39;d use a known one it wouldn&amp;#39;t be magic it would be something you can add a comment with a link to in Wikipedia and not something you would write a blog post about. What you&amp;#39;re talking about is language specific optimizations(they are algorithms but not the ones I&amp;#39;m talking about) and I advice against those. Design patterns are separate across multiple files or even multiple services and people accept them just fine, but if you show a design pattern to a new programmer he won&amp;#39;t understand it unless you explain it or he does some reading, or worst he will start using it without even knowing why. Algorithms are 15 lines of code and you can add a comment stating which one it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Programmers should know about design patterns and algorithms, you don&amp;#39;t need to know their implementation, that&amp;#39;s something you can look up when needed. You need to recognize the problems they solve and their variations because many times two problems look very different but can be solved in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_dgcwy0g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492421900.0, "created_utc": 1492393100.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65njzp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd8rc2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CODESIGN2", "parent_id": "t1_dgcpqvp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/programming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wrap the complexity into a lib then...

I find defenses of technical interviews always fall back on &amp;quot;explaining what you&amp;#39;re doing is a valuable skill for a programmer,&amp;quot; but like you said, literally nobody is expected to explain what they&amp;#39;re doing while they&amp;#39;re thinking about it for the first time. I might even be okay with technical interviews if they left me in a room for a half hour or whatever and let me come up with a solution, and then could present it to the interviewer. That would at least be closer to the type of work expected out of someone on the job, and it would still test my ability to present things clearly. But instead there&amp;#39;s this insane expectation that I&amp;#39;m supposed to talk out loud and think about the solution at the same time. It would be like interviewing piano players and forcing them to sing along as they&amp;#39;re playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In college sometimes the professor would ask the class a question - think about the runtime of an algorithm, or how to implement a data structure, etc - and tell us to discuss it with the person next to us. What I noticed is that literally as soon as people had heard the question, they all started talking out loud immediately to their neighbor. But they had barely even thought about the question - they just started talking in circles. I would usually tell my neighbor to give me a minute or so to think, and then we could compare what we&amp;#39;d come up with. And almost every time my neighbor and I would come up with the right solution faster than everyone else because we weren&amp;#39;t trying to talk and think at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_dgcbeqb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393300.0, "created_utc": 1492364500.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc83xf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "neoform", "parent_id": "t1_dgc6sm2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/programming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; It really depends on the details, but we talk to them about what they are doing, what they know about it and what they don't.
