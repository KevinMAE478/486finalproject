For example, t2.micro starts with 30 cpu credits, where 1cr=1min 100%CPU, and earns 12cr per hour. If we disregard the initial credit, which exists to handle mostly startup performance, then you have 12 minutes of full cpu utilisation per hour. Knowing that you can use this instance for a single threaded build server which executes high intensity builds less than 12 mins long every hour. Although his example is quite specific, i am sure you can extrapolate this. At the end of the day is just a way of saving some money. I will be cautious to recommend this for prod deployment as you do not have a guaranteed cpu rate. Also i would say the t instances are not really comparable with DO&amp;#39;s instances because of the cpu max itilisation variability. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_dg6e8d9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492053703.0, "created_utc": 1492024903.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ynua", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6n8ma", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ForSureLying", "parent_id": "t1_dg6711o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/programming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've deployed apps to burstable VM types on AWS.
