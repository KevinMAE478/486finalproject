The Button was really cool, and it spawned a ton of interesting discourse (that persists to this day and continues to be pretty amusing), but it didn&amp;#39;t really extend much further than that. There was really nothing else to it - you either pressed it or you didn&amp;#39;t, and you went to the subreddit to discuss your decision.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robin, on the other hand, required real dedication and engagement to get to the higher levels - I believe I stayed in a room for 12 - 15 hours, and much of that I was glued to my screen, chatting and monitoring what the other rooms were doing. I was in a room that broke the record towards the end. It was a pretty awesome experience - everyone in chat had been there for &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;, just waiting to merge, and when we finally did, everyone was just going crazy with excitement. I&amp;#39;ll never forget that experience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed the last 3 April Fools projects equally.
