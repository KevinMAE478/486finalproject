You can&amp;#39;t learn Rust while converting a C project to Rust. You are not experienced enough in the language just because you finished the tutorial (no matter how awesome the tutorial is). You need to have some experience with a medium size project over some ammount of time. There are a lot of things that you simply don&amp;#39;t learn until you have to solve them on a real life project, related to the language, the tools you use, the dependency solver etc (quick example: did you knew that MSVC may generate SSE instructions if it sees fit? And that you can&amp;#39;t turn it off for x64 code? No big deal, right? What if you&amp;#39;re building something like a kernel and that SSE instructions get executed before you enabled the future on the CPU? Do you think this is easy to debug, diagnose and fix or that you learn it from a tutorial?). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add this into the mix and converting projects comes at even a higher price. Yes, our job, among other things, is to learn new frameworks. But a large project mantained by experts in language A can be rewritten in B only by peeople who have a solid experience in both languages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since you&amp;#39;re not doing blind conversion (you want to use those powerful features of Rust, don&amp;#39;t you?) you need to rethink some of the project&amp;#39;s design in order to take full advantage of that the language can offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An added risk comes from the fact that the language is new and you simply don&amp;#39;t know how it will evolve and how that might bite you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
