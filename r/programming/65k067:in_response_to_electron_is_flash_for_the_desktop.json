It democratized access to publishing creative works and designing media-rich websites on the internet. How is that a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it helped with the evolution, it was a necessary evil. But it was badly put together, full of security holes (just look at this &lt;a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-6761/Adobe-Flash-Player.html\"&gt;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-6761/Adobe-Flash-Player.html&lt;/a&gt;) and performed poorly (used a lot of resources, drained battery fast). One of my laptops was overheating from flash content more than from some games! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could argue that Electron goes through the same stages as flash, only much quicker. And that&amp;#39;s good: we got rid of flash (almost) so we should get rid of electron. I get his point of view, but Electron isn&amp;#39;t exactly the only alternative, as people have said over and over again. It&amp;#39;s not even the better alternative.
