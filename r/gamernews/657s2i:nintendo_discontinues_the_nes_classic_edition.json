They&amp;#39;re not making out on making NES Classics now and cashing in on the brand, so that when they make the NES Classic 2 or 3 or even the Switch, people get the impression from the original NES Classic (and the high prices it goes for on the secondary market), that Nintendo hardware is somehow rare and desirable. If the NES Classic was flooding every goodwill like the over produced Rock Band stuff, no one would want an NES Classic 2, much like no one now really wants Rock Band stuff. Do you think short selling the NES Classic is going to increase or decrease hype and demand for an NES Classic 2?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying I like what they&amp;#39;re doing, or that you have to like it, I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s the smartest strategy ever, but it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious why they&amp;#39;re doing what they do. They don&amp;#39;t hate money, they like it, they&amp;#39;re just not maxing out on making money now, because they feel they can make more money long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamernews", "name": "t1_dg9arju", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213543.0, "created_utc": 1492184743.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94kho", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shibby523", "parent_id": "t1_dg92s1z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamernews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "By bringing up the online part was just furthering my point that Nintendo is behind and has no interest in making things easier for their customers.
