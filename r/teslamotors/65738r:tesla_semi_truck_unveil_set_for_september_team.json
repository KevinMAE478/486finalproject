For most people who travel for work flying and renting a normal car will always be the most economical way of travel both in cost and time. Semi trucks are also designed to tow upwards of 100,000 pounds with trailer lengths of up to 56' in the US. An 8' wide 56' long trailer is a lot of space for a single person and would be one of the largest RV trailers produced and would weigh half of what a loaded semi trailer of the same size would. Trailers of that size are also the same price as a house in some places costing upwards of $200,000 and then the cost of the tow vehicle which can be $50,000-$150,000 depending on the make, model and outfitting of the cab (basic work truck all the way up to limo-level luxury). \n\nI think that in this area we will see the most usage is from the medium duty trucks similar to box trucks or single rear axle semi trucks. The \"living space\" lengths will probably be anywhere from 20-40' with the smaller ones being much more common. I very much like the idea, I think you are just vastly over estimating the size and prevalence of these vehicles. I think the most common vehicle of this type (combined travel and living space) will probably be something around the size of a large passenger van. Sportsmobile is a company that converts vans built on a 3/4-1 ton chassis (standard \"classes\" are 1/2, 3/4 and one ton which describe the \"heavy duty\"ness of the vehicle suspension, frame and drivetrain) into small 4x4 RV's that are perfectly sized for 1-2 people.

This system would be designed to be able to transport not just people like a standard train, but also cargo and vehicles similar to many ferries used today for water crossings.
