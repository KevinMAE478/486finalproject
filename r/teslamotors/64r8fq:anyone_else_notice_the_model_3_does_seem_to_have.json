Fully loaded Model 3 should position at the cost of a base Model S. The same $ should get either a faster, better equipped Model 3 or a more exclusive Model S with the same driving range. \nWhat I&amp;#39;m expecting to see when the M3 arrives, is a reduction in the cost of some of the options for the Model S. Hardware cost goes down with volume and it will be hard to justify selling the same autopilot hardware for more when mounted in the Model S than when it is mounted in the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teslamotors", "name": "t1_dg4x0r2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973251.0, "created_utc": 1491944451.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4qjp3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "daringone", "parent_id": "t1_dg4qgy3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teslamotors", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd say $100k+ to literally tick every box.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say $100k+ to literally tick every box.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teslamotors", "name": "t1_dg4qjp3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966137.0, "created_utc": 1491937337.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4qgy3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dericiouswon", "parent_id": "t1_dg4klvj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teslamotors", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What I mean is when there is no more options left offered by Tesla.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I mean is when there is no more options left offered by Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teslamotors", "name": "t1_dg4qgy3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966055.0, "created_utc": 1491937255.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4klvj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "daringone", "parent_id": "t1_dg4je1b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teslamotors", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Depends on what you mean by \"fully stocked\".
