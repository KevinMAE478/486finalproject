Here&amp;#39;s the tricky part, if a bucket with a higher price starts selling enough, then it reduces the available fares in the lower buckets as well. The airline is continually running a system that looks at the fares selling on every one of its legs to determine if buckets should be left open for selling or closed or if special buckets need to be opened up or the number of fares available in a bucket should be changed.

However, most of these &amp;quot;duds&amp;quot; only had 1-2 cores not perform up to standards, so instead of trashing it, they can disable/disconnect it and sell it as a 4/6-core unit because it has that many functioning cores. Literally one extra step in manufacturing that takes place after QC, they salvage the duds and re-brand them as the fewer-core models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard drive manufacturers also do this! Most hard drives use platters that can be read on both sides, so how come you end up with odd denominations of GB/TB counts on product pages? This is because sometimes there&amp;#39;s imperfections in a platter side and all they do is have the controller ignore it when writing and voil\u00e0, you have a 3TB hard drive instead of a 4. This is especially common in high-cap disk drives because you can&amp;#39;t really ignore imperfections since space is at such a premium (especially on cheaper systems).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teslamotors", "name": "t1_dge7za8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496320.0, "created_utc": 1492467520.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3j5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65trtg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3j5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65trtg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkb81", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZorbaTHut", "parent_id": "t1_dgdjs8y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teslamotors", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; From the consumers perspective, late activations should be priced lower, not higher.\n\nThen people would just buy a low-end car and upgrade it the next day.

It will cost a million dollars to do the molding, design, and validation, but then manufacturing costs are essentially zero. You go around to your various customers and get a sense of what they'd be willing to pay. Your conclusion:\n\n* At five dollars per widget, you could sell 150,000 widgets\n* At fifty dollars per widget, you could sell 15,000 widgets\n\nWell there's a problem here. Each of these widget designs gets you $750,000 of revenue, in exchange for $1,000,000 in startup costs. This is not a viable business.\n\nSo then you think, well, maybe we can make a lower-end widget - we'll call it Widget Mini. Lower-tolerance parts means a cheaper startup; only $800,000, and . . .\n\n. . . well, that's already not looking viable, but you ask around and it turns out the $5 crew is pretty happy with the idea (140,000 estimated sales) but nobody else gives a shit.\n\nHow about a higher-end widget? Widget Enterprise! It will cost $1,100,000 for startup costs! Turns out there's a market for this - you can now sell widgets for *five thousand dollars*, and you've got a market of . . . 150 people. That's still $750,000 of revenue. This is not going to work.\n\nAnd while you could make Widget Mini, Widget Standard, *and* Widget Enterprise, you'll end up paying a painful $2,900,000 for startup costs on all three of them, and make maybe $2,250,000 in revenue. Ouch.\n\n----\n\nSo here's what you do.\n\nFirst, you start building Widget Enterprises. $1,100,000 for startup costs.\n\nHow much do you sell them for? Well, if you sell them for $5,000, you'll miss out on those 150,000 customers who want it at $5. But if you sell them for $5, you miss out on those 150 super-valuable customers happy to fork over $5,000 each. They'll still buy it, of course - they'll just buy it for $5 instead of $5,000.\n\nSo you artificially limit the widgets. Maybe another $100,000 gets put into software limiters. Every time your factory spits out a widget, you assign it to the Widget Mini, Widget Standard, or Widget Enterprise line. Yeah, each widget is *technically* capable of being a Widget Enterprise, but the software says \"no\".\n\nThis feels awful because you're artificially limiting your product. But on the other hand . . .\n\n* 140,000 people buy Widget Mini for $5 each. Revenue: $700,000\n* 15,000 people buy Widget Standard for $50 each. Revenue: $750,000\n* 150 people buy Widget Enterprise for $5,000 each. Revenue: $750,000\n\nTotal revenue: $2,200,000  \nTotal cost: $1,200,000\n\nAnd boom, you have a successful business.\n\nPlus, now you can start selling software unlocks - $45 for an update if you own Widget Mini and realize you wanted Widget Standard. Chances are good that's another hundred thousand bucks or so.\n\n----\n\nMaking physical products is *really expensive*. Making more variations of physical products is *also really expensive*. The ideal situation is where you make as many things as you can, but as few *different* things as you can, and everyone who's willing to pay more than production cost forks over \"as much money as they're willing\".\n\nBut in reality, nobody's going to voluntarily pay more, so you end up doing this weird marketing dance where you're giving people incremental improvements for a lot more money.\n\nWant to buy a Roomba? Buy a Roomba 650 for only $375. That's probably slightly over the cost of research+development+production. Not good enough? Buy a Roomba 860 for $500. It has a better suction system! Does that cost them $125 to put in? *Fuck no it doesn't*, I bet it's ten bucks of parts, but people who are willing to fork over $500 for \"a robotic vacuum\" are going to buy that instead. Another $200 gets you the Roomba 960 which has wifi connectivity plus, what, two extra software features? And then *another* $200 gets you the Roomba 980 which has \"carpet boost\", which is where it recognizes it's on carpet and ramps up the motor. I bet it's just software. There's no cost here. You're paying $200 for something they could slap into every model for free.\n\nCPUs do the same thing. Intel makes a CPU, then figures out how fast it is - that's called \"binning\" - then sells it for the most money they can, right? But after the first batch, they tend to get quality up enough that they're making more high-end CPUs than they can sell. So they just lock the CPU to a lower frequency and sell it as an inferior CPU. *Because that's how to maximize revenue*.\n\n----\n\nThis is all silly. Everyone knows it's silly. Everyone would love to be able to stop doing it.\n\nBut until we come up with an economic system that still encourages research and development, but doesn't rely on revenue to do so, we're stuck with it.\n\n----\n\nAnd that's why you can upgrade your Tesla in software.", "edited": 1492436994.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a widget manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People like widgets, and you have come up with a new kind of widget.
