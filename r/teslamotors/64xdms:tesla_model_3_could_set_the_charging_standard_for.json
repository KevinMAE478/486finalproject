Let&amp;#39;s say Mod 3 releases with charger v2 and a year later the V3 comes out and cuts the charge time down from 45+ mins to ~15 mins-- there wouldn&amp;#39;t be a way to &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; your charger right?   I&amp;#39;d be OK missing out on all the new tech that is added in later editions of the model 3, but I would feel a rage of jealousy at a substantially reduced charging time.
