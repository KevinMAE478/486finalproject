This was not a healthy company and the acquisition was incestuous at best, (It was run by Elon&amp;#39;s cousins) and a bailout to benefit Elon and his companies at worst (Elon had $475 million tied up in SCTY secured by personal loans, Space X had $165 million tied up in SCTY)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to white wash it by saying it enables synergies by letting them offer solar + battery + car, there would have been much, much better ways to accomplish this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way it played out really does question if Elon breached his fiduciary duty.  Now that Tesla is a $50 Billion dollar company, shenanigans like this wont fly.
