In other words, the Demon is literally a 9.65 quarter mile car with a drivetrain warranty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.allpar.com/news/2017/04/the-2018-demon-everything-there-is-to-know-37153\"&gt;http://www.allpar.com/news/2017/04/the-2018-demon-everything-there-is-to-know-37153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teslamotors", "name": "t1_dg6ko75", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492060453.0, "created_utc": 1492031653.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65upt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EbolaFred", "parent_id": "t1_dg64dfq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teslamotors", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Then it comes down to reliability.\n\nLet's see how the 840hp Hellcat-in-heat Demon works out in this department, lol.\n\nI love following your posts.

Tesla's claim to fame is its instant torque which allows it to get off the line\n\nAWD + very good initial torque + lack of shifting(for more %time during launch at peak traction limited output) [See Related](http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-0-100-0-test/).[1]\n\n&gt; Thats the nature of EV's.  Very short races (think 1/8th mile or less) and from a dig, they are excellent. Pretty much anything else, they're not competitive.\n\nI wouldn't hold that as inviolable.  IINM, BEVs are adopting newer implementations of (cells, motors) higher and higher current ratings with better cooling mechanisms and power peaks.  [Some random EV co from China has already set 7:05 on Nurburgring (would rank 4th among production vehicle times)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/the-nio-ep9-is-the-fastest-ev-at-the-nurburgring-and-now-we-have-the-full-video/)[2]; I'm WAG they'd be faster if they implemented [Lamborghini aero-vectoring](http://www.motortrend.com/news/lamborghini-unveils-ring-master-huracan-performante/)[3].  Some of these technologies will trickle down to less exotic BEVs in indeterminate future.\n\nI think there something to be said for BEV instant acceleration for passing w/o fractional second [WAG: 0.1s?, 0.2s?, 0.3s?, to 0.7s?] (downshifts + RPMs awakening from previous cruising speed)] even with kickdown mechanisms.\n\nI'm more tickled that Dodge had added traction control mechanism to maintain control while sustaining [wheelie(?) or near-wheelie(?)], custom light-weighting [including slim rims and custom tires] with track-day goodies box, pre-tensioned their whole drivetrain, and added (if I'm readaing it correctly) improved initial torque (+$1 passenger seat add-backs XD ).  It's not my cup of tea, but def. admirable.  They look to be pushing/stretching to the limit of [stock-config-from-manufacturer](lol no passenger nor rear seats) to maximize race stats to attain crown|halo|marketing effect (crafty... I like it.)  Hrm... maybe there should be new category (4 seats + all season tires on asphalt at preset tire &amp; road temperature) as a new benchmark at some point to reduce confounding factors XD.\n\n&gt; Dodge runs a 9.6 @ 140\n\n&gt; Tesla runs a 10.5 @ 125\n\nThe (@) speed is personally less interesting to me vs the ET (elapsed time?)  But 9.9-9.6s would be tough cookie; I'd like to see what Tesla comes out with WRT to roadster or other ~4000lb vehicle, weight stripped with higher current cells once they come out.  To be frank, I'm more interested in what Dodge's ICE competitors will do since Tesla is positioned more as premium segment vehicle which I would be a little surprised to see actually selling a factory stripped vehicle (although I'd be quite amused &amp; delighted if they did so.)\n____\n[1] http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-0-100-0-test/\n\n&gt;And that\u2019s because the result is basically the perfect architecture for accelerating. That long wheelbase, low center of gravity, and nearly balanced weight distribution suddenly tee up blistering acceleration possibilities when all four wheels are driven. You don\u2019t want rearward weight transfer anymore\u2014in fact, now it\u2019s the enemy of ideal.\n\n&gt;The benefit from nearly doubling the tire footprint is pretty obvious. What might not be is an invisible phenomenon; the efficiency of a tire\u2019s capacity to deliver grip diminishes as the tire\u2019s downforce on the road rises. With AWD (assuming tire sizes that aren\u2019t excessively staggered), you actually want to minimize weight transfer. That is, it\u2019s way better to distribute the Tesla\u2019s torque to all four wheels than theoretically stand the car and all its weight on two driven rear tires alone. Combine this with wheel-slip control that\u2019s impossible in a gas car, and the result is a layout so ideal that it\u2019s hard to imagine how to better it.\n\n[2]https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/the-nio-ep9-is-the-fastest-ev-at-the-nurburgring-and-now-we-have-the-full-video/\n\n[3]http://www.motortrend.com/news/lamborghini-unveils-ring-master-huracan-performante/", "edited": 1492024542.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s claim to fame is its instant torque which allows it to get off the line&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AWD + very good initial torque + lack of shifting(for more %time during launch at peak traction limited output) &lt;a href=\"http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-0-100-0-test/\"&gt;See Related&lt;/a&gt;.[1]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thats the nature of EV&amp;#39;s.

IINM, BEVs are adopting newer implementations of (cells, motors) higher and higher current ratings with better cooling mechanisms and power peaks.  &lt;a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/the-nio-ep9-is-the-fastest-ev-at-the-nurburgring-and-now-we-have-the-full-video/\"&gt;Some random EV co from China has already set 7:05 on Nurburgring (would rank 4th among production vehicle times)&lt;/a&gt;[2]; I&amp;#39;m WAG they&amp;#39;d be faster if they implemented &lt;a href=\"http://www.motortrend.com/news/lamborghini-unveils-ring-master-huracan-performante/\"&gt;Lamborghini aero-vectoring&lt;/a&gt;[3].  Some of these technologies will trickle down to less exotic BEVs in indeterminate future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there something to be said for BEV instant acceleration for passing w/o fractional second [WAG: 0.1s?, 0.2s?, 0.3s?, to 0.7s?] (downshifts + RPMs awakening from previous cruising speed)] even with kickdown mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m more tickled that Dodge had added traction control mechanism to maintain control while sustaining [wheelie(?) or near-wheelie(?)], custom light-weighting [including slim rims and custom tires] with track-day goodies box, pre-tensioned their whole drivetrain, and added (if I&amp;#39;m readaing it correctly) improved initial torque (+$1 passenger seat add-backs XD ).  It&amp;#39;s not my cup of tea, but def. admirable.  They look to be pushing/stretching to the limit of [stock-config-from-manufacturer](lol no passenger nor rear seats) to maximize race stats to attain crown|halo|marketing effect (crafty... I like it.)  Hrm... maybe there should be new category (4 seats + all season tires on asphalt at preset tire &amp;amp; road temperature) as a new benchmark at some point to reduce confounding factors XD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dodge runs a 9.6 @ 140&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla runs a 10.5 @ 125&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The (@) speed is personally less interesting to me vs the ET (elapsed time?)  But 9.9-9.6s would be tough cookie; I&amp;#39;d like to see what Tesla comes out with WRT to roadster or other ~4000lb vehicle, weight stripped with higher current cells once they come out.  To be frank, I&amp;#39;m more interested in what Dodge&amp;#39;s ICE competitors will do since Tesla is positioned more as premium segment vehicle which I would be a little surprised to see actually selling a factory stripped vehicle (although I&amp;#39;d be quite amused &amp;amp; delighted if they did so.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href=\"http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-0-100-0-test/\"&gt;http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-0-100-0-test/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s because the result is basically the perfect architecture for accelerating. That long wheelbase, low center of gravity, and nearly balanced weight distribution suddenly tee up blistering acceleration possibilities when all four wheels are driven. You don\u2019t want rearward weight transfer anymore\u2014in fact, now it\u2019s the enemy of ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The benefit from nearly doubling the tire footprint is pretty obvious. What might not be is an invisible phenomenon; the efficiency of a tire\u2019s capacity to deliver grip diminishes as the tire\u2019s downforce on the road rises. With AWD (assuming tire sizes that aren\u2019t excessively staggered), you actually want to minimize weight transfer. That is, it\u2019s way better to distribute the Tesla\u2019s torque to all four wheels than theoretically stand the car and all its weight on two driven rear tires alone. Combine this with wheel-slip control that\u2019s impossible in a gas car, and the result is a layout so ideal that it\u2019s hard to imagine how to better it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[2]&lt;a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/the-nio-ep9-is-the-fastest-ev-at-the-nurburgring-and-now-we-have-the-full-video/\"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/the-nio-ep9-is-the-fastest-ev-at-the-nurburgring-and-now-we-have-the-full-video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[3]&lt;a href=\"http://www.motortrend.com/news/lamborghini-unveils-ring-master-huracan-performante/\"&gt;http://www.motortrend.com/news/lamborghini-unveils-ring-master-huracan-performante/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teslamotors", "name": "t1_dg69lfw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048925.0, "created_utc": 1492020125.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3j5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wbx6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8di0j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "farhanorakzai", "parent_id": "t1_dg5x7uh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teslamotors", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nature of ev's?
