Back in December I met this really pretty girl. Our first date was unbelievable. Before this, I would&amp;#39;ve never thought of scoring a date and getting a girl. I thought that I was doomed forever because I&amp;#39;m just this 5&amp;#39;4 asian who sits home and jack off to porn. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and gamed so fucking hard from the end of summer to fall. I had so much fun and support from the RSD inner circle group in Philadelphia. December comes along and I met this gorgeous college girl. On our first date we hit it off amazingly well. We met up at a mall and then I decided to head off to center city to be more spontaneous and adventurous. She agreed to join and I moved her from places to places,  it was unbelievable. I ended the first date with a kiss close. Next following date, we went to a night club 20 minutes away. I invited some of my rsd wings, but unfortunately wasn&amp;#39;t able to game with them because I was trying to fuck the girl. We made out half way through the night on New Years day. I brought her back to my house at the end of the night and lost my V card! I was shaking because I couldn&amp;#39;t believe this was happening, I&amp;#39;m just this dorky 17 year old Asian that barely has any previous experience with women and yet 2 dates later I&amp;#39;m already fucking her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got into a relationship and dated for 3 months. The first 2 months I was on top of my fucking shit, passion and path. But then as the 3rd month hit I stopped going out. I stopped being social. I stopped taking care of myself. And down goes the relationship. This was a gradual process, so she lost attraction for me over time. She got a new dance partner for her school dance and they had a crush on each other. Then on the day that they made out, she broke up with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned that if there is a problem with the relationship, the girl will literally stick that shit in your face. One of the issues was that I solely focused on fun and sex. She told me that I fucked her the best out of all the boyfriends she previously had (I guess googling shit does really help). But since I was purely fun and sex, I left out the deep conversation/connection. I barely took the time to talk with her on a deep emotional level where we could connect. She told me over the months, but I didn&amp;#39;t keep that in mind. &amp;quot;I feel like we only have sex and joke around. But I rarely know about you nor do we ever have talks where I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;oh shit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;. On top of that, I became less and less social. I stopped going out and took advantages of the comfortable situation. As time passed she lost attraction for me and another guy took over because I was no longer the masculine alpha guy that she once knew. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned that if a girls attraction for you is high enough, and non of her friends are around to judge. Then you will get sex for sure by simply escalating. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So where should I start... Back in December I met this really pretty girl.
