EVERYONE is awkward when they go to a beginner salsa class.  And many people there are showing up single.  It's not like you're joining an advanced class for couples.

After you pick up a dance, any kino after that is on easy mode.  Really, it's like cheat codes for game.\n\n* You're socializing with some people who are generally pretty welcoming.  Guys with good attitudes are always welcome; very often it's hard for them to keep beginner leaders because men are usually too *scared* to start or stick with it.\n\nThe downside is, you can't join and expect to plow through the numbers en masse.  But further advantages more than make up for this: \n\n* You have the potential for some fairly regular game in most decently sized cities, especially the more comfortable you get with a dance and more so if you end up picking up more than one dance.  I was usually bouncing around between 2-3 different dance scenes in my hometown and had some pretty regular \"activity\" with new partners, when I wasn't with a GF.\n\n* Events every month or so, often attract visiting dancers from out of town, so you'll have the chance to meet new people often.  \n* There are events you can travel to as well.\n\n* You'll have the chance to build a social network that spans the globe.  A FB search of almost any major city in the world will turn up a number of social dance scenes, many of whom will be nice social contacts who'd be willing to show you around the town or possibly even host fellow dancers.\n\n*So this business about it being too awkward to try.....
