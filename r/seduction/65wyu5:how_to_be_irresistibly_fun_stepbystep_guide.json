To a woman, logical conversation is like noise, whereas emotional conversation is like music. Your intention when interacting with a woman should be to make her feel specific emotions, and most of all, you need to offer her fun.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds good, but how do I do this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most efficient way to be more fun is to snap yourself out of a logical headspace by doing something ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One friend of mine accomplishes this by being romantic to the point of absurdity, he tells every girl she\u2019s different from the rest (when she\u2019s not), that she\u2019s actually intriguing (probably not), and even that he loves her (he doesn\u2019t). He finds this hilarious, and girls know he\u2019s joking, that it\u2019s just a role play, and that\u2019s why it works, it\u2019s fun and totally illogical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All types of fun share one important attribute. Fun is an act of letting go. You can\u2019t have fun while caring what people think, the two states of mind are directly conflicting with each other. \nPractice doing things that force you to let go of your self-image, many of us have spent our entire lives guarding our reputations and trying to seem \u2018cool\u2019, paradoxically, you won\u2019t be cool until you finally let go of your need to look cool, and allow yourself to let go and have fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice LETTING GO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few exercises you can try to practice letting go of your self-image. If these seem difficult to you, then you probably take yourself too seriously. Practicing these will force you to stop caring what people think, and the less you care about what people think, the more fun women will have interacting with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: Whichever of these you choose to do, I recommend that you do them for a week straight so you can deeply absorb the emotional lesson, just doing an exercise once is still useful, but lasting change requires repeated practice.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Awkward Laugh in Public&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do this in a bar, a mall, a college campus, anywhere with a high volume of people. The task is exactly what it sounds like, while you\u2019re walking through the venue, laugh as loudly and awkwardly as possible. Do this for as long as you can. It might be uncomfortable, but that discomfort is a sign that you\u2019re acting in a way that conflicts with your ego. (the part of you that takes your identity way too seriously) You\u2019re basically punching your self-image in the face. You can\u2019t take yourself quite as seriously after you\u2019ve done this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dancing Through the Streets&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do this with or without playing music, but while moving through any public place with a high volume of people, start dancing. You can dance in place or dance as you move, the style of dance is totally up to you, but the weirder and more flamboyant, the better. If this is a bit much for you, you can warm up by skipping instead of full-on dancing. Once you get comfortable with skipping, you can start dancing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Propose to a stranger&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buy a ring pop from a nearby Walgreens. The next time you go out, walk up to a woman and say, \u201cI saw you, and I know this is forward, but when you know, you know.\u201d Then get on one knee and pull out the ring pop before saying, \u201cI am completely smitten by you, will you marry me?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These exercises force you to do things that openly conflict with your self-image. But it\u2019s the parts of your personality that you usually would hide from strangers, that make you feel insecure, that you\u2019d normally only show to someone you are very comfortable around, that are the most fun and likeable. \nWe all have a playful side, a side that most of us rarely show because we\u2019re embarrassed of it. By doing the challenges outlined in this article, you are proving to yourself that people won\u2019t judge you nearly as much as you thought they would for letting your dorky side out. You\u2019re proving to yourself that there aren\u2019t any consequences for acting goofy, for having fun. \nThese practices are incredibly freeing because you prove to yourself that your self-image is holding you back unnecessarily. And that you can act however you want to without negative repercussions (unless you are openly aggressive of course), and you can\u2019t truly be fun until you let go of your fear of these imagined negative repercussions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more practical self-development content, check out the blog at &lt;a href=\"https://tpsychnation.com/\"&gt;https://tpsychnation.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Youtube: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDyD-S-52EnbphdlvB8VUUQ\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDyD-S-52EnbphdlvB8VUUQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "If you\u2019re fun enough, you can get away with ANYTHING.
