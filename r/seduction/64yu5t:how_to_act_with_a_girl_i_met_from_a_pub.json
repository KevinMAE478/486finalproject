I decided &amp;quot;why not? let&amp;#39;s talk to them and see what happens&amp;quot;. That night I ended up with her number, kept her interested, hugged her a bit and slightly chatted with her since then - She asked me that following Sunday and Monday each if i&amp;#39;d like to meet up with her at that same bar, Which in both I refused (Didn&amp;#39;t explain to her why). We haven&amp;#39;t talked up until an hour ago, I decided I wanted to go meet her, and sent her a message if she wants to meet up and hang out at that bar, and she wanted to.

What is the &lt;strong&gt;proper&lt;/strong&gt; way to make a girl want me when this is our second time meeting up in less than a week? Should I tap the breaks constantly? Or should I sexually provoke her a lot (press the gas)? I am pretty convinced she loves physical contact, though coming out too needy would be an issue.
