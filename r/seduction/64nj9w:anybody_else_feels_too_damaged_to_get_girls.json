Most people are judgmental anyway, and they can feel free to think whatever they want. And it. does. not. matter.\" As time goes on, your mind will need to do this less and less.

If your current social circle sucks? You realize that you can make new friends, right? It's not like there's a maximum friend count cap per lifetime. Try to surround yourself with people that bring out the best in you.\n\n5. You will have good days... and you will have bad days. Sometimes, \"down\" days will be consecutive. Understand that they pass. Every time. Remember that \"best version of you\" list? There should be tons of other items on it you could, and should, be working on.\n\n6. If you're an alcoholic, you need to stop binge drinking. Quit alcohol entirely if you can. But if you consider that blasphemy, learn to control your drinking to be set to \"occasional only,\" at most.\n\n7. Stop comparing yourself to others. That exercise results in no useful information whatsoever anyway. Hence, nothing but a waste of time and energy.\n\n8. Don't focus on getting girls.
