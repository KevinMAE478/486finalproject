I think most of it is useless \u2013 human psychology is very complicated and what works for one person may not work for another. Furthermore, anxiety and fear of rejection is a constant fact about the human brain \u2013 you can\u2019t just turn if it off any more than you can turn any other emotion off. That said, here are my thoughts on approach anxiety. I hope it can help some of you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Approach anxiety exists because humans are tribal animals and our biggest fear is rejection from the tribe. Evolution wired us to seek acceptance into the tribe at all costs because we feel like we need the tribe for our needs (food, sex, affection, etc\u2026), even it means being submissive, conformist, and paralyzed by anxiety. To keep beta men and women in their submissive, conformist place, evolution makes us feel anxiety whenever we even consider \u201casking\u201d a higher-ranked ape for something because we know it might lead to soul-crushing rejection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we only feel anxiety if we \u201cfeel\u201d like we are the beta \u201casking\u201d a higher-ranked ape for something. That anxiety will not exist if we \u201cfeel\u201d like we are the alpha \u201caccepting\u201d the lower-ranked ape into the tribe. To eliminate approach anxiety, therefore, you must \u201cfeel\u201d like your approach is you \u201caccepting\u201d her, not \u201casking\u201d her for anything. Of course, this is all feelings \u2013 there is no actual tribe, and therefore you are not actually accepting her into anything (I guess your life? Your good graces?). And any rational person can see that you are approaching her because you want something (to fuuuuck) so it\u2019s actually closer to asking than accepting. But human beings are emotional creatures, and if you subconsciously communicate the right emotion she will accept you as the alpha. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she will fuck you \u2013 she may have other alphas in her life she is committed to. But setting this emotional tone is a necessary precondition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may sound like woo-woo philosophical bullshit, but the \u201caccepting\u201d paradigm corresponds to an actual emotional state. Once you adopt this state, you will subconsciously emit those emotions, she will feel them and then she hopefully adopt the corresponding emotional state, which is the beta supplicant. Evolution requires all the apes \u201csynchronize\u201d their feelings and accept the order so if you demonstrate you are the alpha she will correspondingly adopt the beta position and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This synchronization is the same thing as frame. In other words, \u201cframe\u201d is the parties\u2019 perceptions of the social hierarchy in any particular situation, and their subsequent adoption of the corresponding emotions. Frame is created by the emotional tone set by the man. Women usually come into an interaction agnostic about you (unless you clearly look inferior or superior) but your actions quickly solidify in their mind what emotional position they should take vis-\u00e0-vis you. Women don\u2019t make this easy \u2013 they immediately try to \u201cbitch\u201d you and make you accept the beta frame \u2013 but if you beat that shit test and then women will accept that you are the alpha.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a man, you must set the emotional tone of the interaction, not her. If she sets the emotional tone she loses interest because women want a higher emotional experience than what they already have. And you can\u2019t be intimidated by her bitchiness, or her assertions that she\u2019s dominant, or anything else \u2013 she is wired to accept the beta position if the man acts alpha. It\u2019s a law of biology that humans can\u2019t defeat. Mike Tyson famously said \u201ceverybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.\u201d My corollary is \u201ceverybody has a plan until their emotions act up.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the man sets the emotional tone, he should not fish for positive reactions from the women. Obviously, you should be having fun and let her join in the fun, but seeking to make her \u201chappy\u201d is a form of supplication and validation-seeking. Girls observe everything and are masters of masking their emotions, so they can be building attraction but not let it on. Successful game requires long-term planning and patience, and doing the \u201cright thing\u201d even it doesn\u2019t appear like it is immediately paying off. I\u2019ve had many nights where I interacted with a girl that seemed cold and shitty, but I held my frame, and then magically at one point she gave in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, some girls will just not buy into your frame. They may be thinking about something else, or they just may not be impressed by you. That\u2019s fine. Frame takes two to tango, and all you can do is your best. If she doesn\u2019t like it, next her and find somebody else. Game is like fishing \u2013 I\u2019m not begging each individual fish to come to my boat \u2013 I am just throwing my line out there and letting whoever wants bite it, as long as they\u2019re not fat or ugly or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be the acceptor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a regular girl who works as a bartender or hairdresser sneaks into an exclusive star-studded party thrown by Jay-Z. She is not famous and is mediocre looking compared to the other women there so she fears she will get kicked out for not being invited and actively avoids security guards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Jay-Z walks up to her, shakes her hand, says \u201cthanks for coming,\u201d and gets her a drink. She now feels great because the alpha \u201caccepted\u201d her into the party. Even though he approached her, she doesn\u2019t feel like Jay-Z is a beta, or creepy, or overbearing, or overly aggressive. She also doesn\u2019t think he is \u201ctargeting\u201d her to fuck her. Nor does she think he gave her a drink to \u201cbuy\u201d her or to supplicate to her. She just thinks \u201che is welcoming everybody into the party, and he just welcomed me too.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course you are not Jay-Z and you are not always throwing a star-studded party people are killing themselves to get into. But you should approach every woman in the mindset that you are the alpha \u201caccepting\u201d them. She has to feel like she can walk up to you and start talking to you whenever she wants, that it\u2019s ok for her to call you if she wants something to do, and that she can pour her heart out to you and you won\u2019t make her feel like shit for doing so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to create the right frame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discuss how to create the proper frame in my other articles. To briefly summarize, if you are more emotionally invested in a girl than she is emotionally invested in you, then you are the lower-ranked ape. The way you show emotional investment is by asking her for things (her time, attention, sex, etc\u2026) and by validating yourself to her (by either giving her things or showing that you would give her things so that you can get her time, attention, sex, etc\u2026). Both of these concepts can be reduced to \u201casking\u201d \u2013 if she can subconsciously sense you are \u201casking\u201d her for things, she will sense you are more emotionally invested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The alpha, however, does not ask for things because, at least theoretically, he has everything. The lower ranked apes ask the alpha for things, and out of his abundant generosity, the alpha \u201caccepts\u201d them into the tribe and (maybe) gives them the things they want. \u201cAccepting\u201d doesn\u2019t take a bunch of work and isn\u2019t a grand thing. All it requires is a handshake and a nice smile, but more importantly, a \u201cfeeling\u201d that she is \u201cin.\u201d Sometimes I\u2019ll introduce myself to a woman very warmly, and then just walk away. I accepted you, now it\u2019s your turn to prove yourself worthy of my attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your approach should be warm, direct, loving, happy, positive, and familiar. Most guys are afraid to do a warm approach because they are afraid they will come off as creepy, desperate, overbearing, etc\u2026 But that fear only exists when you approach from weakness and are \u201casking.\u201d If you approach a woman, and she rudely rejects you, she\u2019s not being a \u201cbitch\u201d \u2013 she has just emotionally put you in the \u201cinferior\u201d trash bin in her mind because she felt like you were asking for something and therefore \u201csubmitting\u201d yourself to her. It\u2019s not a conscious decision for her to be a bitch \u2013 it\u2019s an emotional reaction. But if it doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d like you are asking for anything, she won\u2019t (and can\u2019t!) have that negative emotional reaction. If you give her a warm, genuine, direct, approach and she acts like a bitch that means she has issues. The best way to make her feel \u201caccepted\u201d is to immediately speak to her like you guys have known each other for a long time and immediately make her feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier said than done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Approaching as an alpha is a lot easier said than done. First, you have to actually \u201cfeel\u201d like you are the alpha and that she is lucky to be \u201caccepted\u201d into your world. This may require some delusion or wishful thinking. If you\u2019re a busy club or a music festival you may not feel like you have any power to \u201caccept\u201d anybody into anything \u2013 that\u2019s why you have to remember that this all an emotion you are creating and not necessarily connected to any real things in the real world. You have to eliminate any distractions or negative thoughts in your mind, as well as ignore any real facts: your only mission is to deliver an emotion to her. Despite all the various situations you might find yourself in, and all the layers of complexity human culture has created, and people\u2019s crazy thoughts and personalities: we are all deep down just apes with a finite number of emotional buttons: press the right ones and you get what you want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you start talking to her, you will be amazed at your success, and you may want to slip back into beta mode because fundamentally you \u201cfeel\u201d like you are lucky to be talking to her and you want something from her. You must keep the frame, even if it means continuously reminding yourself to stay in the \u201caccepting\u201d frame and not the \u201casking\u201d frame. As a man it is very hard for you to completely turn off your desire to \u201cask\u201d because, frankly, you WANT her really bad. To turn this wanting and asking off, you need abundance mentality and an awesome life mission (read my other articles). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how do I do this in practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I am in a social gathering like a party, I introduce myself to everybody immediately as if I have a duty to do so, like I am Jay-Z at his celebrity party. I pretend like I am the \u201cglue\u201d holding the social group together and I don\u2019t want anybody to feel left out, even if I am really a peripheral member of the group or a newcomer who only knows one or two people. My \u201copener\u201d is usually just \u201chi, my name is Woujo\u201d sometimes followed by some \u201cacceptance-y\u201d banter like \u201cwho do you know here\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your connection to these people?\u201d I want her to feel like she needs to win my acceptance. If she validates herself to me I will even say \u201cacceptance-y\u201d things like \u201cwell, we are glad you are here\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a good addition to the group.\u201d I\u2019ll do irrational things like using \u201cwe\u201d (there is no we) or \u201cthanks for coming\u201d as if I own the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take the same attitude if I am somewhere I don\u2019t know anybody. It\u2019s harder to maintain that mindset, but you still must think: I am Jay-Z, this is my party, and I am \u201caccepting\u201d you into it. It requires some delusional and unrealistic thinking but that\u2019s how human emotions work. There is no actual \u201cwe\u201d but if I speak for the group, she \u201cfeels\u201d like I am the alpha \u201caccepting\u201d her into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThanks for coming\u201d is an incredible opener. If you are a newbie with lots of approach anxiety, just have a few drinks and tell every girl \u201cthanks for coming.\u201d You are almost guaranteed a positive reaction because, no matter what, the girl has to consider for a second that she is at your party and you might kick her out if she\u2019s a bitch. It also flips that emotional switch linked to acceptance. I\u2019ve picked up girls by saying \u201cthanks for coming\u201d in the middle of the street or in a Starbucks. Emotions beat rationality. Now, I don\u2019t go around doing this anymore because I don\u2019t like to feel ridiculous, but it is a useful technique. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When escalating, I introduce her to as many people as I can, including guys. I first make sure to introduce her to the leader or best looking guy in the group because it solidifies my place as the \u201calpha\u201d of the group. If a random guy starts talking to girls I am with I might invite him along. Aggressively accepting guys into the group subconsciously communicates that 1) I am not jealous or scared of this guy taking her and 2) I am actually above this guy, because I am the one accepting HIM into the tribe, not vice-versa. And if she likes the other guy more than me, then I want to know early so I don\u2019t waste my time. But that rarely happens. Most guys are too stuck in the scarcity/asking mindset so they end up looking beta when there are other guys in competition.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the \u201cacceptance\u201d paradigm, women\u2019s psychology and bizarre behavior makes more sense. The entire nightclub industry, with overpriced VIP sections and packing people together like sardines, is based on women\u2019s need for acceptance. Men don\u2019t give a fuck about VIP sections because they see themselves as the acceptors and not the acceptees. A man\u2019s conquering spirit would never let him endure the humiliation of begging to be accepted into the VIP section of another man (if there weren\u2019t girls involved). Women do not have that conquering spirit, however, so they need acceptance. When a beta loser walks around a club he sees a bunch of hot, snobby, \u201cbitches\u201d \u2013 but I see a bunch of pathetic, ridiculous creatures begging for acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of guys complain that women just want \u201cattention.\u201d Not necessarily \u2013 women want to be \u201caccepted\u201d by the alpha. If they don\u2019t see their man as the alpha, then his acceptance doesn\u2019t mean shit to them so they need to go seek it from somewhere else. If a woman has high SMV, most men melt before her and lose their alpha status, requiring her to seek \u201cattention\u201d (i.e., acceptance) elsewhere. These girls often end up riding the CC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could write a 500-page book about the phenomenon of acceptance. Think about the word \u201chello.\u201d What does it mean? It means \u201cI am accepting you.\u201d That\u2019s all that means.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once she\u2019s been accepted, it\u2019s her job to validate herself to you, not vice-versa. Like I said, acceptance takes very little \u2013 anything beyond that may seem like supplication or validation-seeking. One way of thinking about escalation is \u201chigher levels of acceptance.\u201d First, she\u2019s \u201caccepted\u201d into being allowed to talk to me. Then, if she does well she\u2019s accepted into getting affectionate with me. Then, she\u2019s \u201caccepted\u201d into being invited to the next place with me. Etc\u2026 If she does something shitty or loses interest, I \u201cun-accept\u201d her by acting like she\u2019s a stranger. I don\u2019t whine or complain, I just pretend as if we never met. To un-accept a woman is by making sure she thinks you are less emotionally invested than her or she will think you are playing games or being weird. Note, however: if you find yourself \u201caccepting\u201d and \u201cun-accepting\u201d women repeatedly, that means they are probably are not interested in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rarely, if ever, \u201creject\u201d women because I get nothing out of it. Most men only \u201creject\u201d women because they\u2019re angry, and I have no reason to get angry. Rejection really hurts women\u2019s feelings and turns them vindictive. There is a reason for the famous quote \u201chell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\u201d I\u2019d rather keep them all in a state of acceptance \u2013 but at arm\u2019s length if they\u2019re not behaving well.  The hardest part of spinning plates is making them all feel accepted \u2013 if you don\u2019t keep up with it they will feel like you rejected them and go sour on you. Part of the reason people go crazy and stalker-y after break-ups is that they\u2019ve been rationally told \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d but they still \u201cfeel\u201d accepted so they feel entitled to keep going after that person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to my website: &lt;a href=\"http://www.woujo.com\"&gt;http://www.woujo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow me on twitter: &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/woujo3\"&gt;http://www.twitter.com/woujo3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Much ink has been spilled in the pick-up world and manosphere on how to defeat approach anxiety.

If you give her a warm, genuine, direct, approach and she acts like a bitch that means she has issues. The best way to make her feel \u201caccepted\u201d is to immediately speak to her like you guys have known each other for a long time and immediately make her feel comfortable.\n\n**Easier said than done**\n\nApproaching as an alpha is a lot easier said than done. First, you have to actually \u201cfeel\u201d like you are the alpha and that she is lucky to be \u201caccepted\u201d into your world. This may require some delusion or wishful thinking. If you\u2019re a busy club or a music festival you may not feel like you have any power to \u201caccept\u201d anybody into anything \u2013 that\u2019s why you have to remember that this all an emotion you are creating and not necessarily connected to any real things in the real world. You have to eliminate any distractions or negative thoughts in your mind, as well as ignore any real facts: your only mission is to deliver an emotion to her. Despite all the various situations you might find yourself in, and all the layers of complexity human culture has created, and people\u2019s crazy thoughts and personalities: we are all deep down just apes with a finite number of emotional buttons: press the right ones and you get what you want. \n\nOnce you start talking to her, you will be amazed at your success, and you may want to slip back into beta mode because fundamentally you \u201cfeel\u201d like you are lucky to be talking to her and you want something from her. You must keep the frame, even if it means continuously reminding yourself to stay in the \u201caccepting\u201d frame and not the \u201casking\u201d frame. As a man it is very hard for you to completely turn off your desire to \u201cask\u201d because, frankly, you WANT her really bad. To turn this wanting and asking off, you need abundance mentality and an awesome life mission (read my other articles). \n\n**So how do I do this in practice?**\n\nIf I am in a social gathering like a party, I introduce myself to everybody immediately as if I have a duty to do so, like I am Jay-Z at his celebrity party. I pretend like I am the \u201cglue\u201d holding the social group together and I don\u2019t want anybody to feel left out, even if I am really a peripheral member of the group or a newcomer who only knows one or two people. My \u201copener\u201d is usually just \u201chi, my name is Woujo\u201d sometimes followed by some \u201cacceptance-y\u201d banter like \u201cwho do you know here\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your connection to these people?\u201d I want her to feel like she needs to win my acceptance. If she validates herself to me I will even say \u201cacceptance-y\u201d things like \u201cwell, we are glad you are here\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a good addition to the group.\u201d I\u2019ll do irrational things like using \u201cwe\u201d (there is no we) or \u201cthanks for coming\u201d as if I own the place.\n \nI take the same attitude if I am somewhere I don\u2019t know anybody. It\u2019s harder to maintain that mindset, but you still must think: I am Jay-Z, this is my party, and I am \u201caccepting\u201d you into it. It requires some delusional and unrealistic thinking but that\u2019s how human emotions work. There is no actual \u201cwe\u201d but if I speak for the group, she \u201cfeels\u201d like I am the alpha \u201caccepting\u201d her into it.\n\n \u201cThanks for coming\u201d is an incredible opener. If you are a newbie with lots of approach anxiety, just have a few drinks and tell every girl \u201cthanks for coming.\u201d You are almost guaranteed a positive reaction because, no matter what, the girl has to consider for a second that she is at your party and you might kick her out if she\u2019s a bitch. It also flips that emotional switch linked to acceptance. I\u2019ve picked up girls by saying \u201cthanks for coming\u201d in the middle of the street or in a Starbucks. Emotions beat rationality. Now, I don\u2019t go around doing this anymore because I don\u2019t like to feel ridiculous, but it is a useful technique. \n  \nWhen escalating, I introduce her to as many people as I can, including guys. I first make sure to introduce her to the leader or best looking guy in the group because it solidifies my place as the \u201calpha\u201d of the group. If a random guy starts talking to girls I am with I might invite him along. Aggressively accepting guys into the group subconsciously communicates that 1) I am not jealous or scared of this guy taking her and 2) I am actually above this guy, because I am the one accepting HIM into the tribe, not vice-versa. And if she likes the other guy more than me, then I want to know early so I don\u2019t waste my time. But that rarely happens. Most guys are too stuck in the scarcity/asking mindset so they end up looking beta when there are other guys in competition.  \n \n**Final thoughts**\n\nOnce you understand the \u201cacceptance\u201d paradigm, women\u2019s psychology and bizarre behavior makes more sense. The entire nightclub industry, with overpriced VIP sections and packing people together like sardines, is based on women\u2019s need for acceptance. Men don\u2019t give a fuck about VIP sections because they see themselves as the acceptors and not the acceptees. A man\u2019s conquering spirit would never let him endure the humiliation of begging to be accepted into the VIP section of another man (if there weren\u2019t girls involved). Women do not have that conquering spirit, however, so they need acceptance. When a beta loser walks around a club he sees a bunch of hot, snobby, \u201cbitches\u201d \u2013 but I see a bunch of pathetic, ridiculous creatures begging for acceptance.\n\nA lot of guys complain that women just want \u201cattention.\u201d Not necessarily \u2013 women want to be \u201caccepted\u201d by the alpha. If they don\u2019t see their man as the alpha, then his acceptance doesn\u2019t mean shit to them so they need to go seek it from somewhere else. If a woman has high SMV, most men melt before her and lose their alpha status, requiring her to seek \u201cattention\u201d (i.e., acceptance) elsewhere. These girls often end up riding the CC. \n\nI could write a 500-page book about the phenomenon of acceptance. Think about the word \u201chello.\u201d What does it mean? It means \u201cI am accepting you.\u201d That\u2019s all that means.  \n\nOnce she\u2019s been accepted, it\u2019s her job to validate herself to you, not vice-versa. Like I said, acceptance takes very little \u2013 anything beyond that may seem like supplication or validation-seeking. One way of thinking about escalation is \u201chigher levels of acceptance.\u201d First, she\u2019s \u201caccepted\u201d into being allowed to talk to me. Then, if she does well she\u2019s accepted into getting affectionate with me. Then, she\u2019s \u201caccepted\u201d into being invited to the next place with me. Etc\u2026 If she does something shitty or loses interest, I \u201cun-accept\u201d her by acting like she\u2019s a stranger. I don\u2019t whine or complain, I just pretend as if we never met. To un-accept a woman is by making sure she thinks you are less emotionally invested than her or she will think you are playing games or being weird. Note, however: if you find yourself \u201caccepting\u201d and \u201cun-accepting\u201d women repeatedly, that means they are probably are not interested in you.\n\nI rarely, if ever, \u201creject\u201d women because I get nothing out of it. Most men only \u201creject\u201d women because they\u2019re angry, and I have no reason to get angry. Rejection really hurts women\u2019s feelings and turns them vindictive. There is a reason for the famous quote \u201chell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\u201d I\u2019d rather keep them all in a state of acceptance \u2013 but at arm\u2019s length if they\u2019re not behaving well.  The hardest part of spinning plates is making them all feel accepted \u2013 if you don\u2019t keep up with it they will feel like you rejected them and go sour on you. Part of the reason people go crazy and stalker-y after break-ups is that they\u2019ve been rationally told \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d but they still \u201cfeel\u201d accepted so they feel entitled to keep going after that person. \n\nGo to my website: http://www.woujo.com\n\nFollow me on twitter: http://www.twitter.com/woujo3", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65kpyt", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Woujo", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65kpyt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.seduction", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/seduction/comments/65kpyt/approach_anxiety_and_the_acceptance_paradigm/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492310975.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/65kpyt/approach_anxiety_and_the_acceptance_paradigm/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Approach anxiety and the \"acceptance\" paradigm", "created_utc": 1492282175.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 24, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb93rd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IWriteForGroupies", "parent_id": "t1_dgb4toc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Most of it is bs that causes people to do stupid stuff because they do not want to appear beta.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of it is bs that causes people to do stupid stuff because they do not want to appear beta.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dgb93rd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492323014.0, "created_utc": 1492294214.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb4toc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anotherthrowawayad22", "parent_id": "t1_dgb44jr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is the alpha/beta stuff overblown?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the alpha/beta stuff overblown?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dgb4toc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492317106.0, "created_utc": 1492288306.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kpyt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb9zmy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IWriteForGroupies", "parent_id": "t1_dgb9odu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My argument is that humans adapt to survive.
