You tell her how you feel, and obviously she doesn&amp;#39;t feel the same way, because she barely knows you.

If you like a girl, she should know, and if she likes you, you should know. Read up on body language for more insight on that topic.

If a girl is very receptive of you, slowly progress things with her until her receptiveness slows down. It&amp;#39;s not a game, it&amp;#39;s basic social skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, be someone that you can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations. You made it to the end, this is by far the most important tip. If you&amp;#39;re not proud of who you are, why would anyone else like you?
