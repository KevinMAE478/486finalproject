As if you need knowledge about how to strike up a conversation before striking up a conversation. Talking with other people is not quantum physics; You don't need years of prerequisite studies to grasp it. You need to be able to talk! And you need other people. Can you talk? Do you know anyone language? If yes, you have all that\u00b4s needed to learn the **skill** - talking with other people!  \n\nAs demonstrated by countless other people, you don't even need a plan to become somewhat proficient. You just go out there and.... talk! You\u00b4d probably fail many times, but over time you become better. \n\nAnd if you want to become a guru, then you go about it as if it where like any other skill you want to become an expert in. You have clear, specific goals of what you want to achieve and you do something you can do right now and gradually increase the dose. Example: Hold a fluid conversation for one minute? Oh you failed. That's fine. Do it for 20 seconds instead. Still not working. You realized that the problem is actually you not being able to introduce yourself. So you do that a few times until it you can move to the next level.

As if you need knowledge about how to strike up a conversation before striking up a conversation. Talking with other people is not quantum physics; You don&amp;#39;t need years of prerequisite studies to grasp it. You need to be able to talk! And you need other people. Can you talk? Do you know anyone language? If yes, you have all that\u00b4s needed to learn the &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; - talking with other people!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated by countless other people, you don&amp;#39;t even need a plan to become somewhat proficient. You just go out there and.... talk! You\u00b4d probably fail many times, but over time you become better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you want to become a guru, then you go about it as if it where like any other skill you want to become an expert in. You have clear, specific goals of what you want to achieve and you do something you can do right now and gradually increase the dose. Example: Hold a fluid conversation for one minute? Oh you failed. That&amp;#39;s fine. Do it for 20 seconds instead. Still not working. You realized that the problem is actually you not being able to introduce yourself. So you do that a few times until it you can move to the next level.
