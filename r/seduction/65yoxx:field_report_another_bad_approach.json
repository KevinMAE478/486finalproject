We&amp;#39;re both bad moments in retrospect and I walked from the side and just made a generic comment about the situation, I didn&amp;#39;t feel the vibe from the first one before being direct, so I ejected. Second one we talked for a small bit and I said I found her cute and she was meh on that so I ejected. So as I am sitting in a library again pondering what happened and how I can improve this stuff and approaching in general There&amp;#39;s a larger point I have a question about. Walking around and being in different places today, it just seems that despite approaching 2 girls and getting disinterest from both (as they were both alone) I have found that  most girls are taken, as either a couple or just with a group of guys, and I wonder if anyone is single at my campus anymore. I mean sometimes I see a cute girl and I don&amp;#39;t approach since I assume it would be too good to be true if she was single and and even then she probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be interested in me. And still kissless, virgin wondering where the fuck I go from here. I try to positive and am on most days I do love myself, but it&amp;#39;s hard not to get down when literally everyone else is having sex, in relationships, while 15 years olds are getting more than I am.
