In middle school I was very much a class clown, I loved making people laugh and being an overall good guy was my main goal. I&amp;#39;ve always had the mindset that everybody is going through things and making someone enjoy themselves in some way would be a really cool thing to do. I wasn&amp;#39;t the best looking kid in the world, pretty average i&amp;#39;d say because I would get ratimg from different girls within the range of 4-9 usually a 7. I didn&amp;#39;t dress well at all because I didn&amp;#39;t care so people would often say my best feature is my personality. During this time i&amp;#39;ve had the most girls like me which isnt a lot trust me, i think 3 and 2 were slghtly I interested from what i could tell and only one of the three I liked back at all (was too much of a pussy to make any moves though, but again this was middle school).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to Highschool and I wasn&amp;#39;t the same guy I wasn&amp;#39;t as outgoing or anything like that i gained some weight nothing too drastic but I didn&amp;#39;t have any redeeming qualities. My theory is because I was often called weird in Middle School for my excentric personality I went from not caring what people said to becoming really self concious. I started to learn how to dress better but my personality and confidence took a major hit.

The only reason i even spoke to this girl was because she seemed lonely in class so i sparked up a convo to get her spirits up and she ended up liking me.
