This is what I assumed you meant, however.....\n\n&gt; ....but I don't know how guys can consistently fuck randos. I don't feel the need to be like that at all, but I'm pretty sure there's something interesting lurking in that middle ground.\n\nPart of the \"middle ground\" is that one night stands can come from people you actually **connect** with, so while you might have met them that night and may never see them again, the term \"randos\" doesn't quite fit.\n\nAnd what happens when you have enough friends but happen to meet someone cool that you don't quite have enough energy to keep up with on a regular basis?  Sometimes someone can be cool enough to sleep with, but not enough to boot someone out of one's regular rotation of friends.\n\n&gt; SO basically you're saying you have to like a girl to have sex with her? Or that she has to be hot enough? Not exactly sure what you mean by that.\n\nI'm not sure why you're separating these two things.  They're part of a holistic whole.  \n\n* Physical attraction HAS to be a consideration.  If you're trying to force yourself to have sex with women you're not physically attracted to, you're going to have a bad time.  (And that physical attraction shouldn't have anything to do with what friends think.)  \n\n* I have to connect with a girl on some level or I'm just not into it.  I think you have to have some serious self-loathing or lack of self-respect in order to have sex with someone you don't like at all.  (And the idea of \"what one's friends think\" is really just an indication or sign of whether someone aligns with your values. Some people aren't always aware of the values mismatch until they realize that they'd be embarrassed for their friends to see them with her.)\n\n&gt; But as a curiosity, you know women who wouldn't fit in any of these four categories, how would you categorize them?\n\nThe difference is that the \"friend\" category has more levels on a continuum for me.  For example, I'm cool with acknowledging and reveling in a connection with someone right now and then NOT needing to maintain it on a regular basis.\n\n&gt; ....it's not like I've been in a relationship out of fear to tell her I didn't want to....\n\nIf you want something but you don't ask for it because you think they won't agree to it, this is fear.  Fear of hurting her, fear that she won't go for it, fear of coming off like a dick, whatever.  I won't belabor the point because it's for you to take this apart really, but overall, you're failing to ask for what you want because you think it won't work out.\n\nAnd sometimes it won't.  But in the process, you're screening out those who don't want what you want and putting them in the friend-zone where they belong if you want to remain friends with them.\n\n&gt; Doing that talk after sex can be kind of a dick move.....I've had this talk twice, and the first time I seriously wish I had had it before we'd had sex. \n\n*Usually* there really is a bit of a ceasefire, as James Marshall puts it, and people aren't in a rush to define anything initially.  But it certainly can escalate faster emotionally for the other person, which can require you to have the Talk earlier.  If they get there before you've even kissed, then honestly they should just be screened out due to emotional immaturity.  But I guess it's possible someone could get there after some heavy kissing and petting.  \n\nAnd again, consider, if someone is getting that carried away before sex, then maybe they should just be screened out and friend-zoned.  The Talk isn't magic.\n\n&gt; The second time I was super clear from the beginning, but she just \"kept on hoping.\" She's an adult, so I don't really feel responsible for her, but I did bring her quite a bit of suffering.\n\nHmmmm.  Two things going on here, probably.\n\n* You were likely confusing the issue by allowing your actions to confuse the issue.  There shouldn't be public displays of affection at ALL.  No sentimental stuff.  Nothing a BF does.  No holding hands.  None of it.  If you say it's casual but then contradict it with your actions, you're encouraging drama by encouraging further emotional investment by her.  James Marshall [covers this pretty well in the same presentation I linked to.](https://youtu.be/V9owHXPPe_Q?t=31m11s)\n\n&gt; I guess my main problem is about having that \"talk\" before anything happens. How do I make that clear before  anything happens? Should I have been communicating that implicitly all along?\n\nIf you're not confusing the issue with your actions, this shouldn't be a problem.  I've actually personally not even needed to have the Talk with most of the women I casually sleep with.  Because when I've been in that mode, I am pretty clear in my actions.  I'm not doing little things to build up her expectations.  I'm not going for hand-holding or cutesy things unless I'm looking for something serious.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I meant being more chill about sex. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get you now.

For example, I&amp;#39;m cool with acknowledging and reveling in a connection with someone right now and then NOT needing to maintain it on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;....it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;ve been in a relationship out of fear to tell her I didn&amp;#39;t want to....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want something but you don&amp;#39;t ask for it because you think they won&amp;#39;t agree to it, this is fear.  Fear of hurting her, fear that she won&amp;#39;t go for it, fear of coming off like a dick, whatever.  I won&amp;#39;t belabor the point because it&amp;#39;s for you to take this apart really, but overall, you&amp;#39;re failing to ask for what you want because you think it won&amp;#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it won&amp;#39;t.  But in the process, you&amp;#39;re screening out those who don&amp;#39;t want what you want and putting them in the friend-zone where they belong if you want to remain friends with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doing that talk after sex can be kind of a dick move.....I&amp;#39;ve had this talk twice, and the first time I seriously wish I had had it before we&amp;#39;d had sex. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually&lt;/em&gt; there really is a bit of a ceasefire, as James Marshall puts it, and people aren&amp;#39;t in a rush to define anything initially.  But it certainly can escalate faster emotionally for the other person, which can require you to have the Talk earlier.  If they get there before you&amp;#39;ve even kissed, then honestly they should just be screened out due to emotional immaturity.  But I guess it&amp;#39;s possible someone could get there after some heavy kissing and petting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, consider, if someone is getting that carried away before sex, then maybe they should just be screened out and friend-zoned.  The Talk isn&amp;#39;t magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second time I was super clear from the beginning, but she just &amp;quot;kept on hoping.&amp;quot; She&amp;#39;s an adult, so I don&amp;#39;t really feel responsible for her, but I did bring her quite a bit of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmmmm.  Two things going on here, probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You were likely confusing the issue by allowing your actions to confuse the issue.  There shouldn&amp;#39;t be public displays of affection at ALL.  No sentimental stuff.  Nothing a BF does.  No holding hands.  None of it.  If you say it&amp;#39;s casual but then contradict it with your actions, you&amp;#39;re encouraging drama by encouraging further emotional investment by her.  James Marshall &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/V9owHXPPe_Q?t=31m11s\"&gt;covers this pretty well in the same presentation I linked to.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my main problem is about having that &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; before anything happens. How do I make that clear before  anything happens? Should I have been communicating that implicitly all along?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not confusing the issue with your actions, this shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem.  I&amp;#39;ve actually personally not even needed to have the Talk with most of the women I casually sleep with.  Because when I&amp;#39;ve been in that mode, I am pretty clear in my actions.  I&amp;#39;m not doing little things to build up her expectations.  I&amp;#39;m not going for hand-holding or cutesy things unless I&amp;#39;m looking for something serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg5eap9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995906.0, "created_utc": 1491967106.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4alsu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "no-big-dick", "parent_id": "t1_dg48mfn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; You can't be bothered with one night stands.
