I feel like at times that I don&amp;#39;t have someone to cuddle with, to know what it feels like to experience intimacy and companionship when life gets too stressful. Or to experience what it feels like to have someone genuinely interested in you. Whether I&amp;#39;m stressed from exams or just loneliness, I realized there was no one out there. I feel like an unattractive man. I feel like a failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize looking through my Facebook messages, my Snapchat, my text messages, there is not one girl that pops up that would date me, it&amp;#39;s pretty much a sausage fest of guys that I talk to nowadays. Not even a girl to just be friends with to talk to. All guys. Some of these guys, I used to go out with them but not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to this article from the Atlantic, I am the minority of males around my age to be a virgin.

The CDC also reports that virgins make up 12.3 percent of females and 14.3 percent of males aged 20 to 24. That number drops below 5 percent for both male and female virgins aged 25 to 29 and goes as low as 0.3 percent for virgins aged 40 to 44.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Statistically, if you didn\u2019t have sex in your teen years, you\u2019re in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men have it hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the guys have to initiate everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years ago I stumbled upon this subreddit, in my high school days, near the end of 2012 to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read the side bar, read the top posts of this subreddit whether it was top posts of all time, month, or week. I read the good posts here and there. I lurked, learning what I can. I tried to apply the concepts. I tried to go for many girls, and I got rejected by all of them, only a few past the first date. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My two years in college, no girl has ever made the first move with me, no girl initiated, no girl complimented on my looks, and no girl ever showed interest in me. Felt like I was invisible on campus. Walking past attractive women everyday being a ghost. I feel like no girl will ever want to be with me after all the rejections I have experienced and realizing this. I went for countless girls, rejected so many times. Guys, it&amp;#39;s all up to us to initiate. We will be alone forever if we don&amp;#39;t do anything to improve ourselves. If you&amp;#39;re in college, you will never have the same concentration of the same girls around your age in such a small area again. Seems like the real world has a range of 20-40 year old in various workplaces and it doesn&amp;#39;t get easier. And yet I didn&amp;#39;t experience most of what guys around my age, to express love with someone, to have sex, to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know for girls it&amp;#39;s as easy as visual cues to be attractive. But for guys, it seems like it&amp;#39;s years of study trying to increase the probability to be attractive through social status, resources, behaviour, body language, fitness, clothes and style. We guys have to actually try to convince ourselves that we have abundance and look in the mirror saying &amp;quot;I am the prize&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;I have abundance&amp;quot; trying to be outcome independent even if you are a virgin. And it&amp;#39;s damn hard when you are someone who never had that much luck with dating in their life. Girls just has guys approaching them everyday, validating them through liking their Instagram photos and giving compliments/showing sexual interest in them multiple times per day. But for guys, it&amp;#39;s different. We don&amp;#39;t experience that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5q6upn/anyone_tell_me_why_women_are_typically_alot_less/dcxdu7x/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5q6upn/anyone_tell_me_why_women_are_typically_alot_less/dcxdu7x/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5q6upn/anyone_tell_me_why_women_are_typically_alot_less/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5q6upn/anyone_tell_me_why_women_are_typically_alot_less/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I have been recommended to read Models by Mark Manson, and been seeing it being recommended throughout this subreddit over the years. I started reading it a year ago but never finished. School work piled up. I put off self improvement for college. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that I gave up a lot of things for college. I used to work out, but stopped for a midterm a year ago, now I haven&amp;#39;t been in the gym since. I stopped going out with friends and realizing I just spent most of my weekends playing video games and on reddit to de stress from all the college work, being too tired to go out. I used to meditate but told myself I need every minute I can get to study for exams. I quit my job. I gave up dating in the name of monk mode and improving myself. I need to have a career in order to have the money to live the life I want on my own terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told myself to read Models. To read No More Mr. Nice Guy. To read How to Win Friends and Influence People to build friendships to have a healthy fulfilled lifestyle. To read The Way of The Superior Man to make myself better if I ever get into a relationship. Even Feeling Good by David Burns for my depression. Inner game. But my studies are rigorous, and I have not gotten around to reading these books yet. And every time I see an attractive woman, I told myself I am in monk mode, I am not ready. I&amp;#39;ve been telling myself this every time I want to see a girl I want to talk to. It&amp;#39;s true I am not ready, but maybe I am holding myself back making excuses on why not to approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I feel like I&amp;#39;m missing out. I feel like I am missing out because I am not in a frat, no clubs, I don&amp;#39;t get invited out to the clubs and bars, I don&amp;#39;t even have groups of friends to go out partying. I can&amp;#39;t believe I have to admit that. Fuck, I deleted Snapchat and Instagram on my phone because I didn&amp;#39;t want to compare myself to all my peers partying and having the time of their lives. Fuck, some days I walk past some couples on campus and I feel so jealous and it brings me down. Sometimes I insult the boyfriends that I walk past with to make myself feel better. I feel so anxious in the idea of going to a meetup or a club event to meet new people. Too anxious to even go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been feeling a lot like this lately too &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5cdv1x/is_it_okay_to_cry/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5cdv1x/is_it_okay_to_cry/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel like all of this is incredibly hard. Really hard. Working on yourself is hard. Coping with failure is hard. Trying to be happy is hard. Existing is actually damned hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I changed. I worked hard for it. I read every book, I forced myself to go out and socialize, I practiced talking to strangers and talking to girls, I try to act and actually be confident. I went to therapy for this. I changed my lifestyle. I dress well, I eat well, I got new hobbies, I met new people. I even moved to another country. And here I am, feeling like I&amp;#39;m back at nothing. Making the same old mistakes again, getting the same old results, experiencing the same old depressing feelings. knowing fully well that it&amp;#39;s all my fault. And it hurts. It freaking hurts. I want to cry but I feel like I shouldn&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t want to be this way, I don&amp;#39;t want everything to affect me so much. But I just don&amp;#39;t know how to go on anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed a lonely girl in class two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of approaching her and seeing what she&amp;#39;s like, and to also date her. Someone to get to know. It&amp;#39;s been 17 months since my last date. But I&amp;#39;ve actually never cold approached a girl. I went for a lot of girls from social circles and mutual friends but not out of the blue cold approach. The whole time I said &amp;quot;Nah I&amp;#39;m improving myself, need to make myself into the best I could be, work out again, meditate again, get new hobbies and more friends etc etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of just not approaching her at all. I was scared. I was needy. I felt like I wasn&amp;#39;t ready. I didn&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;amazing, exciting, full life&amp;quot; that someone else wants to join. I felt like I was missing this &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5g7yd6/she_confirmed_it_the_truth_in_one_sentence/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5g7yd6/she_confirmed_it_the_truth_in_one_sentence/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I remember this video &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdymCQ5PXrs\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdymCQ5PXrs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zrsfd/this_is_why_you_should_say_hi_incredible_short/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zrsfd/this_is_why_you_should_say_hi_incredible_short/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to approach her. To remove the what if scenario. I can&amp;#39;t miss out. Maybe we will have a adventure together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went for it. I told myself fuck it. I told myself instead of wondering &amp;quot;I hope she&amp;#39;ll like me&amp;quot;, I instead said to myself: &amp;quot;I wonder what is she like?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling of walking down the stairs to sit beside her was fucking wild. I experienced a exhilarating sort of emotions because I wasn&amp;#39;t used to this. It&amp;#39;s been a long time since my last date 17 months ago. I was rusty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then bam, I asked if the seat beside her was taken. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I told her &amp;quot;Hey I thought you&amp;#39;re cute and wanted to come say hi&amp;quot;.  Her faced turned red, laughing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I introduced myself. Oh boy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shook her hand firmly. I felt like I was at the top of the world. It was surreal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the positive vibes were there. Body language, she admitted she was awkward while we were talking, she was laughing at everything I said, smiles, her face turns red again, positive signs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I number closed right after class ended saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll get your number, we should go out together some time&amp;quot; stating my intentions very clearly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She never said she had a boyfriend. I couldn&amp;#39;t wait to text the next day to meet up with her the next week. Hell, after class I got excited that I started experiencing some forms of oneitis that I have to admit where maybe we will have an adventure together, road trips together, hiking together, seeing museums and experiencing life together. I am aware of oneitis, experienced it many times before. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdnYedTpToA\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdnYedTpToA&lt;/a&gt;  I tried to tell myself that I have abundance, and no matter what happens, happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted her up the next day. I told myself who I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she said this&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey it&amp;#39;s _, sorry I should have mentioned this earlier but I have a boyfriend if you were thinking of being more than friends xD. Thanks for being brave and approaching me though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think she had a boyfriend at first, I thought she was lying, because I had a girl lie to me that she had a boyfriend but is still single to this day, even alone for this years Valentine&amp;#39;s day. However, she showed up with her boyfriend the next day and I knew it was true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first I shrugged it off, I was fucking proud of myself to approach someone like that right in front of my friends. Proud to have the courage to go for it. Proud I went for it. Proud I didn&amp;#39;t play games and made myself as assertive as I could be, stating my intentions as early as possible and knowing within a day if we are going to go out together. My curiosity was fulfilled and I was almost ready to move on. I told myself it was just an incompatibility like what Mark Manson said in Models. Maybe our demographics of who we are didn&amp;#39;t match up. It was all factors outside of my control, and it was never my fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, I experienced doubt within a span of meeting her one day to the next day after of being rejected. That maybe I won&amp;#39;t experience love. Maybe something is wrong with me. The loneliness crushed me. After some time later that I got that message, I binge drinked. Pissed off. Sad feelings. I broke things around my dorm room, yelled shit out, punched things, realizing maybe I&amp;#39;m worthless, thinking of all my failures in life and with girls until I passed out on the couch until my roommate woke me up wondering what the fuck happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the girls I went for... the most recent one, has a boyfriend, then the one before, has a boyfriend, then the one before &amp;quot;Thank you, I am very flattered and you seem like a very nice guy but unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t feel the same way, thanks for the fun dates though!&amp;quot; then the one before she says &amp;quot;I have a thing with someone else&amp;quot;, then the one before she says she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be in a relationship, then she goes after the asian guy that has a Mustang. Then the one before her was a lesbian. Then the one before she flaked on the date, no reply, no contact ever again. Then the one before her... Damn. And there were more girls before her that I experienced rejection. I have tried many times with multiple girls in my life. All the girls I asked out, all the dates, all that effort blown by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to feel. Feels like the universe hates me. I know the universe owes me nothing. I am entitled to nothing. Society exists to fill other people&amp;#39;s needs &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14zyof/6_harsh_truths_that_will_make_you_a_better_person/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14zyof/6_harsh_truths_that_will_make_you_a_better_person/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some days I read this to tell myself that I am the prize and girls are lucky to be in the glory of my company. Something to read when I feel really down &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gg9zv/i_am_the_prize/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gg9zv/i_am_the_prize/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, I feel like a failure. I feel like I can never be with someone, to experience love, intimacy, to have someone genuinely interested in you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this normal for my age? To be a kissless virgin around this age? Is the Atlantic article above fake news?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I do from here on out? What are my next steps? I am lost, I feel like there is no hope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I am overwhelmed by all the responses here. I am at a loss for words, and I have no idea what to say to each and every one of you. This is a lot to take in. I really appreciate all the responses on here and for everyone taking their time out of their day helping me out. Thank you. I&amp;#39;ve never posted a thread on here before, I hesitated posting this that maybe I was too desperate or too needy. But I just wanted to let it all out from what I built up over the years on what I think about myself, and my perspective. I  just posted few comments here and there in Seddit helping out others from my experiences over the years. I was hoping by posting on what I&amp;#39;ve been going through this whole time in college, I might help somebody out with the advice I would get and have someone else out there relate to me that they are not alone. I realize that I am too needy worrying about my virginity and I give myself too much negative talk, putting pussy on the pedestal. I really need to get some interesting hobbies instead of being just a guy that masturbates to porn over the weekends, playing video games and surfing Reddit feeling sorry for myself. I really need to start working out again, to make myself proud, and to seek happiness within instead of seeking external validation from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you Seddit, I don&amp;#39;t know how to give back to this community. It&amp;#39;s all up to me. This is my life. This journey is going to be hard. But that&amp;#39;s just what life is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first day of the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It's hard to admit but I can't believe it.

Hell, after class I got excited that I started experiencing some forms of oneitis that I have to admit where maybe we will have an adventure together, road trips together, hiking together, seeing museums and experiencing life together. I am aware of oneitis, experienced it many times before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdnYedTpToA  I tried to tell myself that I have abundance, and no matter what happens, happens. \n\n\nI texted her up the next day. I told myself who I am.\n\n\nThen she said this\n\n\n\"Hey it's _, sorry I should have mentioned this earlier but I have a boyfriend if you were thinking of being more than friends xD. Thanks for being brave and approaching me though.\"\n\n\nI didn't think she had a boyfriend at first, I thought she was lying, because I had a girl lie to me that she had a boyfriend but is still single to this day, even alone for this years Valentine's day. However, she showed up with her boyfriend the next day and I knew it was true.\n\n\nAt first I shrugged it off, I was fucking proud of myself to approach someone like that right in front of my friends. Proud to have the courage to go for it. Proud I went for it. Proud I didn't play games and made myself as assertive as I could be, stating my intentions as early as possible and knowing within a day if we are going to go out together. My curiosity was fulfilled and I was almost ready to move on. I told myself it was just an incompatibility like what Mark Manson said in Models. Maybe our demographics of who we are didn't match up. It was all factors outside of my control, and it was never my fault.\n\n\nBut then, I experienced doubt within a span of meeting her one day to the next day after of being rejected. That maybe I won't experience love. Maybe something is wrong with me. The loneliness crushed me. After some time later that I got that message, I binge drinked. Pissed off. Sad feelings. I broke things around my dorm room, yelled shit out, punched things, realizing maybe I'm worthless, thinking of all my failures in life and with girls until I passed out on the couch until my roommate woke me up wondering what the fuck happened.\n\n\nAll the girls I went for... the most recent one, has a boyfriend, then the one before, has a boyfriend, then the one before \"Thank you, I am very flattered and you seem like a very nice guy but unfortunately I don't feel the same way, thanks for the fun dates though!\" then the one before she says \"I have a thing with someone else\", then the one before she says she doesn't want to be in a relationship, then she goes after the asian guy that has a Mustang. Then the one before her was a lesbian. Then the one before she flaked on the date, no reply, no contact ever again. Then the one before her... Damn. And there were more girls before her that I experienced rejection. I have tried many times with multiple girls in my life. All the girls I asked out, all the dates, all that effort blown by the wind.\n\n\nI don't know what to feel. Feels like the universe hates me. I know the universe owes me nothing. I am entitled to nothing. Society exists to fill other people's needs https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14zyof/6_harsh_truths_that_will_make_you_a_better_person/\n\n\nSome days I read this to tell myself that I am the prize and girls are lucky to be in the glory of my company. Something to read when I feel really down https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gg9zv/i_am_the_prize/\n\n\nBut still, I feel like a failure. I feel like I can never be with someone, to experience love, intimacy, to have someone genuinely interested in you. \n\n\nIs this normal for my age? To be a kissless virgin around this age? Is the Atlantic article above fake news?\n\n\nWhat can I do from here on out? What are my next steps? I am lost, I feel like there is no hope. \n\n\n**EDIT:** I am overwhelmed by all the responses here. I am at a loss for words, and I have no idea what to say to each and every one of you. This is a lot to take in. I really appreciate all the responses on here and for everyone taking their time out of their day helping me out. Thank you. I've never posted a thread on here before, I hesitated posting this that maybe I was too desperate or too needy. But I just wanted to let it all out from what I built up over the years on what I think about myself, and my perspective. I  just posted few comments here and there in Seddit helping out others from my experiences over the years. I was hoping by posting on what I've been going through this whole time in college, I might help somebody out with the advice I would get and have someone else out there relate to me that they are not alone. I realize that I am too needy worrying about my virginity and I give myself too much negative talk, putting pussy on the pedestal. I really need to get some interesting hobbies instead of being just a guy that masturbates to porn over the weekends, playing video games and surfing Reddit feeling sorry for myself. I really need to start working out again, to make myself proud, and to seek happiness within instead of seeking external validation from others.\n\n\nThank you Seddit, I don't know how to give back to this community. It's all up to me. This is my life. This journey is going to be hard. But that's just what life is.\n\n\nThis is the first day of the rest of my life.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65bkc5", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 211, "report_reasons": null, "author": "idunnowhattofeel", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65bkc5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.seduction", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "edited": 1492203451.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/seduction/comments/65bkc5/i_just_turned_20_about_to_finish_my_sophomore/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492190454.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/65bkc5/i_just_turned_20_about_to_finish_my_sophomore/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "I just turned 20.

It is difficult to be able to push past a lot of the anxiety that comes from the pick up game when you are a kissless virgin, but in order to push past this you have to shift your focus and anxiety away from sex so you can stop keeping it on such a high pedestal.\n\n\nThis first thing I would so to do is read \"Models\" by Mark Manson. I know people say that a lot here, but there is a reason for that. Mark helps to break down a path for self-improvement and then puts sexual attraction and interaction in a realistic perspective. I know you are busy with college courses, but you need to find the time for self-improvement and to read the book. Section out a half an hour to  an hour to just read and fully understand the book.\n\nThis brings me to my second point, you need to improve yourself and your self-esteem. Telling yourself you are amazing and confident doesn't bring confidence if you still know in the back of your mind that you don't like who you currently are. Go to the gym and begin weightlifting again, or even running. Just get back into regular exercise 3 days a week for an hour each and you can check r/fitness for a basic routine to start. Begin to update your wardrobe to a style you can find in r/malefashionadvice that YOU like. It's easy to try to fit a certain style to look better, but you don't want to dress for other people. You should try to dress for yourself so when you are wearing you favorite shirt or outfit you feel confident and proud of it. Finally, begin to try out new hobbies and learn new things. I know your college has extracurriculars and clubs, join a couple and try out new things. Try Salsa Dancing, or Pottery, or Yoga, or anything you might be interested. This will give you the opportunity to become a more well rounded person while meeting new people and branching your social circle out.\n\nOnce you have improved on those three things and read Models you will feel a confidence boost because you improved yourself for the sake of yourself. Instead of trying to improve yourself to be able to go after girls, you realize you did it because you genuinely wanted to become a better person. People will see this and enjoy being in your company if you generally have confidence and fun with who you are as a person (as cheesy as that is). This will give you the opportunity to begin to get to know people better and establish a stronger relationship with them because you like who they are. Be flirtatious when establishing these relationships (platonic or not) but also have a genuine interest in getting to know these people around you. People love to talk about themselves, and the stories people have about their lives are fascinating. Everyone has a deep story to who they are and the struggles they have gone through, and simply listening and genuine having an interest makes them appreciate you (whether guy or girl). When you approach, don't go in with an intention to date or fuck but genuinely become interested in who they are. Once you are talking with them, like the personality and looks, then begin to escalate kino and polarize and see if they respond receptively as well. If they do then awesome, continue escalation, banter, and take charge. If they don't, accept that but don't drop them like they are nothing. For example, the girl you hit on who turned out to have a boyfriend, if she was a genuinely interesting person why not become friends with her? You could get a possibly really good friend plus the opportunity to meet her friends as well. I honestly think if you stop focusing on sex so much (which is difficult I understand that) you will see a huge improvement with girls and escalation.\n\n\nI think one of the biggest problems I had when I was a virgin is that I put sex on such a high pedestal and such a miraculous and incredible thing. Don't get me wrong sex is fun, but it's just sex. Your first time may suck and the girl you are with may just be bad at it. If I had the choice between okay sex or a good night with close friends I'd take the good night. Understanding this will help to take away the neediness factor that may be hurting you when approaching girls.\n\nI hope this helped. I'm the same age as you and although I'm not an expert, I've been in your shoes and this is what helped me improve.

But thats cuz men need to have deep trust to do war and build shit.
