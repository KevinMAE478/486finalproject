For those of you have not seen the &lt;em&gt;Flawless Natural&lt;/em&gt;, I would recommend giving it a once over as there is a lot of helpful material provided. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So some of you may be wondering as to what my title means. This is honestly the best thing I learned from watching Tim&amp;#39;s Video, and its simply this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Intention&lt;/strong&gt; (Escalating kino, showing sexual desire etc.) + &lt;strong&gt;Awesome Attitude&lt;/strong&gt;= The kind of guy &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; is interested in, emotionally and physically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Intention&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;sub-par attitude&lt;/strong&gt; (not having fun, out of sync body language) = &lt;strong&gt;Creepy/uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt;, and makes everyone uncomfortable. This is what I am referring to in my title. Strong intention is awesome as long as your intention is to bring value to the situation, rather than just finding out what you can get out of it (i.e. sex). The reason why girls define a guy as creepy rather \u201csexy\u201d or \u201ccharming\u201d is because how would you feel if someone who\u2019s acting like they\u2019re selling you something (something you know nothing about) were to all of a sudden touch your knee, or thigh, nervously compliment you. You would probably feel very uncomfortable and turned off to their \u201cpitch\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;weak intention&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;awesome attitude&lt;/strong&gt;= The &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Entertainer&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, being the entertainer is all well and good sometimes, and I think it&amp;#39;s the category that a lot of guys end up finding themselves in. Occasionally one can get laid being the entertainer, but unfortunately, most of the time women will categorize you as the &amp;quot;the joker&amp;quot;, essentially the guy that makes her laugh but doesn&amp;#39;t go home with her either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 This is why Tim urges men to become confident in their mentality rather than a rehearsed technique. I would have to say that for the most part, I agree with this line of thinking. I know that we have all been around beautiful women and sometimes when you&amp;#39;re chatting them up, you can become so focused on just keeping the conversation going that you&amp;#39;ve forgotten the second critical aspect, which is showing your intention. I remember when I was first starting out, I would approach a girl at X location; I would introduce myself, build some rapport (make them laugh and what not) but I never really bridged that physical gap. I&amp;#39;ve learned that If I am in the mindset of providing my own entertainment, that gets me in the positive attitude I need to be in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 For example, one thing I do in order to get &amp;quot;Into state&amp;quot; as Tyler refers to it, is say I&amp;#39;m in a bar and it&amp;#39;s super busy and it seems like I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;breaking in&amp;quot; to the environment (feeling like you&amp;#39;re an outsider to current developments) I&amp;#39;ll go up to a group of people and introduce myself and because this is my idea of having fun, I will go up to them and ask them the tried and proven question &amp;quot;Do you think men and women can be friends if they are attracted to one another&amp;quot;. Almost 100% of the time Girls will answer Yes and guys will answer No. I&amp;#39;ve had 20-30 minute conversations about this topic alone and I personally just love what people have to say about the subject. remember though, this is something I personally like doing and it gets me to have fun and interactive conversation. It is also has the benefit of possibly starting a more escalated conversation with a woman who might be with group already. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 So after you have possibly had some fun going around and just being social, you&amp;#39;ll notice that you probably feel a bit lighter, like you can feel more of a presence within yourself. That&amp;#39;s exactly what you want. As soon as your initial social interactions are over and you feel good, use that energy and go talk to the first girl that strikes your eye. The important thing to remember while you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;getting ready&amp;quot; is you should still be practicing your kino. My definition of kino is a little different then I suppose the typical seddit edition. I consider it more as a physical touch to establish a further bond regardless of gender. So, go in for a high five, a bro hug, anything that you feel in the moment would build and cross that physical barrier of human connection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ideally once you&amp;#39;ve approached a girl you&amp;#39;ll be loose, you&amp;#39;ll be confident and excited in your verbiage, you&amp;#39;ll get that great mindset + this allows your Kino to come off seamlessly which.... also happens to show strong intention. It\u2019s a beautiful pin pong game of showing intention and getting better feedback and further interaction. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to Wrap up, I&amp;#39;ve left you with two very large pieces of the puzzle and all you have left is a few and minor pieces to find for yourself. Just remember that we all like watching and interacting with people that are having a great time. It&amp;#39;s infectious, it&amp;#39;s exciting and as long you showing that you&amp;#39;re more than an unpaid comedian or a bruiting sex hog out for the kill, the rest will be your decisions at each moment, but if you begin this mentality, your decisions will come from a place of assurance and confidence rather than performance. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For those of you have seen the *Flawless Natural* with RSD Tim, you will be very familiar with this mentality.
