You're being too hard on yourself here.....  \n\n&gt; Well, for example girls would bring up sex first while texting and I don't know how I could escalate the conversation. \n\nYou don't \"escalate\" through conversation.  You escalate through **actions**.  *Physical* escalation.  It doesn't matter that they brought up sex, unless they were literally proposing for you guys to have sex.\n\nIn fact, if you actually want to have sex, you should make sure that sex DOESN'T come up in conversation first.\n\n&gt; I start feeling nervous and I try and be funny about it and they just stop responding. I guess I go into desperation mode and act like a weirdo.\n\nSounds like you actually just got awkward because they got near the topic of sex, which yes.....  would have been a turn-off.\n\n_________2_________\n\n&gt; There were also girls that I turned down because I was just not feeling them at all......still feel like an idiot for not biting the bullet though.\n\n***NO***.  Having personal standards is not stupid.  Think how that sounds.  NO one is entitled to having sex with a person just because THEY want to have it.  If you didn't want to have it, you shouldn't have had to put out just because they wanted it.  \n\nYou have self-respect.  Don't sell it out.\n\n_________3_________\n\n&gt; When going out..I would notice some girls glancing at me more then once, so i would approach them and fuck it up because I'm nervous and even if things are going good, I don't know how to escalate.\n\nGlancing doesn't equal wanting sex.  So the overall good news is that you haven't been fucking up some slam dunks here.  Sounds like you've had some girls showing interest, and then you've shut it down on yourself when that happens.  \n\nBut it's not like you've had girls wanting sex and you killed it just before.\n\n_________4_________\n\n&gt; True, but it is very hard not to compare myself when I see some guys hardly putting in any effort and getting lucky.\n\nFirst off, while there is some element that's not under a guy's control (like the girl's desires, or probability), it's not just \"getting lucky.\"  It's not like the heavens are bequeathing pussy and sex on other guys and just slighting you.  What's happening is that they've learned enough to get the hell out of their own way.  That's MOST of game: getting out of our own way.\n\nSecondly, those guys are not just passively sitting there.  They do have to put in some work.  Work on themselves to improve.  And investment in connecting with a girl.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;______&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s good news and bad news, I&amp;#39;d say.  You&amp;#39;re being too hard on yourself here.....  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, for example girls would bring up sex first while texting and I don&amp;#39;t know how I could escalate the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;escalate&amp;quot; through conversation.  You escalate through &lt;strong&gt;actions&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Physical&lt;/em&gt; escalation.  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter that they brought up sex, unless they were literally proposing for you guys to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you actually want to have sex, you should make sure that sex DOESN&amp;#39;T come up in conversation first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I start feeling nervous and I try and be funny about it and they just stop responding. I guess I go into desperation mode and act like a weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like you actually just got awkward because they got near the topic of sex, which yes.....  would have been a turn-off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;______&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There were also girls that I turned down because I was just not feeling them at all......still feel like an idiot for not biting the bullet though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Having personal standards is not stupid.  Think how that sounds.  NO one is entitled to having sex with a person just because THEY want to have it.  If you didn&amp;#39;t want to have it, you shouldn&amp;#39;t have had to put out just because they wanted it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have self-respect.  Don&amp;#39;t sell it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;______&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When going out..I would notice some girls glancing at me more then once, so i would approach them and fuck it up because I&amp;#39;m nervous and even if things are going good, I don&amp;#39;t know how to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glancing doesn&amp;#39;t equal wanting sex.
