As a dude who got almost all his firsts at the age of 32, and has had more \"success\" in the last year than the rest of his entire life, here's my advice for someone in their 30s.\n\n1 Don't let a girl's emotions bother you. Most women's emotions go up and down way more than most men, so better not to let their shit affect you too much (this is not to say guys don't have moods, just that in general ours are more stable than your average woman's when it comes to relationship stuff).\n\n2 Tying into number one, learn to strike \"while the iron is hot\". I'm no casanova. Just a regular guy, but I've had girls make overt/subtle moves on me, and I've gone \"don't push too hard tonight, she likes you so she'll still be keen tomorrow\". No, no, no. If a girl is making a move do not assume that there is another chance with her on the horizon. If you don't make a move now she might think you are rejecting her. I kick myself on a regular bloody basis when it comes to all the women who have made moves on me and I was just too shy or slow to do anything about it.\n\n3 Try to find a way to meet women that suits your personality. I'm a smart/creative/arty kinda guy, and I fucking hate clubs. I use online dating, art events, and friendship circles to meet girls. \n\n4 Don't tell a girl that you like her, show her. Flirt, gentle touches, holding hands, and kissing all fall under this. Make sure to learn how to \"own your sexuality\". I usually do this with innuendo. I try to regularly remind people yes, I am a dude, I have a penis, I like to fuck girls, in subtle ways.\n\n5 Friendzone stuff: generally speaking, dudes put themselves in the friendzone because they're too chicken shit to say anything. However, sometimes a girl can like you, and might even want to bang you, but if you are key to her social circle she will reject your advances. Sexual relationships can and usually do go south at some point and if the girl thinks it's going to affect her social circle, she'll politely reject you. \n\n6 If you haven't done anything sexual with a girl before, don't be like my brother and tell her until you've gotten past second base. Rather clumsily figure it out than be open about your lack of experience. Most girls will be turned off by this.\n\n7 Don't worry about never having done something with a woman, or not having a girlfriend. Even if you've never kissed a woman, they build up all kinds of weird stories in their heads. My ex thought I was a player even though I thought I had the V card stuck to my forehead.

Just a regular guy, but I&amp;#39;ve had girls make overt/subtle moves on me, and I&amp;#39;ve gone &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t push too hard tonight, she likes you so she&amp;#39;ll still be keen tomorrow&amp;quot;. No, no, no. If a girl is making a move do not assume that there is another chance with her on the horizon. If you don&amp;#39;t make a move now she might think you are rejecting her. I kick myself on a regular bloody basis when it comes to all the women who have made moves on me and I was just too shy or slow to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 Try to find a way to meet women that suits your personality. I&amp;#39;m a smart/creative/arty kinda guy, and I fucking hate clubs. I use online dating, art events, and friendship circles to meet girls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 Don&amp;#39;t tell a girl that you like her, show her. Flirt, gentle touches, holding hands, and kissing all fall under this. Make sure to learn how to &amp;quot;own your sexuality&amp;quot;. I usually do this with innuendo. I try to regularly remind people yes, I am a dude, I have a penis, I like to fuck girls, in subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 Friendzone stuff: generally speaking, dudes put themselves in the friendzone because they&amp;#39;re too chicken shit to say anything. However, sometimes a girl can like you, and might even want to bang you, but if you are key to her social circle she will reject your advances. Sexual relationships can and usually do go south at some point and if the girl thinks it&amp;#39;s going to affect her social circle, she&amp;#39;ll politely reject you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 If you haven&amp;#39;t done anything sexual with a girl before, don&amp;#39;t be like my brother and tell her until you&amp;#39;ve gotten past second base. Rather clumsily figure it out than be open about your lack of experience. Most girls will be turned off by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 Don&amp;#39;t worry about never having done something with a woman, or not having a girlfriend. Even if you&amp;#39;ve never kissed a woman, they build up all kinds of weird stories in their heads. My ex thought I was a player even though I thought I had the V card stuck to my forehead. A friend of mine thought I was at very least average and was very surprised when I opened up to her about how my ex was most of my firsts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg90q36", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492197720.0, "created_utc": 1492168920.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659exd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8j40o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "darkmagicmge", "parent_id": "t3_659exd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why worry?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why worry?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg8j40o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160762.0, "created_utc": 1492131962.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659exd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8s4dp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abstractpickupartist", "parent_id": "t3_659exd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Get the fuck off your computer, and start having a life\".", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get the fuck off your computer, and start having a life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg8s4dp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174384.0, "created_utc": 1492145584.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659exd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8qkkl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MonkeyFist4150", "parent_id": "t3_659exd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Interestingly when you get older its easier to pick up women your age.
