I call this the IRON LAW OF SEDUCTION. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding and correctly applying this law will solve 99% of the problems men have with women. She\u2019s not responsive to your advances? Not emotionally invested enough. Not returning your calls? Not emotionally invested enough. Flaking? Not emotionally invested enough. On the flipside, as a man, if you emotionally divest yourself from girls, you solve most your own problems. Outcome dependent? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid. Approach anxiety? You are too emotionally invested in the success of the interaction. Neediness and desperation? You are emotionally invested in getting girls. Suck at conversations? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid and can\u2019t just have a regular conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotional investment is subconsciously communicated and women evolved to sense it. One guy can talk to a girl all night without her feeling like he is emotionally invested, but another can talk to her for 2 seconds and get auto-rejected for being too invested. Of course, a woman may talk to you, hang out with you, fuck you, or even date you for a long time if she\u2019s not emotionally invested because she\u2019s horny, crazy, lonely, desperate, drunk, bored, want something from you, etc.... But if she\u2019s not emotionally invested, you are on thin ice and vulnerable at any time to flaking or going cold.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is emotional investment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotional investment is occupying one\u2019s thoughts and emotions. It is not the same as being interested or \u201cliking\u201d somebody. I \u201clike\u201d a lot of people but I don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything for them and it wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings if they rejected me or even died.  This distinction is why women flake. Women \u201clike,\u201d get \u201cinterested,\u201d and give their numbers to lots of guys, but if she is not at least a little emotionally invested she will not be motivated to get out of bed, put on her make-up, and come somewhere to meet you. Unlike men, women get invited to shit all the time by guys they \u201clike\u201d so they are not going to care about meeting you unless there is some emotional investment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about emotional investment like this: like most men, you probably like Lamborghinis. But like most men, you probably don\u2019t have one, and you probably don\u2019t spend all day thinking about Lamborghinis and being sad because you don\u2019t have one. But if I lent you a Lamborghini for two months and you drove it around, took care of it, showed it off to your friends, and got laid because of it, you would be sad when I take it back. It\u2019s irrational, but you would get emotionally invested in the Lambo even if you weren\u2019t sad when you never had one. Because you became attached to it and it gave you a sense of identity and power, the Lambo took up space in your thoughts and emotions, making you emotionally invested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotional investment in people is similar. Being around somebody awesome and feeling like they \u201cbelong\u201d to you  becomes addictive like crack. An awesome man makes a woman feel special, loved, important, powerful, and cool. An awesome man is also fun, positive, confident, carefree, and dominant, easing the woman\u2019s anxieties and insecurities. Being around an awesome guy is literally like a drug to women, and if they are around you long enough, they become hooked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ben Franklin Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ben Franklin, one of America\u2019s founding fathers and greatest poonhounds, famously and counterintuitively discovered that if person A does something for person B, person A will like person B more. Most people would assume the opposite \u2013 if you want people to like you, you should do things for them, so person B should like person B more! Right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Person A \u201clikes\u201d person B more because person A has become emotionally invested. Maybe person A subconsciously expects person B to do something nice back. Maybe person A subconsciously see themselves as \u201cbeneath\u201d person B in the ape hierarchy. Maybe person A is protecting their own ego \u2013 person B must be somebody special if even I did something for them! Or maybe the simple act of doing something for person B caused person B to enter person A\u2019s thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the psychological mechanism, when a woman really likes you, she will WANT to do stuff for you, sometimes even aggressively, and she will WANT to emotionally invest while you fantasize about other things. When a woman really likes you is when you realize that needy, supplicating, validating behavior is not necessary. I have friends that are strippers, and their job is basically to hustle men out of money and to trick guys into buying shit for them. I don\u2019t buy girls things, ever, (and I never, ever visit my friends at work) and I notice that when these strippers start to like me they buy me shit, clean my house, do me favors, etc... One night I even got into an argument with a stripper because she bought me 5 drinks in a row and she wouldn\u2019t let me buy her a drink in return. That\u2019s emotional investment.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Woujo Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to my corollary of the Franklin theory, supplicating to a woman, validating yourself to a woman, buying a woman things, following a woman around, allowing a woman to treat you like shit, and spending too much time trying to \u201chelp\u201d a woman who doesn\u2019t deserve it subconsciously will cause you to become emotionally invested in her and feel \u201cbeneath\u201d her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes guys will do loserish things, like let a girl treat them badly or repeatedly pursue a girl who doesn\u2019t care about them, and justify it by saying \u201cI don\u2019t really care about her, I just want to fuck.\u201d This is a bad idea, because even though you consciously think you \u201cdon\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d by pursuing her, you become emotionally invested, and by allowing her treat you like shit, you subconsciously re-wire your brain to feel like a beta male. Even if you didn&amp;#39;t give a fuck before, now you do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t control how you feel, but you can control what you do. Where your actions go, your feelings will follow, and where feelings go, your thoughts will follow. If you do loser things, you will eventually feel like a loser, even if you consciously tell yourself you \u201cdon\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d If a hot girl tries to strike a Faustian bargain with you and let you fuck her in return for treating you like shit, you must reject that deal out of respect for your own mental health. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your brain works by making connections, and when you focus your thoughts and emotions on something, your brain starts connecting that thing to other things in your brain, and that thing becomes \u201cenmeshed\u201d in your wiring, creating a deeper web that is hard to untangle. For example, if you date a really hot girl, your brain will start to associate her with sexual pleasure, or ego, or fun times, and other things you like, so when she dumps you, you will think of her constantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The definition of \u201cnot giving a fuck\u201d is only keeping positive thoughts and emotions in your head, and cutting out people, places, activities, thoughts, media, etc... that are negative. \u201cNot giving a fuck\u201d is not about being cold, aloof, an asshole, or stupid, but by filing your thoughts and emotions only with positive things that deserve to be there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is emotional investment unattractive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotional investment is an immediate turn-off. It doesn\u2019t matter why, but I can guess some reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, emotional investment is unattractive because people are attracted to lives that are more interesting, exciting, higher, and better than our own. We just assume that somebody living a better life than us is going to be thinking and feeling about their awesome life, not us. If a woman knows she occupies your thoughts and emotions, she will assume your life sucks. She wants to fixate her thoughts and emotions on something higher, but if your thoughts and emotions are fixated on her, she\u2019s back where she started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a girl that plays soccer will be attracted to guys that are better at soccer than her because they will appeal to the part of her thoughts and emotions that are invested in soccer. I&amp;#39;m not saying she will never become emotionally invested in a guy who is worse at soccer than she is - she may invest in a guy for other reasons - but the guy is playing with a disadvantage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, emotional investment is unattractive because, simply put, emotions are bad and scary. Our society acts like \u201clove\u201d is an emotion and \u201cour true selves\u201d are our emotions, but that\u2019s bullshit. Our value lies in what we can do when we are rational, what we\u2019ve learned in our life, what we know how to do, and what we strive to achieve and be when we are clear-headed. Emotions are temporary and fleeting; but true love is a rational, credible commitment to your beloved\u2019s well-being. In his dialogue the Phaedrus, the Greek philosopher Plato said that emotional love is a kind of madness \u2013 when things are going well, you are irrationally nice to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. When things are going badly, you are irrationally nasty to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. Women know that when you are irrationally nice to them you will eventually be irrationally shitty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of our emotions are selfish, irrational, unrealistic, uncontrollable, and oftentimes downright evil. Emotions are fundamentally needy: they always want something, even if the \u201cwant\u201d is to help somebody. If you see a beautiful woman and think \u201cI like her, and I want to make her happy and do nice things for her,\u201d you\u2019re lying to yourself. You want things FROM her. You want to fuck her, use her for an ego boost, have your friends see you with her, and make yourself feel better for being a \u201cgood person.\u201d You don\u2019t want to see her run off and be happy with another guy, you want her to be unhappy with you. When you show emotion women subconsciously know you want something and that puts pressure on them, and they run away. Women sometimes will hang out with guys they don\u2019t like or aren\u2019t attracted to in any way, just because those guys are not emotionally invested and are not putting any pressure on them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you become extremely emotional, you fantasize about getting your beloved back or hurting them for the wrongs they did to you, you stalk them, you act weird, you feel depressed, you can\u2019t function, etc\u2026 Love songs glorify these feelings, but these are not healthy feelings. They are signs of weakness. Women have these feelings things too (oftentimes much more deeply than men), and they know it\u2019s a scary pit to be in, so if they sense for even a second that a man is feeling these things (or is even just slightly beginning to feel these things), they run away immediately. Women want an emotional rock. They want the lifeguard on the edge of the pool pulling them out, not somebody drowning with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women also take longer to get emotionally invested in men than men take to get emotionally invested in women. Men evolved to seek \u201cfertile\u201d women (big ass, big tits, healthy face) to impregnate as soon as possible. Women, on the other hand, evolved to find the strongest man in the tribe that could protect her and her baby, so they seek a larger group of traits, many of which are long-term traits (confidence, dominance, emotional stability, intelligence, etc\u2026). It takes a woman time to figure out if a guy has these traits but a man can immediately be attracted to a hot girl. In every man-woman relationship there is a period of time where the man is emotionally invested, but the woman is still \u201crational\u201d and feeling the guy out. Many men fuck it up here \u2013 they start acting creepy, or weird, overly nice, overly fixated, and the woman, who feels nothing, thinks the guy isweird or worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, emotions are a part of life and can be beautiful if channeled correctly. But you shouldn\u2019t show your emotions to a woman until she has also developed those emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, emotional investment makes you stupid and saps you of your vitality and awesomeness. Tons interesting, smart, funny, cool, successful guys become vacant shells of their normal selves around women, partly because their thoughts and emotions are empty of everything that makes them awesome. If you are deep in a game of chess and I try to have a conversation with you about quantum physics you will sound stupid because your thoughts and emotions are full of chess. Seduction requires intelligence and creativity, but if your thoughts and emotions are just \u201cdurr, she\u2019s a pretty woman\u201d you\u2019re going to fail. Because women are \u201crational\u201d longer than men, they want to have rational, intelligent conversations about interesting shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another reason is power. It\u2019s a sad fact of life, but humans are wired to look at relationships in power terms. We subconsciously rank everybody in a particular social situation from least to most powerful. Women are much more aware of the power dynamic because they are generally less powerful than men. And unfortunately, we subconsciously see emotional people as lower in the power hierarchy. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, correctly in my opinion, that individuals higher in the social hierarchy do not feel emotions for people lower than them. The lower ranked apes evolved to obey and be obsessed with the alpha male because they need his protection and resources, but the alpha male feels nothing for the lower ranked apes because he does not need them for anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, women are not attracted to emotionally invested men because women are attracted to RESILIENCE. Resilience here means \u201cthe ability to confidently pursue your goals and not let anything or anybody perturb you.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are attracted to resilience because they naturally want a protector, and a protector\u2019s commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. We subconsciously see emotional people as weak because they can be easily controlled. If a guy is emotional about a girl, he is likely to agree with whatever she says, let her get away with bad behavior, etc\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a protector wavers for even a second, the woman becomes anxious and fearful, but a confident man with boundaries is not scared and cannot be thrown off of his mission. You must be a brick wall that cannot be moved or affected: if you approach her or escalate with her, it is purely based on your own desire, not her cajoling. At every moment you should think to yourself \u201cam I doing this because I want to or because I am trying to impress her\u201d? Sometimes you need to monitor her emotional investment on a moment-by-moment basis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subconscious communication&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women can quickly sense by your body language, words, demeanor, tone of voice and actions whether you are emotionally invested. Neither you nor her may consciously know you\u2019re invested, but you will just \u201cfeel\u201d unattractive to her. Sometimes very subtle changes in behavior (staring too long, asking a question that is too intrusive too early) can tip off that you are too invested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use the \u201cgravity theory\u201d to gauge emotional investment. In social settings, high-value people are \u201cbigger\u201d and therefore \u201cdraw\u201d lower-value people to them. If you look at any party, you will see hot girls usually in the center, relaxing and having fun, and guys literally surrounding them like planets around the sun. There is a reason these guys are called \u201corbiters.\u201d If the girl gets up to leave, the guys may play it cool for a while, but they then get up to follow her. Your ultimate goal is to become the center of gravity so women are drawn to you, not vice versa, which is hard, because as a man you must approach. But even if you approach your demeanor and body language can exude the message of \u201cI am the center of gravity, and I create a rip in space-time that compels you to come to me.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The subconscious subtext of an interaction is 99%. For example, the sentence \u201ccan I buy you a drink\u201d can have a wide range of subconscious meanings depending on the tone, body language, context and emotion I deliver them in. \u201cCan I buy you a drink\u201d can mean \u201cI want to fuck you,\u201d \u201cI feel like I owe you something and I want to pay you back,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a generous guy and I like to just people free things,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re a good friend, and I want to show my appreciation,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a loser and I want to make you like me by buying you things,\u201d etc\u2026 What matters is not your superficial words, but your subconscious context. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because seduction is mostly subconscious, I can\u2019t teach you every detail of the walk, speaking style, body language, demeanor, etc\u2026 of a guy who is not emotionally invested. Even if I did, it\u2019s too much for you to remember and process. I even doubted the efficacy of writing this article because it\u2019s incredibly hard to \u201cfake\u201d an emotional state for a long period of time and most people will go back to behaving like what they feel they are.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The paradox of escalation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far it sounds like the right solution to get girls would be to just ignore them completely. You won\u2019t look emotionally invested, right? Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t work. It is the man\u2019s responsibility to approach and escalate because women do not get emotionally invested quickly and are afraid of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get a girl attracted to you, you must show at least some initial interest and escalate, luring her into becoming emotionally invested in you. Magicians use a technique called \u201cforcing,\u201d where they trick the person into thinking they are picking a random card out of the deck when the person is really picking the card the magician wanted them to pick. Seduction is similar: she should feel like she is picking you, not vice-versa. You are just opening the door to her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of seduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seducing a woman while you appear not emotionally invested is incredibly challenging. First, women\u2019s aversion to emotional investment is mostly subconscious \u2013 consciously, women want the guy to show at least some interest. And it\u2019s naturally hard to hang around a woman you like for a long period of time and not become invested to at least some degree. Beautiful women create a reality distortion field where men lose all concept of rationality, truth, normal standards of right and wrong, etc\u2026 You can say \u201cyou\u2019re overthinking this, just be yourself,\u201d, but women touch men\u2019s strongest emotion, so many men literally forget how be themselves. When a beautiful woman walks into a nightclub a swarm of otherwise successful, rational, manly men immediately lose their fucking minds. They start begging for her approval, trying to buy her things, acting stupid, etc\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like I said earlier, men emotionally invest quicker than women, so we must be patient because our emotions push us to jump the gun and get right into lovey-dovey mode. And in non-romantic contexts, people become emotionally invested at the same rate, so you are used to the other person feeling the same as you if the interaction is going well. And when we feel emotionally invested in somebody, we naturally are going to want to elicit a positive emotional response. But trying to make a woman happy that is not emotionally invested comes off as validation-seeking, supplicating, bitch behavior. You must instead do what is RIGHT. A woman may seem cold, and we may think we can \u201cwarm her up\u201d by being \u201cnice\u201d to her, but we should really just pursue our mission and have faith that she will emotionally invest even though she appears on the surface to not be attracted or care about you. Remember: women are constantly sizing you up, so even if they don\u2019t look like they are attracted or paying attention, they are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seduction is a gamble because you must have faith that eventually the woman will start to emotionally invest, knowing she might not. Sometimes she just won\u2019t like you. Sometimes she just wants attention. Sometimes she is in love with you but won\u2019t let it on. Some women are damaged and never emotionally invest in anybody \u2013 they see all men as objects to be used. This is why you must assume attraction \u2013 because you DON\u2019T KNOW. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to not be emotionally invested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you take away one thing from this article, it is this: a woman who is not yet invested in you must not occupy a big part of your thoughts and emotions. You must have your mind and heart on other things when interacting with women. Period. If she hasn\u2019t made room for you in her head and heart yet, you shouldn\u2019t make space for her in your head and heart. If you make this change right now, I promise your results will instantly improve. Women are the dessert to a good life, not the main course, and that\u2019s how women should feel when you are talking to them. WOMEN WANT TO BE DESSERT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my main steps to not becoming emotionally invested:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)      Realize you don\u2019t need to emotionally invest&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)      Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)      Have \u201cabundance mentality\u201d with respect to women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)      Have boundaries and be unperturbable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)      Focus on your own fun first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realize you don\u2019t need to emotionally invest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may be the most important step. I think a lot of guys emotionally invest in girls because society and pop culture subconsciously make us think that for a man to get a girl, he must supplicate to her and emotionally invest in her. In the movies, the confident, successful guy living his own life never gets the girl; instead the winner is the loser who falls in love with her from afar, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to \u201cget\u201d her, enduring multiple rejections and humiliations. These movies also teach that women are delicate flowers that need constant coddling and lovey dovey bullshit. That\u2019s not how it works in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men also misunderstand women\u2019s aversion to rejection. Women have a strong need to be \u201caccepted\u201d and therefore are often much more sensitive to rejection than men. The phrase \u201chell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u201d is true. Dread game and \u201cignoring\u201d women only works if she is ignoring you first. But if you outright reject her, or if she makes a move on you, or asks for acceptance, and you say \u201cno\u201d or she feels like you are ignoring her there is a strong chance she will emotionally \u201cun-invest.\u201d Because women have this strong need for constant acceptance and validation, men mistakenly think they must emotionally invest. But all you really need to do is not reject her or make her feel excluded. It\u2019s a thin line between keeping a woman \u201caccepted\u201d and emotionally investing in her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To win this game, you should only do something for a woman if the woman would do it for you. If you want to buy her a drink, think about whether she would buy you a drink. If she wouldn\u2019t, don\u2019t. If she wants you to wait for her, think about whether she would wait for you. If she wouldn\u2019t, don\u2019t. If there is a girl you always say hi to, but she never says hi to you, stop saying hi to her. She knows who you are, she can say hi to you. It\u2019s ok to \u201cwin\u201d in relationships. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, this is easier said than done. Society and your emotions team up to make you feel like you need to follow girls around, wait for them, put up with their bullshit, buy them drinks, etc\u2026 You must fight your feelingss and social training and have faith that if you stay the course women will become attracted. This requires the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to a woman (saying \u201cno\u201d is different than rejecting her) and the ability to walk away from her, even permanently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans are wired to seek good feelings. If the main part of our life is not making us happy (job, school, our hobbies), we get those good feelings from other sources: drugs, trashy TV, women, food, etc\u2026 All those things are not bad by themselves, but if your regular life doesn\u2019t make you happy, you will overly emotionally invest in bad things and become addicted and depressed. If your life is miserable, you will subconsciously and unknowingly immediately start overly investing in women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use the \u201ccheese pizza method.\u201d Whenever I feel like I\u2019m getting too emotional, I fill my thoughts and emotions with something I love \u2013 cheese pizza, Oreo cheesecake, the day I did mushrooms at the beach, reading about dinosaurs stoned, etc... This clears my head and allows me to act \u201cnormal\u201d around women. When I am thinking about doing something for a girl I ask myself \u201cwhat has she done to dislodge cheese pizza out of my heart and mind?\u201d You can replace cheese pizza with anything, ideally an incredible, thrilling life that she would want to join. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have abundance mentality with respect to girls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No matter how awesome your life is, it is hard to not emotionally invest in girls. Abundance mentality is when your thoughts and emotions are full of other women, so you don\u2019t need this one girl. If you don\u2019t have other girls, you need to delude yourself. I recall times when I did have abundance and put myself back in that mental space. If you\u2019ve never had abundance, imagine you are Brad Pitt or some other celebrity and think about how he would feel and act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have boundaries and be unperturbable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women want you to be an immovable wall that confidently and joyfully pursues his mission. She will try to perturb you from that mission, not because she wants to see you fail, but because she wants to test whether you are actually a brick wall or a fa\u00e7ade for something softer. The same way you knock on a desk at the furniture store to see if it is real wood, a woman shit tests you to see if you are actually confident enough to pursue your mission or if you will be perturbed. And the more confident and immovable you are, the stronger the shit tests become. This is true even if the mission is getting her! As long as she is into it, you need to escalate as if you already know she will say yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mission, when out, should be maximum fun. She should sense that your emotional investment is \u201cwhere\u2019s the party? Where\u2019s the next fun thing?\u201d You should have a plan for the entire night: I\u2019m going to X, then I\u2019m going to Y , etc\u2026 You should not let the woman hijack your plans and take the lead. Your primary mission (career, hobbies, etc\u2026) should also be in your head. Remember the song \u201cgirls just wanna have fun?\u201d In truth, everybody just wants to have fun but boys are wracked with anxiety because they are trying to impress girls. Whenever you are feeling nervous, scared, anxious or like you are emotionally investing too much in a girl, just say to yourself \u201cI\u2019m here to have fun. If you contribute, great. If not, you are dismissed.\u201d Fun and positivity always win. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: If a beautiful woman is talking about something incredibly boring most men pretend to be interested. Wrong! Women know when they are being boring and it is sometimes a subtle shit test to see if you will let her get away with it. Women are not desperate for sex and they do not need to hang around if a guy is being boring, stupid or mean, and they cannot respect or empathize with a guy who would put up with bullshit from her. Men let women be boring when they lose their vision of the good life. A good life involves beautiful women, but it also involves interesting conversations. If you aren\u2019t getting interesting conversations from her, you would leave because you have options. Whenever a woman is being boring, I change the subject just to let her know I don\u2019t tolerate bullshit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By having a vision of the good life, boundaries, and confidence that your life, thoughts and emotions are interesting and valuable, you can challenge and stimulate a woman. Women want a man that will help them grow and introduce them to a better life and more interesting world than the one they currently inhabit. They don\u2019t want some a that agrees with everything they say, a pushover, or a simple-minded conformist.  Women want a guy who is willing to walk away at any time, not because he is some cold-hearted psychopath, but because once a man shows that is he NOT willing to walk away at any time, there is no challenge or growth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, for most of you, this is very difficult. Many of you have uninteresting lives so a beautiful woman would instantly become the most interesting and important thing your life or you are so sex starved and desperate that you don\u2019t care if a woman is being boring, or mean, or uninterested, or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on your own fun first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you paid $500,000 to spend a week with Leonardo DiCaprio (or whatever celebrity you think lives an awesome life) and when you get there Leonardo says \u201ctell us what we should do?\u201d You would say \u201cI don\u2019t know, what are the options?\u201d and Leo goes \u201cI don\u2019t have anything planned \u2013 let\u2019s just do what you were gonna do.\u201d You would be pissed! You want to become part of Leo\u2019s awesome life, not make your own plan. That\u2019s how girls feel when men don\u2019t have a plan. They want to join your life, not lead you around in their life. That\u2019s why you need to focus on your own fun first. You may like you are being rude or selfish, but you\u2019re not, because women are more attracted to the act of leading than the destination necessarily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make her emotionally invest in you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a woman to emotionally invest in you, certain shit must happen: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)  She must \u201clike\u201d you \u2013 i.e., she must find you pleasant, friendly, good-looking, compatible with her values and interests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  She must feel an emotional connection with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)  She must feel accepted by you. If she you are rejecting her, ignoring her, or being hostile, she will not emotionally invest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)  She must watch you be confident and resilient. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)  She needs to spend time around you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She must like you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is self-explanatory. Women are usually not going to invest in you if you don\u2019t share their interests, values, goals, etc\u2026 Some girls want a rapper covered in tattoos, others want a nerdy guy who watches Star Wars. If you\u2019re a versatile guy with lots of interests, a lot more women will like you, but some people just aren\u2019t compatible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She must feel an emotional connection with you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key to developing an emotional connection with a girl is experiencing emotionally exciting things together. The ultimate is of course, passionate sex, but a good concert, a deep conversation, even a beer pong game you guys play together can help build an emotional connection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another way to build an emotional connection is for her to vicariously experience your confidence. She wants you to be her emotional rock, so she would like to project her insecurities and fears onto you, and watch you brush them off as if they were nothing. She also wants to watch you take the lead and make the night fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman has emotional energy, and that energy must be directed towards something or somebody. You want that energy to be directed to you. The easiest way to do this is just by spending time around her. Just \u201cbeing around\u201d will help build attraction as long as you are not fucking it up by being needy or making her feel bad. The best way to get women to like you is to be \u201cforced\u201d to be around them, such as work or a group hangout, where you do not supplicate to them or validate yourself to them. My friend used to take girls out on his boat, and these girls would usually end up liking me by the end of the day because we would have spent all day together. Celebrities get so much tang because women watch them in movies or listen to their music and become emotionally invested, whereas the celebrity shows the women no emotional investment in all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She must feel accepted by you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, so it must feel like the door to you is open. As she invests in you more, you must escalate more. You can fuck this up by being an asshole, not being sensitive to her emotions, and not reading her advances correctly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She must watch you confidently pursue your goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith). A man with confidence has faith that he will succeed in whatever he does and cannot be stopped by anybody. Women get turned by watching a man confidently pursue his mission. Why are women w so attracted to DJs, promoters, and drug dealers in the club? Those guys aren\u2019t exactly the \u201ccream\u201d of society. It\u2019s because those guys are the only people at the club actually doing something. All the other guys are just sitting there drooling over the girls, instantly reducing their attractiveness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To apply all this knowledge, my strategy is to adopt a rational, almost businesslike demeanor, at least in the early stages of the interaction. As I said earlier, women are \u201crational\u201d at the beginning before they are emotionally invested, so you should also be rational. A man must act almost like he is a woman: he is interested in a relationship (or maybe even just sex) but he has high standards and must evaluate the woman thoroughly first and make sure she is suitable before he gets emotionally invested. You should act like your actions are guided by a seduction computer that makes all the decisions based on the available information, not your emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One technique is called \u201cdisinterested interest.\u201d Your rational words should show interest and enthusiasm but you must communicate the \u201cemotion\u201d of \u201cI\u2019m just talking to you to be nice, I am not totally emotionally invested in you yet and I could walk away at any moment.\u201d The best way to do this is by keeping your thoughts and emotions focused on something else, other than her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should not, however, stay completely rational. You must allow yourself to show your emotions about things that are not her: your passions, your interests, your friends, etc\u2026 And you can show emotion towards her if she deserves it: laugh if she says something funny, thank her if she does something nice, sympathize with her if she says something sad: just don\u2019t let on that you feel emotional about \u201cher\u201d unconnected to anything she is or has done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, escalate sexually. Paradoxically, it is possible to escalate sexually and not appear emotionally invested. In fact, a lot of women (especially damaged ones) are looking for emotionless sex. You must touch her, you must turn the conversation sexual, you must do \u201cseductive\u201d things like look into her eyes and whisper in her ear, etc\u2026 And you must confidently take the lead in the conversation and the situation in general, leading her from place to place, getting intimate with her, etc\u2026 And when she starts to emotionally invest, make her feel like you MIGHT emotionally invest too (but not as much as her). Sometimes if you play it \u201ctoo\u201d cool she will think you just like her platonically or that you lost interest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broader view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This article is obviously about getting girls, but the principles are applicable in all areas of your life. Simply put, you should not invest your thoughts and emotions into people, places, institutions, and activities that do not give a fuck about you and/or do not produce a return that equals the investment you put into them. One of the biggest mistakes people make is investing too much in their job, friendship, hobbies, etc..., and getting 0 out of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, whatever you do becomes your emotional investment. If you spend every weekend hanging out with piece of shit people that just do drugs, complain and make bad decisions, guess what, you are now becoming a piece of shit person. You are what you do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow me on twitter: &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/woujo3\"&gt;http://www.twitter.com/woujo3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to my website: &lt;a href=\"http://www.woujo.com\"&gt;http://www.woujo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I hate it when people try to oversimplify pick-up, but if I had to boil down pick up into one principle every man should understand, it is this: The woman must be more emotionally invested in you than you are in her at every stage of the relationship. I call this the IRON LAW OF SEDUCTION. \n\nUnderstanding and correctly applying this law will solve 99% of the problems men have with women. She\u2019s not responsive to your advances? Not emotionally invested enough. Not returning your calls? Not emotionally invested enough. Flaking? Not emotionally invested enough. On the flipside, as a man, if you emotionally divest yourself from girls, you solve most your own problems. Outcome dependent? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid. Approach anxiety? You are too emotionally invested in the success of the interaction. Neediness and desperation? You are emotionally invested in getting girls. Suck at conversations? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid and can\u2019t just have a regular conversation. \n\nEmotional investment is subconsciously communicated and women evolved to sense it. One guy can talk to a girl all night without her feeling like he is emotionally invested, but another can talk to her for 2 seconds and get auto-rejected for being too invested. Of course, a woman may talk to you, hang out with you, fuck you, or even date you for a long time if she\u2019s not emotionally invested because she\u2019s horny, crazy, lonely, desperate, drunk, bored, want something from you, etc.... But if she\u2019s not emotionally invested, you are on thin ice and vulnerable at any time to flaking or going cold.  \n\n**What is emotional investment?**\n\nEmotional investment is occupying one\u2019s thoughts and emotions. It is not the same as being interested or \u201cliking\u201d somebody. I \u201clike\u201d a lot of people but I don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything for them and it wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings if they rejected me or even died.  This distinction is why women flake. Women \u201clike,\u201d get \u201cinterested,\u201d and give their numbers to lots of guys, but if she is not at least a little emotionally invested she will not be motivated to get out of bed, put on her make-up, and come somewhere to meet you. Unlike men, women get invited to shit all the time by guys they \u201clike\u201d so they are not going to care about meeting you unless there is some emotional investment.  \n\nThink about emotional investment like this: like most men, you probably like Lamborghinis. But like most men, you probably don\u2019t have one, and you probably don\u2019t spend all day thinking about Lamborghinis and being sad because you don\u2019t have one. But if I lent you a Lamborghini for two months and you drove it around, took care of it, showed it off to your friends, and got laid because of it, you would be sad when I take it back. It\u2019s irrational, but you would get emotionally invested in the Lambo even if you weren\u2019t sad when you never had one. Because you became attached to it and it gave you a sense of identity and power, the Lambo took up space in your thoughts and emotions, making you emotionally invested. \n\nEmotional investment in people is similar. Being around somebody awesome and feeling like they \u201cbelong\u201d to you  becomes addictive like crack. An awesome man makes a woman feel special, loved, important, powerful, and cool. An awesome man is also fun, positive, confident, carefree, and dominant, easing the woman\u2019s anxieties and insecurities. Being around an awesome guy is literally like a drug to women, and if they are around you long enough, they become hooked. \n\n**The Ben Franklin Theory**\n \nBen Franklin, one of America\u2019s founding fathers and greatest poonhounds, famously and counterintuitively discovered that if person A does something for person B, person A will like person B more. Most people would assume the opposite \u2013 if you want people to like you, you should do things for them, so person B should like person B more! Right? Wrong!\n\nPerson A \u201clikes\u201d person B more because person A has become emotionally invested. Maybe person A subconsciously expects person B to do something nice back. Maybe person A subconsciously see themselves as \u201cbeneath\u201d person B in the ape hierarchy. Maybe person A is protecting their own ego \u2013 person B must be somebody special if even I did something for them! Or maybe the simple act of doing something for person B caused person B to enter person A\u2019s thoughts and emotions.\n \nWhatever the psychological mechanism, when a woman really likes you, she will WANT to do stuff for you, sometimes even aggressively, and she will WANT to emotionally invest while you fantasize about other things. When a woman really likes you is when you realize that needy, supplicating, validating behavior is not necessary. I have friends that are strippers, and their job is basically to hustle men out of money and to trick guys into buying shit for them. I don\u2019t buy girls things, ever, (and I never, ever visit my friends at work) and I notice that when these strippers start to like me they buy me shit, clean my house, do me favors, etc... One night I even got into an argument with a stripper because she bought me 5 drinks in a row and she wouldn\u2019t let me buy her a drink in return. That\u2019s emotional investment.    \n \n**The Woujo Theory**\n \nAccording to my corollary of the Franklin theory, supplicating to a woman, validating yourself to a woman, buying a woman things, following a woman around, allowing a woman to treat you like shit, and spending too much time trying to \u201chelp\u201d a woman who doesn\u2019t deserve it subconsciously will cause you to become emotionally invested in her and feel \u201cbeneath\u201d her.\n \nSometimes guys will do loserish things, like let a girl treat them badly or repeatedly pursue a girl who doesn\u2019t care about them, and justify it by saying \u201cI don\u2019t really care about her, I just want to fuck.\u201d This is a bad idea, because even though you consciously think you \u201cdon\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d by pursuing her, you become emotionally invested, and by allowing her treat you like shit, you subconsciously re-wire your brain to feel like a beta male. Even if you didn't give a fuck before, now you do. \n\nYou can\u2019t control how you feel, but you can control what you do. Where your actions go, your feelings will follow, and where feelings go, your thoughts will follow. If you do loser things, you will eventually feel like a loser, even if you consciously tell yourself you \u201cdon\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d If a hot girl tries to strike a Faustian bargain with you and let you fuck her in return for treating you like shit, you must reject that deal out of respect for your own mental health. \n\nYour brain works by making connections, and when you focus your thoughts and emotions on something, your brain starts connecting that thing to other things in your brain, and that thing becomes \u201cenmeshed\u201d in your wiring, creating a deeper web that is hard to untangle. For example, if you date a really hot girl, your brain will start to associate her with sexual pleasure, or ego, or fun times, and other things you like, so when she dumps you, you will think of her constantly. \n\nThe definition of \u201cnot giving a fuck\u201d is only keeping positive thoughts and emotions in your head, and cutting out people, places, activities, thoughts, media, etc... that are negative. \u201cNot giving a fuck\u201d is not about being cold, aloof, an asshole, or stupid, but by filing your thoughts and emotions only with positive things that deserve to be there. \n\n**Why is emotional investment unattractive?**\n\nEmotional investment is an immediate turn-off. It doesn\u2019t matter why, but I can guess some reasons. \n\nFirst, emotional investment is unattractive because people are attracted to lives that are more interesting, exciting, higher, and better than our own. We just assume that somebody living a better life than us is going to be thinking and feeling about their awesome life, not us. If a woman knows she occupies your thoughts and emotions, she will assume your life sucks. She wants to fixate her thoughts and emotions on something higher, but if your thoughts and emotions are fixated on her, she\u2019s back where she started. \n\nFor example, a girl that plays soccer will be attracted to guys that are better at soccer than her because they will appeal to the part of her thoughts and emotions that are invested in soccer. I'm not saying she will never become emotionally invested in a guy who is worse at soccer than she is - she may invest in a guy for other reasons - but the guy is playing with a disadvantage. \n\nSecond, emotional investment is unattractive because, simply put, emotions are bad and scary. Our society acts like \u201clove\u201d is an emotion and \u201cour true selves\u201d are our emotions, but that\u2019s bullshit. Our value lies in what we can do when we are rational, what we\u2019ve learned in our life, what we know how to do, and what we strive to achieve and be when we are clear-headed. Emotions are temporary and fleeting; but true love is a rational, credible commitment to your beloved\u2019s well-being. In his dialogue the Phaedrus, the Greek philosopher Plato said that emotional love is a kind of madness \u2013 when things are going well, you are irrationally nice to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. When things are going badly, you are irrationally nasty to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. Women know that when you are irrationally nice to them you will eventually be irrationally shitty. \n\nMost of our emotions are selfish, irrational, unrealistic, uncontrollable, and oftentimes downright evil. Emotions are fundamentally needy: they always want something, even if the \u201cwant\u201d is to help somebody. If you see a beautiful woman and think \u201cI like her, and I want to make her happy and do nice things for her,\u201d you\u2019re lying to yourself. You want things FROM her. You want to fuck her, use her for an ego boost, have your friends see you with her, and make yourself feel better for being a \u201cgood person.\u201d You don\u2019t want to see her run off and be happy with another guy, you want her to be unhappy with you. When you show emotion women subconsciously know you want something and that puts pressure on them, and they run away. Women sometimes will hang out with guys they don\u2019t like or aren\u2019t attracted to in any way, just because those guys are not emotionally invested and are not putting any pressure on them.  \n\nWhen you become extremely emotional, you fantasize about getting your beloved back or hurting them for the wrongs they did to you, you stalk them, you act weird, you feel depressed, you can\u2019t function, etc\u2026 Love songs glorify these feelings, but these are not healthy feelings. They are signs of weakness. Women have these feelings things too (oftentimes much more deeply than men), and they know it\u2019s a scary pit to be in, so if they sense for even a second that a man is feeling these things (or is even just slightly beginning to feel these things), they run away immediately. Women want an emotional rock. They want the lifeguard on the edge of the pool pulling them out, not somebody drowning with them. \n\nWomen also take longer to get emotionally invested in men than men take to get emotionally invested in women. Men evolved to seek \u201cfertile\u201d women (big ass, big tits, healthy face) to impregnate as soon as possible. Women, on the other hand, evolved to find the strongest man in the tribe that could protect her and her baby, so they seek a larger group of traits, many of which are long-term traits (confidence, dominance, emotional stability, intelligence, etc\u2026). It takes a woman time to figure out if a guy has these traits but a man can immediately be attracted to a hot girl. In every man-woman relationship there is a period of time where the man is emotionally invested, but the woman is still \u201crational\u201d and feeling the guy out. Many men fuck it up here \u2013 they start acting creepy, or weird, overly nice, overly fixated, and the woman, who feels nothing, thinks the guy isweird or worse. \n\nOf course, emotions are a part of life and can be beautiful if channeled correctly. But you shouldn\u2019t show your emotions to a woman until she has also developed those emotions. \n\nThird, emotional investment makes you stupid and saps you of your vitality and awesomeness. Tons interesting, smart, funny, cool, successful guys become vacant shells of their normal selves around women, partly because their thoughts and emotions are empty of everything that makes them awesome. If you are deep in a game of chess and I try to have a conversation with you about quantum physics you will sound stupid because your thoughts and emotions are full of chess. Seduction requires intelligence and creativity, but if your thoughts and emotions are just \u201cdurr, she\u2019s a pretty woman\u201d you\u2019re going to fail. Because women are \u201crational\u201d longer than men, they want to have rational, intelligent conversations about interesting shit. \n\nAnother reason is power. It\u2019s a sad fact of life, but humans are wired to look at relationships in power terms. We subconsciously rank everybody in a particular social situation from least to most powerful. Women are much more aware of the power dynamic because they are generally less powerful than men. And unfortunately, we subconsciously see emotional people as lower in the power hierarchy. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, correctly in my opinion, that individuals higher in the social hierarchy do not feel emotions for people lower than them. The lower ranked apes evolved to obey and be obsessed with the alpha male because they need his protection and resources, but the alpha male feels nothing for the lower ranked apes because he does not need them for anything. \n\nMost importantly, women are not attracted to emotionally invested men because women are attracted to RESILIENCE. Resilience here means \u201cthe ability to confidently pursue your goals and not let anything or anybody perturb you.\u201d \n\nWomen are attracted to resilience because they naturally want a protector, and a protector\u2019s commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. We subconsciously see emotional people as weak because they can be easily controlled. If a guy is emotional about a girl, he is likely to agree with whatever she says, let her get away with bad behavior, etc\u2026 \n\nIf a protector wavers for even a second, the woman becomes anxious and fearful, but a confident man with boundaries is not scared and cannot be thrown off of his mission. You must be a brick wall that cannot be moved or affected: if you approach her or escalate with her, it is purely based on your own desire, not her cajoling. At every moment you should think to yourself \u201cam I doing this because I want to or because I am trying to impress her\u201d? Sometimes you need to monitor her emotional investment on a moment-by-moment basis. \n\n**Subconscious communication** \n\nWomen can quickly sense by your body language, words, demeanor, tone of voice and actions whether you are emotionally invested. Neither you nor her may consciously know you\u2019re invested, but you will just \u201cfeel\u201d unattractive to her. Sometimes very subtle changes in behavior (staring too long, asking a question that is too intrusive too early) can tip off that you are too invested. \n\nI use the \u201cgravity theory\u201d to gauge emotional investment. In social settings, high-value people are \u201cbigger\u201d and therefore \u201cdraw\u201d lower-value people to them. If you look at any party, you will see hot girls usually in the center, relaxing and having fun, and guys literally surrounding them like planets around the sun. There is a reason these guys are called \u201corbiters.\u201d If the girl gets up to leave, the guys may play it cool for a while, but they then get up to follow her. Your ultimate goal is to become the center of gravity so women are drawn to you, not vice versa, which is hard, because as a man you must approach. But even if you approach your demeanor and body language can exude the message of \u201cI am the center of gravity, and I create a rip in space-time that compels you to come to me.\u201d \n\nThe subconscious subtext of an interaction is 99%. For example, the sentence \u201ccan I buy you a drink\u201d can have a wide range of subconscious meanings depending on the tone, body language, context and emotion I deliver them in. \u201cCan I buy you a drink\u201d can mean \u201cI want to fuck you,\u201d \u201cI feel like I owe you something and I want to pay you back,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a generous guy and I like to just people free things,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re a good friend, and I want to show my appreciation,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a loser and I want to make you like me by buying you things,\u201d etc\u2026 What matters is not your superficial words, but your subconscious context. \n\nBecause seduction is mostly subconscious, I can\u2019t teach you every detail of the walk, speaking style, body language, demeanor, etc\u2026 of a guy who is not emotionally invested. Even if I did, it\u2019s too much for you to remember and process. I even doubted the efficacy of writing this article because it\u2019s incredibly hard to \u201cfake\u201d an emotional state for a long period of time and most people will go back to behaving like what they feel they are.  \n\n**The paradox of escalation**\n\nSo far it sounds like the right solution to get girls would be to just ignore them completely. You won\u2019t look emotionally invested, right? Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t work. It is the man\u2019s responsibility to approach and escalate because women do not get emotionally invested quickly and are afraid of rejection. \n\nTo get a girl attracted to you, you must show at least some initial interest and escalate, luring her into becoming emotionally invested in you. Magicians use a technique called \u201cforcing,\u201d where they trick the person into thinking they are picking a random card out of the deck when the person is really picking the card the magician wanted them to pick. Seduction is similar: she should feel like she is picking you, not vice-versa. You are just opening the door to her. \n\n**The challenge of seduction**\n\nSeducing a woman while you appear not emotionally invested is incredibly challenging. First, women\u2019s aversion to emotional investment is mostly subconscious \u2013 consciously, women want the guy to show at least some interest. And it\u2019s naturally hard to hang around a woman you like for a long period of time and not become invested to at least some degree. Beautiful women create a reality distortion field where men lose all concept of rationality, truth, normal standards of right and wrong, etc\u2026 You can say \u201cyou\u2019re overthinking this, just be yourself,\u201d, but women touch men\u2019s strongest emotion, so many men literally forget how be themselves. When a beautiful woman walks into a nightclub a swarm of otherwise successful, rational, manly men immediately lose their fucking minds. They start begging for her approval, trying to buy her things, acting stupid, etc\u2026 \n\nAnd like I said earlier, men emotionally invest quicker than women, so we must be patient because our emotions push us to jump the gun and get right into lovey-dovey mode. And in non-romantic contexts, people become emotionally invested at the same rate, so you are used to the other person feeling the same as you if the interaction is going well. And when we feel emotionally invested in somebody, we naturally are going to want to elicit a positive emotional response. But trying to make a woman happy that is not emotionally invested comes off as validation-seeking, supplicating, bitch behavior. You must instead do what is RIGHT. A woman may seem cold, and we may think we can \u201cwarm her up\u201d by being \u201cnice\u201d to her, but we should really just pursue our mission and have faith that she will emotionally invest even though she appears on the surface to not be attracted or care about you. Remember: women are constantly sizing you up, so even if they don\u2019t look like they are attracted or paying attention, they are. \n\nSeduction is a gamble because you must have faith that eventually the woman will start to emotionally invest, knowing she might not. Sometimes she just won\u2019t like you. Sometimes she just wants attention. Sometimes she is in love with you but won\u2019t let it on. Some women are damaged and never emotionally invest in anybody \u2013 they see all men as objects to be used. This is why you must assume attraction \u2013 because you DON\u2019T KNOW. \n\n**How to not be emotionally invested**\n\nIf you take away one thing from this article, it is this: a woman who is not yet invested in you must not occupy a big part of your thoughts and emotions. You must have your mind and heart on other things when interacting with women. Period. If she hasn\u2019t made room for you in her head and heart yet, you shouldn\u2019t make space for her in your head and heart. If you make this change right now, I promise your results will instantly improve. Women are the dessert to a good life, not the main course, and that\u2019s how women should feel when you are talking to them. WOMEN WANT TO BE DESSERT.\n\nHere are my main steps to not becoming emotionally invested:\n\n1)      Realize you don\u2019t need to emotionally invest\n\n2)      Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions.\n\n3)      Have \u201cabundance mentality\u201d with respect to women.\n\n4)      Have boundaries and be unperturbable.\n\n5)      Focus on your own fun first.\n\n**Realize you don\u2019t need to emotionally invest**\n \nThis may be the most important step. I think a lot of guys emotionally invest in girls because society and pop culture subconsciously make us think that for a man to get a girl, he must supplicate to her and emotionally invest in her. In the movies, the confident, successful guy living his own life never gets the girl; instead the winner is the loser who falls in love with her from afar, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to \u201cget\u201d her, enduring multiple rejections and humiliations. These movies also teach that women are delicate flowers that need constant coddling and lovey dovey bullshit. That\u2019s not how it works in the real world. \n \nMen also misunderstand women\u2019s aversion to rejection. Women have a strong need to be \u201caccepted\u201d and therefore are often much more sensitive to rejection than men. The phrase \u201chell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u201d is true. Dread game and \u201cignoring\u201d women only works if she is ignoring you first. But if you outright reject her, or if she makes a move on you, or asks for acceptance, and you say \u201cno\u201d or she feels like you are ignoring her there is a strong chance she will emotionally \u201cun-invest.\u201d Because women have this strong need for constant acceptance and validation, men mistakenly think they must emotionally invest. But all you really need to do is not reject her or make her feel excluded. It\u2019s a thin line between keeping a woman \u201caccepted\u201d and emotionally investing in her. \n\nTo win this game, you should only do something for a woman if the woman would do it for you. If you want to buy her a drink, think about whether she would buy you a drink. If she wouldn\u2019t, don\u2019t. If she wants you to wait for her, think about whether she would wait for you. If she wouldn\u2019t, don\u2019t. If there is a girl you always say hi to, but she never says hi to you, stop saying hi to her. She knows who you are, she can say hi to you. It\u2019s ok to \u201cwin\u201d in relationships. \n \nAgain, this is easier said than done. Society and your emotions team up to make you feel like you need to follow girls around, wait for them, put up with their bullshit, buy them drinks, etc\u2026 You must fight your feelingss and social training and have faith that if you stay the course women will become attracted. This requires the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to a woman (saying \u201cno\u201d is different than rejecting her) and the ability to walk away from her, even permanently. \n  \n**Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions**\n \nHumans are wired to seek good feelings. If the main part of our life is not making us happy (job, school, our hobbies), we get those good feelings from other sources: drugs, trashy TV, women, food, etc\u2026 All those things are not bad by themselves, but if your regular life doesn\u2019t make you happy, you will overly emotionally invest in bad things and become addicted and depressed. If your life is miserable, you will subconsciously and unknowingly immediately start overly investing in women.\n\nI use the \u201ccheese pizza method.\u201d Whenever I feel like I\u2019m getting too emotional, I fill my thoughts and emotions with something I love \u2013 cheese pizza, Oreo cheesecake, the day I did mushrooms at the beach, reading about dinosaurs stoned, etc... This clears my head and allows me to act \u201cnormal\u201d around women. When I am thinking about doing something for a girl I ask myself \u201cwhat has she done to dislodge cheese pizza out of my heart and mind?\u201d You can replace cheese pizza with anything, ideally an incredible, thrilling life that she would want to join. \n \n**Have abundance mentality with respect to girls**\n \nNo matter how awesome your life is, it is hard to not emotionally invest in girls. Abundance mentality is when your thoughts and emotions are full of other women, so you don\u2019t need this one girl. If you don\u2019t have other girls, you need to delude yourself. I recall times when I did have abundance and put myself back in that mental space. If you\u2019ve never had abundance, imagine you are Brad Pitt or some other celebrity and think about how he would feel and act.\n\n**Have boundaries and be unperturbable**\n\nWomen want you to be an immovable wall that confidently and joyfully pursues his mission. She will try to perturb you from that mission, not because she wants to see you fail, but because she wants to test whether you are actually a brick wall or a fa\u00e7ade for something softer. The same way you knock on a desk at the furniture store to see if it is real wood, a woman shit tests you to see if you are actually confident enough to pursue your mission or if you will be perturbed. And the more confident and immovable you are, the stronger the shit tests become. This is true even if the mission is getting her! As long as she is into it, you need to escalate as if you already know she will say yes.\n\nYour mission, when out, should be maximum fun. She should sense that your emotional investment is \u201cwhere\u2019s the party? Where\u2019s the next fun thing?\u201d You should have a plan for the entire night: I\u2019m going to X, then I\u2019m going to Y , etc\u2026 You should not let the woman hijack your plans and take the lead. Your primary mission (career, hobbies, etc\u2026) should also be in your head. Remember the song \u201cgirls just wanna have fun?\u201d In truth, everybody just wants to have fun but boys are wracked with anxiety because they are trying to impress girls. Whenever you are feeling nervous, scared, anxious or like you are emotionally investing too much in a girl, just say to yourself \u201cI\u2019m here to have fun. If you contribute, great. If not, you are dismissed.\u201d Fun and positivity always win. \n\nExample: If a beautiful woman is talking about something incredibly boring most men pretend to be interested. Wrong! Women know when they are being boring and it is sometimes a subtle shit test to see if you will let her get away with it. Women are not desperate for sex and they do not need to hang around if a guy is being boring, stupid or mean, and they cannot respect or empathize with a guy who would put up with bullshit from her. Men let women be boring when they lose their vision of the good life. A good life involves beautiful women, but it also involves interesting conversations. If you aren\u2019t getting interesting conversations from her, you would leave because you have options. Whenever a woman is being boring, I change the subject just to let her know I don\u2019t tolerate bullshit.  \n\nBy having a vision of the good life, boundaries, and confidence that your life, thoughts and emotions are interesting and valuable, you can challenge and stimulate a woman. Women want a man that will help them grow and introduce them to a better life and more interesting world than the one they currently inhabit. They don\u2019t want some a that agrees with everything they say, a pushover, or a simple-minded conformist.  Women want a guy who is willing to walk away at any time, not because he is some cold-hearted psychopath, but because once a man shows that is he NOT willing to walk away at any time, there is no challenge or growth. \n\nOf course, for most of you, this is very difficult. Many of you have uninteresting lives so a beautiful woman would instantly become the most interesting and important thing your life or you are so sex starved and desperate that you don\u2019t care if a woman is being boring, or mean, or uninterested, or whatever. \n\n**Focus on your own fun first**\n\nImagine you paid $500,000 to spend a week with Leonardo DiCaprio (or whatever celebrity you think lives an awesome life) and when you get there Leonardo says \u201ctell us what we should do?\u201d You would say \u201cI don\u2019t know, what are the options?\u201d and Leo goes \u201cI don\u2019t have anything planned \u2013 let\u2019s just do what you were gonna do.\u201d You would be pissed! You want to become part of Leo\u2019s awesome life, not make your own plan. That\u2019s how girls feel when men don\u2019t have a plan. They want to join your life, not lead you around in their life. That\u2019s why you need to focus on your own fun first. You may like you are being rude or selfish, but you\u2019re not, because women are more attracted to the act of leading than the destination necessarily. \n\n**How to make her emotionally invest in you**\n\nFor a woman to emotionally invest in you, certain shit must happen: \n\n1)\tShe must \u201clike\u201d you \u2013 i.e., she must find you pleasant, friendly, good-looking, compatible with her values and interests. \n\n2)\tShe must feel an emotional connection with you.\n\n3)\tShe must feel accepted by you. If she you are rejecting her, ignoring her, or being hostile, she will not emotionally invest. \n\n4)\tShe must watch you be confident and resilient. \n\n5)\tShe needs to spend time around you. \n\n**She must like you**\n\nThis one is self-explanatory. Women are usually not going to invest in you if you don\u2019t share their interests, values, goals, etc\u2026 Some girls want a rapper covered in tattoos, others want a nerdy guy who watches Star Wars. If you\u2019re a versatile guy with lots of interests, a lot more women will like you, but some people just aren\u2019t compatible. \n\n**She must feel an emotional connection with you**\n\nThe key to developing an emotional connection with a girl is experiencing emotionally exciting things together. The ultimate is of course, passionate sex, but a good concert, a deep conversation, even a beer pong game you guys play together can help build an emotional connection. \n\nAnother way to build an emotional connection is for her to vicariously experience your confidence. She wants you to be her emotional rock, so she would like to project her insecurities and fears onto you, and watch you brush them off as if they were nothing. She also wants to watch you take the lead and make the night fun. \n\nA woman has emotional energy, and that energy must be directed towards something or somebody. You want that energy to be directed to you. The easiest way to do this is just by spending time around her. Just \u201cbeing around\u201d will help build attraction as long as you are not fucking it up by being needy or making her feel bad. The best way to get women to like you is to be \u201cforced\u201d to be around them, such as work or a group hangout, where you do not supplicate to them or validate yourself to them. My friend used to take girls out on his boat, and these girls would usually end up liking me by the end of the day because we would have spent all day together. Celebrities get so much tang because women watch them in movies or listen to their music and become emotionally invested, whereas the celebrity shows the women no emotional investment in all. \n\n**She must feel accepted by you.**\n\nAgain, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, so it must feel like the door to you is open. As she invests in you more, you must escalate more. You can fuck this up by being an asshole, not being sensitive to her emotions, and not reading her advances correctly. \n\n**She must watch you confidently pursue your goals**\n\nThe word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith). A man with confidence has faith that he will succeed in whatever he does and cannot be stopped by anybody. Women get turned by watching a man confidently pursue his mission. Why are women w so attracted to DJs, promoters, and drug dealers in the club? Those guys aren\u2019t exactly the \u201ccream\u201d of society. It\u2019s because those guys are the only people at the club actually doing something. All the other guys are just sitting there drooling over the girls, instantly reducing their attractiveness. \n\n**Putting it all together**\n\nTo apply all this knowledge, my strategy is to adopt a rational, almost businesslike demeanor, at least in the early stages of the interaction. As I said earlier, women are \u201crational\u201d at the beginning before they are emotionally invested, so you should also be rational. A man must act almost like he is a woman: he is interested in a relationship (or maybe even just sex) but he has high standards and must evaluate the woman thoroughly first and make sure she is suitable before he gets emotionally invested. You should act like your actions are guided by a seduction computer that makes all the decisions based on the available information, not your emotions. \n\nOne technique is called \u201cdisinterested interest.\u201d Your rational words should show interest and enthusiasm but you must communicate the \u201cemotion\u201d of \u201cI\u2019m just talking to you to be nice, I am not totally emotionally invested in you yet and I could walk away at any moment.\u201d The best way to do this is by keeping your thoughts and emotions focused on something else, other than her. \n\nYou should not, however, stay completely rational. You must allow yourself to show your emotions about things that are not her: your passions, your interests, your friends, etc\u2026 And you can show emotion towards her if she deserves it: laugh if she says something funny, thank her if she does something nice, sympathize with her if she says something sad: just don\u2019t let on that you feel emotional about \u201cher\u201d unconnected to anything she is or has done. \n\nAnd of course, escalate sexually. Paradoxically, it is possible to escalate sexually and not appear emotionally invested. In fact, a lot of women (especially damaged ones) are looking for emotionless sex. You must touch her, you must turn the conversation sexual, you must do \u201cseductive\u201d things like look into her eyes and whisper in her ear, etc\u2026 And you must confidently take the lead in the conversation and the situation in general, leading her from place to place, getting intimate with her, etc\u2026 And when she starts to emotionally invest, make her feel like you MIGHT emotionally invest too (but not as much as her). Sometimes if you play it \u201ctoo\u201d cool she will think you just like her platonically or that you lost interest. \n\n**A broader view**\n\nThis article is obviously about getting girls, but the principles are applicable in all areas of your life. Simply put, you should not invest your thoughts and emotions into people, places, institutions, and activities that do not give a fuck about you and/or do not produce a return that equals the investment you put into them. One of the biggest mistakes people make is investing too much in their job, friendship, hobbies, etc..., and getting 0 out of it. \n\nAdditionally, whatever you do becomes your emotional investment. If you spend every weekend hanging out with piece of shit people that just do drugs, complain and make bad decisions, guess what, you are now becoming a piece of shit person. You are what you do. \n\nFollow me on twitter: http://www.twitter.com/woujo3\n\nGo to my website: http://www.woujo.com", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "64zv67", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 602, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Woujo", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64zv67", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.seduction", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/seduction/comments/64zv67/the_most_important_thing_about_seduction_is_not/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049156.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/64zv67/the_most_important_thing_about_seduction_is_not/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "The most important thing about seduction is not being more emotionally invested in her than she is in you.", "created_utc": 1492020356.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 76, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 602}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zv67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zv67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zv67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7diy6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EatTheRichNZ", "parent_id": "t1_dg6weij", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Keep being awesome &lt;3", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep being awesome &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg7diy6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492107351.0, "created_utc": 1492078551.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6weij", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SigmaCronos", "parent_id": "t1_dg6plkx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's also the girthiest.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also the girthiest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg6weij", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074774.0, "created_utc": 1492045974.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zv67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6xsu9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xarthass", "parent_id": "t1_dg6plkx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had to scroll for an hour to get here!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to scroll for an hour to get here!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg6xsu9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492076507.0, "created_utc": 1492047707.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zv67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6yjc6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "19RomeoQuebec", "parent_id": "t1_dg6plkx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are plenty of articles of this length and caliber, on the sub TRP.

I think it's a natural, inevitable and good thing. I'm just saying that men should not be more invested in the girl, at least in the early stages in the relationship. After you've been dating somebody for a while, the emotions go deep and tangle in complex ways, so it's hard to tell who is \"more\" invested, but the main thing I am trying to prevent is the guy who is immediately \"all in\" while the girl isn't. So I think we generally agree here. \n&gt;\n\nI definitely agree here but I think your context of emotionally invested i view as over invested and just having shitty boundaries and self view.\n\n&gt;2) I disagree with you on the role of emotions. I think our society places too much emphasis on emotions, and I think it harms a lot of people, especially in relationships. Emotions are natural, of course, but they should be carefully guarded and controlled by rationality. There is nothing more \"emotional\" than doing a bunch of cocaine, but if you're going to do cocaine, you need to plan your adventure out so that you don't hurt yourself, etc... Emotions are like swimming. Swimming is fun and good ... but if you can't find your way back to shore, you are fucked.  \n\nI disagree here being that in psychology there are a few views on relationship attachment styles. One is over attachment with insecurity which I feel you view as being emotional, one is secure and one is avoidance type relationships. The only healthy one is secure but no one falls directly on that line.\n\nI think it's perfectly normal to be emotionally invested in dating someone after say 3rd or 4th date and be disappointed if it doesn't work out. I think the problem is when you are unable to process it properly and lay blame to it not working or their choices as your fault. That's just being selfish and not actually viewing someone as a individual and just as an  extension of your need. And I think we both agree that this is where being too invested is an issue. This is the point where people come across needy and low value. \n\nTo sum it up I think you can be invested in someone but still carry enough self worth and value that you easily can see others decisions and actions have no actual\u200b bearing on your personal value. Not everyone is going to be a good match and other people have other things going on in their lives that affect their decisions and often this has nothing to do with how well you game.\n\nI hope this actually doesn't sound too convoluted.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have 2 responses to the stuff you&amp;#39;re saying: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I&amp;#39;m not against emotional investment.

So I think we generally agree here. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely agree here but I think your context of emotionally invested i view as over invested and just having shitty boundaries and self view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2) I disagree with you on the role of emotions. I think our society places too much emphasis on emotions, and I think it harms a lot of people, especially in relationships. Emotions are natural, of course, but they should be carefully guarded and controlled by rationality. There is nothing more &amp;quot;emotional&amp;quot; than doing a bunch of cocaine, but if you&amp;#39;re going to do cocaine, you need to plan your adventure out so that you don&amp;#39;t hurt yourself, etc... Emotions are like swimming. Swimming is fun and good ... but if you can&amp;#39;t find your way back to shore, you are fucked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree here being that in psychology there are a few views on relationship attachment styles. One is over attachment with insecurity which I feel you view as being emotional, one is secure and one is avoidance type relationships. The only healthy one is secure but no one falls directly on that line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s perfectly normal to be emotionally invested in dating someone after say 3rd or 4th date and be disappointed if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out. I think the problem is when you are unable to process it properly and lay blame to it not working or their choices as your fault. That&amp;#39;s just being selfish and not actually viewing someone as a individual and just as an  extension of your need. And I think we both agree that this is where being too invested is an issue. This is the point where people come across needy and low value. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum it up I think you can be invested in someone but still carry enough self worth and value that you easily can see others decisions and actions have no actual\u200b bearing on your personal value. Not everyone is going to be a good match and other people have other things going on in their lives that affect their decisions and often this has nothing to do with how well you game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this actually doesn&amp;#39;t sound too convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "seduction", "name": "t1_dg7taov", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130246.0, "created_utc": 1492101446.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg79k8u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Woujo", "parent_id": "t1_dg74xoz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/seduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have 2 responses to the stuff you're saying: \n\n1) I'm not against emotional investment.
