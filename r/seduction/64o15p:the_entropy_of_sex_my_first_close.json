However, no tangible results could be seen for months. This past Friday, I managed to surprise even myself. It was a regular night and I decided to stay in and watch a movie with my friends rather than go out and party. There was 20 minutes left in the movie and I got a call from a friend. This guy (Chris) only calls me when he wants to party and game. At this point, it was 12:30 am and I thought parties would be dying down. He managed to convince me and told me an Uber would come pick me up outside my dorm. Free ride...I wasn&amp;#39;t going to complain. We head to a random house party and head to the basement. The place is dead. The music was OK but it was not a place to game. We headed out to an off-campus frat and this is where it happened. I was already getting frustrated because no plausible sets were in sight. I headed down to the basement and see a guy from my floor (John). He was chilling in the corner not doing much. I asked him, &amp;quot;Yo, how has the party been so far.&amp;quot; John responded, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not that lit. There were more people earlier.&amp;quot; Again, the disappointment was about to impact my state. At this exact moment, I saw two girls hanging out near the DJ. I looked at John and said, &amp;quot;This is us.&amp;quot; I walked up to one of the girls, tapped her and said, &amp;quot;Hey, have you met my friend John? He&amp;#39;s really chill and he thinks you&amp;#39;re cute.&amp;quot; I looked at her friend (Gabby) and told her we should give them space to talk. She agreed and we moved across the room. We talked about her night and what she was majoring in...the usual questions freshmen ask each other. I asked her if she wanted to dance and she said OK. I looked to my right and John along with the girl were just staring at me and Gabby. It was awkward but I made sure to turn Gabby around and make out with her. I whispered, &amp;quot;You know, we both want the same thing. We can go to my place and grab some bomb-ass breakfast later.&amp;quot; The entire time, I made sure to use kino. She agreed to come home with me after talking to her friend. I called up Chris and asked him to hook me up with a ride. Chris was such a good wing. He called me an Uber right away and I went home to kick my roommate and his GF out of my dorm room for a solid hour ;) If I had stayed in my room and watched a movie instead of going out, I would still be a virgin. I would not have gained this valuable experience. No progress would&amp;#39;ve been made. I truly did not think that night of all nights would be the one where I would get laid. It was random.
