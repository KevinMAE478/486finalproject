We\u2019re mapping the walls, doors and other surfaces in our city to create a digital canvas on top of our physical reality and ultimately fill it with immersive, interactive and 3 dimensional digital art or other forms of expression, living side-by-side with existing street art.\nA GPS/maps function is part of the app, where you can see the spots and your location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The app is now in beta-phase and the number of spots is growing crazy fast: Starting in Barcelona there are now new spots being added in London, New York, The Hague, Amsterdam, Paris and Berlin. The community is growing by the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I\u2019m looking for artists who want to collaborate. Are you a graffiti artist working also digital (3D, illustrator, photoshop, video, animation) and you want to put those works out there, or if you\u2019re a \u2018purist\u2019 but like to see your pieces animated, interactive or in 3D we\u2019d like to collaborate with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your work can exist on several spots around the world at the same time and more then one piece can be applied to the same walls, doors and surfaces. when we keep\u00a0 growing as we do now new features will be added; an automated system of submitting spots and pieces, leaving \u2018virtual tags\u2019 and even adding a \u2018gaming element\u2019 to it are some future plans\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides the works I\u2019m also asking people to join the beta-test community and send pictures of walls , doors and surfaces in their city (together with adres or GPS coordinates) to expand our world wide canvas. These photos will be converted to so called \u2018markers\u2019.
