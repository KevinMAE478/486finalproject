The bottom lock is difficult/impossible to open by drilling. It&amp;#39;s a lever lock, not a pin tumbler lock, so drilling it does not remove the parts that hold the lock closed. The upper lock has a larger opening, so you can drill it and then use small pliers to rip out the rest of the internals and then force the lock open. The lower lock cylinder opening is smaller, so you can&amp;#39;t get the pliers in to rip it apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WhatsInThisThing", "name": "t1_dg6x91f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075829.0, "created_utc": 1492047029.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wn3k", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650l7j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wn3k", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650l7j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wn3k", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650l7j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6u2an", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kathartik", "parent_id": "t1_dg6t3va", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WhatsInThisThing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This\n\n^^^I ^^^do ^^^what ^^^I ^^^want", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;do&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;what&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;want&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WhatsInThisThing", "name": "t1_dg6u2an", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492071976.0, "created_utc": 1492043176.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6t3va", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rastacola", "parent_id": "t1_dg6njfy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WhatsInThisThing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dawg just upvote.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawg just upvote.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WhatsInThisThing", "name": "t1_dg6t3va", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492070796.0, "created_utc": 1492041996.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6njfy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "InFlammen", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ky0n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WhatsInThisThing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WhatsInThisThing", "name": "t1_dg6njfy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492063890.0, "created_utc": 1492035090.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -24}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ky0n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 50, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Drathus", "parent_id": "t3_650l7j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WhatsInThisThing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pay phone parts look to be pretty common on ebay.\n\nIdentify what locks you'd need to replace, then drill out the ones on your phone.
