Let me try to help you out a bit.\n\n\nYou don't need to know the menu. You don't need to know what the ridiculous size names are called. We know what smalls, mediums, and larges are lol. If you dont know what you want by the time you get to the register, **just know if you want a hot drink or a cold drink, and what size.** For example, \"I know i want something cold in a medium, but idk what any of these things are on the menu.\"\n\n\nPersonally, i appreciate a customer that knows that and not their drink over someone that just walks up to the register and spouts off their 2 paragraph drink and leaves that part out. We write your drink on the cups so if you tell us what we're writing on first, we immediately like you and want to help you through this. \n\nThat being said, some baristas will be more helpful than others, some may be new and just as unsure of the process as you are. If you have a starbucks near you, go somewhat frequently and they'll remember you pretty quickly. \n\n\nAs a final gambit, you could always download the app and mobile order to the store. Your order will print out on a sticker and they'll prepare it with no interaction with you. Give em 5 minutes (maybe a lil longer if it's busy), walk to the drink pickup, tell em your name, and theyll give it to you no questions asked. The downside to this, though, is without knowledge of the menu, you may end up overpaying for something you dont like or didnt even really want. \n\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps you out at least a little bit. Dunkin Donuts you're on your own, though.

Let me try to help you out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to know the menu. You don&amp;#39;t need to know what the ridiculous size names are called. We know what smalls, mediums, and larges are lol. If you dont know what you want by the time you get to the register, &lt;strong&gt;just know if you want a hot drink or a cold drink, and what size.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, &amp;quot;I know i want something cold in a medium, but idk what any of these things are on the menu.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, i appreciate a customer that knows that and not their drink over someone that just walks up to the register and spouts off their 2 paragraph drink and leaves that part out. We write your drink on the cups so if you tell us what we&amp;#39;re writing on first, we immediately like you and want to help you through this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, some baristas will be more helpful than others, some may be new and just as unsure of the process as you are. If you have a starbucks near you, go somewhat frequently and they&amp;#39;ll remember you pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a final gambit, you could always download the app and mobile order to the store. Your order will print out on a sticker and they&amp;#39;ll prepare it with no interaction with you. Give em 5 minutes (maybe a lil longer if it&amp;#39;s busy), walk to the drink pickup, tell em your name, and theyll give it to you no questions asked. The downside to this, though, is without knowledge of the menu, you may end up overpaying for something you dont like or didnt even really want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope this helps you out at least a little bit.
