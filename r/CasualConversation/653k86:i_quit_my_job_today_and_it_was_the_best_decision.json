I&amp;#39;m in college, it was a part time job, and I didn&amp;#39;t feel like a part time job should be able to make me so stressed I can&amp;#39;t sleep or eat like I need to. It just wasn&amp;#39;t worth it. I&amp;#39;d rather get paid minimum wage and be happy than get paid more and be completely miserable. That said, I know I&amp;#39;m lucky to be in a situation where I can follow through with that without having to worry about food, having a place to live, etc. I&amp;#39;ve been applying elsewhere for a few weeks now, and know things will work out. :) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "name": "t1_dg7optc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125359.0, "created_utc": 1492096559.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gy4m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_Right_Muff", "parent_id": "t1_dg77by5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CasualConversation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "While that's true for most people most of the time, there is a counterpoint.
