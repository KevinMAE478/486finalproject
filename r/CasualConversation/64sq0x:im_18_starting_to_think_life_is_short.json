I can't give you a complete life strategy, but I can give you some tips I had to learn the hard way.\n\n1. You're not gonna do everything you want. This isn't meant to shut you down, but there's only so many hours in a day and most things worth doing are slow-simmer kinds of things. So as you go along in life, don't forget to take time to sit down and think about what you really want on occasion. You don't need to plan your life all at once mind, but just make sure you always know why you're doing what you're doing\n\n2. One thing at a time. Multitasking is a lie perpetuated by lying liars who lie all the time. In my experience, the most effective plan when you want to get something done, it's best to really buckle down and do that thing well. You don't need to do it forever, and you will always need to keep a few things on the back burner, but the more things you try to do at once, the worse each individual thing will be. This applies to discrete tasks, long term projects and life goals.\n\n3. Recognize when you're done: the flip side to this is that you need to know when to stop, whether it's for a break, or if you need to put something down for good. A lot of people get caught up in doing something for a long time because they internalize the task as a part of their being. There's no such thing as lawyers or scientists or rock stars. There are just people some of whom practice law, some who do science, some who perform rock music. And they all can do something else if they want to. Or if they thought they were allowed to.\n\n4. The default skill level is sucking at something. Everyone who has ever lived has, at one point, been really shitty at what they do. So just suck it up and be shit at something, and make sure you know why you're shit at it. You'll stop being shit at it faster than you think.\n\n5. Live within your means: Cheap credit is basically heroin, in that it's fucking awesome while you have it, and it'll destroy you before you even realize anything's wrong. Save until you get an emergency fund, $1500-$5000, then try to put away 10% a month in a retirement account. If you can't do that, your first job must be to find a way in which you can at least get the emergency fund up and running. Don't ever get debt for things that don't appreciate (credit cards,  cars), and always be veeery suspicious of \"can't lose\" sales pitches for homes and stock. Failure is always an option.
