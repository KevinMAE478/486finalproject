Remember to give yourself an extra few days to get used to your own culture again.\n\nA little advice:\n\n* Buy good walking shoes. You will walk a lot! There are rarely any places to sit in the country, and you can't even count on sitting in the subway, because of how crowded it is in Tokyo. I actually hurt my back after the second day, and apparently that's pretty common.\n\n* Someone mentioned a data sim, but I got a pocket wifi instead. Much cheaper, and you can connect multiple devices to it. The only downside is that you have another device to recharge after 10-12 hours.\n\n* Get a change purse. Cash is still king, I barely used my credit card there other than maybe 7-Eleven and some of the higher end/select stores.\n\n* Download offline maps, and get Google Translate. It's not perfect, but it's useful if you don't know the language. If you don't have time to take a basics class, you can still get by on English in Tokyo. Just make sure you learn some key phrases, and at least know how to count to 10.\n\n/r/JapanTravel is a great resource!

I was actually having post-vacation sadness from leaving so soon (Still not sure it&amp;#39;s over). Remember to give yourself an extra few days to get used to your own culture again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little advice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy good walking shoes. You will walk a lot! There are rarely any places to sit in the country, and you can&amp;#39;t even count on sitting in the subway, because of how crowded it is in Tokyo. I actually hurt my back after the second day, and apparently that&amp;#39;s pretty common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned a data sim, but I got a pocket wifi instead. Much cheaper, and you can connect multiple devices to it. The only downside is that you have another device to recharge after 10-12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a change purse. Cash is still king, I barely used my credit card there other than maybe 7-Eleven and some of the higher end/select stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download offline maps, and get Google Translate. It&amp;#39;s not perfect, but it&amp;#39;s useful if you don&amp;#39;t know the language. If you don&amp;#39;t have time to take a basics class, you can still get by on English in Tokyo. Just make sure you learn some key phrases, and at least know how to count to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/JapanTravel\"&gt;/r/JapanTravel&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource!
