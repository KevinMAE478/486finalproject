Sometimes I worry if I have enough ambition and drive. Right now, I feel lost in life because there are things that I want to improve about myself. Sometimes, I worry if I am doing my best and I really contemplate it. I&amp;#39;m sorry if my thoughts are all over the place. Goals that I want to accomplish are to: improve myself, gain confidence, work on my driving skills, start writing more as a hobby since I feel I don&amp;#39;t do it enough, and some others that I can&amp;#39;t think of at this moment. In general, I want to take life one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "name": "t1_dgdf4uh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492461073.0, "created_utc": 1492432273.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ep", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ep", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ep", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdwe6c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "djshine88", "parent_id": "t1_dgdni7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CasualConversation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Definitely - being happy is the secret to a very fulfilling life.
