To be honest, I didn't really know what I was going to college for. I loved acting but I didn't believe it could pay the bills, but I took the classes whenever they'd fill a GE requirement. I had a lot of fun in class playing up any comedy role you could throw at me. I met a lot of amazing people and even did some side projects with some of them. Then, one day, it just stopped. I didn't feel anything on stage, I couldn't empathize with the characters. I didn't want to act anymore. I couldn't bring myself to sign up for something I had no passion for and in a fit of panic I signed up for nursing classes. \n\nIt didn't last long at all. I didn't have any friends to keep me interested in the class and my queasiness around blood made me hate the path I had chosen. I started to feel lonely and my depression made me unable to leave my room some days. I couldn't stand it anymore and I dropped out. I was so terrified of everything: my future, the bills, but what I really feared was how my dad would take it. I didn't talk to him for some time so he called me and I broke down and told him. He took it better than I thought he would, but he said I should try going back to school at some point when I was still young. \n\nI got my first job to be able to keep myself a float. Since I dropped out my dad wasn't paying for anything anymore. If I saved up both of my paychecks I could pay for rent and I'd have $200 for the rest of the month. Some nights I'd have to starve to make sure I had a roof above my head. My friends would invite me out but I never had any money for that stuff. Sometimes I'd go anyway with the hopes of wolfing down someone's food they didn't finish.\n\nI hated working but I hated being poor a helluva lot more. One day I was complaining to one of my co-workers who had been with the company for a while about how long my 7 hour shift was. She responded \"Try doing it for 30 years\". That scared the ever-loving shit out of me and I quit that job and went back to school for computer science. \n\nI put a lot of effort into learning CS and the math that came along with it. I started seeing a psych for my depression so I could keep going to class. I finished my first year of CS, with C's and B's, but I finished. I learned a lot too and was excited to be able to transfer after the next year. Then I get the phone call from my dad.\n\nHe says he can't afford to support me away from home anymore and that I should move in with him again. I could continue going to school near home and transfer elsewhere. I couldn't believe it, everything was going so well for once. What choice did I have? I knew I couldn't maintain a part time job and finish school on time. I accepted.\n\nI picked up a job over the summer when I moved down at a mom and pop shop. I wasn't very good at my job and they never hesitate to let me know that. I'd be sweeping the street in front of the store hoping that a car on the road would lose control and hit me. Or maybe I'd pass out from exhaustion in the summer heat. I wanted to die. One day I was eating my lunch and I felt a huge lump in my throat. I had trouble breathing and I felt my ears getting hot. I started crying, full on sobbing at my job. My boss let me go home for the day but it didn't fix anything. I'd excuse myself to go to the bathroom and cry until my lungs hurt. My boss got sick of it and asked if it was going to interfere with my work and I told her I needed to quit.\n\nMy dad was furious with me and didn't talk to me for three days. I told him I'd look for a new job when I went back to school. I'd put in a few applications a day but at a certain point there's nothing you can do but wait. School started and I still hadn't found anything but at least I had something to take my mind away from how much I fucking hated myself.\n\nIt didn't last long. I hated school, I hated the city I lived in, I hated that I was even more alone than I was in my old town. I started skipping class and my dad noticed so he began to wake me up when class was starting. I'd get in my car and sleep around the block or spend the day at a LAN cafe playing games. I knew it wasn't sustainable but every day I kept telling myself \"I just need to make it to the end of the day\". I had no long term plans for my life. Things were getting worse.\n\nI was in class and I got handed back a test. Of course I failed, it's not like I ever studied. What am I even here for? What's the fucking point of pretending to go to school? I thought about it for a minute and picked up my bags mid lecture and left. I got in my car and started to drive home and that's when it got to me. I was a failure in every sense of the word. I quit everything I started and I was never going to amount to anything in life. No one loved me or cared about me and I spent so much time alone trying to convince myself to live. I knew I was going to die, it was like there was a gun to my head. I wouldn't see the end of the month because I was going to kill myself.

The wage was way higher than anything I had ever received and it was for a huge company too! I accepted on the spot and a month later I had moved out of my dad's.

When I was very young, I did not know that it wasn't normal for your parents to be arguing and breaking stuff around the house. My father was abusive towards my brother. My brother would run away. My mom would cry alone in her bedroom. Our parents expected perfection out of us, and when we didn't perform, we were reprimanded harshly. The one time I finally told someone, they didn't believe me. I was 10.\n\nFast forward a few years, and I'm a freshman in high school. My brother is in his senior year, and he has turned into a bitter and angry person. My parents were on both of our asses all the time about school, even though my brother was ranked 3rd in his grade and I was in the top 15% of my grade. My brother turned to alcohol and weed to cope. He would stay out with friends for days and not come home. One day, we got a call from his friend's mom and she told us that she had called the police because my brother was not himself. He was sent to a hospital and my parents rushed over very late at night, leaving me in the house. He was then transferred to a mental hospital. I remember crying because I had read in the rules that we coudn't bring any shoes with laces. I was 14.\n\nAfter that, my parents somewhat pulled their shit together. They stopped arguing with each other, with me and my brother. Until after my brother left for college. They then fully projected on me, and the arguing became worse. Threats were always made to call the police because the amount of things that were broken during each fight. \nI became very sad. There were many days I cried myself to sleep dreading the next day. It came to a point where I broke down in a restaurant because I knew it didn't matter if I lived or died because I was never going to be happy. I was 15.\n\nMy highest moment was when I found my first real friend. In freshman year, I had called him after a particularly nasty fight with my mother. I hadn't really known him that well previously, and we only had a few classes together that I could call him an acquaintance. The only thing I didn't anticipate was that he didn't hang up on me. He did not try to offer solutions. He listened and he empathized, and I am very lucky to find a friend like him. He has been one of my rocks in some very bad storms.

When I was very young, I did not know that it wasn&amp;#39;t normal for your parents to be arguing and breaking stuff around the house. My father was abusive towards my brother. My brother would run away. My mom would cry alone in her bedroom. Our parents expected perfection out of us, and when we didn&amp;#39;t perform, we were reprimanded harshly. The one time I finally told someone, they didn&amp;#39;t believe me. I was 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, and I&amp;#39;m a freshman in high school. My brother is in his senior year, and he has turned into a bitter and angry person. My parents were on both of our asses all the time about school, even though my brother was ranked 3rd in his grade and I was in the top 15% of my grade. My brother turned to alcohol and weed to cope. He would stay out with friends for days and not come home. One day, we got a call from his friend&amp;#39;s mom and she told us that she had called the police because my brother was not himself. He was sent to a hospital and my parents rushed over very late at night, leaving me in the house. He was then transferred to a mental hospital. I remember crying because I had read in the rules that we coudn&amp;#39;t bring any shoes with laces. I was 14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, my parents somewhat pulled their shit together. They stopped arguing with each other, with me and my brother. Until after my brother left for college. They then fully projected on me, and the arguing became worse. Threats were always made to call the police because the amount of things that were broken during each fight. \nI became very sad. There were many days I cried myself to sleep dreading the next day. It came to a point where I broke down in a restaurant because I knew it didn&amp;#39;t matter if I lived or died because I was never going to be happy. I was 15.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My highest moment was when I found my first real friend. In freshman year, I had called him after a particularly nasty fight with my mother. I hadn&amp;#39;t really known him that well previously, and we only had a few classes together that I could call him an acquaintance. The only thing I didn&amp;#39;t anticipate was that he didn&amp;#39;t hang up on me. He did not try to offer solutions. He listened and he empathized, and I am very lucky to find a friend like him. He has been one of my rocks in some very bad storms. His parents are also the sweetest and most outstanding people I have ever met. They have even offered their home as a refuge should the need arise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was very isolated as a child.
