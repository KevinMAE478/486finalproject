I&amp;#39;ve known this girl for a while now as I see her in speech and debate tournaments frequently. I was never really even acquaintances with her; I just never really talked to her. She was &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; cute but she wasn&amp;#39;t exactly &amp;quot;my type&amp;quot; either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this year and somehow, I started talking to her over Twitter DMs. She lives about 300+ miles away from me so hanging out really isn&amp;#39;t an option. Straight off the bat, I could tell she was interested in me (although I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was as a friend or more than that) as I noticed the way she asked me questions was similar to the way I ask questions when I&amp;#39;m interested in someone. Over the course of several weeks, we kept talking and the feeling that she might like me more than a friend kept growing. In retrospect, it was super obvious she was trying to be flirty but I wasn&amp;#39;t so sure at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I realized we would actually get to meet up in person for a 3 day debate competition in March, I didn&amp;#39;t think too much of it in the weeks leading up to it. The first day, we didn&amp;#39;t even see each other bc we were just so busy. But the 2nd and 3rd day, oh dear were those the most memorable days of my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Quick side note: I&amp;#39;m a 17 year old high school senior who is hella awkward and has never really dated anyone. I&amp;#39;ve been in a few pseudo-relationships but those don&amp;#39;t really count lol)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On those days, we had almost the whole day to ourselves so a lot of it was spent alone in a remote hallway, just talking about stuff. I noticed that she was super flirty with me especially when she kept hugging me and laying her head on my shoulder. I also noticed that while the first little while of talking to her was slightly awkward, it soon disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(In one of my past pseudo-relationships even thought we had a big crush on one another, things were always awkward so I assumed awkwardness was just abnormal part of any relationship)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel so comfortable being with her... We talked about everything from colleges to memes lol. Nothing was off limits. And by the end of that first day, I realized, I really liked her, more than a friend. So I finally mustered up the courage to tell her. And she said she did as well. I remember when she kissed my cheek: i finally understood what euphoria felt like... I finally understood so much...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last day we were together, we just kept growing a deep emotional bond I didn&amp;#39;t even realize we were making. Somehow, the conversation turned to insecurities, and we shared secrets about ourselves we never imagined we would ever tell. And I liked her for who she was, not despite her flaws, but because of them. She saw the deepest part of my soul, yet didn&amp;#39;t recoil. She saw my broken, lonely soul, yet she admired me because of them, not in spite of. It was perfect...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... just a little too perfect. This was our last day together, and we had to face it. It turns out her parents are very strict with who she is allowed to date and I DEFINITELY am not one of them. None of that matters in that moment in time: wrapped in each other&amp;#39;s arms where not a care in the world that can reach us. When we finally said goodbye for the last time, agreeing to not talk to each other bc of her parents, it didn&amp;#39;t hit me that night. But the next morning when she laid bare all the last things she wanted to say, I started crying. And crying. And crying. How foolish was I to not understand the gravity of what we had. Was what we had love? I didn&amp;#39;t know... I asked her and she thought that it was &amp;quot;love-quality&amp;quot; since love took time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we couldn&amp;#39;t stop talking to one another. For several weeks afterwards we did. But it all ended when we almost got caught by her parents. That night was the night that she said we needed to face the possibility of never talking to one another, or at the very least, hardly ever talking. That night we agreed was the last night we would speak freely. It lasted from 11 pm to 4 am. So many things were said. And she said those words: &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those 3 words that I tossed around before in my past pseudo-relationships I now understood, if not fully, on a deeper level. Those 3 words that I so cynically thought was nothing but a stupid fantasy I now felt. Even though we might not ever talk to or see each other ever again, we want each other to find happiness in our lives, even if it means her finding someone else besides me and vice versa. We will look back at these memories and treasure them, regardless of what happens because to call it a fling would devalue what it meant to us; it was so, so much more...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a girl who I could finally imagine myself being in a long term relationship, but fate otherwise was said otherwise. We did leave open the possibility for a future long distance relationship though. We have our whole lives ahead of us and there&amp;#39;s nothing to say that we won&amp;#39;t find a way back to each other. But unfortunately, it can&amp;#39;t happen now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had I been looking from the outside into this situation, I would&amp;#39;ve been like the next person in saying that it was just young love, you have no idea how shallow it was based upon, etc. But it is so much different, which is also a line we&amp;#39;ve all heard before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m terrified of is that I&amp;#39;ll never meet someone like her, someone who truly accepts me the way I am, not the illusion I make for myself. I love her, and I can&amp;#39;t imagine letting go of what we&amp;#39;ve had. If she does find someone she is truly happy with and it&amp;#39;s not me, I want her to be with that guy. I want her to have a happy future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that someone is gonna say that pretty much almost everyone meets &amp;quot;the one&amp;quot; eventually. But what if she was the one? I&amp;#39;m not popular by any stretch of the imaginations and putting myself out there has almost always ended in failure...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Fell in love with a girl. Have to go our separate ways for now. Terrified that I&amp;#39;m losing something I may never find again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: some words here and there for clarity. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I dunno if this is the right subreddit for this kind of stuff but I haven't shared this with anyone and I just wanted to talk about it so here it is (sorry if it gets really rambly):\n\nTl;dr at the bottom\n\nIt all started back in late February this year.
