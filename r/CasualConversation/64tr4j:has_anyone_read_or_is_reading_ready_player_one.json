But I&amp;#39;m older, so the thing I liked best about it was all the references to things that happened long ago. Brought back some awesome memories, and made me sad because newbie geeks won&amp;#39;t have nearly as much fun as we did. Technology was the wild west. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like that one, let me recommend another book: &lt;em&gt;Reamde&lt;/em&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;br/&gt;\nBonus points if you get the &amp;quot;meme&amp;quot; in the title.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn general, any Neal Stephenson book is a great read for a geek.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you&amp;#39;re into future resources, etc, take a look at &lt;em&gt;Seveneves&lt;/em&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Bonus recommendation: Hugh Howey, the Silo series. I liked the first part, &lt;em&gt;Wool&lt;/em&gt;. Second and third parts are only interesting if you want to know what happened before and after. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "name": "t1_dg4yhhb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975003.0, "created_utc": 1491946203.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tr4j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tr4j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52z42", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "purplemountain01", "parent_id": "t1_dg51wn2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CasualConversation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Spielberg makes really good movies.
