The time was bad for me. The two weeks at home were hell, my mother was treating me horribly. My bf at the time was extremely controlling and abusive. I was just lost and at a bad place. I had two flights that day to get home and I was not in the mood to talk to anyone. On my first flight I made it a point to put on my bitchiest face so no one would sit by me or talk to me, I even pulled the whole backpack in the seat thing to try and prevent anyone from sitting next to me (Southwest airline style seating). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First flight went great, not a single person talked to me. On the second flight I tried to do the same thing, hard bitch face and backpack in seat. I was in the window seat and I see this guy coming down the aisle who noticed me so I avoided eye contact. Of course this guy asks, &amp;quot;Is this seat open?&amp;quot; Sure, whatever, just don&amp;#39;t talk to me...nope! He then proceeds to ask me a million questions about myself, where I&amp;#39;m heading etc. But instead of it annoying me I actually started enjoying his company. We got into some pretty deep topics about our families and the like, talked about guitars since he played and I was just trying to learn, video games, yada yada. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were mostly through the flight before he says this: &amp;quot;You know, I don&amp;#39;t want to sound creepy or anything, but I actually saw you on the previous flight. We were on the same flight before this and I saw you, but not gonna lie, you looked super bitchy. But when I saw you on this flight too I thought, what the heck, and decided to ask you if I could sit here. Turns out you aren&amp;#39;t a bitch at all! You are actually really cool to talk to!&amp;quot; Ha! While this was like the weirdest non-compliment compliment I had ever received, I also found it amazing that we happened to be taking the same route, he saw me and for some reason decided to talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometime near the end of our conversation he started talking about how you meet people like this and then just never see them again. He had this amazing term for it which I of course forgot and wish desperately that I could remember it. Next thing I know, he pulls out a purple guitar pick and says &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll probably never meet again, but this conversation was great and I want to give this to you as a way to remember meeting this random guy on a plane&amp;quot; To this day, I still carry around that guitar pick in my wallet, as a reminder of all the people that affect you in life that you can never thank later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made my flight so much better, I was on the verge of tears the entire first flight and he made me feel so much better. I wish I could thank that guy for being so nice that day, because I desperately needed it and I don&amp;#39;t think he ever realized how much it meant to me. Also to note, a while after the encounter I was scrolling through my instagram and found a picture I had taken the day I took those flights of everyone around me on their cellphones. I started looking at the picture and the guy was literally sitting right in front of me and is in the picture!!! Crazy...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, long-winded but that&amp;#39;s my story.

Probably the best words to live by I've ever gotten from anyone. Long story, but I hope someone can take inspiration from this.\n\nLet's start with some background. It was the middle of an internship as an island steward on a small island off the coast of Connecticut. I was looking forward to it originally, but after a month or so on the island the isolation and general tediousness of the work (pulling weeds all day) was really getting to me. After the fourth of July weekend, I get to the island and my co-steward is on his days off so it's just me. I'm on my final trash collection round, I realize some people who had arrived earlier set up a tent and a barbecue. They know the island is staffed by someone and they (complete strangers) told me to join them at their barbecue. I finish my trash round (and work for the day) and join them afterwards, very glad about the opportunity social interaction. We shared life stories, ate some fantastic gumbo, and since my work was done for the day I stayed for the fun. Something felt very welcoming about this group, and despite being strangers, they were quick friends for the day. \n\nThe quality of the gumbo was a bit of a premonition. As the sun went down, the last call for when visitors are allowed on the island (30 minutes after sunset is when it closes to any visitors whatsoever), the festivities pack up and we're about share our goodbyes. I go to thank and compliment the gumbo chef, who had introduced himself as Frank. He was busy cooking so he was one of the group I didn't get to speak with much earlier on. And this is what he told me (not exact quotes, but the message): \n\nYou know how your family, your friends, your college, and pretty much everyone tells you to follow your passion? You have to be careful with that. Of course, you should follow it, but a lot of people think that following your passion involves working with your passion in a career or a business. You're going to get the best out of your passion following it on your own time as opposed to someone else's time or on constraints you set yourself too. I had a passion for cooking and started a restaurant. But, there's so much to running a restaurant that my cooking suffered and I started to almost lose it. I also have a passion for traveling. I quit my finance job in New York a while ago to travel the world on my own terms and I can tell you the people that were doing what they liked when they liked were by far the happiest. Of course, you do need a career to keep yourself going, it's a part of life. But you're going to get the most out of you passions if you pursue them on your own terms and your own time. \n\nAnd with that, we shook hands, I thanked him, and he went to his boat and drove off. \n\nOn a side note to that, I feel like a friend nowadays is going through something like this and I may want to share this with her. She's a creative writer and is a month away from a degree in it. Her classes have been very critical of her writing and that of others, and she doesn't have much time to actually think about it. I remember her loving every part of creative writing and she told me recently that she's not been feeling it even on her own time and she's afraid she's losing that passion.
