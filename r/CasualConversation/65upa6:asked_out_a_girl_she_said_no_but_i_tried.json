No idea where to start. Gyms are a little too... Scary? \n\nHey now. We accept all those who choose to walk along the Iron Path. We all started our journey by taking that first step into the gym. No one is born with innate knowledge of lifting or becoming fit. We all started at the same place.\n\nSure, some of us started earlier and some have better genetics, but everyone can become fit. Anyone who judges you at the gym is an asshole and is going to judge you outside the gym. So, why not be judged while bettering yourself (but seriously, no one is going to judge you)?\n\nQuick story: there was this guy who was really, really overweight in my gym. But, was he ever determined. He started by walking on the treadmill. Eventually he started lifting weights and he started with the lowest weights possible. Nevertheless, this dude was there every single time I was there. Six months later, he was still at it and you could definitely see that he had made progress. Now, he wasn't an Adonis, but he was putting in the time and it showed. One night I went up to him and introduced myself (we both worked out really late and were generally the only people in the gym). I said, \"I've seen you in here almost every day for the last few months. I hope this isn't weird, but it's clear you've really made some great progress. You actually make me hold myself responsible and come to the gym because I know you are always here\" He said he appreciated it because he said it was hard to see the progress himself. People who lift don't care if you are actually honestly trying.\n\nSince you wrote that you don't know where to start, I recommend [5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/). It's an awesome starting program that everyone knows.\n\nAlso, diet is about 80% of the battle. Make sure you eat fewer calories than you expend and you'll lose weight. There are a lot of good ways to go about it but that's really the general idea.\n\nI'm not an expert by any means but if you have questions, shoot me a PM and/or read /r/fitness (or for a laugh /r/swoleacceptance [Wheymen!])\n\nGood luck! You can do this, brother/ sister\n\nEdit: Because typing a novel on your phone is hard\n ", "edited": 1492449519.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly have 0% care for myself.

We all started at the same place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, some of us started earlier and some have better genetics, but everyone can become fit. Anyone who judges you at the gym is an asshole and is going to judge you outside the gym. So, why not be judged while bettering yourself (but seriously, no one is going to judge you)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quick story: there was this guy who was really, really overweight in my gym. But, was he ever determined. He started by walking on the treadmill. Eventually he started lifting weights and he started with the lowest weights possible. Nevertheless, this dude was there every single time I was there. Six months later, he was still at it and you could definitely see that he had made progress. Now, he wasn&amp;#39;t an Adonis, but he was putting in the time and it showed. One night I went up to him and introduced myself (we both worked out really late and were generally the only people in the gym). I said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve seen you in here almost every day for the last few months. I hope this isn&amp;#39;t weird, but it&amp;#39;s clear you&amp;#39;ve really made some great progress. You actually make me hold myself responsible and come to the gym because I know you are always here&amp;quot; He said he appreciated it because he said it was hard to see the progress himself. People who lift don&amp;#39;t care if you are actually honestly trying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you wrote that you don&amp;#39;t know where to start, I recommend &lt;a href=\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/\"&gt;5x5&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s an awesome starting program that everyone knows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, diet is about 80% of the battle. Make sure you eat fewer calories than you expend and you&amp;#39;ll lose weight. There are a lot of good ways to go about it but that&amp;#39;s really the general idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not an expert by any means but if you have questions, shoot me a PM and/or read &lt;a href=\"/r/fitness\"&gt;/r/fitness&lt;/a&gt; (or for a laugh &lt;a href=\"/r/swoleacceptance\"&gt;/r/swoleacceptance&lt;/a&gt; [Wheymen!])&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck! You can do this, brother/ sister&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Because typing a novel on your phone is hard&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "name": "t1_dgdrvtb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492477886.0, "created_utc": 1492449086.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65upa6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65upa6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65upa6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65upa6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdtta3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "swollton", "parent_id": "t1_dgds0il", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CasualConversation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "THIS.  \n\n\"Motivation gets you started.

But just be aware of the emotional current underneath it all as you&amp;#39;re moving on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I like to read articles like this &lt;a href=\"http://www.themodernman.com/dating/relationships/how_to_survive_a_relationship_breakup.html\"&gt;http://www.themodernman.com/dating/relationships/how_to_survive_a_relationship_breakup.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "name": "t1_dge2a22", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489533.0, "created_utc": 1492460733.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65upa6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge411r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "personaldistance", "parent_id": "t1_dgdedkm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CasualConversation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If she \"moved on\" sooner than three weeks it's likely she was already messing around.
