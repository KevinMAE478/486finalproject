The coffee I used is from El Salvador produced by Cafe Pacas for anyone who cares...\nSo the drink is very dark and smells good but not at all bitter, it tastes very similar to how the coffee is when dripped but not as much flavor. It seems pretty well extracted (To my surprise) I would go a bit less coffee for a longer amount of time to really bring out the other flavors, as at the low-temperature I doubt you would get many bitter notes. The mouthfeel isn&amp;#39;t that good, it seems quite rough, not sure why that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is one of the fastest Aeropress brew methods I have seen and gives a decent cup :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loads of good recipes on this link &lt;a href=\"https://handground.com/grind/66-recipes-for-amazing-aeropress-coffee\"&gt;https://handground.com/grind/66-recipes-for-amazing-aeropress-coffee&lt;/a&gt; Yes they are trying to sell a grinder as all the instructions have to grind the coffee on this setting.  Side note I got one of these grinders, had issues when I first got it emailed the guys who made it and they sent me out replacement burrs to sort it out now it works really nicely. It is a very expensive grinder for what else is on the market of similar type like the Hairo grinders as they are also ceramic, probably not as consistent though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dg5se9v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028771.0, "created_utc": 1491999971.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4g0sn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "12_bowls_of_chowder", "parent_id": "t3_64qr35", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Currently this is my favorite:\n\n* Heat water to 80C\n* Rise paper filter &amp; warm cup\n* add 18g of fine grind (fine then one or 2 clicks toward medium), right side up\n* 30g of water bloom for 10 seconds\n* add 150g water, stir 5 times\n* attach plunger, wait for 10 seconds\n* plunge while counting to 10 (edit: just timed and my 10 count is about 25 seconds.)\n\nAdd more water to taste.\n", "edited": 1491927387.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently this is my favorite:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Heat water to 80C&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rise paper filter &amp;amp; warm cup&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;add 18g of fine grind (fine then one or 2 clicks toward medium), right side up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30g of water bloom for 10 seconds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;add 150g water, stir 5 times&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;attach plunger, wait for 10 seconds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;plunge while counting to 10 (edit: just timed and my 10 count is about 25 seconds.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add more water to taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dg4g0sn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954665.0, "created_utc": 1491925865.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qr35", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qr35", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qr35", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qr35", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5shzq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Richard_severn", "parent_id": "t1_dg51a7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "First time I did this I rushed, held Aeropress by the body....plunger fell out coffee went everywhere, all down my washing machine, over the wooden worktops made a right mess scolded my hand a bit too, worst of all, I didn't get to drink the coffee, I made another after but that's not the point, definitely learned my lesson\nShould this be a TIFU....", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time I did this I rushed, held Aeropress by the body....plunger fell out coffee went everywhere, all down my washing machine, over the wooden worktops made a right mess scolded my hand a bit too, worst of all, I didn&amp;#39;t get to drink the coffee, I made another after but that&amp;#39;s not the point, definitely learned my lesson\nShould this be a TIFU....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dg5shzq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028953.0, "created_utc": 1492000153.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg51a7x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lobotomobility", "parent_id": "t1_dg4o6uq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Put mug on it, flip with mug, problem solved.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put mug on it, flip with mug, problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dg51a7x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978473.0, "created_utc": 1491949673.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4o6uq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Z1ggy0", "parent_id": "t1_dg4cmtl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is my favorite method.
