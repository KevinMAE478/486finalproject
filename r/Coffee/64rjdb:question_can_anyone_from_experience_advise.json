The implication that manual grinders can not perform more than admirably for espresso is absolutely incorrect. You don&amp;#39;t need a Mazzer Robur or a Malkhonig EK43 to make exceptional espresso, even if they might still be a leg up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, if I was buying specifically for espresso grinding I&amp;#39;d build a Bunnzilla with Ditting 804 burrs before any other option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Also, I feel like this reply may seem sort of hostile and if so I apologize as I really don&amp;#39;t intend it to be.
