I was pretty stoked to find out that they were offering a new natural processed coffee, and it was just as delicious as I\u2019d expected it to be! It was very reminiscent of strawberry juice, with some nice chocolaty tones to balance out the fruitiness. I\u2019ve been brewing it on my Kalita 185 with 25 grams of coffee to 425 grams of water. Overall, it is a super sweet and juicy cup with very little acidity, and is amazingly clean for a natural processed coffee. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also ordered a bag of their limited edition &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/4PfUbeV.jpg\"&gt;Honduras El Nino&lt;/a&gt; because the tasting notes sounded pretty intriguing, so I\u2019m excited to try it out in a couple days once I finish up this bag of Panama.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dg9a6x3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212873.0, "created_utc": 1492184073.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cgp6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cgp6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb84x7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "maplesyrple", "parent_id": "t1_dg9f1ie", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same here!

Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as the grinds not floating, I&amp;#39;ve read that means the beans were stale and already off gassed. I make a french press and there&amp;#39;s no need to stir after the bloom because the grinds have all dropped to the bottom and when I fill it they just drop again. That&amp;#39;s not how it&amp;#39;s supposed to work afaik. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dgdm1v3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492471295.0, "created_utc": 1492442495.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkwzl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SingularityParadigm", "parent_id": "t1_dgcv41d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The refrigerator is the absolute worst place you can store roasted coffee.
