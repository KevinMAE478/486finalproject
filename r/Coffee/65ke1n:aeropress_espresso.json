Its very similar in terms of both flavor and body compared to many other things that do officially qualify as espresso under his definition, so its not exactly fair to say to say its totally different. Id argue its CLOSER to a good third wave espresso than a lot of shitty &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; espressos you can get. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its like saying a Camaro SS is TOTALLY DIFFERENT than a sports car, because it doesnt fit the technical definition of a sports car. I think anyone in the automotive world would say that its serves most of the same purpose, and is significantly better at doing all of the things sports cars do than many of the shitty/slow &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; sports cars out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dgblrpy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492341325.0, "created_utc": 1492312525.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbl1pl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "theunendingtrek", "parent_id": "t1_dgbjryr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The point is its a misnomer, if we just called it coffee concentrate itd be clearer all around.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is its a misnomer, if we just called it coffee concentrate itd be clearer all around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dgbl1pl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492340243.0, "created_utc": 1492311443.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ke1n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ke1n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ke1n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbq3vm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Courtbird", "parent_id": "t1_dgbonzr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right?
