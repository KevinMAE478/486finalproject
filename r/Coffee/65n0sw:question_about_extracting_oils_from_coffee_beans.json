While this pressure isn&amp;#39;t the ~9 atm and won&amp;#39;t be sufficient to extract the same amount of oils with only water that an espresso machine is capable of, have any of you had experience using a set-up like the one described with either whole milk or water + some kind of oil to extract more of the oils?
