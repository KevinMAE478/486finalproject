Use your palate and good judgement to work out what timeline 'fresh' means to you.  Just because other people quote a number doesn't make it real.  I'd *suggest* between one and four weeks, but don't take me as gospel any more than anyone else.  \n\n* Buy good coffee.  Or at least, don't buy bad coffee twice.  You won't like everything you get, even from the 'best' lot by the 'best' roaster.  Knowing your own standards and preferences is far more useful here than what other people say they think is good.  \n\n* Pay attention to what you like and don't like.  This makes buying good coffee easier in the future.  \n\n* Try and find what you like and dislike *in each cup*.  It'll develop your attention to detail, and make the very minor differences in your brewing and experiments more apparent.  \n\n* Test everything.  Might as well.  Being willing to screw up a brew *now* makes all your future brews slightly, incrementally, better in the future.  Start building that learning now.  \n\n* Make a point of learning what over- and under-extraction taste like, so you can diagnose brew vs. beans early into your pursuit.  \n\n* There is no such thing as a 'perfect' (recipe, formula, brew, coffee, brewer, grinder, etc.) \n\nOtherwise, and here as well - rules are just suggestions.  Coffee likes to make hard simple statements in order to make it easy and non-intimidating to new people, but can oversimplify to excess at times, and end up with a somewhat confusing or misleading net result.  \n\nBecause coffee is *full* of cargo-cult ritual and rules. \n\nEveryone must do X because [it improved one dudes brew that one time and he's believed it's helped every brew since, but without testing that out in any meaningful way] ... but leaving off that back half just sounds like someone who knows tons helpfully sharing wisdom, and suddenly everyone is also doing pointless X, also believing it's improved their brews - because someone told them it *would* and that's pretty much how strong the power of suggestion &amp; confirmation bias work.  \n\n&gt;\"Why should you stir in an aeropress or french press and how does it effect the coffee, when should you do it\" \n\nSo the easiest way to make sense of your examples and their questions isn't to understand why someone thinks you should stir an aeropress or a french press, but to understand *what stirring does*.  In coffee, stirring simply speeds up extraction.  If you have a slow extraction, it will help.  If you already have a balanced or fast extraction, it will hurt.  However, it does nothing else but change the pace of what was already occurring in your brew.  \n\nIf you want to understand extraction and how things affect it, I wrote a [somewhat gigantic guide to the concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/4lxqib/what_does_each_part_of_an_aeropress_recipe/d3r0wks/) a while back; I found it ended up being that huge because it was super hard to cover the complexity of those factors in relation to each other without that kind of length - it's really hard to give answers that don't sound trite without adequate context.\n\n&gt; \"When do i change extraction time, rather than grind size.\" \n\nWhen your coffee tastes wrong, but changing grind size would mess it up even more and your method has the option of only adjusting extraction.  \n\nMost people adjust extraction time *by* adjusting grind size, so that's a very rare circumstance and probably not something you need to solve before starting.  But without knowing the scope of 'tastes wrong' or the relationships between grind size, brew time, ideal extraction time, and how pace can be tinkered with ... well, I worry the above answer sounded trite or shallow.
