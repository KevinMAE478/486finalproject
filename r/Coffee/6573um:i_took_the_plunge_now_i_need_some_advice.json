You can use this as a starting point, then adjust the variables to your liking.

[Invert](http://coffeegeek.com/images/53961/210x315/aeropressiced-5.jpg) the press (pull out the plunger most of the way and turn it upside-down).  It's much easier to use, and you won't lose any coffee this way.  Wet the filter.\n\n2. Use one scoop (~18g) medium-fine grounds.  Add ~300mL of water (190-200 degrees, or 30-60s off the boil), and stir a few times with the paddle until grounds are saturated.  Steep for one and a half to two minutes.  \n\n3. You can add a couple stirs here if you want.  Then place the lid (containing the pre-wetted filter or metal filter), push to remove the air at the top, invert quickly/smoothly over a mug, and press slowly and firmly over 30-45s. \n\nHope this helps!  It may require some tuning to find the sweet spot between between flavor and bitterness.  If you're overextracting/bitter, you can try a coarser grind, cooler water, less steep time, or less pressure (change one variable at a time to see how it impacts the brew).  If your coffee is too weak/strong, try a different coffee:water ratio.  Take a look at the [Coffee Compass](https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/the-coffee-compass) for troubleshooting.\n\nYou can also take a look at the brewing recipes from [Heart](http://www.heartroasters.com/pages/aeropress), [Stumptown](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/aeropress), and [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/aeropress). The Aeropress championship recipes don't seem as generalizable/reproducible without the right equipment, but they're fun to try out.\n\nI highly recommend the [Able disk fine](https://smile.amazon.com/Able-Brewing-Coffee-Aeropress-Espresso/dp/B00E58P81E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473172249&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=able+disk+fine) metal filter.  It lets more oils through and produces a more flavorful cup with more body.  It's also reusable and saves money in the long run.  I prefer it to the Kaffeologie S filter, which has a greater tendency to warp.  \n\nKeep tinkering with all the variables (inverted vs non-inverted, grind size, water temperature, water:grounds ratio, blooming with a small amount of water first, steep time, stirrs and turbulent wiggles, press pressure, etc).
