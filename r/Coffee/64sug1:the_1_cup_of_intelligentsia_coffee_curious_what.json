Let's change gears to assuming good faith and not talking about Locol very much further.  \n\nPricing and *perceived* exclusivity are closely linked, but not synonymous.  \n\nThis community takes extensive pride in not being exclusive, not being (very) pretentious, and in general not living up to many of the negative coffee-culture stereotypes.  \n\nSo, first off, it's worth understanding that \"being unable to afford something\" often results in that person feeling left out - like the pricing is a barrier that's keeping them from something the rest of us have.  And this feeling gets louder and more frustrated the less *easily apparent* the distinctions being drawn are to that outsider.  If they don't understand why This Grinder is bad but That Other Grinder is good, and there's a gulf of pricing between them (Black &amp; Decker Burr Coffee Grinder vs. Baratza Encore) ... they feel like we're either holding out - or keeping out.  \n\nMaybe it's due to my role here, but I've had some really quite vitrolic responses from people for not recommending an electric grinder below the Bistro - because 'we' are holding out on them and being exclusive and exclusionary by not giving them reviews on grinders they can afford.  By simply advising everyone to not buy a $50 electric burr, *the entire coffee community* is letting them personally down because we won't tell them which $50 burr is best.  \n\nThe assumptions present in gear make a fantastic parallel here: the assumption is that *one* of those products in that price point has to be good, and that at the very least, 'the best' $50 burr is the exact purchase they should be making - because they have $52 and want a coffee grinder tomorrow.  The assumption is that it's our fault for not guiding them towards making a least-awful purchase, rather than that it's a larger marketplace &amp; economic fault for failing to produce a grinder in that price point worth recommending - largely, because at the moment, it's not possible.  \n\nSimilarly coffee.  Because there is a desire for cheaper *and* better coffee, the assumption is that it must be out there, and that the coffee community is either holding out or lining its pockets by pushing the more expensive stuff.  And the very things that coffee does to try and justify the prices that we need to charge often get understood as pretentious and snobby because, well, they're practices we engage in to justify a price point that is keeping some people out.  \n\nThis is some of my objection to water standardization, to tangent briefly.  As useful as water tuning can be in some narrow situations, I still feel standardization is a practice in optical self-sabotage - to start telling newcomers that even their water is inadequate and needs a (available for purchase!!) solution is placing a barrier that just won't connect for the bulk of new entrants.  During the big \"HOLY SHIT WATER\" trend, there was a ton of questions that were simple extraction problems being offered water customization as a solution.  Nah, having perfect water don't do shit if you're hovering at 16% extractions.  \n\nSo yes, \"expensive\" is a barrier to people without the means.  But I don't feel excluded because I can't buy a Morgan.  I don't feel excluded because I can't afford to do wintersports, or because I don't have the cash for travel.  \n\nIn large part because I already understand those things simply cost more than I have.  And (specialty, especially) coffee, sadly, is at a point where it simply costs more than some people have.  Labour costs make the cheapo cuppa nearly impossible for most small business.  Home coffee makes the cheapo cuppa nearly impossible for most small business as well - they can't make up price on volume that doesn't exist.  \n\nAnd as long as we're still talking good coffee from ethical producers ... those prices are only going to keep going up.  As living standards in those develping nations ... develop ... their cost of living, their livable wage, the costs on the farm ... they all go up.  Shitty, boring Kona is $20-35 a bag because Hawaii pays American wages.  If we genuinely want the developing world to develop, if we want things to improve for the people and nations producing our coffees ... that improvement is going to make coffee expensive for us.  \n\nWhile there's absolutely legitimacy and space in the marketplace to de-pretentious, re-culture away from exclusivity and performance - and while I absolutely support that making a 'cheaper' coffee is not always selling out  or even a guaranteed loss of quality (For a very easy example: if I sell mine for $15+$10 shipping - it's the same net cost and quality inside the bag as selling it $25, free shipping.)\n\nI do agree that Coffee can be awful hasty to dismiss or discredit new things.  But that in all those cases, and this one too - that needs to be handled on a per-case basis, not as some sort of general culture complaint.  Like, if *your* claims are bogus, don't bitch about how coffee culture hates marketplace newcomers, in general.  Some of the pricing rules I've seen tossed around are kinda ridiculous - that it 'needs' to be $20+ or someone 'needs' this $50 piece of supplimental hardware ... but again, *specific cases*.  No, you don't always need to spend $20+, but ... yes, if it sounds too cheap to true, it probably is.  \n\n'We' as a culture need to look long and hard at pretty much every case where we're consuming something exclusively produced in the developing world - and prioritizing cheapness.  Because in contributing to market assumptions and perceptions that coffee \"should\" be this cheap - Locol might be doing nice things for its neighborhood, but they're fucking over the developing world.  \n\nIf marketplace pressure starts trending cheaper again - even if Locol actually is and can continue doing everything it both says and implies about itself ... not everyone can.  Creating larger, massive-er demand for cheap coffee while undermining those portions of the market paying more realistic and fair-er pricing is only going to add pressure to the industry side of things to move towards more exploitative practices solely to stay afloat.  \n\nYou can't have \"cheap\" without the many, many, downsides that come with it.

Yet again Strand wants to circlejerk to the consuming public that coffee is just too fancy, complicated, and not nearly as down-home as he'd like it to be. \n\nI've read this a few times now, and my end impression is that Locol and Strand are a match made in heaven.  Strand wants to bitch about coffee culture some more, and Locol wants to use that bitching to advertise how they're 'not like that'.  \n\nThis is something that really is just a long-form advert and press release for Locol.  It's dressed up as a critique of coffee culture, but ... are 'we' actually that stupid?  There's a lot of that here.  Shade tossed at the competition, shitty market positioning, and massive pandering and pander apologia.  And it's a particularly hamfisted article about 'fanciness' because Strand has softpitched every possible hard question to participants while making sure to toss the tough balls towards people not in the article.  Hella shady.  \n\n**I want to acknowledge that there's some very good, worthy, points about exclusivity in coffee culture in this article; I'll get there later.  Just that this particular article is a ridiculously tacky venue for Strand/Locol to bring them up - and it's gauche to play it out like that conversation is what they came for.**\n\nSo first, while I recognize it's just the submission title here, not a claim made through the link - but this is not \"$1 Intelligentsia coffee\" : it's $1 coffee.  From a different company.  From a different roaster.  From different lots.  Possibly from the same green supplier.  \n\nThe incredibly tenuous connection drawn in the article is \"Obtained and roasted according to the same lofty standards found at Intelligentsia Coffee, Stumptown Coffee Roasters or any of the small\" which is, honestly, effectively meaningless except to try and make them sound better to someone not reading carefully.  Similarly, that they buy from a green supplier someone credible also uses.  If you don't know a ton about the market, maybe that makes for a glowing endorsement - for myself, I know that my supplier also carries very cheap shitty beans if we really wanted some.  \"A good supplier\" says nothing about what's actually inside the bags.  \n\nBut 'shade' yo.  \n\nWhat does \"fancy\" mean here?  Not really 'fancy' in the traditional sense - no little umbrellas, no gold flakes, no saucers with little cookies and doilies and shit ... \"Fancy\" is just a keyword for \"expensive.\"  And as ever, we're taking \"expensive\" at face value, just assuming everyone agrees on what it means.  And even once we get into 'fancy' ... \n\n&gt;He has no patience for what he calls the \u201cculinary burlesque\u201d of pour-over bars, with their solemn baristas and potted succulents. \u201cIt\u2019s dress-up,\u201d he said.  [...]  \u201cWe have become overly focused on this ingredient preciousness, single-origin puritanism,\u201d he said. As a result, he added, coffee just keeps getting \u201cfancier and fancier.\u201d  [...] That\u2019s why there is no gastro-sermonizing at Locol, no talk of farms or varieties. The coffee on the menu is either hot or cold, and served with a cheerful lack of ceremony.\n\nAnd no one is terribly surprised when \"fancy\" ends up being a armwavingly vague straw-man.  It's just 'those hipsters' over there.  \n\n&gt;Still, the information is there for those who want it: A dedicated Twitter feed will relay details of that week\u2019s coffees. \u201cPeople who want to go down the rabbit hole can, but it\u2019s not what we put on the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy into a set of conceits about how to buy or understand coffee to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nBecause this is literally how all those people he just shit on as 'fancy' pretty much all already do it.  Its not crammed down customers throats - but still available for customers that want to engage that way.  Actually, they're going a little further than most of us by having a weekly rotating lineup and needing to provide that much updating in the first place.  \n\n&gt;Colby Barr, a founder of Verve Coffee Roasters, said he supported Locol\u2019s mission but *felt there was a value in highlighting some of the wonkier aspects of coffee*, just as it made sense to ask customers to pay more for something that required care to produce.\n\nWhat the fuck, man.  \"Wonkier\"?  I hope that's a literal quote, and you just forgot the punctuation.  Because otherwise that's a hell of a lot of editorial narrative - and judgement - added onto a quoted source's contribution to your article.  \n\nLastly in criticial quote soup from this article, Mr Babinsky of course says relatively clever and intelligent things, and names the single most frustrating thing both in the article and in Locol's market positioning.\n\n&gt;But does the $1 price go too far? \u201c**My worry is that this will reinforce the idea that specialty coffee is inherently overpriced, when it\u2019s the opposite,**\u201d said Charles Babinski, a co-owner of G&amp;amp;B Coffee and Go Get Em Tiger, in Los Angeles. \u201cThe best coffees in the world cost nothing when you compare it to the best beers or a fancy glass of wine, and the margins that businesses take on coffee are smaller than you\u2019re going to find in a bar.\u201d\n\nBecause that's Locol's marketing pitch: validating consumer preconceptions that coffee 'costs too much' and offering themselves as a solution.  Then ... talking about themselves like they're still delivering \"high quality coffees\" while shitting all over the core accountability mechanisms that our culture has developed to make sure high quality coffees aren't being sourced exploitatively.  Are they really, actually, delivering craft cafe coffee at $1/cup, with the same integrity and standards that I would define craft cafe coffee - without a price attached?  I really doubt it, and I have *hella* flexible standards.  \n\nAre they going to compete on quality alone with either of their owners' old businesses?  Not at those prices.  Are they going to compete on quality with their price-point competition?  Yeah, they'll stack up fine against McDonalds and beat the pants off Tims.  \n\n&gt;\u201cA lot of my colleagues don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said.\n\nI'd suggest that's a backhanded response to criticism, not a literal statement.  Because \"oh well they just don't understand\" is the pitchline for \"Hey customers, don't listen to those critics - whatever they say is just because they don't get it\" rather than handle the actual criticisms he's faced so far.  \n\n...Like \"economy of scale\" is dope, but it's not that amazing.  **Where are those savings coming from?**  \n\nEventually, you either have to pay more, or buy shittier coffee, because there is a price floor even at massive bulk orders - and the lower your price floor, the less and less likely that your savings aren't coming off the back of exploitative developing world labour.  Serving black and bidding up for condiments is not a $2 price difference either, nor is having a full fast-food joint staff turning into labour savings.  Are they roasting it in 180KG batches or something?  \n\nAt this point, the Locol $1 coffee is sounding like it's one of two things: decent commodity dressed up as craft ... or *heavily* subsidized by Locol's fast food business lines as a loss-lead product offering.  \n\nEither way, spinning it out like they're the future of coffee for setting a market pricing expectation the entire rest of the industry has no meaningful hope of meeting without either buying substantially shitter coffee or simply being a totally different business entirely ... Fuck that noise. \n\n**Edit**: \"Strand\" not \"Stroud\"", "edited": 1492041692.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen this article doing the rounds on twitter, to the usual twitter-sized responses from the coffee community.

Strand wants to bitch about coffee culture some more, and Locol wants to use that bitching to advertise how they&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;not like that&amp;#39;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is something that really is just a long-form advert and press release for Locol.  It&amp;#39;s dressed up as a critique of coffee culture, but ... are &amp;#39;we&amp;#39; actually that stupid?  There&amp;#39;s a lot of that here.  Shade tossed at the competition, shitty market positioning, and massive pandering and pander apologia.  And it&amp;#39;s a particularly hamfisted article about &amp;#39;fanciness&amp;#39; because Strand has softpitched every possible hard question to participants while making sure to toss the tough balls towards people not in the article.  Hella shady.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to acknowledge that there&amp;#39;s some very good, worthy, points about exclusivity in coffee culture in this article; I&amp;#39;ll get there later.  Just that this particular article is a ridiculously tacky venue for Strand/Locol to bring them up - and it&amp;#39;s gauche to play it out like that conversation is what they came for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first, while I recognize it&amp;#39;s just the submission title here, not a claim made through the link - but this is not &amp;quot;$1 Intelligentsia coffee&amp;quot; : it&amp;#39;s $1 coffee.  From a different company.  From a different roaster.  From different lots.  Possibly from the same green supplier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The incredibly tenuous connection drawn in the article is &amp;quot;Obtained and roasted according to the same lofty standards found at Intelligentsia Coffee, Stumptown Coffee Roasters or any of the small&amp;quot; which is, honestly, effectively meaningless except to try and make them sound better to someone not reading carefully.  Similarly, that they buy from a green supplier someone credible also uses.  If you don&amp;#39;t know a ton about the market, maybe that makes for a glowing endorsement - for myself, I know that my supplier also carries very cheap shitty beans if we really wanted some.  &amp;quot;A good supplier&amp;quot; says nothing about what&amp;#39;s actually inside the bags.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;#39;shade&amp;#39; yo.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does &amp;quot;fancy&amp;quot; mean here?  Not really &amp;#39;fancy&amp;#39; in the traditional sense - no little umbrellas, no gold flakes, no saucers with little cookies and doilies and shit ... &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; is just a keyword for &amp;quot;expensive.&amp;quot;  And as ever, we&amp;#39;re taking &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; at face value, just assuming everyone agrees on what it means.  And even once we get into &amp;#39;fancy&amp;#39; ... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He has no patience for what he calls the \u201cculinary burlesque\u201d of pour-over bars, with their solemn baristas and potted succulents. \u201cIt\u2019s dress-up,\u201d he said.  [...]  \u201cWe have become overly focused on this ingredient preciousness, single-origin puritanism,\u201d he said. As a result, he added, coffee just keeps getting \u201cfancier and fancier.\u201d  [...] That\u2019s why there is no gastro-sermonizing at Locol, no talk of farms or varieties. The coffee on the menu is either hot or cold, and served with a cheerful lack of ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no one is terribly surprised when &amp;quot;fancy&amp;quot; ends up being a armwavingly vague straw-man.  It&amp;#39;s just &amp;#39;those hipsters&amp;#39; over there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the information is there for those who want it: A dedicated Twitter feed will relay details of that week\u2019s coffees. \u201cPeople who want to go down the rabbit hole can, but it\u2019s not what we put on the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy into a set of conceits about how to buy or understand coffee to enjoy it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because this is literally how all those people he just shit on as &amp;#39;fancy&amp;#39; pretty much all already do it.  Its not crammed down customers throats - but still available for customers that want to engage that way.  Actually, they&amp;#39;re going a little further than most of us by having a weekly rotating lineup and needing to provide that much updating in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Colby Barr, a founder of Verve Coffee Roasters, said he supported Locol\u2019s mission but &lt;em&gt;felt there was a value in highlighting some of the wonkier aspects of coffee&lt;/em&gt;, just as it made sense to ask customers to pay more for something that required care to produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck, man.  &amp;quot;Wonkier&amp;quot;?  I hope that&amp;#39;s a literal quote, and you just forgot the punctuation.  Because otherwise that&amp;#39;s a hell of a lot of editorial narrative - and judgement - added onto a quoted source&amp;#39;s contribution to your article.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly in criticial quote soup from this article, Mr Babinsky of course says relatively clever and intelligent things, and names the single most frustrating thing both in the article and in Locol&amp;#39;s market positioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But does the $1 price go too far? \u201c&lt;strong&gt;My worry is that this will reinforce the idea that specialty coffee is inherently overpriced, when it\u2019s the opposite,&lt;/strong&gt;\u201d said Charles Babinski, a co-owner of G&amp;amp;B Coffee and Go Get Em Tiger, in Los Angeles. \u201cThe best coffees in the world cost nothing when you compare it to the best beers or a fancy glass of wine, and the margins that businesses take on coffee are smaller than you\u2019re going to find in a bar.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s Locol&amp;#39;s marketing pitch: validating consumer preconceptions that coffee &amp;#39;costs too much&amp;#39; and offering themselves as a solution.  Then ... talking about themselves like they&amp;#39;re still delivering &amp;quot;high quality coffees&amp;quot; while shitting all over the core accountability mechanisms that our culture has developed to make sure high quality coffees aren&amp;#39;t being sourced exploitatively.  Are they really, actually, delivering craft cafe coffee at $1/cup, with the same integrity and standards that I would define craft cafe coffee - without a price attached?  I really doubt it, and I have &lt;em&gt;hella&lt;/em&gt; flexible standards.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are they going to compete on quality alone with either of their owners&amp;#39; old businesses?  Not at those prices.  Are they going to compete on quality with their price-point competition?  Yeah, they&amp;#39;ll stack up fine against McDonalds and beat the pants off Tims.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA lot of my colleagues don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d suggest that&amp;#39;s a backhanded response to criticism, not a literal statement.  Because &amp;quot;oh well they just don&amp;#39;t understand&amp;quot; is the pitchline for &amp;quot;Hey customers, don&amp;#39;t listen to those critics - whatever they say is just because they don&amp;#39;t get it&amp;quot; rather than handle the actual criticisms he&amp;#39;s faced so far.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Like &amp;quot;economy of scale&amp;quot; is dope, but it&amp;#39;s not that amazing.  &lt;strong&gt;Where are those savings coming from?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, you either have to pay more, or buy shittier coffee, because there is a price floor even at massive bulk orders - and the lower your price floor, the less and less likely that your savings aren&amp;#39;t coming off the back of exploitative developing world labour.  Serving black and bidding up for condiments is not a $2 price difference either, nor is having a full fast-food joint staff turning into labour savings.  Are they roasting it in 180KG batches or something?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Locol $1 coffee is sounding like it&amp;#39;s one of two things: decent commodity dressed up as craft ... or &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; subsidized by Locol&amp;#39;s fast food business lines as a loss-lead product offering.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, spinning it out like they&amp;#39;re the future of coffee for setting a market pricing expectation the entire rest of the industry has no meaningful hope of meeting without either buying substantially shitter coffee or simply being a totally different business entirely ... Fuck that noise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Strand&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;Stroud&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Coffee", "name": "t1_dg4vqwr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971814.0, "created_utc": 1491943014.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 140}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sug1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sug1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhze", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sug1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ub4b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rockydbull", "parent_id": "t1_dg5rdby", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coffee", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Eh...I think its more like opening a bar and saying you'll only serve a few inexpensively priced craft beers, no wine list.\n\nWe have one beer.
