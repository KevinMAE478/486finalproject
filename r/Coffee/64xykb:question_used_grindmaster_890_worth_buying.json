I am wondering if this would be a good deal to get a high quality grinder for cheap. I&amp;#39;ve tried doing some research, and it seems that they use Malkonig/Ditting 89 mm flat burrs, but I haven&amp;#39;t found much else. Based on the burrs, I&amp;#39;d think that this would give me a pretty good grind, so that&amp;#39;s what intrigued me most about it. Also, the pictures of the grinder make it look like it&amp;#39;s in almost new condition, but it&amp;#39;s hard to tell without having any pictures of the inside. Here are my specific questions that I have about it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any experience with this grinder? How good would it be for drip and espresso? Would it be comparable to any other grinders in quality, i.e. a Malkonig or Ditting grinder? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much could I expect to spend replacing the parts on it if they need replacing? Is it very difficult to fix it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, is this a stepless grinder? I&amp;#39;d much prefer stepless, or at least micro-stepped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really hope it turns out that I can get an awesome grinder for cheap. Thanks for all your help! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve found out from the serial number that the unit was manufactured in 2007, so it might have more use than it seems by looking at the pictures. It also might be worth mentioning that I already have a Lido 2 that I&amp;#39;m very happy with, but I have been interested in playing with a grinder with flat burrs. Would this be worth it since I already have a decent grinder that I like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I decided I&amp;#39;m going to meet with the seller this weekend, so hopefully I&amp;#39;ll have a nice new drip grinder to play with by next week!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello all, I've just noticed that a used Grindmaster 890 has become available in my area for $300.
