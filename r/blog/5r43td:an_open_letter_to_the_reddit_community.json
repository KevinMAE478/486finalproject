Here's my story:\n\nMy mom carried me, almost 5, and my newborn baby brother on a plane from South America to the US in 1979 to join her husband who had been here six months. They came for economic opportunity, traveling on visitor visas they let expire.\n\nMy mom cleaned houses for a Mexican family business and I remember going with her on days I couldn't go to school, watching her break her back cleaning for other people. The business owner's son had a small industrial equipment company who needed a receptionist and they gave her a chance. She taught herself English and within 12 years was a VP managing a major portion of the company's accounts. She also taught herself Portuguese to be ale to communicate and travel to work with their Brazilian customers. \n\nIn the meantime she and my dad applied for permanent legal residence under the 1986 amnesty program. I was 12. I was scared because I'd known we were \"illegal\" and that coming forward there was a risk we'd get sent back. (That happened to my aunt - she had violated a law no one knew about having to do with when she arrived in the US and she had to leave for a year with her newborn daughter). Thankfully, we got our green cards. \n\nMy dad didn't do so well- he worked at a steel factory for a while until he was laid off. He was a driven entrepreneur at heart but no matter what business he tried they never took off. His most successful attempt were gluten-free cookies that got picked up at the local Whole Foods but he couldn't take his business to scale and it went bad. \n\nFor lots of normal reasons, my parents split a couple of years after we got our green cards. My mom worked two to three jobs always, every night, every weekend, while holding her 9 to 5. My dad kept pouring money into doomed businesses so it was up to her to make it all work for me, my brother, and my new sister. \n\nAlmost forty years since we came here illegally, I'm now a lawyer working at a small nonprofit fighting for economic justice in the financial services industry, married to a wonderful woman, and trying to start a family. My brother is in tech- one of the early, never went to college techies who rode the booms and busts and now still techs with his also techie husband in San Francisco. My sister has two beautiful kids and a husband; he's a graphic designer, she's an x-ray technician at a major sports university. \n\nIn 2002, I became a citizen. It was less than a year since 9/11 and again, I was scared that the national reaction might mean even green cardholders weren't safe so I applied for naturalization as quickly as I could. I was sworn in with hundreds of other immigrants at a ceremony in Faneuil Hall in Boston- one of the most historic buildings in this country. I was a grown adult, crying like a kid with emotion. And still, in the moment between when they had us hand in our green cards, walking down the line to pick up our naturalization certificates, I felt in limbo. I thought, if something happens *right now*, I'm not safe.\n\nThe Muslim travel ban and ICE raids have brought back all of those memories of being scared of being found out as an undocumented kid, of being told never to lose or hand over my green card to anyone because it was my protection, of that moment when I didn't have it and even though I knew my citizenship was literally a few yards away, I was terrified. (As was the elderly lady behind me who asked me whether it was true that we really had to hand over the green card and wasn't that dangerous?) \n\nI don't know to end this comment except to say that I feel incredibly lucky. It was not for any reason personal to anyone in my family that we were never the target of policies like the ones being ordered and carried it today.

We all applied for citizenship. \n\n\nIt's not always an easy (or cheap) process. My dad made it first, then my mom. When I was 18 (having lived the past 13 years in the US) I was finally approved for citizenship. \n\n\nThe day I became a citizen was one of the proudest days in my life. I was sworn in, given an American flag pendant, and the next day I signed up for selective service (puts your name in the drawing for military draft, should that ever happen again). \n\n\nMy parents are both doctors. I and my sister earned masters degrees and work in the medical field. My other sister earned her doctorate and is a college professor. \n\n\nWe are good citizens. We pay our taxes. No one in my family has been in legal trouble. My sister has spent years volunteering at a homeless shelter, I have spent years volunteering at a free clinic for low-income people who don't have health care. My other sister is a foster parent and works with troubled and abused children. \n\nI may be arrogant in saying this, but I feel like we have paid our dues, that we have given back as much as we have gotten. \n\n\nGreen cards are hard to get. WE WERE VETTED.

However much was lost: traditions, family history, language, etc. In the interest of integrating so they wouldn&amp;#39;t get targeted by those who did not like the Mexican communities at the time (apparently there was shitty treatment back when they migrated without any real help about the situation for those involved).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably not a kind of story you&amp;#39;ll see here a lot but it makes me infuriated at what I could have shared with people as a 2nd generation Mexican American. Because of hatred and racism, my family was basically forced into dropping everything about their Mexican identity to enjoy their lives here in America. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my point with this is that the ideals our leadership is injecting into its citizens are the same that convinced my family they needed to loose themselves of anything Mexican to fit in. This is so wrong and I hope no one else can say their family lost its history and culture out of fear of being ousted because some fat cheeto lied about what their people represent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "blog", "name": "t1_dd4knnc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1485858597.0, "created_utc": 1485829797.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "restricted", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh49", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5r43td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh49", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5r43td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh49", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5r43td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh49", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5r43td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh49", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5r43td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dd4cmxo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 172, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Maester_May", "parent_id": "t1_dd4bkky", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blog", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sure it was also a warmth issue as well, I grew up in a house that had a wood stove in on room, and a gas stove in another (aka no central heat), and my bedroom was on the second floor.
