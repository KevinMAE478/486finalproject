Most of these hours required you to put some attention onto the game and mostly prevented you from doing other things, unless you did something like afk fishing or woodcutting but even those werent that afkable back then&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people in rs have that &amp;quot;efficiency&amp;quot; mentality, and this is the same mentality that sometimes disinterest rs players in playing other games. A huge cause of the efficiency mentality are dailies. which must be done in a strict schedule to ensure maximum no exp waste&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention many of the rs players do some sort of pvm now, whether it be gwd1 or 1000+ enrage telos or nex aod. I dont know about you, but i seriously doubt i could play another game while killing a boss in rs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jagex should stop making these useless as fuck new games and focus SOLELY on runescape, allocating every bit of their dev time onto it and fixing every little small bug and making every update great and not half assed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dge92mn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497739.0, "created_utc": 1492468939.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yus6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yus6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yus6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgewmnh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Broswagonist", "parent_id": "t1_dgevf0n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sure, but it was the only one of it's type that I played, and I liked the whole Chinese theme.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure, but it was the only one of it&amp;#39;s type that I played, and I liked the whole Chinese theme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dgewmnh", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492536405.0, "created_utc": 1492507605.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgevf0n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LordJanas", "parent_id": "t1_dgebd7q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really?
