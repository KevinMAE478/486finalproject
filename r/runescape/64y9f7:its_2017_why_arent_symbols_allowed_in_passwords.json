No matter what Jagex does, this is out of their hands. In the event the password used is different, or it was never leaked, people will tend to create passwords in very predictable ways. For example, capital letters at the beginning, numbers towards the end, numbers replacing certain letters, dictionary attacks.

Therefore the accounts who are in the middle ground in which the increased complexity would make a difference is very small. The size of players who fit in that category, would have to justify spending the time to make passwords more secure. In the event Jagex were to have additional security measures put in place in the event passwords were leaked, then obviously it wouldn't be worth spending this time.\n\n###Jagex's Security\n\nIf Jagex stores passwords in plaintext, or even does basic encryption, no amount of password complexity would be protected. Therefore we have to assume passwords would be hashed (as confirmed.) In the event passwords are just hashed using a common hashing algorithm and nothing else, hackers could use rainbow tables and password complexity wouldn't matter. Therefore Jagex would either need to have their own hashing algorithm or use salted passwords.\n\nIf they developed their own hashing algorithm, a rainbow table attack could still be effective in discovering common passwords, and using the same information related to human error discussion up above. Password complexity at this point would be a significant benefit, but as discussed above it could still be marginal and would rely on a subset of players. In the event passwords are salted, then it's safe to assume passwords aren't being leaked.\n\nFinally, even if password were made available, two-step authentication (the additional security mentioned above) would prevent the password from being of much use. However the sub-set of players whom would be effected with password complexity in-mind is even smaller. Therefore it's safe to assume the amount of players who this would benefit is marginally small.\n\n***\n\n###Conclusion\n\nThe number of players who use\n\n* an 8-12 length password\n* that don't make common mistakes\n* and don't use two-step authentication\n\nis relatively small, and not worth spending the time and money of re-writing the system.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one here is saying that additional characters or case sensitivity are bad features.

Ever. For a symbol to be useful enough against an attacker to be worth using, they also need to be complicated enough for the average user to forget (example: using \"p@ss\" instead of \"pass\" is utterly pointless). This leads to frustration and repeated 'I forgot my password\" journeys, or, worse in some cases, the user just writing his or her passwords down.\n\nAlso, as two-factor authentication and other types of authentication become more common and usable, I believe that there's a fairly strong possibility that password requirements could become more lax in the coming years, to the point where they're used more as a reference/signature than as an actual authentication check. But that's just personal opinion, and I don't see it happening as the norm for a while yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYeah... This topic is very interesting to me.", "edited": 1492026138.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few people have already made all of the fun references about size &amp;gt; complexity, and both the XKCD comic and Computerphile have been mentioned. That said, I didn&amp;#39;t see anyone actually link &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg\"&gt;Computerphile&amp;#39;s video on password security&lt;/a&gt;. (Full link in case the hyperlinked text doesn&amp;#39;t work: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it fascinating, and have actually used it for two or three different assignments in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;m of the opinion that every password system &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; allow:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case sensitivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers and letters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any size password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an absolute necessity though, I believe that systems should, at a bare minimum, allow case sensitivity and passwords up to 25 characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I also believe that password systems should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require symbols. Ever. For a symbol to be useful enough against an attacker to be worth using, they also need to be complicated enough for the average user to forget (example: using &amp;quot;p@ss&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; is utterly pointless). This leads to frustration and repeated &amp;#39;I forgot my password&amp;quot; journeys, or, worse in some cases, the user just writing his or her passwords down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, as two-factor authentication and other types of authentication become more common and usable, I believe that there&amp;#39;s a fairly strong possibility that password requirements could become more lax in the coming years, to the point where they&amp;#39;re used more as a reference/signature than as an actual authentication check. But that&amp;#39;s just personal opinion, and I don&amp;#39;t see it happening as the norm for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah...
