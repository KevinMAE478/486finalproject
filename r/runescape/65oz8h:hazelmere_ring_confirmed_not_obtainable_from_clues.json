I&amp;#39;m pretty sure players went &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; off-base on at least two different occasions, to the point where Blizzard just finally said &amp;quot;Nope.&amp;quot; Then, when players were back on track, they solved most of the clues and puzzles faster than Blizzard intended (that might be speculation). Blizzard wasn&amp;#39;t ready to release Sombra yet, so created a website with a count-down timer (also possible speculation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By time Sombra was released, I think there had been a count-down timer (actually happened), a count-up timer (I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it actually happened), sixteen billion different false leads (slight exaggeration), 525,600 different clues (slight exaggeration plus reference), a few months of subreddit spam (actually happened), and a lot of players that completely lost interest in the entire thing by time Sombra was released (actually happened). It got to the point where the subreddit mods added a filter to hide Sombra ARG posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hype-build pretty much resulted in a loss of hype for a while. Players have also begged Blizzard to just &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; do something to that extent again (and they didn&amp;#39;t for the next hero that was released, so that was nice).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the entire thing became a meme that still gets referenced once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dgcamae", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392254.0, "created_utc": 1492363454.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oz8h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgca0xl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Killerx09", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9jo6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "SOMBRA.
