As someone who plays and enjoys both games daily i can&amp;#39;t believe people are actually arguing about zulrah being harder to kill than arraxor. Oldschool has better pvp and the nostalgia factor that&amp;#39;s literally it. Rs3 is miles ahead on everything else and the bosses are 100x more difficult. At the end of the day play what game you enjoy who gives a fuck what other people think. We play the same game, why are you retards arguing 24/7 about which game is better? You&amp;#39;re just embarrassing every other runescape player.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dgafd82", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492270534.0, "created_utc": 1492241734.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga93wc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "0x425631", "parent_id": "t1_dga2dpt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are much better options if you want PVM.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are much better options if you want PVM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dga93wc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257551.0, "created_utc": 1492228751.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgandnm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bubbazzzz", "parent_id": "t1_dga2dpt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can I link my pre-nerf 25 Heroic Lich King kill in the \"OSRS players can't pvm\" debate?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I link my pre-nerf 25 Heroic Lich King kill in the &amp;quot;OSRS players can&amp;#39;t pvm&amp;quot; debate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dgandnm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292293.0, "created_utc": 1492263493.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaoioa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ommageden", "parent_id": "t1_dgai719", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be fair the only really annoying legendary pet is that giant drake that takes up like 7 squares.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair the only really annoying legendary pet is that giant drake that takes up like 7 squares.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "runescape", "name": "t1_dgaoioa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294311.0, "created_utc": 1492265511.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwxl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcki", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgam0m2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "board124", "parent_id": "t1_dgai719", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/runescape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't understand the hate for legendary pets hate the players/design team that pick the big ones.
