To be able to take the money from drug traffickers they created the laws so they could seize the mansions, cars and money from anyone involved in the drug business.  Sounds good right?  No problems with that law.  Now the same laws are used for seizing money or property from citizens because they had a suspicious amount of money on them and they might be involved in a crime.  They don&amp;#39;t need to press charges or prove that you were involved in a crime.  Read about civil forfeiture laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the patriot act.  We needed something to make sure that terrorists don&amp;#39;t fly planes into buildings, great idea, we should stop that.  And now the government has access to just about everything electronic on every citizen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg8ty3w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492178013.0, "created_utc": 1492149213.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85j5o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 98, "report_reasons": null, "author": "archwolfg", "parent_id": "t1_dg7vxmv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is Politicizing Internet access to give everyone access.\n\nI think that's the one thing they should Politicize.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Politicizing Internet access to give everyone access.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s the one thing they should Politicize.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg85j5o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143388.0, "created_utc": 1492114588.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 98}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6550fr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg84fb9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TygrScott", "parent_id": "t1_dg7vxmv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Damn the internet is going to suck next week.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn the internet is going to suck next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg84fb9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142158.0, "created_utc": 1492113358.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6550fr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6550fr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8esru", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "call_8675309", "parent_id": "t1_dg8acgs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really the whole point of ICANN, at least as its viewed by its current participants, was to privatize the internet, so the world wouldn't feel like the US was holding them hostage and if things went wrong, the US wouldn't be responsible.\n\nThat said, the community of ICANN consists of a freely joinable working groups, which are dominated by intellectual property.
