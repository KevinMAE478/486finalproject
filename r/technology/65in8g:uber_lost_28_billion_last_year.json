You get some hate from their own employees, who barely break even - and the CEO&amp;#39;s recent bullshit with confronting a driver certainly isn&amp;#39;t helping that. Taxi drivers hate not only that it&amp;#39;s tech and app based (telling its drivers where they need drivers right now), which gives Uber drivers a leg up on traditional taxis. Some people think the service from Uber drivers sucks, given as they aren&amp;#39;t fighting for a tip, the driver&amp;#39;s rating doesn&amp;#39;t really matter much. Personally, here in Chicago, I hate getting the Uber driver who lives in a suburb 45 minutes away and is never in the city except for the one morning a week that they feel like driving. They don&amp;#39;t know the city for shit, and I&amp;#39;ve directed an Uber or Lyft driver to my destination more than once after a glitch in the GPS makes their voice navigation system useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m downtown, in the loop, I&amp;#39;ll grab a cab, just because of the prevalence of them (no waiting for the driver they pick to get out of traffic) and the fact that I don&amp;#39;t have to nervously keep my eyes peeled for the one car out of a million I&amp;#39;m supposed to be meeting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in an Uber this morning, and I scheduled an Uber Pool ride. Cost me $2.50 to go 2 1/2 miles. I asked the driver about it, because we didn&amp;#39;t pick anyone up - he said he was probably going to make about $1.75 on that trip - which barely seems to be worth it. Works out to about $8 an hour from which you have to pay for gas, maintenance, etc etc. So it bums me out that Uber doesn&amp;#39;t quite know how to deal with pooling yet (it works out of those of us who really like the price) but the majority of the time, no one else is joining the ride, and that&amp;#39;s put on the driver&amp;#39;s back instead of being company subsidized.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dgb8hna", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492322150.0, "created_utc": 1492293350.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65in8g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbv9gr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cbmuser", "parent_id": "t1_dgb1ioh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They are exploiting their drivers.
