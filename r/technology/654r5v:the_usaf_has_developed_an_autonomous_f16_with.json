The F-35 isn&amp;#39;t so much a plane as an augment for pilots to utilize and maximize efficiency while utilizing existing assets that are proven. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say you have a squadron of F-35s that can use 2 drones at a time. If each of those drones is loaded with bomb and missiles, you have increased your fire power by a good bit without risking more lives or having to worry about keeping a rotation of pilots ready to go. If the F-22 could do all of what the F-35 could do, it would but unfortunately to take it back to the drawing board and redesign it to do those things would cost as much if not more than using something built from the ground up for it and still not be able to do it as well. If your wingman spots a threat, it sends that information to everyone that needs it and the most important target is identified and the most effective means to attack is used. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movie Stealth had something similar to that but it had a fully autonomous AI. As Hollywood as it was, the concept of making decisions without influence from human emotions and feelings or issues deteriorating thought processes like fatigue and stress, you have something that can make better decisions. Why destroy the whole city block when you can bring down the building on an enemies head with little collateral damage and loss of life? If you have multiple squads of friendlies pinned down by multiple groups of enemies and they have given you the location of the enemies, hit all enemies at once instead of making multiple runs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can share information faster via a network compared to radio communications and have options given by a computer analyzing the data, it makes choosing the correct choice easier and less likely to have errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg8tg49", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492176952.0, "created_utc": 1492148152.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ns2z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Facts_About_Cats", "parent_id": "t1_dg8loxh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why couldn't you just put all that in an F-22?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why couldn&amp;#39;t you just put all that in an F-22?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg8ns2z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492167330.0, "created_utc": 1492138530.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8loxh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fuckface_academy", "parent_id": "t1_dg8bf0g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Berke likes to describe the F-35 as the iPhone of modern air platforms.
