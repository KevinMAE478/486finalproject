So, shady websites will still work.  It&amp;#39;s just the legal ones that are impacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as &lt;a href=\"/u/Grung\"&gt;/u/Grung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/65e2y1/princetons_adblocking_superweapon_may_put_an_end/dg9rbm9/\"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;, this means they have to download and run all the ad code.  So it doesn&amp;#39;t help with bandwidth, nor does it protect against malware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next part has all sorts of problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To defeat anti ad blockers, the researchers say they&amp;#39;ve borrowed techniques from rootkits, which are often used for malware but can be adapted to &amp;quot;hide their existence and activities&amp;quot; from ad-blocking detectors. This is done because browser extensions are given a higher &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot; than advertisements and ad blocker detectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, anti-adblocker scripts don&amp;#39;t detect it, because the proof of concept didn&amp;#39;t actually modify the ads!  The moment they actually start interacting with the DOM this code will be detected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another technique that was not used but was proposed to hide the ad blockers&amp;#39; activities is even more impressive. They are able to &amp;quot;create two copies of the page, one which the user sees (and to which ad-blocking will be applied) and one which the publisher code interacts with, and to ensure that information propagates between these copies in one direction but not the other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proposed means, pie in the sky idea.  Sure, they could do that with a static web page.  The thing is none of the dynamic content would work.  It&amp;#39;s a total fantasy land solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr:  It only works with properly labeled ads, and it&amp;#39;s not hard to stay hidden when it doesn&amp;#39;t actually do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg9rwb5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233743.0, "created_utc": 1492204943.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 42}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e2y1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e2y1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgajq1o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MalcolmtSpruce", "parent_id": "t1_dg9njaw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "XD On the one hand, yes. \n\nI would add that over the last few years, ads from google have become far better as opposed to certain other ad networks.
