The mix will be extremely competitive and they&amp;#39;ll be able to provide energy reliably and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg4v6g9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971168.0, "created_utc": 1491942368.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4tkxq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KitKhat", "parent_id": "t1_dg4s2r3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like clean and reliable energy, aka Nuclear", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like clean and reliable energy, aka Nuclear&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg4tkxq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969390.0, "created_utc": 1491940590.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4s2r3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Grandfather_Clock", "parent_id": "t1_dg4gs4h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "quite regressive on a number of issues, in fact.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;quite regressive on a number of issues, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg4s2r3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491967770.0, "created_utc": 1491938970.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qlqk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qlqk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5167k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "velociraptorfarmer", "parent_id": "t1_dg4m8jj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sounds like Minnesota too...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like Minnesota too...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg5167k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978337.0, "created_utc": 1491949537.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4m8jj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NeoShweaty", "parent_id": "t1_dg4gs4h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To expand, the bay and parts of SoCal aren't the only parts of the state.
