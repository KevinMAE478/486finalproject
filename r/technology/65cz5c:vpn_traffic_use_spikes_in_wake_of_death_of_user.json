Google makes it's money by creating user profiles, and selling them to ad agencies, or running ads themselves. That is where their money comes from.\n\nThe thing is google doesn't have all your browsing data. Google has your search history, any tracking done through their ad services, your email, your location if you use google maps, and basically anything you do on chrome or stock android, especially if you are signed in.\n\nNow google themselves uses this information to provide a very good service. Ever wonder why google searches tend to be the best? Well not only are they the biggest, but because of their user profile, they know what you want.\n\nTake a member of /r/the_donald and /r/politics. Have those two users both search the word \"impeach\" and they will get two different suggestion lists. While both will likely have \"Impeach Obama\" and \"Impeach Trump\" they will likely be in different order.\n\nThis is because google is predicting what you want based on previous search history &amp; email keywords (yes google scans your email).\n\nNow google provides **excellent** service, but there is a price to pay for it. On the internet if you are not paying for something you can assume you are the product being sold.\n\nUnless of course google is your ISP. Then they get everything, because they can see everything.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nOnto what *YOU* can do about it. Get yourself a VPN (Virtual private Network).\n\nThere are many providers, I myself use [NORDVPN](http://nordvpn.com/?ref=120157330), but they aren't the most popular due to some customer service issues, and they aren't the most secure if you aren't running on openVPN. The upside is they are relatively cheap, very simple to use, and have a lot of nodes all over the world.\n\nBut if you are just looking to anonymize your traffic, circumvent region locks, and maybe hide some torrenting I think they're great.\n\nOn to the technical side, who is a VPN and what does it do?\n\nA VPN basically creates an encrypted traffic tunnel &amp; routes all your internet traffic through that.\n\nSo instead of seeing:\n\n* workacct1484 connects to reddit.com \n* workacct1484 pulls down images from /r/unxpectedjihad\n* workacct 1484 receives torrent traffic from &lt;nodes&gt;\n\nmy ISP instead sees:\n\n* workacct1484 blarglblarglc'thulhuharblehoggglyfthagn to &lt;Server&gt;\n* workacct1484 blarglblarglr'lyehharblehoggglywtagn to &lt;Server&gt;\n* workacct1484 blarglblarglph'ngluiharblehoggglymglw'nafh to &lt;Server&gt;\n\nSo my ISP has no idea what I am doing on that connection, only that all my traffic is going to that server. So while they *could* sell my browsing data, it would be useless.\n\n[Diagram](http://www.limevpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/banner.png)\n\nNow you might say to yourself, \"Self, what if the MPAA suspects workacct1484 of torrenting. Can't they sue &amp; subpoena the VPN provider for their logs?\"\n\nYes, they can. Which is why you need a VPN provider that does not keep logs. Many of them don't and what happens is this:\n\n* MPAA sues &amp; demands VPN logs\n* VPN provider says Ok, but we don't have them. We do not keep logs. We cannot give you something we don't have.\n* MPAA curses\n\nNow if you start torrenting too much (like actually releasing the new content as node 0), or start doing more shady things like drug deals, and the FBI needs to get involved, you may be in trouble. Because a VPN can be compromised. It's not a 100% guarantee. But security isn't about being unbreachable, it's about being more secure than the attacker cares to break.\n\nHow do we get around this? TOR:\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nTOR the onion browser, a necessary tool in the fight for privacy.\n\nWhat does TOR do? Well TOR encrypts your traffic. At every. single. network hop.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well you don't connect to reddit.com. do a traceroute to even google.com &amp; you will see many hops. Each hop TOR re-ecnrypts your traffic.\n\n[Diagram](http://en.linuxreviews.org/images/7/72/How_tor_works.png)\n\nThis does create a slow connection but a much more secure connection. It is not 100% secure though. If someone controls both the first &amp; last node you use, they can do reasonably well finding out your traffic with some other information. I won't get into the specifics, but suffice to say it is **NOT** easy, but it *CAN* be done.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nSo if you really want to ensure privacy what do you do? Well first off, stop using chrome. Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.\n\nSecond get a VPN.\n\nThird use TOR over that VPN.\n\nFourth, start calling your representatives &amp; telling them how you feel, then GET OUT &amp; VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren't registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.\n\nFinally, realize you lack the money &amp; expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nAnd finally what does this mean for you?\n\nFor the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it's already happening. And it's not just ISPs. It's google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. \n\n#GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.\n\nThey are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.\n\nBut why should you care?\n\nBecause these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don't give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data &amp; sees you looking for a new job &amp; fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history &amp; sees that you frequent /r/clopclop (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to &lt;Local Credit Union&gt;.com and now can focus their attack.\n\nIf you don't think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in \"private\" browsing modes.\n\nAnd because, personally, I just don't think it's right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn't be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not \"free\" and there are no realistic competitive options.\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.\n\n", "edited": 1492197751.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have that comment that explains VPNs from awhile ago?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/62567c/eli5what_does_this_isp_selling_browser_history/dfk48d6/\"&gt;Found it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Credit to &lt;a href=\"/u/workacct1484\"&gt;/u/workacct1484&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just going to Copy-Paste from another thread I replied to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, I do netsec &amp;amp; net eng so without going into super specifics let&amp;#39;s give this a whirl:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but is it now also possible Google to sell my browsing data&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It always was, and they do.

Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second get a VPN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third use TOR over that VPN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourth, start calling your representatives &amp;amp; telling them how you feel, then GET OUT &amp;amp; VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren&amp;#39;t registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, realize you lack the money &amp;amp; expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally what does this mean for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it&amp;#39;s already happening. And it&amp;#39;s not just ISPs. It&amp;#39;s google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why should you care?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don&amp;#39;t give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data &amp;amp; sees you looking for a new job &amp;amp; fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history &amp;amp; sees that you frequent &lt;a href=\"/r/clopclop\"&gt;/r/clopclop&lt;/a&gt; (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to &amp;lt;Local Credit Union&amp;gt;.com and now can focus their attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; browsing modes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And because, personally, I just don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn&amp;#39;t be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; and there are no realistic competitive options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "technology", "name": "t1_dg9lppv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492226225.0, "created_utc": 1492197425.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cz5c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cz5c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9glt2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IDrinkUrMilksteak", "parent_id": "t1_dg9f0lw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Had to read it five times to figure out what was going on there.
