Buses and trucks are different because they have larger packs and so charging at 350kW is going to be more necessary and easier to accomplish. And they fill up more often so they can afford the extra cooling and such which makes charging quickly easy. But just because a bus or truck has to charge faster doesn't mean anything to a regular charging station. You may notice you don't see buses or semis at the gas station when you are filling your car, there's no reason that you would want buses or semis to share the same charging lanes/stations as your regular car either.\n\nRight now the money is probably better spent putting in somewhat lower speed chargers. They'll be cheaper, so there will be more installed starting from the same budget. And for current and near future cars it'll make no difference in charging speed.\n\nHonestly, right now everyone talks kW, possibly because that's how Tesla termed their chargers. But what's really important is the current (Amps) because that's what tends to set the maximum charge rate of a charger for your particular car. Sure, your pack voltage matters too, but that's essentially a constant which is set when your car is built. Ugh this isn't working, let me give an example.\n\nIf you have a Chevrolet Bolt you currently have the car which has the most reason to want to fast charge on this network the fastest, because it has the highest capacity battery. If an i3 takes 25 minutes to fill it would take your Bolt 50 at the same rate. So what do you do, seek how the highest capacity chargers, measured in kW? If you do, you find that the charging process \"runs out of steam\" unexpectedly long before you reach the end.\n\nThis is because while that charger may be a 50kW charger, it really maxes out at 100A. It also maxes out at 500V and 100A at 500V is 50kW. But your car only has a 400V pack. So your max charge rate is only about 40kW. What you need is a 200A charger (the max according to the spec right now I think) so that you can charge at 80kW at the start.\n\nWith a Tesla this hardly matters because there are only two pack voltages used by Teslas, one for the 85/90/100kW cars and a slightly lower one for the other cars. So all 85/90/100kW cars can charge at full rate (sometimes, when you aren't power sharing) and Tesla simply doesn't brag about the slightly reduced rate on the other cars.\n\nBut with other EVs using these kinds of chargers the voltages of their packs vary much more and the chargers advertise the figures using 500V packs because it gives them the highest figure to brag about. Although no existing EV has a 500V pack! So even a 100kW charger isn't going to let them all charge at 100kW even for a moment.\n\nOkay, so what's the big payoff here, why am I even bothering to mention all this. Well, it's because Porsche, which is part of VW, is making noises that they are going to adopt 800V battery packs. If they do so and VW puts in chargers which are rated with their max speed into a 800V or 1000V pack, then that means no other existing car (even a Tesla, if it could find a way to hook up) would get over half the rated charge power on these chargers. So if VW puts in a bunch of 150kW chargers they could easily be only 80kW chargers on any car not made by them.\n\nWe really should be concentrating on 200-350A chargers, that's what I'm saying. They'll be 150-ish kW max on \"normal\" cars and if VW makes 800V cars then they'll be maybe 250kW on theirs.
