INCOMING WALL OF TEXT. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED\n\n\nHere's [United's Contract of Carriage](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx). I'll cite as I go, but you should read it for yourself.\n\n\n&gt; **Rule 3: Application of Contract**\n\n&gt; A. These rules constitute the conditions of carriage upon which UA agrees to provide Domestic and International Carriage and are expressly agreed to by the Passenger. These Rules are also the tariffs filed by UA in accordance with certain government regulations.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; H. No employee or agent of UA has the authority to alter, modify, or waive any fare rules or any provision of the Contract of Carriage unless authorized by a corporate officer of UA. UA\u2019s appointed agents and representatives are only authorized to sell Tickets for air transportation pursuant to approved fares, rules, and regulations of UA. Failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right or power herein shall not operate as a waiver thereof.\n\nOkay, so we've established that these rules cover how United agrees to carry people to their destination, and their employees cannot just make up rules as they go. Let's get in to the exact scenario that happened. Note the bolded portions:\n\n&gt; **Rule 25 Denied Boarding Compensation**\n\n&gt; A. Denied Boarding (U.S.A./Canadian Flight Origin) - When there is an Oversold UA flight that originates in the U.S.A. or Canada, the following provisions apply:\n\n&gt;&gt; 1. Request for Volunteers\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a. **UA will request Passengers who are willing to relinquish their confirmed reserved space** in exchange for compensation in an amount determined by UA (including but not limited to check or an electronic travel certificate). The travel certificate will be valid only for travel on UA or designated Codeshare partners for one year from the date of issue and will have no refund value. If a Passenger is asked to volunteer, UA will not later deny boarding to that Passenger involuntarily unless that Passenger was informed at the time he was asked to volunteer that there was a possibility of being denied boarding involuntarily and of the amount of compensation to which he/she would have been entitled in that event. The request for volunteers and the selection of such person to be denied space will be in a manner determined solely by UA.\n\n&gt;&gt; 2. Boarding Priorities - If a flight is Oversold, **no one may be denied boarding against his/her will** until UA or other carrier personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservations willingly in exchange for compensation as determined by UA. If there are not enough volunteers, **other Passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily** in accordance with UA\u2019s boarding priority:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b. **The priority of all other confirmed passengers may be determined based on a passenger\u2019s fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and the time in which the passenger presents him/herself for check-in without advanced seat assignment.**\n\nSo United will ask for volunteers **before** they board the plane. Once you're boarded, that's it, you're not being boarded. You're being transported. And these rules don't apply.\n\nSo what rules does United have regarding transport? (definitions have been truncated, but you'll get the gist).\n\n&gt; **Rule 21 Refusal of Transport**\n\n&gt; UA shall have the right to refuse to transport or shall have the right to remove from the aircraft at any point, any Passenger for the following reasons:\n\n&gt;&gt; A. Breach of Contract of Carriage \u2013 Failure by Passenger to comply with the Rules of the Contract of Carriage.\n\n&gt;&gt; B. Government Request, Regulations or Security Directives \u2013 Whenever such action is necessary to comply with any government regulation, Customs and Border Protection, government or airport security directive of any sort, or any governmental request for emergency transportation in connection with the national defense.\n\n&gt;&gt; C. Force Majeure and Other Unforeseeable Conditions \u2013 Whenever such action is necessary or advisable by reason of weather or other conditions beyond UA\u2019s control including, but not limited to, acts of God, force majeure, strikes, civil commotions, embargoes, wars, hostilities, terrorist activities, or disturbances, whether actual, threatened, or reported.\n\n&gt;&gt; D. Search of Passenger or Property \u2013 Whenever a Passenger refuses to submit to electronic surveillance or to permit search of his/her person or property.\n\n&gt;&gt; E. Proof of Identity \u2013 Whenever a Passenger refuses on request to produce identification satisfactory to UA or who presents a Ticket to board and whose identification does not match the name on the Ticket. UA shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to require identification of persons purchasing tickets and/or presenting a ticket(s) for the purpose of boarding the aircraft.\n\n&gt;&gt; F. Failure to Pay \u2013 Whenever a Passenger has not paid the appropriate fare for a Ticket, Baggage, or applicable service charges for services required for travel, has not paid an outstanding debt or Court judgment, or has not produced satisfactory proof to UA that the Passenger is an authorized non-revenue Passenger or has engaged in a prohibited practice as specified in Rule 6.\n\n&gt;&gt; G. Across International Boundaries \u2013 Whenever a Passenger is traveling across any international boundary if:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The government required travel documents of such Passenger appear not to be in order according to UA's reasonable belief;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Or such Passenger\u2019s embarkation from, transit through, or entry into any country from, through, or to which such Passenger desires transportation would be unlawful or denied for any reason.\n\n&gt;&gt;  H. Safety \u2013 Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew including\n\n&gt;&gt; I. Any Passenger who, by reason of engaging in the above activities in this Rule 21, causes UA any loss, damage or expense of any kind, consents and acknowledges that he or she shall reimburse UA for any such loss, damage or expense. UA has the right to refuse transport, on a permanent basis, to any passenger who, by reason of engaging in the above activities in this Rule 21, causes UA any loss, damage or expense of any kind, or who has been disorderly, offensive, abusive, or violent. In addition, the activities enumerated in H) 1) through 8) shall constitute a material breach of contract, for which UA shall be excused from performing its obligations under this contract.\n\n&gt;&gt; J. UA is not liable for its refusal to transport any passenger or for its removal of any passenger in accordance with this Rule. A Passenger who is removed or refused transportation in accordance with this Rule may be eligible for a refund upon request. See Rule 27 A). As an express precondition to issuance of any refund, UA shall not be responsible for damages of any kind whatsoever. The passenger\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy shall be Rule 27 A).\n\nNotice that none of those scenarios applied to the traveller before he was asked to leave the plane. In other words, United's decision to randomly pick a name from a hat (basically) and then use airport security to forcibly remove him from the plane was in violation of their own Contract of Carriage. Yes, once he resisted, he would be in violation of Rule 21(b), but they had already broken Rule 21 by not conforming to those guidelines, and they had already waived their right to Rule 25 by seating him.", "edited": 1492187606.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure. INCOMING WALL OF TEXT. YOU&amp;#39;VE BEEN WARNED&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx\"&gt;United&amp;#39;s Contract of Carriage&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ll cite as I go, but you should read it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 3: Application of Contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A. These rules constitute the conditions of carriage upon which UA agrees to provide Domestic and International Carriage and are expressly agreed to by the Passenger. These Rules are also the tariffs filed by UA in accordance with certain government regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H. No employee or agent of UA has the authority to alter, modify, or waive any fare rules or any provision of the Contract of Carriage unless authorized by a corporate officer of UA. UA\u2019s appointed agents and representatives are only authorized to sell Tickets for air transportation pursuant to approved fares, rules, and regulations of UA. Failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right or power herein shall not operate as a waiver thereof.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we&amp;#39;ve established that these rules cover how United agrees to carry people to their destination, and their employees cannot just make up rules as they go. Let&amp;#39;s get in to the exact scenario that happened. Note the bolded portions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 25 Denied Boarding Compensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A. Denied Boarding (U.S.A./Canadian Flight Origin) - When there is an Oversold UA flight that originates in the U.S.A. or Canada, the following provisions apply:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Request for Volunteers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;UA will request Passengers who are willing to relinquish their confirmed reserved space&lt;/strong&gt; in exchange for compensation in an amount determined by UA (including but not limited to check or an electronic travel certificate). The travel certificate will be valid only for travel on UA or designated Codeshare partners for one year from the date of issue and will have no refund value. If a Passenger is asked to volunteer, UA will not later deny boarding to that Passenger involuntarily unless that Passenger was informed at the time he was asked to volunteer that there was a possibility of being denied boarding involuntarily and of the amount of compensation to which he/she would have been entitled in that event. The request for volunteers and the selection of such person to be denied space will be in a manner determined solely by UA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boarding Priorities - If a flight is Oversold, &lt;strong&gt;no one may be denied boarding against his/her will&lt;/strong&gt; until UA or other carrier personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservations willingly in exchange for compensation as determined by UA. If there are not enough volunteers, &lt;strong&gt;other Passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily&lt;/strong&gt; in accordance with UA\u2019s boarding priority:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;The priority of all other confirmed passengers may be determined based on a passenger\u2019s fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and the time in which the passenger presents him/herself for check-in without advanced seat assignment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So United will ask for volunteers &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; they board the plane. Once you&amp;#39;re boarded, that&amp;#39;s it, you&amp;#39;re not being boarded. You&amp;#39;re being transported. And these rules don&amp;#39;t apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what rules does United have regarding transport? (definitions have been truncated, but you&amp;#39;ll get the gist).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 21 Refusal of Transport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UA shall have the right to refuse to transport or shall have the right to remove from the aircraft at any point, any Passenger for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A. Breach of Contract of Carriage \u2013 Failure by Passenger to comply with the Rules of the Contract of Carriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B. Government Request, Regulations or Security Directives \u2013 Whenever such action is necessary to comply with any government regulation, Customs and Border Protection, government or airport security directive of any sort, or any governmental request for emergency transportation in connection with the national defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C. Force Majeure and Other Unforeseeable Conditions \u2013 Whenever such action is necessary or advisable by reason of weather or other conditions beyond UA\u2019s control including, but not limited to, acts of God, force majeure, strikes, civil commotions, embargoes, wars, hostilities, terrorist activities, or disturbances, whether actual, threatened, or reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D. Search of Passenger or Property \u2013 Whenever a Passenger refuses to submit to electronic surveillance or to permit search of his/her person or property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E. Proof of Identity \u2013 Whenever a Passenger refuses on request to produce identification satisfactory to UA or who presents a Ticket to board and whose identification does not match the name on the Ticket. UA shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to require identification of persons purchasing tickets and/or presenting a ticket(s) for the purpose of boarding the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F. Failure to Pay \u2013 Whenever a Passenger has not paid the appropriate fare for a Ticket, Baggage, or applicable service charges for services required for travel, has not paid an outstanding debt or Court judgment, or has not produced satisfactory proof to UA that the Passenger is an authorized non-revenue Passenger or has engaged in a prohibited practice as specified in Rule 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;G. Across International Boundaries \u2013 Whenever a Passenger is traveling across any international boundary if:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The government required travel documents of such Passenger appear not to be in order according to UA&amp;#39;s reasonable belief;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or such Passenger\u2019s embarkation from, transit through, or entry into any country from, through, or to which such Passenger desires transportation would be unlawful or denied for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H. Safety \u2013 Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew including&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I. Any Passenger who, by reason of engaging in the above activities in this Rule 21, causes UA any loss, damage or expense of any kind, consents and acknowledges that he or she shall reimburse UA for any such loss, damage or expense. UA has the right to refuse transport, on a permanent basis, to any passenger who, by reason of engaging in the above activities in this Rule 21, causes UA any loss, damage or expense of any kind, or who has been disorderly, offensive, abusive, or violent. In addition, the activities enumerated in H) 1) through 8) shall constitute a material breach of contract, for which UA shall be excused from performing its obligations under this contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;J. UA is not liable for its refusal to transport any passenger or for its removal of any passenger in accordance with this Rule. A Passenger who is removed or refused transportation in accordance with this Rule may be eligible for a refund upon request. See Rule 27 A). As an express precondition to issuance of any refund, UA shall not be responsible for damages of any kind whatsoever.
