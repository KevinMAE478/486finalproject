It's the average price of the campaign they purchase.  Typically an ad campaign is dependent on a combination of clicks, impressions, and duration.  The advertiser pays a premium if they want their campaign to last for a specific duration.  Otherwise, they pay based on clicks/impressions that are expected based on the traffic statistics of the site that will be presenting their content.  The software most ad agencies use track all three stats independently, and if any one of them is met, the campaign is terminated for that advertiser.  The advertiser still needs to pay upfront for the campaign they want to present.  \n\nFor example, if a company pays for a 1 month ad campaign that has a maximum of 1000 clicks, and after the month is over, they only had 500 clicks, they don't get refunded the missing clicks.  Similarly, if they got all 1000 clicks by the middle of the month, their campaign is still over.
