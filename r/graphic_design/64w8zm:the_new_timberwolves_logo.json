If you have a logo that looks too far out of place from the rest of the league, it can be negatively affected, even if in a bubble it's a good logo. \n\nFor example, if you look at all the logos/crests in the EPL, or La Liga, or Bundesliga, most of the logos within each league have similar aesthetics, similar elements. \n\nRelative to the North American styles, the European styles also are often not really great from a logo design perspective. They're overly complicated, with many details that don't replicate or are even visible at smaller sizes. But of course, tradition plays into that as well. \n\nIn North America, when you go far back enough in baseball, nicknames were informal, and teams were known by the city, hence a lot of letter-based 'logos'. Hockey started in a similar way. but with football logos from the 1900-1950 range, like the Giants or Bears, you can see that some originated as more complicated logos. It was only over time, into the 60s and 70s, that a more cohesive style started to emerge, combined with the cultural preference or desire to base teams around mascot themes. \n\nMeanwhile if you look at European soccer teams, many are basically just a city or regional name, lots of \"real\" and \"FC\" or team names that combine two regional aspects. Like Bayern Munich, which is Bavarian and Munich. It's no surprise that if you look at the MLS, it has more a European style, since most of the teams are trying to replicate European clubs. \n\nSo when so many club names are in that vein, it's no wonder they all just use crests, letters or symbols, as opposed to the North American style names and logos.

If you have a logo that looks too far out of place from the rest of the league, it can be negatively affected, even if in a bubble it&amp;#39;s a good logo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if you look at all the logos/crests in the EPL, or La Liga, or Bundesliga, most of the logos within each league have similar aesthetics, similar elements. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relative to the North American styles, the European styles also are often not really great from a logo design perspective. They&amp;#39;re overly complicated, with many details that don&amp;#39;t replicate or are even visible at smaller sizes. But of course, tradition plays into that as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In North America, when you go far back enough in baseball, nicknames were informal, and teams were known by the city, hence a lot of letter-based &amp;#39;logos&amp;#39;. Hockey started in a similar way. but with football logos from the 1900-1950 range, like the Giants or Bears, you can see that some originated as more complicated logos.
