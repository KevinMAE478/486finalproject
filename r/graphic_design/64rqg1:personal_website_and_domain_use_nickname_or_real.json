But I have a question and I have pros and cons for the 2 possibilities so i&amp;#39;m coming at you asking for advices...\nSo the first question I had to answer to myself is [context]: Why a website, for what content, what&amp;#39;s the goal ? - I want a place where I can post some works, indicate what can I do, where I can experiment etc... I think it&amp;#39;s needed, even if I become a &amp;quot;simple salary&amp;quot; for example, at least for me, and it can be useful for the future. It&amp;#39;ll help me to get an online &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; too, easy to access and easy to share. I&amp;#39;m looking for a job so that can be really helpfull. The second question to finish the context area and going to my real question is simple, is &amp;quot;why not a simple blog/tumblr/whatever already existing ?&amp;quot; -\n- even if there is a community on thos platforms, and where i can be followed, I know how to create a website and have skills in (i think) cool javascript libraries and do AR stuff, create my own website will give me my own space for total experimentation and test, and that&amp;#39;s really cool. Platforms like that aren&amp;#39;t that permissive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now, the issue. I don&amp;#39;t know if I should get a domain name with my real name (for &amp;quot;looking pro&amp;quot;), or with a nickname (because it&amp;#39;s my space, where i experiment, and on platforms where people post their works they very often use a nickname...). Obviously by nickname i think at something clean, no worries about the quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, should I consider people have to eventually see me through my real name or through a nick ?\nI know real name can help people by searching the content with google, but a nick can be easy to find too and maybe my real name can appears somewhere on the website even if the domain is a nickname.... And i&amp;#39;ll provide the link anyway when needed to share my works...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you use for your personal space on the web ?
