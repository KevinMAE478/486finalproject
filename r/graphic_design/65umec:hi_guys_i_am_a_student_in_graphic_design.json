I taught graphic design at my alma mater for a few years, and even the tenured professors urged students past and present to skip the master's program and just work, because that's where you're going to improve the fastest.\n\nFor color, finding images or existing color palettes is a good exercise. Whether it's from sampling in Photoshop or googling things from an era that used similar themes, like posters, patches, or advertisements, or using Kuler to mix your own palettes, it's all about finding combinations that work and recognizing it by eye.\n\nLayout: Again, getting an eye for it comes from looking at EVERYTHING. Look at similar pieces to what you're designing for. Thumb through magazines. Search for websites that have interesting layout. Learn the basics of user experience design. Even if it isn't interactive media, there's still a user, and you need to know how they think in order to feed them the information that you're trying to convey.\n\nTypography: Learn to kern. Spend *days* doing it. Lots of them. Take every type class your school offers. When you're tired of it, do it some more. I remember having nightmares in school about calligraphic letters not being the right distances from each other. Look up that browser-based kerning game and play the hell out of that. Build up a font collection, and make lists of your favorites in each category. Not five fonts per category, like 30 for each. Always be looking for new fonts.\n\nDrawing: Again, practice. I suck at it too, but I can get the bare essentials down if I actually need to, and fix things in Illustrator.\n\nEditorial design: This is my favorite, because you don't need to code or know what looks like what in which browser on which device, and you have complete control over what the final product is. I moved from digital design to the jobs section of my local newspaper, and now I design three magazines. I'd refer back to my section on layout. Every six months, my boss and I go to Barnes &amp; Noble to spend a few hundred dollars on magazines that we reference for design ideas. It keeps us aware of what other magazines are doing (Rolling Stone, Esquire, The Fretboard Journal, and several European magazines are our go-tos for great layout) and allows us to experiment with different elements without having to brainstorm what the contents might be. If you want to focus on print design, and as someone who does exactly that, I'd highly recommend it, get a fairly basic job at your local newspaper or for a magazine, publisher, whatever.
