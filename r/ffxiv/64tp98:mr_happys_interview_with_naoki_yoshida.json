Dun Scaith has some nice moments where you&amp;#39;re progressing through what seems to be a marketplace with some apartment type buildings around which gives some &amp;quot;lived in&amp;quot; feeling, but Alexander was just tiny rooms for the most part (A7 had an &amp;quot;alright&amp;quot; backdrop I guess). Coil was overall much, much grander in scale and much more impressive. I don&amp;#39;t understand how they could regress so much both visually and artistically. Alexander was never really fully realized I feel, but that&amp;#39;s how I feel with most of Heavensward as already stated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I know how they handle an expansion I just can&amp;#39;t seem to find any hype for Stormblood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg58il6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491988073.0, "created_utc": 1491959273.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp98", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp98", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp98", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp98", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp98", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wqx4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HollowMarthon", "parent_id": "t1_dg67tc1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If I'm being honest I find The Vault harder than most of what I've done in Alexander. \"MMMMMMMMMMMMTHISSHALLBEAMERCY\" haunts my nightmares man.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m being honest I find The Vault harder than most of what I&amp;#39;ve done in Alexander. &amp;quot;MMMMMMMMMMMMTHISSHALLBEAMERCY&amp;quot; haunts my nightmares man.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg6wqx4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075203.0, "created_utc": 1492046403.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg67tc1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "obi5683", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ui16", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be honest, there are people that can't do The Vault no matter what gear they have.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there are people that can&amp;#39;t do The Vault no matter what gear they have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg67tc1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047129.0, "created_utc": 1492018329.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ui16", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kyuven87", "parent_id": "t1_dg5hlj3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, it'll be more complicated than that.

Getting your 2/4/8/whatever set bonus is it's own goal in itself.\n\n* Getting your set bonus instantly changes how your class plays (most of the time) adding that \"fresh\" feeling even if it's just for one raid tier. They can allow new rotations or stat priorities. It's another layer on optimization outside of: Do I have ACC cap? Yes? Max best stat. Unable to get best stat? Get 2nd best stat. \n\n* Set bonuses are wonderful for allowing devs to test design changes for later patches/expansions. I have to use WoW for an example as it's what i'm familiar with outside of XI/XIV/Rift. A class  had their set bonus do the following: Ticks of [[MAIN DOT]] has a chance to reset the cooldown on [[HARD HITTING ABILITY]]. Sort of like how DoTs reset bloodletting (spelling, I DONT PLAY BRD SORRY). This made the class feel a bit faster and actually pushed the priority of haste (skill/spell speed) over other stats. \n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nAll the Cons revolve around correct balancing. They are a nightmare to do well. With things like FFlogs, parsing and rankings it's extremely important to get balancing \"Right\". \n\n* Feeling like you're losing 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% of your overall damage because you're missing your chest to meet your 4set doesn't feel good.  \n\n* You have to choose between balancing around having the set bonus (making you feel weaker without it) OR around not having it (meaning with the set bonus you could be potentially overpowered). \n\n* Set bonus strength in later tiers. This is all a numbers game to end game raiders. At what Item level is it worth breaking your 2/4/whatever set bonus? Most games at this point just opt to nerfing set bonuses that are sticking around well into the next tier though that doesn't feel good for the players. \n\n* You run into innovation problems. XIV's ability rotations are pretty set from a design perspective. Unlike other games you don't have something like a talent system to modify your builds. Meaning the set bonuses always have to make sure they work around the Job. Not the Job/player working around the set bonus. This is harder to explain and will end up more vague but. If you just end up with set bonuses being % damage increase to abilities. Players will think it's boring after a while. If you force yourself to have set bonuses impact rotations and how you play the job, that can only be done well so many times. Eventually you'll have a bonus that IS a dps increase but makes the rotation un fun or irritating. If you do Utility bonuses ALL the bonuses from that tier have to be utility otherwise you'll feel screwed. EX: Mnks bonus is a buff to mantra but DRGs/NIN/SAMS are buffs to their damage. Suddenly MNk feels left behind. \n\n\n**My opinion on them:** \n\nI think they would add more depth to the game. They would also insensitive players to push for higher end raiding over just gearing outside of raids. Sure you could tome farm for weeks and get Ilv 260/270 but you would still feel that drive of \"I want that awesome set!\" outside of just cosmetics.  XIV also has the bandaid of having every Job on one character. Meaning if they do royaly fuck up to the point of \"Oh you're playing BLM this tier instead of RDM/SMN? HA! Enjoy the bench\" You CAN play other jobs for that tier. While this isn't a good feeling it is a lot better than \"I need to remake my character to be competitive this tier.\".\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually a really indepth topic but the bullet points are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gives you a sense of accomplishment ontop of clearing bosses and getting high Ilv gear. Getting your 2/4/8/whatever set bonus is it&amp;#39;s own goal in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your set bonus instantly changes how your class plays (most of the time) adding that &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; feeling even if it&amp;#39;s just for one raid tier. They can allow new rotations or stat priorities. It&amp;#39;s another layer on optimization outside of: Do I have ACC cap? Yes? Max best stat. Unable to get best stat? Get 2nd best stat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set bonuses are wonderful for allowing devs to test design changes for later patches/expansions. I have to use WoW for an example as it&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m familiar with outside of XI/XIV/Rift. A class  had their set bonus do the following: Ticks of [[MAIN DOT]] has a chance to reset the cooldown on [[HARD HITTING ABILITY]]. Sort of like how DoTs reset bloodletting (spelling, I DONT PLAY BRD SORRY). This made the class feel a bit faster and actually pushed the priority of haste (skill/spell speed) over other stats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the Cons revolve around correct balancing. They are a nightmare to do well. With things like FFlogs, parsing and rankings it&amp;#39;s extremely important to get balancing &amp;quot;Right&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling like you&amp;#39;re losing 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% of your overall damage because you&amp;#39;re missing your chest to meet your 4set doesn&amp;#39;t feel good.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to choose between balancing around having the set bonus (making you feel weaker without it) OR around not having it (meaning with the set bonus you could be potentially overpowered). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set bonus strength in later tiers. This is all a numbers game to end game raiders. At what Item level is it worth breaking your 2/4/whatever set bonus? Most games at this point just opt to nerfing set bonuses that are sticking around well into the next tier though that doesn&amp;#39;t feel good for the players. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You run into innovation problems. XIV&amp;#39;s ability rotations are pretty set from a design perspective. Unlike other games you don&amp;#39;t have something like a talent system to modify your builds. Meaning the set bonuses always have to make sure they work around the Job. Not the Job/player working around the set bonus. This is harder to explain and will end up more vague but. If you just end up with set bonuses being % damage increase to abilities. Players will think it&amp;#39;s boring after a while. If you force yourself to have set bonuses impact rotations and how you play the job, that can only be done well so many times. Eventually you&amp;#39;ll have a bonus that IS a dps increase but makes the rotation un fun or irritating. If you do Utility bonuses ALL the bonuses from that tier have to be utility otherwise you&amp;#39;ll feel screwed. EX: Mnks bonus is a buff to mantra but DRGs/NIN/SAMS are buffs to their damage. Suddenly MNk feels left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My opinion on them:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think they would add more depth to the game.

So once you have tons of bonuses, you can mix and match to your liking and create party that is not your usual meta jobs. The entire Abyssea area become an open world free for all for everyone to test things and challenge themselves (which I suspect the new Eureka could end up being). FFXI created several variation of these, with Voidwatch, where you also have to kill notorious monsters (spread out in all area of the game, which is a great idea to revitalize older content), you also get different set bonuses from each NM, but you can also power up that specific bonuses to max (say you start with 1% and end up with 10%). The  NM all has \"random\" order of move sets so players are always on their toes since you don't know which one could come next. So many ideas they can easily pillage from FFXI but the FF14 always decided to play it safe Care Bears style, completely obliterating older content within 6 months (FFXI contents last for YEARS, and they constantly being improved to be relevant).\n\nWhen it comes to PoTD, it is a sound idea, but they should have implement random mini boss every 3 floors, and much harder synergistic monsters starting at floor 20, sure this will create a barrier but also forcing people to be good or they just not going to proceed. I rather have half the population getting frustrated and end up being friendly to people within their servers so they can actually clear contents. Mind you, we are not talking savage difficulty but more or less common sense strategy for MMORPG 101 (pull safely, sleep the adds, separate mobs that link with each other, etc...). FFXI, again sadly, has a much better version of PoTD (though there are several objectives that are flat out horrific) - some of the objectives would be kill only mob of certain families to open portal, kill notorious monster that masquerade as normal mobs, kill all mobs, kill two mobs at the same time, etc.. it is not just \"whack-a-mole\" while watching Netflix.

Right now FF14 is getting stale so fast, within 4-6 weeks after big patch is released, the content is no longer interesting because it is the same songs and dance, again...
