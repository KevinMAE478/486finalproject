Will we be able to visit the city as a location in the game?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, players will be able to enter the Ala Mhigo region. The reason why we weren\u2019t able to reveal the landscapes of the Ala Mhigo area is that unfortunately we didn\u2019t yet have the assets to show at the Las Vegas Fanfest at the required level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there are some buildings that are prominent in the main scenario. They\u2019re key locations, and it was very difficult to shoot around them to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before the release of Stormblood, we expect to create a field walkthrough trailer, as we did for the previous expansion, so you will be able to get a glimpse on how beautiful the landscape is. &lt;a href=\"http://www.dualshockers.com/2017/03/22/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-interview-naoki-yoshida-talks-expansion-improvements-paladin/\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there is to be another zone, I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll see more of it and Ala Mhigo in the Tour of the East trailer which should hopefully be revealed in the next live letter towards the end of April (they&amp;#39;ve said they&amp;#39;re &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/61a762/there_will_be_an_additional_of_3_more_waymarks/\"&gt;aiming for the 20-something of April&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg7pnys", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126378.0, "created_utc": 1492097578.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6548iq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6548iq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7n4lc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lvl1bidoof", "parent_id": "t1_dg7kvpe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably like two zones and the rest is Dona.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably like two zones and the rest is Dona.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg7n4lc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123592.0, "created_utc": 1492094792.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7kvpe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChaoticCookieEUW", "parent_id": "t1_dg7kpy0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "inb4 Ala Mhigo is 1 zone.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;inb4 Ala Mhigo is 1 zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg7kvpe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492120914.0, "created_utc": 1492092114.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7kpy0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheFriskyIan", "parent_id": "t3_6548iq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We have already seen the Ala Mhigan city in both concept art and the world map and it looks completely unchanged.
