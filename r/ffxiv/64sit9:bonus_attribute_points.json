You can look at the talents ans summise which are &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; for a specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just say that Elemental Shamans are &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; at supporting AoE healing, and that the fight you&amp;#39;re on requires it... But you don&amp;#39;t have an Elemental Shaman. While it may be technically worse for you personally to take Word of Glory; it is better with your group&amp;#39;s composition than if you were to take something that is less taxing on your resources, because it will allow you to fulfill a role that is required in the fight where your group otherwise would not be able to fill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is Repentence. A Rogue would better fulfill the utility of instantly CCing an add, but you don&amp;#39;t have a Rogue. Instead of taking Fist of Justice to more frequently use your stun, you would rely on your Protection Warrior to stun casts, while you give your group the utility of instant single-target CC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are theoretical situations, but they&amp;#39;re the sort of situation that crops up in WoW. I realize that XIV isn&amp;#39;t as complex or granular as that, but I still think XIV jobs would benefit from talent trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg53lgi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491981519.0, "created_utc": 1491952719.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sit9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5gf33", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PlutoTheBoy", "parent_id": "t1_dg5388c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am so angry at this attitude that I actually created an account after lurking for 8 months.\n\nGame theory is not GAMES theory.

You&amp;#39;re BRD huh? Full dex, keep those songs up whenever needed and perform your priority rotation to the best of your ability no matter what the fight is. Your role won&amp;#39;t ever change. That pretty much holds true for every other job in the game. In the end, one job has a single role assigned to it and that is why it feels like there&amp;#39;s not much freedom to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also something important that people need to understand : you don&amp;#39;t need to have an actual choice in the way you play ; the illusion of choice usually goes a long way in making the game fun for most people, especially when you dress it up behind complex damage calcs and combinations of attributes and whatnot like they do in GW2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now is it needed in XIV? Probably not, the game works great as it is. But it&amp;#39;s definitely one of those things that I miss from other MMOs, this (admitedly false) diversity. You can have fun with suboptimal builds in non-hardcore content and still clear it comfortably. You can always filter out people to have the best/meta gear on when going for hardcore content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit : all of this post was more meant as a personal thought rather than an actual reply.

These people aren't who the game should be designed around.\n\nIf you can pull of a talent system where you change the playstyle of a class with minuscule differences in their output, IMO it's a completely viable feature for an MMO. \n\nIt's one thing to have a stat system that has tens of combinations that will give you shit tier DPS and 1 combination that gives you two times the DPS of any other combination. That means the majority of the player base will play with the one functional stat combination and give shit to the players who don't.\n\nIt's something entirely different when the system gives choices that are more flavorful and the differences between the specs are much harder to put in numbers. The optimal talent choice will differ depending on the situation you're in, the other characters in your party, how good you are at using certain talents etc.\n\nThe important bit is to make the gameplay less one dimensional. Let's use a DPS player as an example. There's fight mechanics that everyone needs to know and do, then there's the boss you need to DPS. You know your fight mechanics, and now you only need to optimize your numbers. If talent choices are about tuning these numbers, there will be an optimal choice and the rest will be wrong. \n\nIf for example kiting/CC/interrupting/adds were a regular task for DPS players it would allow for way more meaningful choice in a talent system. Or making mechanics harder and then having choices between mobility, defense and self heal type skills. You'd essentially have choices that are better if you know you'll be able to use the skills on time and choices that are more for \"If I screwed up, then I can recover with this\".\n\nYour view essentially is that everything worthwhile with talent systems has been tried and nothing will work. My view is that talent systems can and should evolve further. I'm not saying that this is easy to do, choices with proper balance between them is one of the most difficult aspects to get right in video games. But it's also the aspect that differentiates games from other media.

These people aren&amp;#39;t who the game should be designed around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can pull of a talent system where you change the playstyle of a class with minuscule differences in their output, IMO it&amp;#39;s a completely viable feature for an MMO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one thing to have a stat system that has tens of combinations that will give you shit tier DPS and 1 combination that gives you two times the DPS of any other combination. That means the majority of the player base will play with the one functional stat combination and give shit to the players who don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something entirely different when the system gives choices that are more flavorful and the differences between the specs are much harder to put in numbers. The optimal talent choice will differ depending on the situation you&amp;#39;re in, the other characters in your party, how good you are at using certain talents etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important bit is to make the gameplay less one dimensional. Let&amp;#39;s use a DPS player as an example. There&amp;#39;s fight mechanics that everyone needs to know and do, then there&amp;#39;s the boss you need to DPS. You know your fight mechanics, and now you only need to optimize your numbers. If talent choices are about tuning these numbers, there will be an optimal choice and the rest will be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If for example kiting/CC/interrupting/adds were a regular task for DPS players it would allow for way more meaningful choice in a talent system. Or making mechanics harder and then having choices between mobility, defense and self heal type skills. You&amp;#39;d essentially have choices that are better if you know you&amp;#39;ll be able to use the skills on time and choices that are more for &amp;quot;If I screwed up, then I can recover with this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your view essentially is that everything worthwhile with talent systems has been tried and nothing will work. My view is that talent systems can and should evolve further. I&amp;#39;m not saying that this is easy to do, choices with proper balance between them is one of the most difficult aspects to get right in video games.
