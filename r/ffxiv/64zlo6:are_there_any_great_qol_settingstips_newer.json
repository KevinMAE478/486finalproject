(used to be 10k.)\n\n- Your GC also sells the same but for your companion chocobo. I believe it's cheaper to get it via Allied seals rather than GC seals, though.\n\n- GC gear is great for leveling up baby classes through 20-45 and brings set bonuses.\n\n- GC also sells gathering/crafting EXP manuals.\n\n- CTLR + Home resizes HUD elements.\n\n- You can macro swapping through HUD setups.\n\n- Holding shift down will move HUD elements on a grid.\n\n- You can now change the shape of how hotbars display. (1x2, 3x3, etc.)\n\n- You can set up sound so that you can hear System Sounds even when alt-tabbed (game running in background), meaning you can hear when Duty Finder pings even when doing something else entirely. You can also set up an instant mute key.\n\n- If you have DX11/12 you can turn on the DX11 version of the game by clicking the gear icon in the log-in.\n\n- I use this macro to instantly give my healers whatever DPS skill is highest/available no matter what sync level I'm forced into. I tied to Protect since this is ALWAYS (should always) be on a healer's bar yet only gets used rarely.\n\n/micon \"Protect\"\n\n/action \"Protect\"\n\n/hotbar action \"Ruin\" 1 2\n\n/hotbar action \"Broil\" 1 2\n\n/hotbar action \"Malefic\" 1 2\n\n/hotbar action \"Malefic II\" 1 2\n\n/hotbar action \"Stone\" 1 2\n\n/hotbar action \"Stone II\" 1 2\n\n/hotbar action \"Stone III\" 1 2\n\n\n(you need to change the 1 2 bit to the hotbar slot your normal DPS spell goes.)\n\n- &lt;mo&gt; works on all ground skills you have to target, including Sacred Soil.\n\n- You can use 'emotion' icons in macros with /micon \"__emotionhere__\" emote\n\n- You can put /echo on commands to make sure things are working the way they should. For example for SMN I have the 'Obey' macro set with an echo to make doubly sure that little jerk can't pretend I didn't tell it to stop being a turd. I also have it set for my stay/heel commands. /echo is text only you can see, and yes sound effects work with it.\n\n- The game has sound effects. &lt;se.1&gt; &lt;se.2&gt; etc.\n\n- /readycheck and /countdown text commands work and can be macroed if for some reason you want to do that.\n\n- Gearsets can also be assigned to macros. I use these tied to HUD changes so that everything swaps when I go to a specific job with a job-specific customized HUD. (like, healer gets a slightly different hud, DPS gets a slightly different hud, etc.) And so;\n\n/macroicon \"Astrologian\" classjob\n\n/gearset change 2\n\n/hudlayout 2\n\n- Estate maid/butler (and housing ward housing npc) now sell a bunch of housing items that could only be crafted before, such as wallpapers and floors. \n\n- You can turn on and off HUD elements (this was more useful before we got multiple HUD saves) by text commands/macros.
