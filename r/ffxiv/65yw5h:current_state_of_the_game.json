But the mechanics were much more varied and punishing, including one that SE felt forced to nerf a couple months after release due to A6S becoming an A3S-grade wall. \n\nWhile overall the tier was widely lauded by the hardcore raiders, ultimately the clear rates weren't substantially better than Gordias. SE's read this time was that they messed up when crafting the level 60 skill kits - the attention they ask of players for things like Enochian doesn't play very well with complex mechanics, making it too hard for too many people to both deal with hard mechanics and do capable dps at the same time.\n\nSo on the final tier, Creator, SE effectively punted. It's the easiest raid tier in history by far, and intentionally so because SE's focus is more on rebuilding the raiding populace, getting people accustomed to trying out this content, etc. A9S was easier than most every EX primal on-release, A10S maybe about EX primal in difficulty. A11S and A12S were tougher, but ultimately they're glorified run-to-this-spot dances that most experienced raiders are accustomed to.\n\nImportant to note, Creator also brought with it cooldown resets on wipe, which makes progression a lot faster and easier. And in 3.5 we got cross-server PF, so statics can get subs with much more ease. So things got a lot easier in those ways as well.\n\nCertainly, SE has a lot of lessons they've taken away from the series of events in HW, that they mean to apply to SB. They're going to address certain aspects of job kits that require outsized amounts of attention like Enochian, and Yoshi has said that they hope the raid tiers get progressively harder this time instead of the other way around. \n\nThey now know not to try and design fights just to stick it to world-first raiders, and while it isn't talked about I bet they're thinking a little bit about how to do a better job with these +30 ilvl gear stages, as some part of Gordias' issues likely stemmed from not wanting i210 to trivialize it. \n\nThey've also gotten a lot of feedback and data on how to have both normal and Savage exist without the latter losing too much appeal. A8S had an entire \"final form\" of the boss added that wasn't in normal, and Creator Savage's gear is noticeably more decorated than the protoype counterparts. You can see they're trying to find avenues on this front.\n\n---\n\nOn jobs, that's a whole other mess that's resulted in \"punt off to SB\". SE screwed up frankly pretty bad, but because Creator is so easy it's entirely irrelevant.\n\nWhen AST was released in a weak state, and MCH released facing a set of Savage fights plainly favorable to Bard, people got \"these jobs are bad\" stuck in their heads. Both saw sufficient buffs to keep up, MCH by 3.1 and AST by I want to say 3.3, but the buy-in from the players just wasn't there. SE's hand was forced, such that in order to get people to actually give the new jobs a shot, they had to over-buff them. \n\nMidas was designed to super-emphasize burst damage, while also making sure to kick Bard to the ground and stomp it while it was down at every opportunity. At the same time Hypercharge was buffed through the stratosphere, and the results were predictable. Bard was considered garbage tier and everyone wanted a Machinist instead. \n\nIt was so bad that SE had to address it in 3.3, except that they have a policy of not nerfing things, so they buffed Bard instead. And not even in a way that was targeted at its biggest Midas issues - just arbitrary potency gains on its DoTs and such. Bard became less-good than MCH but at least okay to have in your group.\n\nThen it was AST's turn. By 3.4, AST's Balance was raised to +20% damage, they could redraw (an always-different card) on every draw, and their healing was more than up to snuff versus a WHM. Again, predictable outcomes, except for the punt - Creator is too easy for gaps in job performance to matter for anything short of speedruns.\n\nWhich is good, because people also figured out that DRG-NIN-MCH-BRD is by far the strongest DPS comp - all four increase other party members' damage while SMN, BLM and MNK do not. Of course, the rest of that comp is AST-SCH-WAR-DRK, because PLD still deals less damage and A12S is hilariously thick with magic tank busters. But again, doesn't really really matter. Having a PLD is maybe the one thing that could make a clear notably harder early on, but naturally that's well past now.\n\nObviously SE knows this, and has some manner of plan for how to design their jobs better with regards to new jobs, raid dps buffs and so on come SB. Judging by HW, I expect that they'll do a fine job or at least a sensible attempt to deal with all these known issues. \n\nWhat will likely happen instead are new kinds of problems, or the revival of previously-solved ones, that weren't so predictable. Oh and also, SAM and RDM will probably err on the side of \"overpowered\" this time, to avoid the MCH debacle, and that error could definitely come to fruition.\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492471001.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Gordias, SE decided that for the next their they&amp;#39;d focus on challenging mechanics, rather than on tight DPS/heal/gear checks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And such was Midas - the DPS checks were non-trivial, but readily cleared at starting gear (crafted i220 was available on release) save for A8S, which was still gear gated.

Bard became less-good than MCH but at least okay to have in your group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it was AST&amp;#39;s turn. By 3.4, AST&amp;#39;s Balance was raised to +20% damage, they could redraw (an always-different card) on every draw, and their healing was more than up to snuff versus a WHM. Again, predictable outcomes, except for the punt - Creator is too easy for gaps in job performance to matter for anything short of speedruns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is good, because people also figured out that DRG-NIN-MCH-BRD is by far the strongest DPS comp - all four increase other party members&amp;#39; damage while SMN, BLM and MNK do not. Of course, the rest of that comp is AST-SCH-WAR-DRK, because PLD still deals less damage and A12S is hilariously thick with magic tank busters. But again, doesn&amp;#39;t really really matter. Having a PLD is maybe the one thing that could make a clear notably harder early on, but naturally that&amp;#39;s well past now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously SE knows this, and has some manner of plan for how to design their jobs better with regards to new jobs, raid dps buffs and so on come SB. Judging by HW, I expect that they&amp;#39;ll do a fine job or at least a sensible attempt to deal with all these known issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What will likely happen instead are new kinds of problems, or the revival of previously-solved ones, that weren&amp;#39;t so predictable. Oh and also, SAM and RDM will probably err on the side of &amp;quot;overpowered&amp;quot; this time, to avoid the MCH debacle, and that error could definitely come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dgeai7b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492499619.0, "created_utc": 1492470819.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 100}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yw5h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeng8f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "soulsociety666", "parent_id": "t1_dgemnkr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He's a youtube/twitch streamer.
