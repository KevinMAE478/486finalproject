As I&amp;#39;m typically a nice person, I said &amp;quot;oh lets just do it&amp;quot; and we started, got to like 5% and wiped, only one person seemed a bit confused on mechanics, so it seemed like &amp;quot;Oh I know who the bonus is now, we almost had it lets keep going.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proceed to wipe for an entire lockout with a lot of 2-3% wipe bullshit.
