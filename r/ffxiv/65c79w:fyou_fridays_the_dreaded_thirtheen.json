FUCK YOU YOU STUPID FUCKING ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LAB PROFESSOR.  THE CLASS AVERAGE ON THIS EXAM LAST SEMESTER WAS A THIRTY GODDAMNED THREE, AND I BET THE ONE I JUST TOOK IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE FUCKING SAME.  WHY?  SURE, YES, I REMEMBER LDA&amp;#39;S A THING, BUT SINCE ORGO 2 ISN&amp;#39;T A PREREQ FOR THIS, AND WE DIDN&amp;#39;T USE IT AT ALL IN ANY OF THE LABS WE&amp;#39;VE DONE, SO WHAT THE EVERLOVING TITTYFUCKING BATSHIT CRAZY CHRIST ON A POGO STICK WAS IT DOING ON THE FUCKING EXAM?  NO I DON&amp;#39;T REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.  DOESN&amp;#39;T FUCKING HELP THAT IT WAS PART OF AN IR SPECTRO PROBLEM FOR WHICH YOU GAVE US NEITHER AN IR CHART OR A FUCKING REFERENCE FOR ANY OF THE OTHER IR CHARTS THAT YOU DID ACTUALLY DEIGN TO PUT ON, WITH ERASED OUT PEAKS TOO, YOU LAZY FUCK.  YES, I SAW THAT, AND SO DID EVERYONE ELSE.  JUST FIND THE IR FOR WHAT YOU WANT.  NIST YOU LAZY BITCH, IT&amp;#39;S NOT EVEN HARD.  AND FUCK YOU ESPECIALLY FOR THE FIRST FUCKING PROBLEM BEING STRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENT OF REAGENTS.  THAT WASN&amp;#39;T PART OF THE DEAL.  I&amp;#39;VE NEVER BEEN CLOSER IN MY LIFE TO JUST WRITING FUCK YOU ON THE FRONT OF THE EXAM AND WALKING OUT.  AS IT WAS, THE FIRST AND LAST PROBLEMS WERE FUCKING BLANK.  OK.  THINK THAT PART&amp;#39;S DONE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHERE AM I?  OH, RIGHT, THE FFXIV SUB.  LET&amp;#39;S DO SOME TOPICAL THINGS TO RAGE AT THEN.  MY EB DELETED HER CHARACTER AND HER ALTS A FEW DAYS AGO.  SOME KIND OF REALLY COOL THING HAD COME UP AND I GUESS SHE COULDN&amp;#39;T TEAR HERSELF AWAY WITHOUT DELETING HER CHARACTERS TO GO DO LIFE.  FAIR ENOUGH, DELETED MY CHARACTER IN FFXI FOR A SIMILAR REASON.  BUT GODDAMNIT.  SHE SENT ME A BEAUTIFUL GOODBYE LETTER SINCE I WAS IN CLASS (SERIOUSLY FUCK YOU THIS WEEK COLLEGE) WHEN SHE LOGGED ON FOR THE LAST TIME, BUT DIDN&amp;#39;T TELL ANYONE ELSE SHE WAS LEAVING.  SO THAT WAS FUN, GETTING TO TELL EVERYONE SHE&amp;#39;D QUIT.  LIKE, NO, SHE&amp;#39;S NOT COMING BACK FOR STORMBLOOD, SHE DELETED HER CHARACTERS.  YES HER ALTS TOO.  YES I KNOW IT SUCKS BUDDY, SHE WAS MY EB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND NOW FOR SOME ACTUAL GAME THINGS.  I ONLY PLAY BLM IN A10S, AND, LIKE DAMNED NEAR EVERY OTHER BLM, I LINE UP TO START ON ONE SIDE OF THE MIDDLE BUTTON, JUST A WEE TAD BEHIND IT.  GREAT SPOT FOR SPREAD.  SO WHY THE FUCK DO YOU IDIOTS KEEP LITERALLY CHARGING INTO ME AND THEN STACKING ON ME DURING SPREAD.  FOR FUCK&amp;#39;S SAKE LEY LINES IS STILL UP AND IT&amp;#39;S DAMNED NEAR THE SAME SIZE OF THE BLAST.  ALSO A10S.

IF YOU WON&amp;#39;T OR CAN&amp;#39;T DO IT, THEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE.  AND FOR FUCK&amp;#39;S SAKE USE YOUR FUCKING BRAINS.  IF HE&amp;#39;S AT 4 FUCKING PERCENT AND I TELL YOUR BRINK OF DEATH STEREOTYPICAL FLOOR TANK ASS TO USE THE MELEE LB AND JUST FINISH THE FIGHT, DON&amp;#39;T STAND THERE DROOLING AT ME MOUTHBREATHING AND THEN SCREAM AT ME TO DO MECHANICS BECAUSE I DIDN&amp;#39;T USE THE CASTER LB ON THE ADDS.  THE FUCK SHOULDN&amp;#39;T HAVE BEEN ALIVE FOR THE ADDS.  LAST OF ALL, FRIENDLY NOTE ABOUT A10S PF.
