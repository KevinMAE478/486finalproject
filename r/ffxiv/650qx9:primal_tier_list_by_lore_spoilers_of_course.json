[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "ffxiv", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this for a bit. By my count we&amp;#39;ve met nineteen different primals, and fought eighteen of them. Based on what we know about each of them, which ones are the most powerful, and which ones are the least powerful? In thinking about this, I&amp;#39;m not going off the difficulty of their battles, but instead I&amp;#39;m going off what we know about them, storywise, and how they might fare against each other. Secondly, while we know that the amount of aether used to summon these primals has a strong effect on how powerful they are, I&amp;#39;m just going to be comparing them given their best known incarnations. Besides, story-wise they always mention that primals are more powerful given more crystals, but in actual fact that is mostly played out in how hard their battles actually are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given those guidelines, here is my best attempt at a list:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitions of tiers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calamity Tier: World ending, potentially. Powerful enough and dangerous enough to cause (or prevent) a calamity all on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Astral Tier: A summoning of one of these is dangerous to all of Eorzea. These are uncommonly strong primals, powerful beyond measure to what a primal should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Umbral Tier: These are typical primals. While all primals are incredibly strong, these ones fall into the normal range of a powerful foe that could decimate armies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manderville Tier: Jokes, to some degree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calamity Tier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alexander- Alexander and Bahamut could be flipped very easily, but Alexander is more powerful simply because he can manipulate time to create any reality he wanted, even stopping the calamity if possible. He was also only defeated because he chose to destroy himself, not because he needed to be defeated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bahamut- Obviously Bahamut was going to be high on this list. The definition of a calamity causing primal. Powerful enough to end the world simply by existing, and taking immense power to even chain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shinryu- We know much less about Shinryu, so it&amp;#39;s possible that Shinryu is stronger than either Bahamut or Alexander. Clearly the scions treat Shinryu like the second coming of Bahamut, and clearly Shinryu&amp;#39;s capable of immense destruction. Time will tell exactly where this will fall on the list, but this seems a safe bet for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phoenix- Phoenix was the only force strong enough to prevent the calamity, and only did an incomplete job of it. Definitely a top tier primal since it is capable of fighting against Bahamut as a near equal, and stronger than anything below it, but probably not the equal of other calamity tier primals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Astral Tier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thordan- This is where the list gets a bit hard to delineate. Thordan, thanks to Nidhogg&amp;#39;s eye, is far stronger than any primal has the right to be. Left to its own devices, Thordan would have been able to defeat the dragons single handedly, and seems unmatched in strength. Not a calamity in and of itself, but the very strongest a regular primal can be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zurvan- We don&amp;#39;t know a lot about the Warring Triad. However, I feel like I remember something saying that Zurvan was the strongest of the three, and Zurvan certainly acts like the leader of the Triad. All three of these eikons are ancient, far more powerful than the current primals, and so dangerous that the Allagans had to lock them up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sophia- Sophia could be stronger than Zurvan, potentially; she was going to be used as a nation destroying weapon, had her follower let her out of containment so that she could attack the Allagans. Moreover, she seems capable of destroying other nations as well- a loose Sophia would be a danger to just about everyone, as she would actively seek to create balance everywhere by razing the ground beneath her. I think Zurvan seems like the stronger of the two, but without more information I don&amp;#39;t know for sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sephirot- Very, strong, but the weakest of the three. Again, we don&amp;#39;t know much about him, except that he has the power to make anything, including himself, grow. That strikes me as sucking up incalcuable aether around him, which makes him a potential danger to anything in his path, but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the same threat to nations that Sophia would be or the sheer strength of Zurvan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odin- Odin is ancient, Odin never dies, Odin is the an unparalleled warrior with a final attack that can kill anything. Some might argue that Odin is the strongest in this tier, but it strikes me that Odin never does more than take on individual adventurers in the Shroud. I think Odin is clearly more powerful than a regular primal, but is probably not a match for Thordan in pure destructive power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Umbral Tier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leviathan- Leviathan&amp;#39;s summoning is a disaster for Limsa Lominsa, and one that has to be immediately dealt with. As well, Leviathan is a bigger threat than anything the WoL has fought up until this point. Not to mention it was able to twist all of Satasha into a mindless army. Leviathan is a clear and present danger the second it is summoned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Garuda- It seems clear that Garuda is the strongest of the initial three primals. Alphinaud spends what seems like days discussing how powerful Garuda is, and her control of the winds clearly makes her an immediate target. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Titan- Titan&amp;#39;s probably almost as powerful as Garuda, but I put him behind her for two reasons. First, Titan was defeated by a group of adventurers besides the WoL, while Garuda would not have fallen so easily. Secondly, Titan is a territorial primal, who protects the kobolds rather than actively attacks others. He&amp;#39;s dangerous, but not aggressive in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ramuh- I&amp;#39;m not positive how to rank Ramuh. I get the feeling that Ramuh is powerful and could be a threat if he wanted to be. But he&amp;#39;s also wise and not aggressive. As a result, Ramuh strikes me as a powerful force, but not one that requires immediate action, and not one on the same scale as Titan or Garuda. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ravana- Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, Ravana&amp;#39;s a great fighter. But that&amp;#39;s all Ravana does- he challenges the strongest challenger, and then he defeats them, and then he parties. When Ravana is summoned, he isn&amp;#39;t treated as an immediate danger, but rather a random nuisance Alphinaud and the WoL have to deal with on their way to their real mission. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bismarck- Maybe Bismarck should be higher on this list. But of all of these primals, Bismarck&amp;#39;s the only one that people just kind of let exist. Bismarck is a threat to the peoples of the Sea of Clouds, but not an immediately life-ending one. Instead, Bismarck&amp;#39;s more of a natural disaster. Maybe Bismarck&amp;#39;d be higher up if it had the intelligence to focus its power, but as an uncontrolled flying whale, it doesn&amp;#39;t create any immediate crises. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ifrit- Ifrit seems like he&amp;#39;s dangerous because he tempers people and because he drains the land of aether, not because he&amp;#39;s that powerful himself. Even when summoned, Ifrit doesn&amp;#39;t immediately imperil Uldah, but instead he&amp;#39;s a nuisance to them. One that costs lives from time to time, granted, but not one that is an existential threat to the kingdom. Ifrit is a danger to travelers, not to nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shiva- Shiva&amp;#39;s my favourite primal, but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s actually that strong of a primal. First of all, she&amp;#39;s summoned by the resolve of one person, not by an entire beast tribe. This means that, by definition, she&amp;#39;s going to be weaker. Secondly, Shiva spends her time in the narrative getting defeated by Ravana and by the empire. She&amp;#39;s strong in that she&amp;#39;s a junior partner to the WoL, but she&amp;#39;s not really a match for most other primals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manderville Tier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;King Moggle Mog- Moggle Mog is close in power to the Umbral Tier, but the way that almost no one in the narrative treats him seriously suggests he isn&amp;#39;t that strong. Moreover, his main strength is coordinating the Mogglesguard, not actually doing much himself. It&amp;#39;s telling that his quest even makes fun of him by calling him &amp;quot;probably a primal?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enkidu- Obviously Enkidu&amp;#39;s barely a primal, and pretty ignored except as a punchline to a joke. Enkidu&amp;#39;s not much more than a glorified dungeon boss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?
