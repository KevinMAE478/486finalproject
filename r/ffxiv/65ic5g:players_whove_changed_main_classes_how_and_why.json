This was also around the time the various &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/DYwzmDP\"&gt;job discussion discords&lt;/a&gt; were popping up, so I lurked in the bard Discord a lot and asked lots of questions about edge cases, listened to what the top bards were saying, and studied their FFLogs runs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about three weeks I took BRD into our weekly raid and we immediately started skipping phases we&amp;#39;d never skipped before despite me making mistakes, which was encouraging so I kept playing it.  Eventually I decided that I was enjoying it more than I thought I would, and I starting to become pretty decent on it to boot.  And since casters were meme status this tier, BRD became my new main soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll probably swap again in Stormblood since I kinda want to go back to caster, but it&amp;#39;ll probably be SMN or RDM instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dgatn5s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492301856.0, "created_utc": 1492273056.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ic5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatq10", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dootdootington", "parent_id": "t3_65ic5g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I first started as a thermaturge.
