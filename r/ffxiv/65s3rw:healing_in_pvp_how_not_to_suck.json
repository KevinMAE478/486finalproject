Remember Purify can be used on any friendly target, including other alliances\u200b' members in Frontline!\n- AST Noct sect is the best shit. Don't let people convince you otherwise before you try it yourself and judge it's potential with your own playstyle! A crit instant shield can save your DPS's life. Of course, as any healing mechanic, it's heavily affected by how YOU play with it. Works for some, not for others.\n- Ewer card is friendly. If you're in Feast, there is NO downtime to regen MP aside from dying. Buffed Ewers can be point turners when your and your heal mate MP regen/Mana Draw are not quite out of cooldown yet. Specially helpful for that WHM friend. Of course that's on 8v8 case, which is by far my favorite option.\n- Try not to spread cards often. I feel like the shitty potency they get plus the fact that cards in PvP are even more situational than they already are on PvE makes it a waste of good cards. Give them time or potency rather than using the AoE Royal Road.\n- Lighspeed is great for culling time, save this shit for it if the enemy team seems coordinated. If they're not then you should win before it even happens. Celestial Opposition is Lightspeed's best friend, also.\n- As any healer, it's a good idea to abuse that \"Fall Back!\" chat line if your dudes seem to have tunnel-visioned into the enemy spawn in Feast. That is NEVER a good idea, 9 out of 10 times they'll push you back hard unless they're already about to lose. Lost a solid amount of matches due to enemy DPS spamming all the LBs right there and your team has hardly anywhere to run to.\n- Don't save Swiftcast. Use it to insta heal, good for AoEs in my opinion. The cooldown is short enough that you can use it as a regular buff, you ain't using PvE raise anyway.\n- If you're getting focused on, hit your best \"Oh Shit Button\": Attunement. Make sure you won't die to DoTs, tho, they will still deal damage while it's up. This is great for baiting the enemy DPS's big hits, they'll think you're vulnerable before noticing you're practically unkillable.\n- Don't panic if you're the only healer in your 8 man party. It's perfectly doable if your teammates are conservative of their HP when possible. Plus, even if you lose, it's the best way to learn how to get good at it!\n\nIf I can think of other general tips or common mistakes I see others doing that have not been addressed here, I'll surely be back with them (: Focused a lot on AST because that is what I personally enjoy and use most for PvP, but I've done it plenty on WHM and SCH. Might bring some pointers for these later if no one else does.\nAnd remember: PvP is all about suffering through immense anger and disappointment peaks, but it's also about having fun. If you've been at it for a bit and\u200b it doesn't\u200b entertain you more than it makes you want to throw your monitor/TV out the window then take a break. Breaks are friendly!

The cooldown is short enough that you can use it as a regular buff, you ain&amp;#39;t using PvE raise anyway.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#39;re getting focused on, hit your best &amp;quot;Oh Shit Button&amp;quot;: Attunement. Make sure you won&amp;#39;t die to DoTs, tho, they will still deal damage while it&amp;#39;s up. This is great for baiting the enemy DPS&amp;#39;s big hits, they&amp;#39;ll think you&amp;#39;re vulnerable before noticing you&amp;#39;re practically unkillable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t panic if you&amp;#39;re the only healer in your 8 man party. It&amp;#39;s perfectly doable if your teammates are conservative of their HP when possible. Plus, even if you lose, it&amp;#39;s the best way to learn how to get good at it!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I can think of other general tips or common mistakes I see others doing that have not been addressed here, I&amp;#39;ll surely be back with them (: Focused a lot on AST because that is what I personally enjoy and use most for PvP, but I&amp;#39;ve done it plenty on WHM and SCH. Might bring some pointers for these later if no one else does.\nAnd remember: PvP is all about suffering through immense anger and disappointment peaks, but it&amp;#39;s also about having fun. If you&amp;#39;ve been at it for a bit and\u200b it doesn&amp;#39;t\u200b entertain you more than it makes you want to throw your monitor/TV out the window then take a break. Breaks are friendly!
