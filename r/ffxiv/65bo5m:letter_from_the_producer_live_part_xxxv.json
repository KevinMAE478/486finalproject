Think about it this way: player A: \"I have all day to play this game and I like to take my time and enjoy dungeons. But they're so boring it's just 3 bosses with trash in between. I still do them but I am not a fan.\" Player B: \"due to my busy life I only have an hour to play a day to get through all the dailies and stuff. Dungeons take too long and I want to get through them as fast as I can to get to the next thing. I appreciate how streamlined the newer dungeons are, I get to speed through them as fast as I can.\"\n\nYoshi P has the dilemma of who do they cater towards? Only one can 'win'. Yoshi's team is going for appeasing player B because if they appeased player A they lose out on B's sub. Tho you could ask why not just 2 bosses? Or 1? Make them take less than the 20 minutes they already do. Sure but they wouldn't have the right dungeon feel. So is going for player B a good thing? Not really, but it's not a bad thing either. Dungeons still have a challenge. They don't make the challenge for you, like raids, you have to make them yourself. Such as how fast can I run through this dungeon? Or how many mobs can I pull before I get fucked? Granted many don't agree with those challenges but they are the current meta. I think dungeons are fun when I'm trying to speed through them as fast as I can. Others might not. \n\nBut one things for sure, if they make dungeons too complicated, people are going to get upset too. Like a cool jump puzzle would be immensely fun, but that could waste like 10 minutes if someone sucks at jumping. Or result in harassment in the form of kicking players who don't do it right the first time by those that only want to speed run. Making a dungeon with multiple routes and maybe even multiple bosses would be so cool but like people only going right in the last room of the one dungeon I forgot the name of, the partner to neverreap. You can go left but why is it that nobody ever goes left? It'll be the same with branching paths. People will find the most optimal way to go and neglect the other way entirely. Wasted development time! That time designing that boss that no one ever fights could have been spent on designing a trial or another dungeon. There's only a few bits of content nobody does and they were experimental. So yeah, that's the dungeon dilemma of ffxiv. There's no clear cut solution to it. So I don't fault the team for doing what they do. I just don't run dungeons ever. There's plenty of other things to do in the game. Dungeons aren't even a tenth of what you can do.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right but it is less a case of Yoshi P and team being uncreative more so the underlying problem of game design. Think about it this way: player A: &amp;quot;I have all day to play this game and I like to take my time and enjoy dungeons. But they&amp;#39;re so boring it&amp;#39;s just 3 bosses with trash in between. I still do them but I am not a fan.&amp;quot; Player B: &amp;quot;due to my busy life I only have an hour to play a day to get through all the dailies and stuff. Dungeons take too long and I want to get through them as fast as I can to get to the next thing. I appreciate how streamlined the newer dungeons are, I get to speed through them as fast as I can.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yoshi P has the dilemma of who do they cater towards? Only one can &amp;#39;win&amp;#39;. Yoshi&amp;#39;s team is going for appeasing player B because if they appeased player A they lose out on B&amp;#39;s sub. Tho you could ask why not just 2 bosses? Or 1? Make them take less than the 20 minutes they already do. Sure but they wouldn&amp;#39;t have the right dungeon feel. So is going for player B a good thing? Not really, but it&amp;#39;s not a bad thing either. Dungeons still have a challenge. They don&amp;#39;t make the challenge for you, like raids, you have to make them yourself. Such as how fast can I run through this dungeon? Or how many mobs can I pull before I get fucked? Granted many don&amp;#39;t agree with those challenges but they are the current meta. I think dungeons are fun when I&amp;#39;m trying to speed through them as fast as I can. Others might not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one things for sure, if they make dungeons too complicated, people are going to get upset too. Like a cool jump puzzle would be immensely fun, but that could waste like 10 minutes if someone sucks at jumping. Or result in harassment in the form of kicking players who don&amp;#39;t do it right the first time by those that only want to speed run. Making a dungeon with multiple routes and maybe even multiple bosses would be so cool but like people only going right in the last room of the one dungeon I forgot the name of, the partner to neverreap. You can go left but why is it that nobody ever goes left? It&amp;#39;ll be the same with branching paths. People will find the most optimal way to go and neglect the other way entirely. Wasted development time! That time designing that boss that no one ever fights could have been spent on designing a trial or another dungeon. There&amp;#39;s only a few bits of content nobody does and they were experimental. So yeah, that&amp;#39;s the dungeon dilemma of ffxiv. There&amp;#39;s no clear cut solution to it. So I don&amp;#39;t fault the team for doing what they do. I just don&amp;#39;t run dungeons ever. There&amp;#39;s plenty of other things to do in the game.
