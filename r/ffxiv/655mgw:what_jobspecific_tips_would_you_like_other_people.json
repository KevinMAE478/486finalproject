You will make mistakes, and the best thing you can do is pick yourself back up and learn what you did wrong and the beauty in that is from these mistakes, you can learn to become a better healer, one who can both keep everyone from death and support their party at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg7wyux", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492134149.0, "created_utc": 1492105349.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rwkl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Raven123x", "parent_id": "t1_dg7pw1z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "ah you're right.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ah you&amp;#39;re right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg7rwkl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128761.0, "created_utc": 1492099961.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7pw1z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yashimata", "parent_id": "t1_dg7onzh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; another ~~healer~~ WHM/SCH reminder\n\nAST doesn't have Eye.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;another &lt;del&gt;healer&lt;/del&gt; WHM/SCH reminder&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AST doesn&amp;#39;t have Eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg7pw1z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126618.0, "created_utc": 1492097818.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg89v50", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stikxs", "parent_id": "t1_dg821sb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I keep eye and virus on my blm as I've been leveling it!

Now you&amp;#39;re on 5 stacks with no fell cleave and no fracture - a bigger DPs loss than just hitting the fracture as normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On some parts is totally fine - the beginning of a12s definitely springs to mind once your group hits the 80% threshold consistently you can definitely optimize there down to the GCD, but on others like adds it can be a little more precise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case the only tip i wanted to get across is that - in general - the maths supports more fell cleaves rather than more fractures. But there&amp;#39;s exceptions and minor optimizations of course like in the examples you give.

This is especially bad for both dark knight and paladin since their hate combos are the weakest combo they have. It&amp;#39;s more than just that for a dark knight since you are forcing them to power slash and lose mp generation, at least moreso than they would outside of your enmity from dps. By no means does thos mean you shouldn&amp;#39;t use BB, but you should always be aware of the parties enmity during any given encounter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continuing in this vein, shade walker and smoke screen can be used much more often than in an opener Ninjas.  If you have buffs coming up soon and no tank swap, if theres no reason for the tank to be in Tank stance, or if that one ass in the party wont use quelling when they get an opener refresh halfway through a fight, you can and should use these skills to help the party get more dps. They aren&amp;#39;t doing anything sitting on the hotbar after your opener so please use them more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At work on phone, so formatting is probably terrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg87qu3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492145874.0, "created_utc": 1492117074.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8d1ti", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NatsumeHashiba", "parent_id": "t3_655mgw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For Ranged job/classes:\n\n\nPlease try to park or be in range of your healers AOE heals.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ranged job/classes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please try to park or be in range of your healers AOE heals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg8d1ti", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492152552.0, "created_utc": 1492123752.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg80biv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bro4dway", "parent_id": "t3_655mgw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "DRK: Do NOT attempt to play DRK the same way you play WAR.\n\nExamples:\n\n1.

You turn into a BLM turret for  the duration of dreadwyrm and you have to get the entire bufftime +deathflare off or you shouldn&amp;#39;t have popped it, but unlike BLM you arent either 30secs at worst, 15 secs at best away from getting back to your &amp;#39;big damage&amp;#39; mode, and even then mitigated by things like fire 3 and thunderstorm procs, you can be a whole minute or longer if your spreading out your festers, forcing you to use ruin 3&amp;#39;s outside dreadwyrm, hurting your dps and your mana pool. During which you can only have regular dots up for the whole time until you can spend your next set of aetherflow. So messing up when you pop dreadwyrm not only affects your damage potential for a lost dreadwyrm, but has a much longer lasting affect on your potential dps for up to a few minutes after messing it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg88jin", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146813.0, "created_utc": 1492118013.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8bh2v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bakemi", "parent_id": "t3_655mgw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "dragoons, practice using Elusive Jump, it can and will save you.\n\nAnd there is nothing more satisfying than a clutch Elusive Jump.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;dragoons, practice using Elusive Jump, it can and will save you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there is nothing more satisfying than a clutch Elusive Jump.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "name": "t1_dg8bh2v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492150471.0, "created_utc": 1492121671.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mgw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7xdu9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "captain_moniker", "parent_id": "t3_655mgw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ffxiv", "controversiality": 0, "body": "DRG: just because the little marching outline appears on Ring of Thorns doesn't mean you have to use it when fighting a single target.
