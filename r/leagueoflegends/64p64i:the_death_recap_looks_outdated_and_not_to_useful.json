That's the tricky part.\n\nLet's look at some very, very simple Scenarios.  [A]= attacker, [D]=dying champion.\n\n[D] has 100 HP.  [A] auto attacks and deals 200 damage.\n\nSo our code could look something like this\n\n    If [D].health-[A].attack&lt;0 {\n            D.dead=True;\n    } else {\n            D.dead=False;\n    }\n\n\nAll the game knows at this point is that the [D] is or is not dead.  At no point do we even save who attacked, how much damage they did, where the damage came from, etc.\n\nTo do this compounds the problem exponentially.  Let's just try to record some damage\n\n\n    If [D].health-[A].attack&lt;0 {\n            D.dead=True;\n            D.KilledByWho=[A].Champion;\n            D.KilledByWhat=[A].Attack.Type;\n            D.LastHitDamage=[A].attack;\n            D.DamageType=[A].Attack.Type\n    } else {\n            D.dead=False\n    }\n\nOk, so that's neat.  But that only stores the last guy who attacked.  In a teamfight, there are many people fighting, and damage from a lot of places.\n\nSo instead you have to end up recording all that information, and that becomes difficult.  You have to create a list of who attacked you, what they attacked with, how much damage they did, what kind of damage (AD, Magic, hybrid, true, etc.).  This whole thing then needs to be stored.  And for how long?  The last 10 seconds?  Last 15?  Maybe all damage taken if damage is taken within **x** seconds of the last bit of damage taken?  Well if I'm sieging a turret, I could take damage for almost a minute or two straight.  Do we want to record all that poke?\n\nThere are **many** variables that have to be considered, and a lot of that is predicated on not just what information is being produced, but on what is being saved.\n\nIt's not as simple as **just** recording information and summing it.", "edited": 1491930802.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;then there shouldn&amp;#39;t a be any problem to display those numbers..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You assume the accumulation of the numbers exists.  That&amp;#39;s the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at some very, very simple Scenarios.  [A]= attacker, [D]=dying champion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[D] has 100 HP.  [A] auto attacks and deals 200 damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So our code could look something like this&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;If [D].health-[A].attack&amp;lt;0 {\n        D.dead=True;\n} else {\n        D.dead=False;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the game knows at this point is that the [D] is or is not dead.  At no point do we even save who attacked, how much damage they did, where the damage came from, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do this compounds the problem exponentially.  Let&amp;#39;s just try to record some damage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;If [D].health-[A].attack&amp;lt;0 {\n        D.dead=True;\n        D.KilledByWho=[A].Champion;\n        D.KilledByWhat=[A].Attack.Type;\n        D.LastHitDamage=[A].attack;\n        D.DamageType=[A].Attack.Type\n} else {\n        D.dead=False\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that&amp;#39;s neat.  But that only stores the last guy who attacked.  In a teamfight, there are many people fighting, and damage from a lot of places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead you have to end up recording all that information, and that becomes difficult.  You have to create a list of who attacked you, what they attacked with, how much damage they did, what kind of damage (AD, Magic, hybrid, true, etc.).  This whole thing then needs to be stored.  And for how long?  The last 10 seconds?  Last 15?  Maybe all damage taken if damage is taken within &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; seconds of the last bit of damage taken?  Well if I&amp;#39;m sieging a turret, I could take damage for almost a minute or two straight.  Do we want to record all that poke?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; variables that have to be considered, and a lot of that is predicated on not just what information is being produced, but on what is being saved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as simple as &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; recording information and summing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg4frmo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954384.0, "created_utc": 1491925584.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p64i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4l3tp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Datkif", "parent_id": "t1_dg4bd1r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Their excuse is that fixing the recap would be far too much work.
