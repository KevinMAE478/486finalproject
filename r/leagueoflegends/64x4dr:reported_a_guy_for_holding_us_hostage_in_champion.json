Suck it up and don&amp;#39;t dodge so you can report instead of promoting this behavior.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many people just plainly saying that they aren&amp;#39;t wrong to say that. Of course, they aren&amp;#39;t wrong to say that. But the OP is showing and even says that they really need to find a better way to communicate the whole issue because they seem to convey the lack of interest in resolving this long-term controversy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To people asking me what then is the solution or that no one should dodge anyways, I think we all know that dodging is not the long-term solution and that we are not yet anywhere near in our current games to find the real solution. But the point of this post is to bring awareness to the fact that the Riot&amp;#39;s auto-(or non-auto) response to the issue does not seem to showcase any signs of  immediate resolution or future improvement to the whole issue. The OP clearly writes in his post that he believes that&amp;#39;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: Riot Player Support has given an official answer to accommodate the current situation.

Maybe someone had to AFK five minutes in. Maybe someone was holding the lobby hostage. Maybe Riot was trying to discourage toxic players from feeding with the mindset that &amp;#39;you&amp;#39;re trapped in here too!&amp;#39; and that they might as well play to win, but it clearly isn&amp;#39;t working if they can&amp;#39;t monitor the lobby. The worst offenders will gladly troll nine other people if they have to listen to him for twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Surrender at 20 rule is anti-fun. It means that if I get into a game where my bot and mid lane just gets rolled with 0-12 between them at ten minutes, then we&amp;#39;re just stuck here with the slow grind to death. Of course in higher elo and with proper team coordination, our opponent team of silver scrubs could always throw and give us chances to win. But we won&amp;#39;t take advantage of it. Of course we won&amp;#39;t. We&amp;#39;re a team that went 0-12 in ten minutes, and you think we&amp;#39;re going to rally around an out of position splitpusher and then take smart objectives together for a miraculous comeback? Push off mate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a saying that no happy marriage ever ended in divorce. Of course we didn&amp;#39;t want to surrender at ten minutes in. But this arranged marriage of five just doesn&amp;#39;t work out sometimes, and I&amp;#39;m not sure why you think &lt;em&gt;more time together&lt;/em&gt; is going to help us out with this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg5whpp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034810.0, "created_utc": 1492006010.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x4dr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg63iwm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheEssentialNemca", "parent_id": "t3_64x4dr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Seriously fuck auto fill, remove that shit.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously fuck auto fill, remove that shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg63iwm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042731.0, "created_utc": 1492013931.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x4dr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg63xsj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Meanie40", "parent_id": "t3_64x4dr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You know what I call tasks someone else asks me to perform that I do not wish to perform?

In the end when you dc in champ select it is litterally the same thing.
