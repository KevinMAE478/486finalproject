There are a lot of people upset about the result of this competitive ruling, and given the history of such rulings, such anger is no surprise.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I want to do here is &lt;strong&gt;explain why Tainted Minds avoided the death penalty&lt;/strong&gt; and the other nuances to Riot&amp;#39;s position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the big one.  How is this not dramatically worse than Renegades? This seems indefensible on the surface; as gamers we can little imagine a hell worse than a summer without a palatable PC or air conditioning, much less everything else we&amp;#39;ve seen slung around for the past months on this sub.  Moreover, with all the vitriol evident in the communications going on, there&amp;#39;s a distinct lack of care for professionalism especially on behalf of Tainted Minds, who should be setting the tone here.  It thus &lt;strong&gt;feels&lt;/strong&gt; way worse than what happened in Renegades&amp;#39; case.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the relevant bits from the ruling as to why &lt;strong&gt;Riot didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; this&lt;/strong&gt; to be worse.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tainted Minds offered to move the players, coach and manager to different housing (of their choice) as early as January 13, but the team declined the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the house was a rental, many of the failings were on the part of the landlord. We reviewed emails from representatives of Tainted Minds to its landlord\u2019s representatives throughout December, January and February, including multiple emails seeking permission for improvements made to the house at the team\u2019s expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At no point do we believe that the players\u2019 safety was in jeopardy. We have heard directly from the players involved they did not feel unsafe or at risk in the house, and communications between players and Riot OCE team members at the time confirmed the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the short form translation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tainted Minds isn&amp;#39;t being held responsible for shitty living conditions because the &lt;strong&gt;team refused to move and they couldn&amp;#39;t take independent action in the current location&lt;/strong&gt; (because that&amp;#39;s how rental properties work).  All the living condition shit thus is gone from the ruling.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you have a shitty rental, you either need to move or get the landlord to buy into making things better.  There&amp;#39;s no third option; that&amp;#39;s not how leases work.  So, all of the stories we&amp;#39;ve had about how shitty the living conditions were - no matter how awful they&amp;#39;ve seemed - don&amp;#39;t matter because from Riot&amp;#39;s perspective, the team didn&amp;#39;t buy into the realistically available solution to the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the rest of people are upset with, and probably the root cause of why Riot didn&amp;#39;t kick Tainted Minds for being unpleasant and seeming to not have the best of intentions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s also important to state that breaking non-disclosure agreements and releasing personal information publicly, including unredacted email addresses, often has serious legal implications and consequences. Even where the trust between players, coaches, managers and organizations break down, the violation of NDAs and the release of personal and/or confidential information should never be the answer to the problem. In the future, we\u2019ll be taking NDA violations into consideration within rulings\u2014whether from the player or the org side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of legalese bullshit that basically says &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;don&amp;#39;t give out other people&amp;#39;s personal information&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;; certainly not in an attempt to shame them publicly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important distinction isn&amp;#39;t to not go public with problems, but to not be releasing things that are supposed to be private or personally identifying.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You cannot do this shit.&lt;/em&gt;  If you are going to post evidence and chatlogs, it needs to be appropriately redacted; you don&amp;#39;t know what some crazy on the internet is going to do with someone else&amp;#39;s personal information.  &lt;strong&gt;You cannot fuck this up.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at this case, it&amp;#39;s not hard to imagine how the players and the org could have presented their cases without violating any NDAs or releasing personal information. Neither would have lost any credibility in their public arguments, they would have gained no less sympathy for being more professional in their delivery.  This is a simple display of childish irresponsibility from both the org and the players, and a very dangerous one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t Riot discounting the issues of what happened here because someone made a public brouhaha.&lt;/strong&gt;  Riot would also like players, where possible,  to use internal resources to resolve problems, but that&amp;#39;s an aside and didn&amp;#39;t effect this particular ruling outside of Riot&amp;#39;s internal changes for the future.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what does that leave Riot with here?  Riot can adjudicate based on what is in their rulebooks and effectively what they feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their rulebook says they &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; come down on Tainted Minds for the payment and computer issues.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their feelings determine how hard.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Riot determined that** while the organization was clearly a bag of dicks, the players weren&amp;#39;t acting in good faith themselves**.  If the players had conducted themselves appropriately and in earnest worked with the organization&amp;#39;s less than stellar attempts to improve the situation, Riot would have probably thrown the book at the organization.  However, you can&amp;#39;t reasonably expect Riot to do this when the players are refusing to cooperate with even backhanded attempts to make things better seemingly out of spite.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a lesson for anyone else who may ever be at any organization&amp;#39;s mercy in any walk of life, learn the lesson now: &lt;strong&gt;you cannot do this.&lt;/strong&gt; This is why you need to cover your ass, keep your own side clean, and roll with bad situations with your head held high until the people trying to screw you thoroughly hang themselves.  If Riot looks at those chatlogs and Faffsy is a paragon of professionalism while Tainted Minds continually behaved as they did, and the team made a good faith effort at going along with the organization&amp;#39;s half-hearted attempts to improve the situation, then this ruling would have been entirely one-sided in their favor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it seems like an injustice given that we&amp;#39;re talking about a bunch of kids that frankly aren&amp;#39;t old enough to know better or be reasonably expected to have the levels of personal restraint necessary to behave this professionally, that&amp;#39;s not good enough when that level of un-professionalism is effectively what you are trying to crucify your organization for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will probably get downvoted into oblivion because I&amp;#39;m not chewing into Riot here.   I&amp;#39;m not doing that not because I think Riot handled this perfectly or is otherwise above judgement.  There&amp;#39;s another couple thousand words to be written on Riot&amp;#39;s problems, but that&amp;#39;s a separate issue that transcends this ruling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tearing into Riot here would be a bit like being angry about our legal system in a discussion about the merits of a particular criminal case.  Yes, we may know the system itself is flawed; Riot even acknowledges as much here and we all know there&amp;#39;s more flaws to the system than they show any evidence of grasping themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, you don&amp;#39;t have a ton of standing to complain about a flawed system when you didn&amp;#39;t even reach the bare minimum within that system to achieve your desired result.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR:  Yes, Tainted Minds was awful.

I'd then set an acceptable deadline as to what the overall solution would be chosen given the lack of progress seat to that point. \n\nIf I were handed a counter-offer of solutions that didn't meet requirements, I'd explain in writing why those solutions wouldn't work, would yield an competitive disadvantage, and attempt to renegotiate.  If relevant, I'd highlight relevant contractual obligations.  \n\nIf the organization made it clear they were unwilling to budge and offered only solutions that fell short of achieving everything, I'd pass on my grudging acceptance of the attempted solution, noting that I didn't consider the grievances fully addressed and an expectation that a full solution would be forthcoming.  \n\nIf through any of this process the organization seemed to imply they were less than willing to be cooperative, I'd express my concerns that actions of theirs seemed to indicate that they weren't aggressively enough pursuing solutions despite being handed them, pre-packaged for them, and this indicated unwillingness to meet their contractual obligations.  I'd express my regrets at this and that we'd be in touch with Riot Games and legal advice should these concerns not be addressed in earnest.  \n\nIf I couldnt get traction with Riot, I'd contact both Riot and Tainted Minds with my full case and the full history, requesting a solution with the understanding that we'd go public with the situation if we didn't feel our concerns were being adequately addressed.  I'd set a deadline of when I expected to hear back.  \n\nIf the deadline came and went, I'd send Riot and Tainted Minds a copy of our public statement and give them a final 24 hours to respond.

Since the issues are high priority and contractual in nature, I&amp;#39;d follow up the informal meeting with written communication in an email and track each issue&amp;#39;s progress, with deadlines set as to when I expected to see specific, deliverable progress on each issue.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d then follow up before the deadlines to make sure progress was being made, or to register concerns in writing that progress didn&amp;#39;t seem to be occurring.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the deadline passed, I&amp;#39;d register my dissatisfaction in writing, and request alternate solutions, offering various options the organization could pursue that met our requirements, researched and pre-packaged to simplify.  I&amp;#39;d then set an acceptable deadline as to what the overall solution would be chosen given the lack of progress seat to that point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were handed a counter-offer of solutions that didn&amp;#39;t meet requirements, I&amp;#39;d explain in writing why those solutions wouldn&amp;#39;t work, would yield an competitive disadvantage, and attempt to renegotiate.  If relevant, I&amp;#39;d highlight relevant contractual obligations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the organization made it clear they were unwilling to budge and offered only solutions that fell short of achieving everything, I&amp;#39;d pass on my grudging acceptance of the attempted solution, noting that I didn&amp;#39;t consider the grievances fully addressed and an expectation that a full solution would be forthcoming.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If through any of this process the organization seemed to imply they were less than willing to be cooperative, I&amp;#39;d express my concerns that actions of theirs seemed to indicate that they weren&amp;#39;t aggressively enough pursuing solutions despite being handed them, pre-packaged for them, and this indicated unwillingness to meet their contractual obligations.  I&amp;#39;d express my regrets at this and that we&amp;#39;d be in touch with Riot Games and legal advice should these concerns not be addressed in earnest.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I couldnt get traction with Riot, I&amp;#39;d contact both Riot and Tainted Minds with my full case and the full history, requesting a solution with the understanding that we&amp;#39;d go public with the situation if we didn&amp;#39;t feel our concerns were being adequately addressed.  I&amp;#39;d set a deadline of when I expected to hear back.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the deadline came and went, I&amp;#39;d send Riot and Tainted Minds a copy of our public statement and give them a final 24 hours to respond.  Failing this, I&amp;#39;d post to reddit and all of social media.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I would not do is be anything other than respectful and direct with Riot or Tainted Minds, nor would I leave any room whatsoever for misinterpretation in the entire process and make it abundantly clear what the status of the issues continued to be and what our current position was at any time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how i&amp;#39;d handle it if I were the manager. I have ~10-odd years on these kids, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect them to be at quite that level.  However, I would expect them to be respectful, professional, and cooperative, and we&amp;#39;ve seen enough posted publicly to see they fell short of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg82awb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492139857.0, "created_utc": 1492111057.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7z12q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VideaMon", "parent_id": "t1_dg7yqqt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What kind of solutions are the players supposed to provide?

Since the players were just as uncooperative and unprofessional as the organization, the players lacked a solid foundation to stand on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The appropriate response when you&amp;#39;re being screwed isn&amp;#39;t to stop engaging. What you want to do is tighten up your conditions to clarify communication and start documenting everything, specifically what you consider to be acceptable or not and your record of communicating as much.  In the case of the house, you have to express what you need (AC, etc) and communicate an appropriate deadline for that, and what acceptable alternatives might be and timeframes for that.  You offer concrete enough options and solutions that any response is as clear as &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; to avoid being weaseled about by shady assholes.  So, when it&amp;#39;s been two weeks and work hasn&amp;#39;t started, you demand to move by the end of the month.  You do all of this in clear, polite language, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; when your counterparties are not being clear or polite.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to demonstrate that your side was acting in good faith the entire time while showcasing where your counterparty was acting in bad faith, while offering them no justification for anything other than complete cooperation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg7ornx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125415.0, "created_utc": 1492096615.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654ust", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8jgbs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "marduk05", "parent_id": "t1_dg7mt0u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cake's own emails from TM show the list of items that were solved and in the process of being solved (slow due to having to work with a landlord, that's how leases work)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cake&amp;#39;s own emails from TM show the list of items that were solved and in the process of being solved (slow due to having to work with a landlord, that&amp;#39;s how leases work)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg8jgbs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492161228.0, "created_utc": 1492132428.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7mt0u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 45, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GentleMocker", "parent_id": "t3_654ust", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sorry, you seem like a completely intelligent and reasonable individual so I hope you won't become unnecesarily offended but I have to say this is complete bullshit.

Let's say, for once, Tainted Minds do end up getting banned. The personal friendship (which is clearly there) with the higher ups from Riot OCE will continue benefiting them, and Riot OCE are the corrupt ones. The Tainted Minds org could simply continue being corrupt in other ways, and they most definitely would/will be once this shitstorm stops. There's only so much Riot themselves can do, because it's never as simple as \"okay, fire the guy, ban this org, gg done\".\n\nAnd then, and of course my personal favorite, you have the typical hate-ignorance on the comments. People who instantly take sides because \"HE SAID\" or \"SHE SAID\".\n\nLet's pretend, for once, that Riot has all the information. Just pretend with me, for a second. They spoke with everyone, they got all the information, and they made their judgement accordingly.\n\nAre the odds of that happening high? We can suppose so, and Riot can mess up sometimes, but they aren't the type of company to fuck over their players, for the most part.\n\nTainted Minds got their punishment, that Riot deemed necessary based on the information they had, which is FAR more than the average Redditor has, and you get these gems on the comments.\n\n&gt;Riot just showed how egregiously biased they are with this ruling. The Renegades ruling is a travesty in retrospect.\n\n&gt;A player signs a contract and refuses to abide by it, org goes aggressive and threats the player - get shafted; Org lies to players during months, living in sub optimal environment with heat, no internet and terrible living conditions - slap in the wrist\n\n&gt;Whistleblower laws exist for a fucking reason. This is completely outrageous and frankly it's much, much worse than anything else in the document. I can't believe they've said this, genuinely.\n\nNow, let us all focus for a second here, because while xPecake's response is, in and of itself, gold as well (containing some incredible gems which, some could call it integrity, others could call it childish, I personally call it incredibly dumb, like a multi-billion dollar company will give a rat's ass about a PR hit, which at worst will slightly lower their revenue for a bit), we'll dive into it in a moment.\n\nFirst, we'll focus on those comments, and there's a pletora of them. From comments comparing this situation to the Renegades' situation (hint: it isn't the same, and you're a fucking donkey for even comparing them), to saying that Tainted Minds should be banned because of what players said, and as we know, players are never biased nor lie at all, to of course my personal favorite, people saying Riot is to blame here.\n\nObviously, Tainted Minds have people on Riot OCE, so we might as well say the entire Riot Games company is a piece of shit. Because why not, Riot fucks up sometimes, so they're clearly an evil mastermind company who's out to fuck those specific players.\n\nI don't personally have an issue with these comments, and if it looks like I'm taking Riot's side on this, it's because I am. You take players side on this, when all they did was come public with things they shouldn't have and said things they wanted everyone to hear. They were clearly wronged, but it's not like it's Riot's fault.\n\nAnd what do you do? You judge Riot, like YOU know all the information, and like they made the Competitive Rulling based on the information we have. Which isn't true whatsoever.\n\nNow that we have unanimously agreed that you're an idiot for taking a side instead of going neutral, let us go to xPecake's response.\n\nAnd since I don't have the time, nor the focus to go over all of it, half because I have better shit to do and I've wasted plenty of time on this response, half because I don't particularly care, I'll skip right to the end.\n\n&gt;I'll be clear here, I am not going to stop until one of these 2 situations happen.\n1. Tainted Minds get banned from OPL and Daniel Ringland is fired.\n2. Nick, Fasffy, my teammates and I get paid damages for Riot screwing up on this matter.\nIf nothing happens I'm really wondering how you will publicly announce my competitive ruling without taking another PR hit.\nYour turn Riot.\n\nLike this post states,  the players weren't exactly saints either, and Riot has guidelines they have to follow. They won't throw them away simply because players decided to throw a tantrum.\n\nI'm not against the players obviously, but let's face it: the org will win. They have good friends within Riot OCE, and xPecake has given them the grounds to give him a good ol' Competitive Rulling. There's no reason for Riot OCE to not take action against him. NDA's exist for a reason. They're not there just because, and if you break them, wether you're right or wrong, you get what's coming for you.\n\nDo you deserve it? I don't know, but that's the way things work. And you could rally every pro player, and every person from this subreddit, that won't change, because that's the law.\n\nxPecake and the players trying to push this matter foward, and rellying on \"PR hits\", like most people who play League of Legends would actually care about it (hint: they're casuals, they won't give a single shit about what happened to a few players from the OCE region), shows they aren't exactly doing it the smart way, and it's only a matter of time before they're fucked massively hard, because corrupt or not, Tainted Minds have the right friends within Riot OCE.\n\nRiot OCE has corrupt members, as any powreful organizations do.\n\nWelcome to the real world.\n\nDisclaimer: It would be good if I could be proven wrong, and I still trust the Riot HQ's can try to do something about it. However, these things always take time. You can't always just weed out the rotten instantly. Just stop taking sides, remain neutral, and keep in mind BOTH sides will tell you what they want you to hear.\n\nAnd you can apply that to pretty much everything in your life.", "edited": 1492097595.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, feels good to read someone who can actually speak about this issue with actual words, and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the &amp;quot;OMG TAINTED MINDS BAD ECS DEE&amp;quot; on the front page is ridiculous.

Which isn&amp;#39;t true whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we have unanimously agreed that you&amp;#39;re an idiot for taking a side instead of going neutral, let us go to xPecake&amp;#39;s response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since I don&amp;#39;t have the time, nor the focus to go over all of it, half because I have better shit to do and I&amp;#39;ve wasted plenty of time on this response, half because I don&amp;#39;t particularly care, I&amp;#39;ll skip right to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be clear here, I am not going to stop until one of these 2 situations happen.\n1. Tainted Minds get banned from OPL and Daniel Ringland is fired.\n2. Nick, Fasffy, my teammates and I get paid damages for Riot screwing up on this matter.\nIf nothing happens I&amp;#39;m really wondering how you will publicly announce my competitive ruling without taking another PR hit.\nYour turn Riot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like this post states,  the players weren&amp;#39;t exactly saints either, and Riot has guidelines they have to follow. They won&amp;#39;t throw them away simply because players decided to throw a tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not against the players obviously, but let&amp;#39;s face it: the org will win. They have good friends within Riot OCE, and xPecake has given them the grounds to give him a good ol&amp;#39; Competitive Rulling. There&amp;#39;s no reason for Riot OCE to not take action against him. NDA&amp;#39;s exist for a reason. They&amp;#39;re not there just because, and if you break them, wether you&amp;#39;re right or wrong, you get what&amp;#39;s coming for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you deserve it? I don&amp;#39;t know, but that&amp;#39;s the way things work. And you could rally every pro player, and every person from this subreddit, that won&amp;#39;t change, because that&amp;#39;s the law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;xPecake and the players trying to push this matter foward, and rellying on &amp;quot;PR hits&amp;quot;, like most people who play League of Legends would actually care about it (hint: they&amp;#39;re casuals, they won&amp;#39;t give a single shit about what happened to a few players from the OCE region), shows they aren&amp;#39;t exactly doing it the smart way, and it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before they&amp;#39;re fucked massively hard, because corrupt or not, Tainted Minds have the right friends within Riot OCE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Riot OCE has corrupt members, as any powreful organizations do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: It would be good if I could be proven wrong, and I still trust the Riot HQ&amp;#39;s can try to do something about it. However, these things always take time. You can&amp;#39;t always just weed out the rotten instantly. Just stop taking sides, remain neutral, and keep in mind BOTH sides will tell you what they want you to hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can apply that to pretty much everything in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg7p8aj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125915.0, "created_utc": 1492097115.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654ust", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654ust", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rx2j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ituralde_", "parent_id": "t1_dg7r5g2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not a lawyer, and certainly don't know anything about the Australian side.  \n\nI asked a lawyer about this though when Renegades was banned, and they seemed to think that a case could be possible depending on the terms of the contract and if Riot's case was demonstrably disingenuous, though it would be a hard one given that the contracts are likely written in a one-sided manner.
