I think that while it aims to be the most unique of the \"Damage\" keystones, it actually has the least impact on how you want to play the game. You just do what you already did and let DFT do its thing. This is exactly why Warlords needed to be changed from flat lifesteal, and why Strength of the Ages is no more.\n\nMy thoughts for DFT:\n\nDealing damage to a champion applies a DOT and causes your following damage (of the same type) to the same champion to apply another stack of the DOT. the DOT also slightly ups the damage taken of that type from you, or tacks on a few bonus damage in the same way spellthief items do.\n\nEXAMPLE: Jhin bounces a Q on you, you now are taking DFT ticks, and further physical damage from jhin is slightly amplified / augmented during the DOT.\n\nOther example: Vlad hits you with a Q dealing magic damage. Further Magic damage applies more DOT\n\nYou can apply something like 3 - 5 instances of the DOT (just spitballing numbers) and they can happen at the same time - but for reduced damage on additional concurrent instances - however, once those instances wear out (in other words, once the target has no DFT ticking on them), the keystone goes on CD.\n\nSomething like this would align it with the Deathfire concept (Throwback Tuesday to DFG) and would make it less about \"I poke you every now and then\" and more about finding extended fights to keep DFT ticking for as long as possible.\n\nThis would likely still benefit most of the champions that already liked DFT while further carving out the \"extended fights\" niche. Also, Mages would be able to apply extra DFT with auto's since they naturally get Magic Damage on autos. This can be seen as a blessing or a curse. However, AD champs with no Magic Damage on autos would need to be careful not to proc DFT with magic damage and limit their ability to utilize it.\n\nEDIT: Clarification.", "edited": 1491954712.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deathfire name has some history with LOL, quite iconic history at that.
