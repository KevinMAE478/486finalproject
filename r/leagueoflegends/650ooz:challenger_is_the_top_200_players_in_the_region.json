In your second season, you&amp;#39;re pretty likely to get placed Bronze 5 even if you do decently well in your placement series.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, your MMR&amp;#39;s already quite low and it&amp;#39;s very sensitive just after you first place. If you place and then lose the vast majority of your games for the next 20 or so after, there&amp;#39;s a high probability your MMR could plummet at an exponential rate - since it&amp;#39;s based on a bell curve, the bottom 1% accounts for hundreds of MMR points. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get in that special class of hyper-low MMR, it&amp;#39;s difficult to get out as you have many points to build up again (once your MMR becomes less sensitive), and your games are extremely unpredictable being dominated by AFKs, trolling and genuine cluelessness on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get a small taste of a &amp;#39;Hell&amp;#39; effect with the fifth divisions in general, if your MMR&amp;#39;s tanking but you&amp;#39;re winning enough games to keep you off sticking at 0 LP and demoting just barely, but it&amp;#39;s something that doesn&amp;#39;t take too long to reverse (sometimes it can actually be a blessing to degrade to the lesser first division as with comparatively few wins in succession you can get right back in to x 5 0LP with much better MMR).
