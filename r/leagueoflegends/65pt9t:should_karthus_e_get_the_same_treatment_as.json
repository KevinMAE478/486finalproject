I like to do a little puff toggle with E on Karthus just to last hit a minion and get that mana regen from it. not being able to do it would kill his laning which is already horrid enough. Even with mana sustain off e or using the empowered q, he still struggles.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-edit-&lt;br/&gt;\nWTF 140 UPDOOTS!?!?!? You people sometimes... xD I&amp;#39;m just a bronze scrub who loves karthus. I don&amp;#39;t deserve this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dgcf0lt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492398123.0, "created_utc":
