I think Americans really really like April Fools - considering how almost all of Reddit was for the day it sort of felt that way. Whereas in England or the rest of Europe it&amp;#39;s a bit of &amp;#39;ehh cool, that&amp;#39;s alright&amp;#39; kinda thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up pretty much staying off Reddit for the entire day, not sure I could handle 18+ front page posts about Marc Merril on here or changing all the flairs on the football sub reddit to rival teams. Even the team I support changed all of it&amp;#39;s styling to a rival club. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg4099o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491925774.0, "created_utc": 1491896974.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64lzm2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg46pi0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ultimatex", "parent_id": "t1_dg3xw0h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And I believe it's 9 days later and it's hilarious you're still complaining about it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I believe it&amp;#39;s 9 days later and it&amp;#39;s hilarious you&amp;#39;re still complaining about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg46pi0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491942763.0, "created_utc": 1491913963.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3xw0h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChemtrailEUNE", "parent_id": "t1_dg3tukg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like april fools pranks as much as the next guy, but I believe that a prank shouldn't destroy functionality.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like april fools pranks as much as the next guy, but I believe that a prank shouldn&amp;#39;t destroy functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg3xw0h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491919677.0, "created_utc": 1491890877.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3tukg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Louizk", "parent_id": "t1_dg3brq3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was April 1st man, and besides, the content in this subreddit is pointless already.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was April 1st man, and besides, the content in this subreddit is pointless already.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg3tukg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491912175.0, "created_utc": 1491883375.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64lzm2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64lzm2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64lzm2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64lzm2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64lzm2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3dsrp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "elevendytwo", "parent_id": "t1_dg3dfvx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was just clarifying because it looks like you misread his sentence.
