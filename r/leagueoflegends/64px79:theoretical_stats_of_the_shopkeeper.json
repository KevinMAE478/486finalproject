After is 3091.5 AP), (40% CDR cap, he follows these rules too), and 8200 Mana.  Notably, he has to choose between the AP of Archangel or AD of Muramana, because they share the same unique passive name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here is where he gets absolutely scary.  If we assume that the shop keeper MUST have enough items for every person on a single team to build 6x of that item on a Hexakill game (Meaning a total of 36 of each item, as we assume he only needs to stock up enough for his own team, not both teams), he has...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;858978 HP.  A single Titanic skill proc by itself at this much hp deals 85937 physical damage in a cone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;29545 MR (Almost enough MR as to leave him immune to magic damage no matter how much Mpen you get, thanks to the fact that around 19990 Armor/MR you become immune to physical/magical damage because the damage reduction rounds up to 100%, as has been tested with Nasus on the practice tool).  With full MPen build, you can bring him to effectively 19129 MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;38895 armor.   A few fun facts to go with this.  Thanks to the Randuins Omens he has, he takes 100% reduced damage from crits no matter what.  If you crit, you literally lose all of your damage vs him.  Second, at 38895 armor, the Thornmail he has will reflect 9724 magic damage back at you if you auto attack him, not counting whatever damage you would do to him before all of that armor.  Even Rammus doesn&amp;#39;t think this is OK, man.  Third, if you run a full arpen build vs him you can reduce him to 14914 effective armor.   Not that you can auto attack him though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;295200 Mana.    Archangel would turn this into 8856 AP just by itself.   Muramana would turn this into 5904 AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;31698 AD.  Muramana brings this to 37602 AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;91582.65 AP.    Archangel brings this to 103538.25 AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bonus fun stats.  Lets pretend he has a version of GP&amp;#39;s Q that has 0 base damage, with a 100% AD ratio and applies on hits and spell effects as well as can crit.  The damage dealt by this single &amp;quot;Q&amp;quot; would be 85897(Titanic)+94005(AD ratio critting)+17712(Muramana Shock passive), or 197654 physical damage, and 300(Shiv)+125(Revolver)+45791.325(Lichbane)+27489.795(Nashors&amp;#39;s passive)+13837.3975(Luden&amp;#39;s Echo) = 87543.5175 magic damage, totaling 285197.5 mixed damage.  Oh, and 170 true damage from Duskblade.  Not that we really need to worry about that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we assume this thing is a champion, the best part of all is the fact that you can still kill him with just 2 champions.  Fiora with Kayle or Taric ult active would be able to ult him and down him despite all of this.  If we assumed the Shopkeeper used Zhonya&amp;#39;s, then it brings the requirement to 3 champions, needing both Kayle and Taric to give Fiora the needed duration of invulnerability as to kill this monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "There was a post talking about if the shopkeeper would be able to 1v10 with all the items he has.

Below are all the possibly relevant things I could notice while going through the entire item list, which are not yet mentioned by OP.**\n\n---\n\n&gt;Oh, and 170 true damage from Duskblade. Not that we really need to worry about that...\n\nOn the topic of items we needn't worry about.. Frost Queen's Claim would deal another 15 damage. While Frost Queen's Claim specifies 'Spells and Basic Attacks', there's other minor items that specify 'Basic Attacks deal x damage on hit', such as Guinsoo's Rageblade wth 15 magic damage. Runaan's Hurricane with 15 physical damage, and Wit's End with 40 magic damage. Did you count any of these? :)\n\nThen there are some other chargeable items that could provide a tiny bit more stats as well, such as Jaurim's Fist granting 150 maximum Health, Seeker's Armguard granting 15 Armor and AP. We'd have to assume these items were bought before the Shopkeeper finished his 209hr farming game though, as they require minion kills to charge. Mejai's Soulstealer would be fully stacked if he could farm some enemy bot champions as well.\n\n---\n\nAlso, you mentioned the gold-gen item limits in the comments, but what about other similar limits? Quite a few items have map-based restrictions, such as Doran's and other starters being removed from the Howling Abyss (patch 6.12), and several maps having special versions of otherwise regular items (such as the Quick Charge versions of, well, chargeable items), which fit the map better. Would Wooglet's Witchcap stack multiplicatively with Rabaddon's Deathcap? I can imagine it becoming annoying to calculate when different maps pose (slightly) different stats, but the alternative would be that this scenario takes place in an unknown map where all items are available. :P\n\nBesides map-based restrictions, there are also a couple champion-based restrictions, such as the Hex Core. There's also the jungle items which require the Smite Summoner Spell, for another type of item restriction. And some items also have stats per level, what level would the Shopkeeper be for these? He never levels up ingame (while monsters do level up even when not fighting), so he doesn't seem to level from the passive xp gain. But then again he's been hard-farming minions for literally days to collect all the gold. To top it off there are gamemode-based restrictions such as the Nexus Siege specific items (although I'm not sure if there are any such items that actually affect the Shopkeeper's stats).\n\n---\n\nThen something else, there are tons of damage reducing items in the game, I think most of them are %-based even. wouldn't this drastically reduce Fiora's damage output, to the point where she needs so many extra passive procs that just Kayle and Taric ults are not going to buy enough time (far from, I think).\n\nWhile on the topic of the fight, Guardian Angel's revive passive was also not considered. Considering both GA and damage reduction, could you actually work out how much time is needed, and then how many and which champions are needed? I can see Kindred as an easy third supporter with her ult, but that can't be enough time at all. Besides that she'd probably need other picks to just keep the Shopkeeper down with some heavy CC instead, like a Gnar or Leona.\n\nAlso regarding the fight, what would Fiora's build be? I'm not sure if you can affect the spawn speed of her passive much, so that seems mostly like a hard cap, but you're relying solely on the % max hp shred so adding more base damage doesn't really matter either. Would she be buying other % max hp items instead, like Liandry's Torment (lol)?\n\n---\n\nWhat if we consider the Shopkeeper being able to fight back? He could still be using his hypothetical Q ability on Fiora to proc several passives, such as Hextech Gunblade's passive healing for 15% of damage dealt. (I think this calculates before applying to Fiora meaning it'd count even when no health is lost by Fiora, right?) And there's also more indirect healing passive such as Maw of Malmortius giving 10% Spell Vamp and Life Steal when it procs.\n\nConsidering all the various Life Steal and Spell Vamp items, he may just heal back up to 100% HP with each and every Q. Fiora could try to build a Grievous Wounds item to keep his healing down, but with Spirit Visage and other items directly boosting his healing, would that even be enough? Thornmail could be used to have the Shopkeeper damage himself while attempting to heal via his Q, but again would that be enough to leave a dent? Fiora is troubled further by for example Phantom Dancer which reduces her damage by 12%. Then considering the Tenacity items in the game, the effectiveness of Fiora's allies, the ones who are meant to apply hard CC to hold the Shopkeeper down, decreases drastically.\n\nIf the Shopkeeper is indeed able to fight back, is he even still killable, even by the perfect support team? And even if he is killable, what if besides fighting back with his Q, he could also move? All the movement speed items in the game would make him practically uncatchable for Fiora, or anyone really. How big of a team would be needed to beat the Shopkeeper now? Are there any setups to abuse certain items in ways not effective in regular games? Perhaps multiple champions could use The Black Cleaver to pretty much reduce the Shopkeeper's Armor to nothing (provided they can actually hit him, ofcourse).
