Things didn't go super well early, but things were still manageable. Our jungler ganks top and gets a kill, and the enemy jgler and bot lane move to do drag while me and the other mid laner are both sitting mid. \n\nBot lane, who was already behind, decides that we **have** to contest infernal, but I choose to not go along with their terrible play. It would've been a a 3v4; at best, we had a 10% chance of stopping the dragon and a 90% chance they get the drag, kill all 3 of us, and then take multiple towers while we're dead.

If he&amp;#39;s faster, he will eventually reach Flay range and you have to Flash. Rarely will Thresh&amp;#39;s Infernal Drake do anything at all for the game. At a certain movement speed, SKT can stop the Baron rush. With a certain amount of Mountain Drake power, you can rush Baron before the mid laner rotates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can make all the arguments that Infernal Drake technically does the same things. But it&amp;#39;s not going to create the same HP/Mana diffs via damage that Ocean does via regen. It&amp;#39;s not going to create the same instant-win team fights that Cloud does. And it&amp;#39;s not going to create the same Baron rushes that Mountain does. It does a little bit of each of them. And in aggregate, it&amp;#39;s roughly as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve literally never seen anyone ever say, &amp;quot;Meh, we only have 1-2 carries, Infernal Drake is useless this game.&amp;quot; Cloud is infinitely more useful on Maokai than Infernal is. And yet everyone says to ignore it.

I&amp;#39;m not going to go rewatch the whole game but SKT&amp;#39;s map movements would likely change as a result of being able to take less advantageous fights with 3 fire drags and the situations that ended up occuring that cloud drake benefited them would have never happened to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg5zvef", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492038750.0, "created_utc": 1492009950.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zxgp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 32, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PhreakRiot", "parent_id": "t1_dg4d4iq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never, because players are idiots.

If infernals gave HALF what they currently do, they'd STILL probably be better than other dragons. My entire issue is how oppressive that dragon in particular is. if the enemy has 2+ infernals, winning the game by that point is almost down to luck. No amount of mechanical outplays can often bring the game back in a soloq environment. Thereby, because your opponent got an early advantage, now that everyone is 6 items, even if you mechanically and strategically outmanoeuvre and outplay them late game, they simply beat you because of some almost invisible 16-24% increased damage.

My entire issue is how oppressive that dragon in particular is. if the enemy has 2+ infernals, winning the game by that point is almost down to luck. No amount of mechanical outplays can often bring the game back in a soloq environment. Thereby, because your opponent got an early advantage, now that everyone is 6 items, even if you mechanically and strategically outmanoeuvre and outplay them late game, they simply beat you because of some almost invisible 16-24% increased damage.

Whether it&amp;#39;s Cloud or Infernal, if the risk is, &amp;quot;We will die if Orianna checks us&amp;quot; then you shouldn&amp;#39;t do either one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg54dup", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982579.0, "created_utc": 1491953779.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg536lp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pillar_of_Filth", "parent_id": "t1_dg4zp26", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd wager that the overvaluing of fire drake results in a relatively equal risk to taking it because it has a higher chance of being contested?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, but I&amp;#39;d wager that the overvaluing of fire drake results in a relatively equal risk to taking it because it has a higher chance of being contested?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg536lp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491980953.0, "created_utc": 1491952153.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pw0t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fxde", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DarthLeon2", "parent_id": "t1_dg4zp26", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I also think in general that players vastly overrate Infernal Drake.

As a player who loves to build mobi boots on support and jungle, I absolutely hate it when people criticize me for that choice. They only see effective combat stats and don't take into account or devalue the impact of arrival versus damage output.\n\nAs I see it, when I buy mobi boots, I'm not getting just 60 ms more. I'm getting a 1.5khp tank with 3 seconds of CC to the fight 2-3 seconds faster than usual. Those 2-3 seconds are absolutely crucial at any level because climbing and gameplay is all about being at the right place at the right time and doing the right things in order.\nI should know, I regularly play with my friends in bronze whereas I am plat myself, and even though we are mechanically at the same skill level (and I hate to admit that they can CS better than me), there is a discernible difference between plat games after 10 minutes versus bronze games after 10 minutes. Positioning not only of the individual but the team as a whole goes to absolute madness after laning phase. I have to actually shotcall to push after teamfights and when and when not to group due to the players' inability to look at opportunities to make a power play, which gradually add up to a win after a few repeats.\n\nMobis help with that, and so does Cloud Drake for the ENTIRE team. Cloud Drake ALWAYS has an impact because everyone is always moving from point A to point B. Sure, when you get there your combat stats are reduced, you dont have 8% more damage, but those 2 extra seconds gained in arriving there could easily mean a blown flash, or 2 extra seconds of CD on your skills and a kill, or getting in time to stop a push, or getting in range for Redemption and saving your ADC.\n\nAnd oftentimes, I find that 8% extra damage is extremely underwhelming compared to what you can get. The other tiers are strong indeed, but receiving +5 AD or +12 AP is almost negligible in the larger scale of things. Not often does an enemy survive with 6 hp because it is always all or nothing, and in many cases they would have died with or without the bonus damage. \n\nFurthermore, there is a gradual effectiveness of Cloud Drake as the game drags on. Think of it like a car race to the Nexus. The longer the game drags on, the larger the gap between Cloud vs no Cloud gets. Say you back at the same time and stay in lane for the same amount of time. You and your enemy back at the same time but you get to lane faster, meaning you get the first auto off on the minion, which pushes the tower a bit faster. Repeat this cycle and eventually your lead will snowball and the backing cycle will be in favor of yours and you will have had one whole rotation more than the enemy on attack turrets.. Its an unlikely scenario, but it gets the point across on how strong the Cloud Drake gets after each passing minute. Infernal damage can just be healed off, Ocean Drake's healing isnt as effective on ADC or support as they usually die in one hit, and Mountain just doesn't work since damage sticks and the +10% to turrets rarely makes a difference since most pushes are not hit and runs but absolute sieges. Cloud benefits almost all lanes but affects mid, jungle, and support the most, 3 of the biggest playmaking roles that can dictate the flow of the game as they run around the map.\n\nNot everyone understands how strong MS is, and I just wanted to shed some light on why Cloud Drake is still a useful drake, even though it is somewhat underwhelming compared to the likes of the Infernal, but there is a lot of hidden power involved with MS and gameplay that players don't take into account when looking at wins and losses.", "edited": 1491967905.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this is gonna be lost in the sea of comments, but here&amp;#39;s my 2 cents:\nPeople severely underestimate the power of movement speed.
