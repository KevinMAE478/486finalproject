I think TSM could have done better in a Bo5 format, but even if they got second seed in groups they would have been matched vs SKT and that series was a 2-3 at best for TSM, so they needed to get first seed in the group to make a deep run, which is really hard honestly. TSM probably would have beaten RNG in a Bo5 format, and vs SSG would be a close series going either way, but it wasn&amp;#39;t and TSM lose out in group stage and with no losers bracket get to maintain the meme of failing all the time. TSM probably could have gotten top 5 last year honestly regardless of meta changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dga0f1m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245001.0, "created_utc": 1492216201.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9uzms", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "No_Fairweathers", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ohao", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "TSM playoff buff and international competition slump is forever.
