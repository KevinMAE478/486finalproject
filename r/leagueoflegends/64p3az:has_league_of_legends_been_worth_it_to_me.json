The time has come to prove yourself in the battle.  Summon powerful champions, hone your skill, and go head to head with other summoners in the greatest competition in Valoran.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I didn&amp;#39;t fully grasp how LoL was about to change me.  I didn&amp;#39;t know that it would change my personality, my social group, my life even.  I think at this point we all know how it feels to have played this captivating online game for years and see someone new join.  It&amp;#39;s like a fresh recruit who knows nothing of the anguish in this world.  I enjoy playing with new players sometimes because it makes me remember how I used to enjoy every single game I played, win or lose.  Of course, that feeling for me personally is all but gone.  I like to think of myself as a relatively patient person all things considered.  I won&amp;#39;t ever rage in chat, no matter how many games in a row I lose. No matter how many times I get one shot by Rengar or hit by a BS Blitz Q.  I do get angry though.  Sometimes I get VERY angry.  I&amp;#39;m not a physically violent person by any means but I will yell at the game, or at myself, on occasion when something is especially frustrating.  I&amp;#39;m sure I sound just as silly and immature as everyone else when I do. Aside from LoL making me less patient and quicker to condemn somebody for an honest mistake, it has also taken an inordinate amount of my life.  3,663 hours to be exact.  I can&amp;#39;t think of anything else in the world that I&amp;#39;ve spent that much time on.  If I go back and think of the things I could&amp;#39;ve accomplished by using 305 full 12 hour days to be more productive, where would I be in my life right now?  Could I have gotten a degree?  Maybe.  Would I have been with my dad when he passed away instead of down the hall getting fed as Leblanc? (Yes, I remember exactly where I was and what champ I was playing. Who wouldn&amp;#39;t? It was possibly the biggest mistake of my life.) I can guarantee, though, that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be sitting here writing this story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m here to answer the question &amp;quot;Has League of Legends been worth it to me?&amp;quot;.  Have the thousands of hours among countless wins and losses on the rift payed off?  The answer is oh so very simple, albeit not what you&amp;#39;d expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little over three years ago I made a choice.  A simple choice to play an ARAM.  It&amp;#39;s not something I normally do, and I&amp;#39;m not sure what made me decide to queue up by myself in said game mode.  I got into this game most likely having just accumulated a couple of semi-satisfying wins and several very frustrating losses.  As usual.  However, this game, there was someone on my team who stood out to me.  Someone who seemed genuinely nice, despite the impending defeat.  Maybe that&amp;#39;s why I sent the friend request, or maybe it&amp;#39;s because I was like &amp;quot;omg &amp;#39;katybug&amp;#39;? maybe it\u2019s a grill on the internet&amp;quot;.  Regardless of the reason, I can with no doubt tell you that this game changed the course of my life forever.  Almost two years had gone by, and I had played with Katybug frequently some months and infrequently to none at all other months.  I had met many personalities after our first encounter, and had lots of interesting experiences that you&amp;#39;d never expect to arise from a game.  Sometime in the late fall of 2015 I began to play and Skype more with Katybug.  We got along very well, and I could tell that she genuinely couldn&amp;#39;t wait to play games with me, and I, her.  Eventually, though, we played less games, and simply talked on Skype.  We got to know each other very well through the peer to peer chat, and became profoundly close while gazing at the two-dimensional representation of each other&amp;#39;s face.  I&amp;#39;ve always been very shy and slow to act when I like somebody, so admitting how I felt did NOT come naturally by any means.  But it was early February of 2016 and I was gonna do it.  I was gonna ask her to be my valentine.  I was so scared, but so driven.  I had waited long enough.  I tried to make it sorta casual, but we all know that&amp;#39;s just not how it works.  Once I said it, I was committed to it.  It was late at night and I was about to go to sleep when I sent the text. (Yeah, I&amp;#39;m too much of a coward to say it out loud in a video chat, so sue me.) The six minutes I waited for her reply were the longest six minutes of my life.  Her answer was more than a simple &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; but that was all I could read through the tears.  I was heartbroken.  Not just because she had said no, but because now I knew that our friendship wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same.  And it wasn&amp;#39;t.  We talked less the next couple days and it hurt me to think it was my fault.  But then she made the decision to come visit me in person-as a friend of course-over spring break.  It wasn&amp;#39;t a simple trip either, 12 hours by car meant it was quite a journey.  She would have begun the drive on March 16th with a friend of hers had she not gotten sick.   Her mother knew that she was really excited to do something for spring break so she agreed to go on the adventure with her the following week.  They arrived late on the 23.  Too late to come visit, and her mom was very skeptical of me, as expected.  We saw each other in person for the very first time the next morning, after knowing each other for well over two years.  She was even more beautiful in person than over Skype. I immediately knew that seeing her just this once wouldn\u2019t be enough. It took less than 48 hours for us to fall in love, once the distance had been closed.  And on Friday, March 25th I had my first kiss at 21 years old.  The next 7 months were simultaneously the happiest and hardest months of my life.  Getting to see each other once a month and having to pay hundreds of dollars in plane tickets each time.  Trying to plan our trips around my job and her school was very difficult, but very worth it.  Now here I am, living 700 miles away from my family and friends. My entire future impacted by a video game, and suddenly it has all been the most valuable time I&amp;#39;ve ever spent.  We got engaged on our 1 year anniversary of dating, and are to be married September 23, 2017.  If I had to spend another 3500 hours playing a video game just to find her again I would, in a heartbeat.  And I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider a second of that time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple PC game has impacted my life more than I could possibly have imagined, and I&amp;#39;d like to take a moment to say thank you.  Thank you, Riot Games. Thank you for League of Legends.

I've been married for a year now, dating for 5 years, and we also have a son together. \n\nMy first bit of advice is making sure you two know how to work things out when shit hits the fan. Life happens to everyone, and it's the easiest time to cut ties with people who have made your life \"harder.\" I've been some through some of the worst shit in my entire life where I could literally feel the tension of stress straining my relationship to the breaking point. Multiple times too. Always make sure you two have a game plan to talk everything out and both be willing to apologize to each other for what is said. If either one of you are closed off in a time of stress, you'll grow very distant very fast. \n\nSecondly, make sure you both think financially similar. If money becomes an issue for you two, it's a hard chance things will work out. If someone spends $20 here and $30 there, things will add up quickly, and it can be hard to break habits of someone who is used to doing that sort of thing. If you're extremely well off, (only assuming you're not cause you're only like what 22? Same age as me and I'm not even close to being well off) you can disregard this, but for us every penny counts right now. Just make sure your finances are budgeted and planned out together. \n\nThird thing I will say is, make sure you guys have talked about the nitty gritty about just about everything. I've heard horror stories of people getting married and then finding out later on that one person is a liberal and the other is a conservative. It's not a deal breaker, and things could be worked out obviously, but just remember that opposites DO NOT attract. Fighting with someone constantly about each other's views on life will only lead to strain. Talk about every facet of life and learn each other in and out, compromise and grow together. \n\nLastly, and a little NSFW I guess, just make sure you two are sexually compatible. Sex is very important in a marriage/any relationship really. Don't be someone who expects sex every other day and be with someone who you know has a low sex drive, you'll just be shooting yourself in the foot. Keep things spiced up and keep things special in the bedroom. \n\nSorry if this was a bit of a ramble, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw this and figured I would say something.

It would of been a beautiful story as yours if she hadnt cheated on me even before she came to see mee with a ticket i had payed for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dg55m5x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984256.0, "created_utc": 1491955456.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p3az", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p3az", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p3az", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg483ke", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fabianos", "parent_id": "t1_dg46tkv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You guys both seem to be right.
