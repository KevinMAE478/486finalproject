Same goes for other rune comparisons as they are going to be very small differences, like 9 ad vs 7 ad. \n\nYou can buy a whole rune page of tier 2s for 30 IP, and save ip for champions. In the end riot is a corporation and they need some ways to incentivize rp purchases outside of skins, so balancing IP between champions/ runes/rune pages/other miscellanious things is riots way of doing it. Think of it like this, if you dont spend any money on the game, but play the game everyday your costing riot money. I just spent 80k IP on chromas because i have nothing else to spend it on, and i dont buy skins because i just use the loot chests. But I play something like 10-20 games a week on avg. Thats service that riot is providing me for free at a cost to themselves. Imagine if even a tenth of the userbase that might have spent money on the game in the future dont have to anymore because their only needed ip purchase is champions because runes are so low cost. Thats a ton of lost profit. \n\nRp pruchase of runes is an idea, but iirc riot didnt want to allow that at the beginning of their game because it felt like you could basically buy yourself power.

Thats almost a third of an auto attacks damage at lvl 1. If 16 hp really makes or breaks the lane, you probably didnt play it right to be winning by such slim margins. Same goes for other rune comparisons as they are going to be very small differences, like 9 ad vs 7 ad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can buy a whole rune page of tier 2s for 30 IP, and save ip for champions. In the end riot is a corporation and they need some ways to incentivize rp purchases outside of skins, so balancing IP between champions/ runes/rune pages/other miscellanious things is riots way of doing it. Think of it like this, if you dont spend any money on the game, but play the game everyday your costing riot money. I just spent 80k IP on chromas because i have nothing else to spend it on, and i dont buy skins because i just use the loot chests. But I play something like 10-20 games a week on avg. Thats service that riot is providing me for free at a cost to themselves. Imagine if even a tenth of the userbase that might have spent money on the game in the future dont have to anymore because their only needed ip purchase is champions because runes are so low cost. Thats a ton of lost profit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rp pruchase of runes is an idea, but iirc riot didnt want to allow that at the beginning of their game because it felt like you could basically buy yourself power. If everyone could only buy it with ip through gameplay, then no one can feel dissatisified over &amp;quot;money power&amp;quot;.
