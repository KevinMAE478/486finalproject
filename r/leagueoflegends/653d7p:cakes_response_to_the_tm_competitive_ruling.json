More often than not the advice around here is that going to a lawyer is a last resort and it's expensive and not worth the time. However, at this point he's basically threatening to break the law if he doesn't get his way and I'd rather he just go through legal avenues to make absolutely sure he's not barking up a tree that will get him burned.\n\nEven if he speaks with a lawyer just for some advice I still think that's more worthwhile than what he's doing right now.\n\nAs for the ruling itself, based on information in the ruling especially key parts like TM not being able to communicate with the landlord for living situation and the team not wanting to switch houses it doesn't seem like Cake addressed that and I'm interested to hear why or what he thought of that part. Stuff about Ringland reaching out to help TM find subs on short notice doesn't mean anything to me it's mutually beneficial for both Riot and TM for TM to field players for a stream that's already dead in the first place.\n\nPunishment is also not a big deal to me. I'd like for Riot to avoid banning companies unless they do something on the tier of MYM. If orgs don't breach that line I absolutely do not think that banning them is valid and it's a bit concerning to me that so many advocate for that here. Feel like Cake's demand of damages is a lot more reasonable and the demand for the banning of TM and the firing of Ringland is just a misdirection as its such an absurd demand there's no way they'll do that. At the same time they don't really have much to lose since the part of the community who cares about this situation is soooo small Riot doesn't stand to lose much of anything from the outcome of this.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point my thoughts on this situation is that Cake is way past the point where he should have been going to a lawyer for this. More often than not the advice around here is that going to a lawyer is a last resort and it&amp;#39;s expensive and not worth the time. However, at this point he&amp;#39;s basically threatening to break the law if he doesn&amp;#39;t get his way and I&amp;#39;d rather he just go through legal avenues to make absolutely sure he&amp;#39;s not barking up a tree that will get him burned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if he speaks with a lawyer just for some advice I still think that&amp;#39;s more worthwhile than what he&amp;#39;s doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the ruling itself, based on information in the ruling especially key parts like TM not being able to communicate with the landlord for living situation and the team not wanting to switch houses it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like Cake addressed that and I&amp;#39;m interested to hear why or what he thought of that part. Stuff about Ringland reaching out to help TM find subs on short notice doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything to me it&amp;#39;s mutually beneficial for both Riot and TM for TM to field players for a stream that&amp;#39;s already dead in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Punishment is also not a big deal to me. I&amp;#39;d like for Riot to avoid banning companies unless they do something on the tier of MYM.
