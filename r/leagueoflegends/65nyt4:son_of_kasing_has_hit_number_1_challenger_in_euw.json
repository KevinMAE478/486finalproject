All the names match up. He seems to have been a sub for ZTR Gaming, which was acquired by NON Gaming this past LSPL split, and as a result, our player in question was replaced.\n\n&gt; So how did I get to that page? Through the links below, I first started from his YouTube channel. I took his YouTube name and typed it into Google, and got results for his Afreeca, from which I obtained his Twitch, from which I obtained his Facebook.\n\n&gt; Also on Google was the link to the Namu wiki page, in which there was a player who is talked about in Section 2.1 whose name matched the names of all the other names on the pages. After that, I followed the links within that section, and got to the name BJ\ud2b8\ud560, which matches that of his Afreeca page, and some of the YouTube VODs on his YouTube channel. From this, we can conclude that this is the player.\n\n&gt; The Namu article also mentions that in Season 6, he posted an Inven guide on Trundle, which is linked to below, and which has been linked to by him on his YouTube page. It also mentions that he is famous in general for being a master of Trundle, and a former Trundle one-trick.\n\n&gt; Pretty sure this proves his identity.\n\n&gt; Links:\n\n&gt; [Their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoYFo-lRD3pchMUtsBcEbOA/videos)\n\n&gt; [Their Afreeca Channel](http://afreecatv.com/poos69)\n\n&gt; [Their Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rnjsgur100)\n\n&gt; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006442090312)\n\n&gt; [Twitter Profile](https://twitter.com/060f65925ded4ec) (They are followed by kaSing on here)\n\n&gt; [Inven Trundle Guide](http://lol.inven.co.kr/dataninfo/champion/manualToolView.php?idx=121704)\n\n&gt; Will update if I find anything else.\n\n&gt; EDIT: Confirmed through links on the Namu Wiki that this is that player.

Our top player in question appears to have been a sub for [Apex Pride](http://lol.esportswikis.com/wiki/Apex_Pride). His name on the roster was Thal. He was a Sub Top laner. The reasoning behind this is because Thal's IRL name matches up with that of the player in question. Both the Korean and English translation of the name matches up to that of Thal's. This was also mentioned in this [Korean article](https://www.op.gg/r/detail/55035/news).\n\n&gt; I am not Korean, nor do I speak Korean. I just know very well how to find info on Korean video games and in Korea.\n\n&gt; You can check out some of my work on another game called Archeage on my site Omnom, where I regularly post articles of information translated from Korean and Russian versions of the MMORPG.
