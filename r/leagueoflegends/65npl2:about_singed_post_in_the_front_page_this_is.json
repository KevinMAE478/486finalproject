Heimers turrets health scales with 40% of his AP at level 18. Let just say he has like 1000 AP. So at the values he places it the turrets get extra health from his AP scaling. But when Zeke&amp;#39;s procs after its build up, it increases his AP by 20%, or 200 AP for a brief moment. That is 80 extra health lying around for only the duration of the Zeke&amp;#39;s, which is more obnoxious to code I am assuming then just simply locking them in for the time you placed it. Heimer turret resource cost is really low anyway, you should constantly be replacing turrets regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dgbwnac", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492366918.0, "created_utc": 1492338118.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65npl2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65npl2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65npl2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgch2d3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cknight18", "parent_id": "t1_dgc94o7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ok, my point still stands that his turrets are riddled with bugs.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, my point still stands that his turrets are riddled with bugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "name": "t1_dgch2d3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400814.0, "created_utc": 1492372014.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc94o7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EinherjarTerra", "parent_id": "t1_dgbz5a2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is not a bug though.
