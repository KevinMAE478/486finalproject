Apocalypse Now is this same theme of Western men in a foreign land and set instead during the conflict in Vietnam. Same issues apply here, and in Colonel Kurtz, the character that everyone is seeking, we see this idea of contrasting cultures and some commentary on the two. One was made in a more self aware time of the 1960s and the book being set in the 1800s is at the height of the colonization of the rest of the known world not yet conquered, so fittingly Conrad labels the entire continent of Africa as dark and the Congo as the \"Heart of Darkness\"\n\n\nChinua Achebe wrote a story called \"things fall apart\", which is a great story that provides the view from an African tribesman as his land is slowly taken over by Western influence. Achebe did not like Jospeh Conrad, or his portrayal of Africans in Heart of Darkness, and I believe he wrote an essay talking about the blatant and overt racism of HOD and Conrad. However, Conrad being born in the time he was, I think there is some room for argument on both sides. I don't subscribe to either, but I feel like knowing both of these side helped give me a more wholesome picture of what each story was trying to tell.\n\n\nAlso fun fact, Conrad wrote HOD in English which I believe was his 3rd or 4th language which makes it terribly impressive. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I haven&amp;#39;t read Conrad in awhile, but I think some major overarching themes in HOD and stories like Lord Jim are about the clash of Western imperialism and the culture it&amp;#39;s descending upon and how those two react. There are themes in HOD of race and the contrast in ethnicity, psychological themes of losing ones mind and others along the lines of that. Apocalypse Now is this same theme of Western men in a foreign land and set instead during the conflict in Vietnam. Same issues apply here, and in Colonel Kurtz, the character that everyone is seeking, we see this idea of contrasting cultures and some commentary on the two. One was made in a more self aware time of the 1960s and the book being set in the 1800s is at the height of the colonization of the rest of the known world not yet conquered, so fittingly Conrad labels the entire continent of Africa as dark and the Congo as the &amp;quot;Heart of Darkness&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chinua Achebe wrote a story called &amp;quot;things fall apart&amp;quot;, which is a great story that provides the view from an African tribesman as his land is slowly taken over by Western influence. Achebe did not like Jospeh Conrad, or his portrayal of Africans in Heart of Darkness, and I believe he wrote an essay talking about the blatant and overt racism of HOD and Conrad. However, Conrad being born in the time he was, I think there is some room for argument on both sides. I don&amp;#39;t subscribe to either, but I feel like knowing both of these side helped give me a more wholesome picture of what each story was trying to tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also fun fact, Conrad wrote HOD in English which I believe was his 3rd or 4th language which makes it terribly impressive. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HistoryPorn", "name": "t1_dg9w3gi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239263.0, "created_utc": 1492210463.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2skqi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cloo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2skqi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cloo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9wyzo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "InerasableStain", "parent_id": "t1_dg9v2rw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HistoryPorn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You ever think that chunk of pages about rivets was supposed to be deliberately maddening?
