If you are saying all observational comedy becomes unfunny to the listener if they were to pick it apart themselves, then uhhh don't do that?  I also don't buy that doing so would be inherently unfunny, sometimes the reasons why we do absurd behaviors are absurd and hilarious in themselves.  \n\n&gt; But what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues.

Someone telling a story their coworkers find humorous about how they nearly got hit by a little black Honda, and low and behold he looks over and it's an Asian women, is funny precisely because they had an expectation and that _exact_ expectation was filled.\n\n&gt; Edit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: \"You did get it, you just didn't find it funny.\"\n\nExactly, humor is diverse, subjective, and entirely in the eye of the beholder.

Someone telling a story their coworkers find humorous about how they nearly got hit by a little black Honda, and low and behold he looks over and it&amp;#39;s an Asian women, is funny precisely because they had an expectation and that &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; expectation was filled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: &amp;quot;You did get it, you just didn&amp;#39;t find it funny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exactly, humor is diverse, subjective, and entirely in the eye of the beholder.
