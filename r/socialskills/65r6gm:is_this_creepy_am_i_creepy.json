There's gotta be something you want to do outside of gaming, right? \nPick up an instrument, and find a private tutor if that's something you can afford. If not, just practice on your own. \n\nTry going to concerts. You don't need to talk to people at clubs or big concerts, just get drunk and listen to the music. \n\nTry a gay bar!!!

It is something that you can get past and improve on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howrver, I think your response to some of these comments is highlighting that you didn&amp;#39;t initially write this looking for advice, just for someone to tell you something you already believe/confirm your thoughts. You don&amp;#39;t improve by getting told things you already know and believe though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to start going to events and gravitating towards places where you think you can meet people who will share similar interests.&lt;br/&gt;\nExhausting? Yeah. Takes a while to build friendships? Yeah. Welcome to life, getting better and getting the things you want take time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to start treating people as individuals instead of lumping them into one giant category of dumb country bumpkins.&lt;br/&gt;\nDo you feel like they&amp;#39;re stupid? Yeah. They, however, think you&amp;#39;re weird, or rude, or something else. Is it easier to change how you treat them or how you act, or change how they see the entire world and your place in it based off their experiences up to this point in life?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take the advice you&amp;#39;ve received in this thread, instead of wondering why the things people are saying are getting upvoted.
