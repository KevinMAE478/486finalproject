Don't be unusually nice. In other words, treat girls the same way you treat friends, be yourself. When you act unusually nice, girls can often tell that it's just a mask that you're wearing. I'm not saying to be a jerk, I'm just saying, don't put her on a pedestal, when you do this, you will be nervous and want to be too nice. When you do this, at first a girl will think \"oh wow this guy is super nice\" but then as you progress, she will think \"why is he being so nice? this is weird\" and once that thought enters her head, she starts to distrust you, and trust is essential to attraction. She might keep you in the friend zone because you're nice, but she will never consider you as a boyfriend. And if you get too carried away with being nice, you will end up worse, in the creepzone.\n\n...or r/creepyPMs?\nNot being creepy is a fine line. Understand that girls encounter creepy men all the time so *every* man they meet undergoes lots of little (and sometimes big) tests to see if they are a potential danger and any signs of creepyness will send them off in a hurry. Creepy men doing horrible things to women is on the news all the time. When you approach a girl, for you the worst that can happen is rejection, but in the mind of the girl, the worst thing that can happen is that you can be a dangerous psychopath. \n\nFor example, eye contact. If you can't meet a girls gaze, you come off as lacking confidence or unsure of yourself or trying to hide that you are looking at them. How is a girl supposed to know you like them if you can't even look them in the eyes? And this is a huge turn off for girls too. On the other hand, if you over-compensate by staring too long, this then becomes too creepy. Again, think about how you act when talking with your friends, you look them in the eyes, then look away as you gather your thoughts to talk some more. Be natural, be real, don't be afraid, and don't over compensate.\n\nDon't stalk. What I mean is this. Don't be secretly admiring a girl forever without approaching her to talk. And don't be near her and wandering around always watching her. She will notice, and the more you do it, the more you appear creepy. When you see a girl you like, be normal... look, don't stare. Look again and when she looks at you, hold your gaze a couple of seconds, then smile and look away. Look one more time, if she looks back at you, she is interested, then walk up to her and talk. What is the single best thing you can say? \"Hello\". No really, this is the best pick-up line in the world. If she has caught you looking at her three times and you are not approaching her by now, then it's too late. Try again another time, with another girl because you've already creeped this one out. This takes just a few minutes, not 15... 15 min of you watching her from a distance is creepy as hell.\n\nDon't compliment too much. This actually makes girls feel uneasy. Again think about your friends, if you suddenly started complimenting your friends too much, they would wonder what is going on. This creates tension, a girl wants to feel at ease with you, not tense. Yes you can compliment once when you approach her, but that's it, don't shower her with compliments. This also makes your compliments shallow, when you are always doing it. The rarer something is, the more impact it has when it happens, this goes for compliments too.\n\nTouching... same rule... too much and too little is creepy. Be natural. What is natural? Say someone wants to take a picture. If you move in close and grab her by the waist and pull her in to you... creepy. On the other hand, if you put your arm around her and just hover your hand over her shoulder as if you're afraid to touch her, that too is creepy. Think about photo's with friends... does that happen? No, there is no awkwardness because they are your friends and you're just being you and you're not worried about how it will come across is you touch them.\n\nLast thing. This is the most important. Let your words match your actions. Don't be fake, don't be in-congruent. This is the CORE of creepiness because this makes it look like you have something to hide. Men that have something to hide cannot be trusted and are seen as a danger. Danger = creepy. It's okay to have your privacy and maybe not want to reveal your inner feelings, but don't fake something that is obviously not the real you, that is not okay. A huge red flag goes up if a girl even *thinks* you are being dishonest or misleading and small things matter too because if you can't be trusted with small things, how can you be trusted with big things, like being in a relationship.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you act around girls without ending up on &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt;?\nThis one is easy.

This creates tension, a girl wants to feel at ease with you, not tense. Yes you can compliment once when you approach her, but that&amp;#39;s it, don&amp;#39;t shower her with compliments. This also makes your compliments shallow, when you are always doing it. The rarer something is, the more impact it has when it happens, this goes for compliments too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Touching... same rule... too much and too little is creepy. Be natural. What is natural? Say someone wants to take a picture. If you move in close and grab her by the waist and pull her in to you... creepy. On the other hand, if you put your arm around her and just hover your hand over her shoulder as if you&amp;#39;re afraid to touch her, that too is creepy. Think about photo&amp;#39;s with friends... does that happen? No, there is no awkwardness because they are your friends and you&amp;#39;re just being you and you&amp;#39;re not worried about how it will come across is you touch them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last thing. This is the most important. Let your words match your actions. Don&amp;#39;t be fake, don&amp;#39;t be in-congruent. This is the CORE of creepiness because this makes it look like you have something to hide. Men that have something to hide cannot be trusted and are seen as a danger. Danger = creepy. It&amp;#39;s okay to have your privacy and maybe not want to reveal your inner feelings, but don&amp;#39;t fake something that is obviously not the real you, that is not okay. A huge red flag goes up if a girl even &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; you are being dishonest or misleading and small things matter too because if you can&amp;#39;t be trusted with small things, how can you be trusted with big things, like being in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialskills", "name": "t1_dg8rk5w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173361.0, "created_utc": 1492144561.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 58}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r275", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6598ha", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8htnf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 73, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wendigo_imago", "parent_id": "t3_6598ha", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialskills", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't treat them like a means to an end, or an accomplishment.
