In any company, I&amp;#39;m usually the one cracking the witty, sarcastic jokes, sometimes at my own or at others&amp;#39; expense. I&amp;#39;m not socially awkward, but I&amp;#39;m introverted, and I generally appear pretty nonchalant and sometimes even bored.

Everyone&amp;#39;s laughing freely and they all have a favorite person in the room, either an SO or best friend, and I&amp;#39;m nobody&amp;#39;s favorite person because of how distant and unapproachable I always seem.

They like my company and my &amp;quot;edgy&amp;quot; sense of humour and my laid-back smirks, as long as they don&amp;#39;t have to look at it for the rest of their life. For a best friend or date, they want someone that is friendly and, I don&amp;#39;t know, someone that seems happier, maybe. I&amp;#39;m happy, I swear. I&amp;#39;m just an introvert and it doesn&amp;#39;t show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I don&amp;#39;t like being at the center of attention, so I&amp;#39;m never at the center of attention.
