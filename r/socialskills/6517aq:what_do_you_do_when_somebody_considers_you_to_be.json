But I don&amp;#39;t really care, because I have boundaries and she has violated them too many times!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider just what your boundaries are, as a person. She probably doesn&amp;#39;t realize it, but what she is doing is very rude. She is monopolizing the conversation and it&amp;#39;s really no wonder you&amp;#39;re burnt out on her. If she is seeking validation from you, don&amp;#39;t give it to her if it isn&amp;#39;t genuine. After a while, it becomes tiring, being someone&amp;#39;s unofficial therapist. Things I do are simply give curt, unemotional answers. I walk away the minute there is a break in the conversation. I don&amp;#39;t engage her on topics I know she is going to run away with. Most of the time, I avoid her completely. In the end, you don&amp;#39;t want to be her friend, so what happens here really doesn&amp;#39;t matter. If you don&amp;#39;t want to listen, then &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t!&lt;/em&gt; There is nothing mean or rude about disengaging from a relationship that isn&amp;#39;t working for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialskills", "name": "t1_dg77bpg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492090358.0, "created_utc": 1492061558.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r275", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517aq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r275", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517aq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r275", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517aq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8sxli", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "icecream1013", "parent_id": "t1_dg8sqrg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialskills", "controversiality": 0, "body": "She is picking up on the fact that you don't like her with that drunk question.
