The only advice I could give is be yourself and be polite. Aside from that try to make yourself available to some people you would feel comfortable with outside of work, it builds that rapport and trust that you are someone they want to know better. \nAlso when having conversations use the F.O.R.D. method where you ask about family occupation recreation and dreams. This way you can find out what you have in common with others and possibly bond over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialskills", "name": "t1_dgchsyp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492401771.0, "created_utc": 1492372971.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r275", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pet2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcnk8n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zipzap21", "parent_id": "t3_65pet2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialskills", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Be that guy who brings back lunch!  \n\nPizza, Chinese, whatever people like.  \n\nPeople love the guy who buys and brings them food!  \n\nIt's also a great icebreaker to get conversations going.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be that guy who brings back lunch!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pizza, Chinese, whatever people like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People love the guy who buys and brings them food!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a great icebreaker to get conversations going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialskills", "name": "t1_dgcnk8n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492409268.0, "created_utc": 1492380468.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
