I'll just post it in this reply (let me know what you think):\n\n---\n\n    Human interaction is very nuanced, and this can make it difficult to become adept at (even moreso if you consider yourself introverted). First, you have to say and do the right things the right way at the right time. Not only that- you then have to pay attention and react appropriately to whomever you\u2019re conversing with. The problem is compounded with the glut of articles on some \u201cmagic pill\u201d to help us better connect or- even worse- the cliche advice to \u201cjust do it.\u201d Trying to process all this information and implement all these tips at once ends up being more of a negative thing than something beneficial (multitasking is ineffective).\n\n     What is most beneficial?\n\n     There is no \u201cone\u201d key element to improved social encounters- there are many. What you have to do is determine the few elements that have the biggest effect on the interaction (see Pareto\u2019s principle). The process doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Though by focusing on one thing at a time, you\u2019ll feel more accomplished and confident, and that progress gives you something to build off.\n\n     This article is not a magic pill.\n\n     This article is a roadmap to beginning work on one of those key elements.\n\n    \n     Before we get into the meat of the importance of eye contact (and how to improve it), see if you can pick up on how lack of eye contact negatively impacted the following situation.\n\n---\n\n    It was a tough week at work- but Pat survived! And, especially with the gloomy weather outside, he felt that he owed it to himself to take Saturday to unwind. He starts the day off working on his passion project and heads to the local cafe.\n\n     Pat recites his normal order but doesn\u2019t notice the barista\u2019s gaze is focused instead on the impending storm outside. She asks him to repeat and, caught off guard, he stutters a little- though manages to blurt it all out. He timidly hands her his credit card, and she counters with a request for ID to confirm his identity. After fumbling through his wallet for a couple seconds, he finds it and successfully pays for his order. He finally gets his beverage and makes his way over to an open chair. Taking his seat, he notices a cute girl at the table opposite him.\n\n     \u201cHopefully the weather holds out so I can clean up my yard!\u201d she remarks.\n\n     Still a bit flustered, Pat smiles, briefly glances at her and responds \u201cYeah that\u2019d be nice\u201d as he looks at his computer.\n\n     After slogging through his project for a couple hours, he gives up, heads home and ends up binge-watching Netflix for the rest of the day.\n\n...\n\n     Does that sound a little too real? I\u2019ve been in similar predicaments on multiple occasions; it\u2019s demotivating and embarrassing. Though you don\u2019t have to be in those situations\u2026 Is anybody really forcing you? No, and change is possible.\n\n     But it\u2019s not easy- that\u2019s obvious. Maybe you can sympathize with how these people felt about their struggle with eye contact:\n\n\n          It seems so unnatural. I can't even look my family members in the eye.\n\n\n          Even with the people I'm closest to, I have a hard time making eye contact with them for longer than a few seconds at a time.\n\n\n     But does eye contact really have that much of an impact on conversation and social situations? The short answer is yes. And when you take a systematic approach, overcoming the challenge becomes far less daunting than you\u2019d have imagined.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the big deal?\n\n     How important is eye contact? An important reason to focus on it is that it allows you to better read others\u2019 body language and facial expressions.\n\n     Viewing the face of the person you're speaking with allows you to notice the things they say without speaking. You pick up on changes in body position, facial expressions and their eye contact; in turn, you can be more conversationally dynamic. If you read between the lines and decipher better what they mean by \u201clistening\" not just to their spoken thoughts but also to their unspoken ones, you can really connect with them and get much more out of the conversation.\n\n     This is huge. You can be far more mindful of the current situation than you would have had you not been visually focused. That dynamism makes the conversation feel more natural. When it feels natural, you'll feel comfortable- and what does comfort lead to?\n\n     Confidence.\n\n     Even if you don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d confident, there\u2019s no doubt that you will give off that impression. \n\n\n     \"But I\u2019m not really confident. People will definitely pick up on that.\"\n\n\n     At least that\u2019s what I used to think. You\u2019ve probably heard people toss around the stale saying \u201cfake it till you make it.\u201d \n\n\n     I freaking hate that saying.\n\n\n     It\u2019s ridiculously overused and doesn\u2019t make sense at face value. But\u2026 it\u2019s true. It makes more sense when paired with this thought:\n\n\n     You are not you. You are who you are perceived to be.\n\n\n     You can illustrate this by thinking of your different sets of close associates. The main ones that likely come to mind are your immediate family, good friends and coworkers. Do they all treat and converse with you the same way?\n\n     No, because they all have a different perception of who you are.\n\n     Your coworkers at a job you disliked might think of you as \u201cthat lazy guy.\u201d Though once you found a job you enjoyed, your new colleagues thought you were a real \"go-getter.\u201d Your parents will always have the perception of you as their baby in the back of their mind, while your friends know you as the buddy that always gives good advice. \n\n     Even \u201cperceived\" confidence leads to a number of positive results. Others will give much more credence to your words when they sense how confident you seem when speaking. People have higher trust in someone that seems confident in what they\u2019re saying than someone who gives off an air of uncertainty.\n\n     Would you trust a salesman if he looked down the entire time he was talking to you? Probably not. \n\n     Now, improving your eye contact is not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s like when when I step into a swimming pool the first time of the year: it generally takes what seems like eternity. Oh, I could jump in- as literally everyone yells at me- but instead it\u2019s one toe at a time.\n\n     Then a foot.\n\n     Then up to the knees.\n\n     Once I\u2019ve been waist-deep for a couple minutes, I\u2019m so invested I\u2019ll generally plunge the rest of my pale white body into the water.\n\n     Improving your eye contact will be the same way. Now, there are many superficial articles on the benefits of good eye contact. And granted, there is some good information; but what\u2019s the point of good information if you don\u2019t use it?! Along that line of reasoning, I created a practical and effective exercise that will ensure significant improvement in your eye contact. \n\n     Again, this takes time. The absolute minimum amount of time this process should take is two weeks. After all, it\u2019s better to take a few small steps forward and hold your ground than to take a giant leap and fall backwards. What this process will do is gradually help you feel more comfortable with holding eye contact until you really start enjoying the benefits and it becomes habit.\n\n---\n\nI fear that the full article is too long to post as a reply.
