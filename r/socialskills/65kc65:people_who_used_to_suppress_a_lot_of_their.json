Learning to be present to the moment is key to letting go I would say that if you were going to try only one thing it should be this. It has changed my life in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second was exposing myself to, and being open to, lots of different beliefs and ways of thinking. Particularly if it is a belief or opinion I don&amp;#39;t agree with, instead of dismissing it I spent time listening and learning about it fully. You probably still won&amp;#39;t agree, but you&amp;#39;ll now be able to understand and empathise with that kind of person. That is a VERY powerful thing, don&amp;#39;t underestimate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally a more focussed resource in the form of a book called: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. The title is typically self helpy I know but the stuff in that book is life changing. I&amp;#39;ve read over a hundred books on self improvement by this point and 7 habits is still the best and I re-read sections from it quite regularly. I still wouldn&amp;#39;t use it as your only method, as is the case for anything I&amp;#39;d suggest tbh, but definitely give it a go as it is immensely useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously I&amp;#39;ve tried a lot more than just these few but these 3 things have helped me grow the most and hopefully they can help you too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialskills", "name": "t1_dgbb9tc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492326170.0, "created_utc": 1492297370.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbait0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "QNoble", "parent_id": "t1_dgb9hng", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialskills", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How did you go about dropping the mask, so to speak, and coming out of your shell?
