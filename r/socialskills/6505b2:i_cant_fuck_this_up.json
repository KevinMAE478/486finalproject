It's okay and understandable to be worried about stuff, especially a first date. But you're waaay too worried about this date. The title of your post even says, \"I can't fuck this up.\" Keyword: **can't**, as if this is a life or death situation.\n\nI'm happy to see you're taking risks and trying to date, but every risk has consequences. They're not always great either, but you should still acknowledge and be okay with them.\n\nWhat /u/CluelessCovert and I are trying to say is, if you're so set on trying to make a relationship work to make your life better, then you're essentially setting yourself up for disappointment, and probably a lot of emotionally pain. You're gambling with your emotions, going all in with your life savings and hoping to win and when gamble like that, you can lose it all in a second. Figuratively and literally. Maybe you do win, but how are you going to spend your money? Well, you want this relationship to work so you keep taking your chances. Bettin' big. You're on the happiness streak and you don't wanna get off cause fuck that, right? Sooner or later, your luck is going to run out and this euphoria will turn into severe depression. \n\nWhen you rely on other things besides yourself for happiness, you're taking unreasonable risks with a slight chance of success. All things must come to an end. No one knows when or how, but we know that it will happen eventually.\n\nI can't tell you what to do. That's up to you. And we're not trying to hurt or criticize you. /u/CluelessCovert and I are worried that you're not happy with yourself and we believe you're going the wrong direction in finding happiness. How can you love somebody if you don't love yourself first?\n\nMy advice... you should really, *really* find something you're passionate about besides yourself or someone else. What do you like learning about? Computers? Cooking? Music? Business Management? This is where I believe you should invest your emotions into. If you're emotionally passionate about your studies, you'll have a much more fulfilling life.\n\nI would like to add more to the advice section, but there shouldn't be a more descriptive explanation.
