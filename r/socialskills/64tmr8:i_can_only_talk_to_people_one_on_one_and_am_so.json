I misinterpreted a meetup with a girl I clicked with years ago on Sunday as a date, even after she slipped and said she had a boyfriend. So she was probably creeped out after I did the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"/r/seduction\"&gt;r/seduction&lt;/a&gt; kino BS&amp;quot; while non-intentionally ignoring the BF thing, 2 hours into coffee. I&amp;#39;m 99% sure my number is blocked, and I still haven&amp;#39;t recovered as that was my first ever date/meeting with a girl.
