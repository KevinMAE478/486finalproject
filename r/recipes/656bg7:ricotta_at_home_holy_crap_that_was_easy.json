You want it to come up to temperature gradually. Make sure to stir occasionally to prevent milk for burning to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Using a thermometer to keep careful track of the temperature, turn the heat off as soon as it reaches 180-190 Degrees Fahrenheit. You don\u2019t want the milk/cream to come to a boil so make sure to keep an eye on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Once the heat is turned off, add in the acid you are using (e.g. lemon juice or vinegar). Stir it in very gently so you don\u2019t break the curds up. Leave this to sit for 10-15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Pour the mixture of curds and whey into a mesh strainer that is lined with cheesecloth. Let the curds drain for anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour, depending on desired dryness. If you are using it for something like lasagna, you probably want it a bit drier so less moisture gets into the final dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Remove from cheesecloth and enjoy!
