Grease and line three 6-inch (15 centimeter) cake tins with parchment paper.

Add in the powdered sugar and beat until smooth fluffy, 4 minutes. Add in the rosewater (if using) and vanilla bean extract. Beat until just combined. Add in the heavy cream and increase the speed to medium-high. Beat until very pale and fluffy, 3 more minutes. Then, add in the champagne, a tablespoon at a time, until combined. Set aside for assembly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8: Make the chocolate glaze&lt;/strong&gt;\nPlace the dark chocolate and remaining 1.7 ounces (50 grams) of butter in a small saucepan set over medium-low heat. Heat, stirring often, until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and pour the chocolate glaze into a small bowl. Let cool to room temperature before using on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9: Frost the cake&lt;/strong&gt;\nTo frost the cake, place the first leveled cake layer, cut side facing up, on a cake stand or serving platter. Then, use an offset spatula to spread about 3-4 tablespoons of the champagne buttercream over the top of the cake. Gently press on the next cake layer and repeat by spreading over 3-4 tablespoons of the champagne buttercream on the second cake layer. Top with the final cake layer, cut side facing down. Finally, coat the entire cake in a thin layer of the champagne buttercream to give it a &amp;quot;naked&amp;quot; effect. Set the cake in the refrigerator to chill until the buttercream is firm, 30 to 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 10: Decorate&lt;/strong&gt;\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator. Pour the chocolate glaze over the entire top of the cake, then, use a clean offset spatula to help spread it over the edges so that it forms a &amp;#39;drippy&amp;#39; glaze. You can now decorate the cake however you like! Here, we used fresh, pesticide-free flowers to decorate the top of the cake. Set the cake in the refrigerator to set the drippy glaze before serving, 15 more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More pictures and instructions at &lt;a href=\"http://foodrink11.blogspot.com/2017/04/how-to-make-naked-cake-with-champagne.html\"&gt;Food And Drink Recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This naked cake with champagne buttercream frosting is the perfect cake to impress!
