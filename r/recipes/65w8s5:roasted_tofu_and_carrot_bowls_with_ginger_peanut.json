Preheat oven to 400F.\n\n2. Meanwhile cut tofu blocks into 1\u201d cubes and place in large mixing bowl. Toss with \u00bd tablespoon olive oil 1 tsp freshly ground ginger, and pinch black pepper. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet.\n\n3. On another baking sheet, place carrot halves in a single layer. Drizzle with remaining \u00bd tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper. Place both baking sheets in oven and cook 20-30 minutes, stirring the tofu every 10 minutes. Cook until tofu is lightly browned and carrots are soft when pierced with a fork. Remove from oven and set aside.\n\n4. While tofu and carrots are cooking, place barley and 1 \u00bd cups of water in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 25 minutes or until barley is soft and chewy. You may have leftover water to drain out of the pan.\n\n5. Once you have your tofu and carrots roasting and the barely simmering, prepare the ginger peanut sauce by whisking together peanut butter, hot water, soy sauce, vinegar, freshly grated ginger, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.\n\n6. To plate, place 2 cups of salad greens in a bowl. Evenly divide carrots, tofu, and barely among the bowls. Finally, top with peanut sauce.
