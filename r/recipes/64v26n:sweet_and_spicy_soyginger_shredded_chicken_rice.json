We have three kinds of fish sauce in our refrigerator \u2013 the cheapest Thai Kitchen fish sauce, Red Boat 40\u00baN and the Real Stinkin' Fancy Red Boat Fish Sauce. I think both of the Red Boat options are miles ahead of the Thai Kitchen varieties. You can definitely tell a difference just by the way they smell! If you can't find these in your grocery store, look for them on Amazon! \n\nServes: 8\n\nCost: Approximately $5.19 per serving* (This price doesn't include dried herbs, oil, and other common pantry items.)\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\nTime to Make: 50 minutes\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n10 cloves garlic\n\n2 hot peppers (Thai bird's eye chili is preferred, but I used a red fresno pepper)\n\n6 scallions\n\n2 limes\n\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n\n3 tablespoons good quality fish sauce\n\n1 cup chicken stock\n\n1 tablespoon freshly minced ginger\n\n1 tablespoon sesame oil\n\n2 tablespoons brown sugar\n\n4 small carrots\n\n8 ounces shelled edamame\n\n1 seedless cucumber\n\n1 small bunch of mint\n\n1 small bunch of cilantro\n\nCooked white rice for serving\n\nOlive oil\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n**METHOD**\n\nPrep Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400\u00baF. Pat the chicken drive and season with salt and pepper. In a food processor, combine the garlic cloves and one chili pepper and pulse until finely minced and set aside. Thinly slice the scallions and keep the white and light green parts separate from the sliced dark green tops. Reserve the sliced dark green tops for garnish. Thinly slice the other chili pepper on an angle.  Trim and scrub the carrots and cut in half lengthwise. Thinly slice the cucumber into rounds. Wash the mint and cilantro and pick the leaves from the stems. Reserve for garnish. Juice one lime and cut the other lime into wedges for garnish.\n\nMake the Chicken: In a large pot, heat a slick of olive oil over medium high until very hot and almost smoking. Cook the chicken in batches until browned all over. Return all the chicken to the pot and add the minced garlic and chili pepper, thinly sliced white and light green parts of the scallions, soy sauce, chicken stock, fish sauce, ginger, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.\n\nPrepare the Edamame and Carrots: During the last 20 minutes of the chicken cooking, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the edamame and boil for 2 minutes. Drain and immediately season with salt and pepper. Cover with foil and keep warm. Heat olive oil in a grill pan or roasting pan and add the carrots, cut-side down. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20 minutes until tender and beginning to char around the edges. Keep warm.\n\nShred the Chicken: Transfer the chicken to a bowl and use two forks to shred the meat. Return the chicken back to the pot of liquid and bring to a boil to reduce the sauce a bit. Add the lime juice and brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Cook for an additional 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and season accordingly. Remove from heat.\n\nTo Serve: Divide cooked white rice between bowls and top with a helping of the shredded chicken and some of the cooking sauce. Arrange cucumbers, roasted carrots, and edamame around the chicken. Right before serving, tear the mint leaves and cilantro and arrange on top. Top with the sliced scallions and a few slices of chili pepper if desired. Serve with additional lime wedges.
