Do not deep fry them, just put the oil until all of them just submerged in it. &lt;strong&gt;Pro-tip, use a small pan, so you do not have to waste so many oil, you can fry them in batches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Once it turn into golden brown, drain them, let it cool a little bit and then blend it into coarse peanut powder. Not too fine until it become a paste but not too coarse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Chop ingredients B finely, then, hit up some cooking oil then saute them until they turn slightly brown and smells awesome. Don\u2019t burn them.Turn off the fire and put all of these item in a blender or food processor with some water. Blend them into fine paste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Heat up some cooking oil, put blended ingredient B first, stir them for a while. Then add blended chili paste, fry them on medium heat together until you can see the cooking oil starts to emerge on top when they all simmer. This is the most important part. &lt;em&gt;(This is actually the recipe to Sambal, you are making Sambal from scratch! Kudos)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Put your crushed peanuts and put enough water in it. More water means your sauce will become more watery, just watch out the consistency, too much water will not make the sauce to coat your Satay. Let them boil under low heat until everything simmers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Put the rest of Ingredients A and adjust the taste to your liking using salt and sugar. Keep cooking until the oil emerges to the top (this is the key to know when your sauce is ready). As you can see in the picture above, there is layer of oil on the top of the sauce.
