I now use it as my off season training protocol and use the cube kingpin for meet peaks.\n\nRecommendations for someone starting out: The best advice for someone starting out: Get your hands on the book (id prefer if you bought it, but that's a dif discussion), it answers a lot of the questions you'll likely have and you don't have to experience going online, asking the question, and having people cut into you for not reading the book. Aside from that, be consistent, train hard, and choose assistance work that is going to focus on your weaknesses. Doing the main work along with BBB, Joker sets, and pyramid sets will leave you lacking. Ex, train the shit out of your back, esp on pressing days. Pull ups are cool, but not enough to correct Imbalances. Also, you don't NEED to deload every 4th week, listen to your body regarding this. When you need it, you'll know. Remember that no cookie cutter program is ideal for any individual person, you're going to have to learn what you respond to best and what you don't and tailor the program to meet YOUR NEEDS. This will take some time but you'll get it eventually. Lastly, stay with the program for a good long while. Program hopping every couple of months will get nowhere. Yeah it's cool to talk about the new program you're doing on instagram but hitting PRs at meets is even better. \n\nWhat it does well: The program is relatively simple, provides all the guidance you'll need, allows you to progress steadily over a pretty long period of time without the need for too much deloading. Allows for solid strength gains and teaches the fundamentals of the big 3 (or 4 or 5, depending on how you look at it). Depending on what version you follow, it can be tailored for general strength gain, sports performance, peaking for a PL meet, and even strongman, which I actually ran in preparation for my first show. it's well liked and used by so many that it has a HUGE community. This means you have a lot of resources when it comes to questions regarding the program, and strength in general. \n\nWhat does it lack: The basic program lacks volume and isn't designed well for someone looking to peak for a meet. Two of the later versions of the program however, Beyond 531 and 531 for powerlifting supplement the basic program and tackle each of those issues. I know a number of high level lifters who use it for both PL and strongman meet prep with little to no complaints. Frequency is another thing it lacks, for some lifters and certain lifts, a higher frequency is required or is at least beneficial. For some, \"greasing the groove\" and mastery of the movement is just as important as overall volume. This is especially the case for lifters that are new to the big compound lifts. You can combat this by doing a particular movement at a much lighter weight for less volume as an accessory to another day. Ex: doing a second squat day after the main deadlift work for 3 sets of 5 at 50-60%. Doing light bench after OHP again for lower sets, reps and volumes. OR you can do the BBB protocol with the opposing lift. 5x10 of squats at 50% after main deadlift work, and 5x10 of deads after squats at 50%. You can get crazy with it as long as it's not hindering progress. \n\nWho would benefit: Anyone looking to build strength period. Whether it be an athlete looking to improve sports performance, a general lifter looking to gain strengh, or a competitive lifter looking to get ready for a comp. It can be tailored to fit whatever goals you have. \n\nRecovery/fatigue/deloads: Recovery is pretty simple. Split the days up so that you have adequate time between sessions to recover. Sleep and eat as well as you can. You're not going to get anywhere if these two factors aren't in control. Fatigue is easily manageable with the program. Deloads are already programmed in but I suggest only taking them when needed, especially if you're new. deloading every 4th week is a waste of time if you're not actually fatiguing. If you fail a working set one week, try it again the next week. If you fail again, take a deload week, at least for that specific lift. If your body hurts, you're not sleeping well, and you can't recover, take a deload week. If you can get through your working sets but can't get through all 5 sets of 10, back off on the assistance work. It doesn't have to be too complicated, listen to your body.

I have a pretty detailed log of 5/3/1 progress over 20 weeks so maybe some of you more on novice/intermediate end of things will find this experience useful.\n\nFirst here is a weekly chart of estimated 1RMs from AMRAP sets. (Estimation is done using formula in the book):\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jwfog4dw9mfsdk9/2017-04-11%2011.10.35.png?dl=0\n\nNumbers (m/27/5'11.5, zero athletic background, but did curls and benching in college):\n\n* Bodyweight: ~171lb -&gt; ~175lb (20 weeks)\n* Press: 120 -&gt; 144 (20 weeks / 1.2lb per week)\n* Bench: 189 -&gt; 215 (19 weeks / 1.3lb per week)\n* Squat: 193 -&gt; 252 (20 weeks / 3lb per week)\n* Deadlift: 236 -&gt; 318 (19 weeks / 4.3lb per week)\n\nIs this the best progress possible? Probably not, but numbers alone don\u2019t tell the full story. And even just by numbers, I am pretty happy with all of them, especially if I can maintain the same rate for full year, except for Bench where I am feeling I can actually do better now that I have fixed some of my form issues. \n\n\nSince 5/3/1 is so varied it is probably useful to specify exactly what I am doing:\n\n* No deload week. I haven\u2019t really felt like i need to take one and I don\u2019t really see any reason to do so, while I am still lifting light weights.\n* 4 day a week (Press/Squat/Rest/Bench/Deadlift/Rest/Rest):\n   - 5/3/1 Main Lift. Long ~3 minute rest periods.\n   - 2nd Set Last: 3x5 on 5+ week, 5/4/3 on 3+ week, 3x3 on 1+ week. Long ~3 minute rests. Introducing 2nd set last has been really helpful for me to get more practice with heavier weights.\n   - Main assistance 10x5 (this is basically inverted BBB), short 60 sec rest periods. 10 sets of 5 reps allows me to use higher weight: ~65% of TM when using main lift as an assistance, however it takes a bit longer to finish the workout.\n   - 1 or 2 secondary accessories (sometimes just superseted) generally as 5x10 with very short rest periods. These are mostly for back and rear delts. PullUps/ChinUps/Lat pulldowns, Different horizontal rows, Back extensions, Face pulls, W shoulder raises. I do make sure I have some back exercise every day I am in the Gym, and some rear delt exercise on upper body days.\n   - On squat &amp; deadlift days when I feel energetic at the end, I will do either farmer\u2019s carries with dumbbells or hex bar, or push prowler/sled around since it is fun.\n\nDeadlift:\n\nThe progress on deadlift has been mostly linear. I think for me, progress on deadlifts would have been linear on any program, because the starting strength 5 step deadlift setup works really well for me and I have never had any form issues with it. If I did a peaking program for deadlift, I am pretty sure I could get it significantly higher in the short term, but I don\u2019t really care all that much about peaking my current strength.\n\nPress:\n\nI made a huge mistake with choosing main assistance moves for the first 12-13 weeks. I was using incline bench and weighted dips for main assistance moves on bench and press days. This was definitely a mistake, as soon as I switched my main assistance moves to be: press for bench day and bench for press day, I immediately broke through the press plateau and have been seeing consistent progress on it ever since.\nOn internet, every time someone plateaus the only advice given is always to just eat more, but unless diet itself is complete shit-show fixing the training program can have much better effects.\n\nFor novice &amp; intermediates doing the main lift as the main assistance movement is probably fairly necessary to make good progress, especially for upper body lifts. Once a week is just not enough frequency to practice the movement.\n\nBench:\n\nWhat just numbers don\u2019t show for bench is that, in the beginning after every top set I would get some nagging shoulder pains for a day or two. So I took my time to work on the form and re-adjust everything properly. This is the benefit of 5/3/1 since you are working with sub-maximal loads it is easier to work on the form without having to de-load and feel like you are regressing. I still have quite a bit to work on for making my bench more efficient but at least now, I feel much safer and haven\u2019t had any pain after heavy bench sessions in a while.\n\nSquat:\n\nSimilar to bench, I have had some issues getting my squat to be consistent. I have fairly long limbs and a short torso so getting to a powerful and safe squat form has been a challenge. Again it has been really useful to do 5/3/1 style training instead of something like starting strength because most of the sets are lighter and it really helps to work with lighter weights to fix the form without feeling like you are regressing in your progression.\n", "edited": 1491940097.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big fan of 5/3/1 training philosophy. I have a pretty detailed log of 5/3/1 progress over 20 weeks so maybe some of you more on novice/intermediate end of things will find this experience useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First here is a weekly chart of estimated 1RMs from AMRAP sets. (Estimation is done using formula in the book):\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jwfog4dw9mfsdk9/2017-04-11%2011.10.35.png?dl=0\"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/jwfog4dw9mfsdk9/2017-04-11%2011.10.35.png?dl=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Numbers (m/27/5&amp;#39;11.5, zero athletic background, but did curls and benching in college):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bodyweight: ~171lb -&amp;gt; ~175lb (20 weeks)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Press: 120 -&amp;gt; 144 (20 weeks / 1.2lb per week)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bench: 189 -&amp;gt; 215 (19 weeks / 1.3lb per week)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Squat: 193 -&amp;gt; 252 (20 weeks / 3lb per week)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deadlift: 236 -&amp;gt; 318 (19 weeks / 4.3lb per week)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this the best progress possible? Probably not, but numbers alone don\u2019t tell the full story. And even just by numbers, I am pretty happy with all of them, especially if I can maintain the same rate for full year, except for Bench where I am feeling I can actually do better now that I have fixed some of my form issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since 5/3/1 is so varied it is probably useful to specify exactly what I am doing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No deload week. I haven\u2019t really felt like i need to take one and I don\u2019t really see any reason to do so, while I am still lifting light weights.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4 day a week (Press/Squat/Rest/Bench/Deadlift/Rest/Rest):\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5/3/1 Main Lift. Long ~3 minute rest periods.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2nd Set Last: 3x5 on 5+ week, 5/4/3 on 3+ week, 3x3 on 1+ week. Long ~3 minute rests. Introducing 2nd set last has been really helpful for me to get more practice with heavier weights.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Main assistance 10x5 (this is basically inverted BBB), short 60 sec rest periods. 10 sets of 5 reps allows me to use higher weight: ~65% of TM when using main lift as an assistance, however it takes a bit longer to finish the workout.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 or 2 secondary accessories (sometimes just superseted) generally as 5x10 with very short rest periods. These are mostly for back and rear delts. PullUps/ChinUps/Lat pulldowns, Different horizontal rows, Back extensions, Face pulls, W shoulder raises. I do make sure I have some back exercise every day I am in the Gym, and some rear delt exercise on upper body days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On squat &amp;amp; deadlift days when I feel energetic at the end, I will do either farmer\u2019s carries with dumbbells or hex bar, or push prowler/sled around since it is fun.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deadlift:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The progress on deadlift has been mostly linear. I think for me, progress on deadlifts would have been linear on any program, because the starting strength 5 step deadlift setup works really well for me and I have never had any form issues with it. If I did a peaking program for deadlift, I am pretty sure I could get it significantly higher in the short term, but I don\u2019t really care all that much about peaking my current strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Press:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a huge mistake with choosing main assistance moves for the first 12-13 weeks. I was using incline bench and weighted dips for main assistance moves on bench and press days. This was definitely a mistake, as soon as I switched my main assistance moves to be: press for bench day and bench for press day, I immediately broke through the press plateau and have been seeing consistent progress on it ever since.\nOn internet, every time someone plateaus the only advice given is always to just eat more, but unless diet itself is complete shit-show fixing the training program can have much better effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For novice &amp;amp; intermediates doing the main lift as the main assistance movement is probably fairly necessary to make good progress, especially for upper body lifts.
