[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "weightroom", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend I had the opportunity to travel to Nebraska and compete in my third Highland Games ever. My wife and I got in the night before, killed a burger, and relaxed at the hotel. I really enjoy getting away with her and throwing stuff in a field is just an added bonus. I also had the pleasure of meeting &lt;a href=\"/u/Trebemot\"&gt;/u/Trebemot&lt;/a&gt; in person and got to bug the crap out of him all day. Overall, the combined B/C group was great and I think everyone had a good time. We had the entire spectrum of skill levels, including some guys who had never done it before, some guys who knew what they were doing, and a future Class A/possible Pro in our midst putting on a show. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A little background on me:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m 27, 285 lbs and about 5&amp;#39;11&amp;quot;. I competed in my first ever Games last October and I plan on doing at least 6 more this year. I&amp;#39;ve been a gym rat for the last 7 or 8 years and I&amp;#39;ve really focused on strength training for the last 5. My best gym lifts to date are a 515 squat, a 355 bench, and a 605 deadlift. I squat once a week, bench twice a week, and pull once a week with random throwing days mixed in. I started out as a C Class throwers, then got thrown into an \u2018open\u2019 Games, and will be throwing as a B Class thrower from now on until I finally decide to jump into the deep end that is A Class. With that out of the way, let&amp;#39;s talk about the Games..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Games:&lt;/strong&gt; This was a bigger Games, with 50+ throwers overall, including a Pro/Am group. The B Class and C Class were combined and I think we were the second biggest group next to the Pro/Am. We started the day off with a shot of whiskey and got going pretty early, albeit a little later than planned. This is normal, at least in my experience, but you should still get to the field \u201con time\u201d if at all possible. If nothing else, they can probably use all the hands they can get to help set the field up. The Pro/Am dictated the order and everyone else just filled in on what was available. We started the day off with the Heavy Weight for Distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Weight for Distance:&lt;/strong&gt; It feels like every Games I do, things feel lighter than they did at the previous Games, but the 56 almost always sucks. I was a little bummed we started the day off with the weights because I enjoy them so much, but I still threw alright despite a limited warm-up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1st Throw: Good speed but the weight of the implement kept pulling me forward and I fouled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2nd: Throw: Again, good speed and better balance this time, but the weight slipped because the handle was smooth and I couldn\u2019t keep the hook-grip because of my glove. Not only did I throw it out the right side of the trig, I also fouled. I ended up taking off the glove for my third throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3rd Throw: Before this attempt I was joking around with the other guys about whether I should sand-bag a one turn to put points on the board or go for broke. &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvxKOFj5b6/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;I went for it.&lt;/a&gt; Luckily, it ended up being my best throw out of the 3. Straight drive up the middle of the trig, grip held great now that the slippery glove was gone, and I ended up hitting a 2\u2019 PR with 26\u20195\u201d. The first two throws were awful, but they taught me a lot.. most importantly, I can hold onto the weight without a glove and if anything, that glove might have been holding me back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Weight for Distance:&lt;/strong&gt; Following the HWFD with the Light Weight is awesome and probably one of the best feelings of the day. Any lifter who has ever overloaded and then done some drop-down sets knows exactly what I\u2019m talking about.. You\u2019ve gotten used to throwing a 56 lb weight, so when you cut that in half it feels even lighter than it really is and you can really go for it on your throws. All of my throws were good, but &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvyJf3D22i/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;my best&lt;/a&gt; ended up being 56\u201911, which is a 3\u20195\u201d improvement. I kept the glove off and honestly felt more secure because of that, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be wearing a glove moving forward unless something changes. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I also won B Class in this event, but I\u2019m still waiting for official results to be posted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Hammer:&lt;/strong&gt; This is where the wheels started to fall off.. I\u2019m not confident or comfortable with the hammers and I knew some of the other throwers were going to absolutely thrash me on the next two events. Moving forward I know that it\u2019s imperative I focus on hammers to improve them. I don\u2019t remember the individual throws feeling any different from one another, but there was a common trend of feeling off-balance throughout the rotations. I think this is because of the new, stiffer blades I put on my hammer boots compared to the old blades that bent more easily. I actually might go back to a thinner blade that feels more comfortable, but I won\u2019t do anything until I actually practice more and figure out what works best for me. Overall, I think my best throw was 58\u20196\u201d\u2019 which was about 3\u2019 shorter than my best ever and 12\u2019 shorter than the guy who took first in this event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Hammer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvyeFtjgQF/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;This was much the same story as Heavy Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, albeit lighter. I felt off-balance through the rotations and lost some speed. I also have a bad habit of not extending on the release, which I know is costing me valuable feet in distance. For the foreseeable future I will be focusing on the hammers because I can\u2019t keep being a one-trick pony. If I intend to do well I have to be competitive in more than 3 or 4 events. My best throw was 67\u20193\u201d, which is a 2\u2019 PR. The guy who took first in this event threw 89\u20195\u201d. Fun fact: That C Class guy who is going to probably be a pro threw 109\u201910\u201d. He\u2019s a monster and he\u2019s just going to get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Over Bar:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the last event before we broke for lunch. I did a good job of staying hydrated this Games and during WOB I made sure to eat some energy bites and Uncrustables. The bar started at 8\u2019 but I skipped a turn and came in at 9\u2019. This feels like the right place to start because I can build some confidence and get a few reps in before things get hard. One thing I\u2019ve noticed at my 3 Games is how unprepared most C Class/B Class competitors have been when it comes to WOB. The 56 lb weight isn\u2019t fun to spin with and throw, and it\u2019s even more unruly when you try to throw it &lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; and over a bar. 11 feet has been where most B/C competitors get knocked out, myself included. In fact, 12\u2019 won the B Class with the rest of us all tying at 11. Moving forward I\u2019m going to actually practice WOB. I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvyos2jeup/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;I finally had a \u201clong\u201d pull&lt;/a&gt; where the weight felt light and accelerated well over the bar. If I can practice the motion and get better at reaching back between my legs I think I can add a few feet to this event, which will definitely come in handy moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheaf:&lt;/strong&gt; After lunch we decided to start things back up with sheaf. Regulars will know I enjoy sheaf, but if you\u2019re unfamiliar, it\u2019s because my sheaf has exploding lately. This is one of the easier events for me to practice because I can do it in my driveway and I just &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; doing it. I practice with a 16 lb sheaf a few times a week and my best throw so far is a 26\u2019 throw (&lt;em&gt;This was, however, with a 16 lber&lt;/em&gt;) Going into this Games I was looking to hit a new PR, but there was a bit of uncertainty because I figured we\u2019d be throwing a 20 lb sheaf and I hadn\u2019t thrown anything other than the 16 since October.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warm-ups: I did bottom drills with a 16 lber to get loosened back up. These felt great and I was hitting 20\u2019 pretty easily without any wind-ups. After 5 or 6 throws I grabbed the 20 lb sheaf and was pleasantly surprised at how.. it pretty much felt like the 16 lber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bar started at 14\u2019 but I decided to wait and not come in until 18\u2019. \n* 18\u2019: This ended up being the right height to come in at because my first throw just barely cleared the bar, but I was honestly trying to hit it as easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;20\u2019: Good clearance, just a little more effort than last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;22\u2019: I think this took two tries, but I cleared it. This is where everyone else got knocked out, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;24\u2019: I used all 3 attempts and &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvyxN7jKhc/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;even a battle cry&lt;/a&gt;, but I missed this height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I watched the video later that day I realized that my back swing wasn\u2019t nearly as far to the right as it normally is, and I didn\u2019t extend as much as I normally do on any my attempts. I attribute this to fatigue but mainly to my stiff neck (&lt;em&gt;Awful hotel pillows&lt;/em&gt;), which nagged me off and on all day. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with how sheaf has become my go-to event. I spent as much time as I could watching the Pros throw sheaf and I have a few tweaks I\u2019m going to try in the next few days. I hope to hit 30\u2019 by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Braemar Stone:&lt;/strong&gt; I\u2019m not a big fan of the stones. I feel slow and weak and they\u2019re just not as fun as the weights or even the hammers. The stone we were throwing was big and round and ugly, but it felt okay in the hand. &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvzEE4DGWT/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;My best throw&lt;/a&gt; ended up being 27\u20192.5\u201d which is a few inches short of my best ever. Moving forward, I just have to start throwing the stones more often, and it\u2019s imperative that I focus on being &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; because right now I\u2019m just too slow despite being stronger than some of the guys throwing farther than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Stone:&lt;/strong&gt; Just like the Braemar, the open stone didn\u2019t feel terrible, &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvy9JcD9US/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;it just felt slow.&lt;/a&gt; I\u2019m going to continue doing my two-step shuffle before I finally decide to try spinning. I fouled on at least one of my throws, Braemar-ed the second, and then didn\u2019t really do much with the third. My best throw ended up being 32\u20197.5\u201d and is ultimately what cost me 2nd place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caber:&lt;/strong&gt; Caber was the final event of the day and was something else I had been looking forward to since building a DIY-caber. This, like WOB and sheaf, is an event that I can earn easy points as a B/C Class competitor since most guys won\u2019t get the opportunity to practice caber until the day of. We decided to run a smaller, lighter qualifier caber that I turned on my first pick. The caber we threw after that was a bit longer and a little heavier, but not much worse, and definitely easier than the monstrous DIY caber I\u2019ve been practicing with. I picked it clean all 3 times but pulled late my first Attempt. The next two attempts were sooner (&lt;em&gt;Still late, though&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvzNhAD3VL/?taken-by=squat.bot\"&gt;I hit ~10 o\u2019clock&lt;/a&gt; both times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; Overall, I\u2019m happy that I hit PRs and didn\u2019t get absolutely murdered my first time as a B Class competitor. There was a bit of confusion during the award ceremony.. I was originally awarded 1st place and then that quickly was retracted with them saying I was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; 3rd place. The final results were posted this morning and one point separated me and 2nd place, which boiled down to 1.1\u201d difference on the open stones. Oh well. The top 3 throwers in the B Class were all pretty consistent and it was a close race all-around. I know that if I intend to actually be competitive and win I &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to stop being a one-trick pony and start focusing on my weaknesses; I have to get better with the hammers and stones. I also learned what a \u2018long\u2019 pull in WOB feels like and that I can handle throwing the weights without a glove. My next Games is in two weeks in Wichita and I fully plan on using what I learned between now and then. I will be throwing hammers and stones more often and I will continue to practice with my caber. I believe that if I can add a foot or two to my WOB, be more consistent with caber, and actually throw stones &lt;em&gt;decently&lt;/em&gt; I should be a more solid candidate for 1st or 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Things Learned:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring your own pillows if you\u2019re staying in a hotel. Competing with a stiff neck is awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go out and eat breakfast assuming you have time. Next Games I\u2019m hitting an IHOP or waffle house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the sun off you as much as you can. It &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; wear   you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This weekend I had the opportunity to travel to Nebraska and compete in my third Highland Games ever.

The final results were posted this morning and one point separated me and 2nd place, which boiled down to 1.1\u201d difference on the open stones. Oh well. The top 3 throwers in the B Class were all pretty consistent and it was a close race all-around. I know that if I intend to actually be competitive and win I **have** to stop being a one-trick pony and start focusing on my weaknesses; I have to get better with the hammers and stones. I also learned what a \u2018long\u2019 pull in WOB feels like and that I can handle throwing the weights without a glove. My next Games is in two weeks in Wichita and I fully plan on using what I learned between now and then. I will be throwing hammers and stones more often and I will continue to practice with my caber. I believe that if I can add a foot or two to my WOB, be more consistent with caber, and actually throw stones *decently* I should be a more solid candidate for 1st or 2nd. \n\n**Other Things Learned:** \n\t\n* Bring your own pillows if you\u2019re staying in a hotel. Competing with a stiff neck is awful.\n \n* Go out and eat breakfast assuming you have time. Next Games I\u2019m hitting an IHOP or waffle house.\n\n* Keep the sun off you as much as you can. It **will** wear   you down.\n\t\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Meet Report", "id": "64qvxk", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 33, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Squat_Bot", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64qvxk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.weightroom", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "edited": 1491919339.0, "link_flair_css_class": "meetReport", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/weightroom/comments/64qvxk/highland_games_games_report_spring_fling_proam/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947042.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/64qvxk/highland_games_games_report_spring_fling_proam/", "author_flair_text": "Amateur Sheafmaster", "quarantine": false, "title": "[Highland Games] Games Report: Spring Fling Pro/AM, April 8th - Round 2 Electric Boogalo", "created_utc": 1491918242.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 22, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvxk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvxk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvxk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4a5v8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trebemot", "parent_id": "t1_dg4a3vz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah.

Here's what I see on some of your vids, feel free to take my advice seriously or laugh at how stupid it is, because like I said, I don't really know what I'm talking about.\n\n* HWFD - Looked like a really good release point.  The camera followed the throw so I couldn't really tell but it looked like you cut your follow through short.  Maybe because you wanted to make sure you go it in the field, but a full spin follow through with the proper release timing will add a few feet to that throw (or maybe a foot, it's pretty heavy) without changing force or speed.\n\n* LWFD - Same thing with the follow through, I feel like a full follow through would really help transfer the energy from your arm into the throw more.\n\n* Light hammer - Looks good to me, but I have no frame of reference for the hammer throw, it's not an event in a decathlon.\n\n* Weight over Bar - A little more hip/waist bend on the between the legs and getting a little more height on the back end, thus getting a little more momentum coming forward might give you a better height.  Good job not bending with the elbow on the throw.\n\n* Sheaf - This is another one I'm not really familiar with, but it just looks like your hips are so stiff.  Like you could get a lot more momentum into it if you were looser.  \n\n* - Stones, both of them - Dip lower, and lean back farther.  Keep your elbow up.  Elbow up brings more back into the throw, elbow down puts it more on your delts.  On the open stone, try to shuffle, not step, on your approach.  The step kills the momentum.\n\n* Caber - Yeah I don't know much about this, but like you pointed out, it just looks like your tossing it late.\n\nThat's it.  Like I said, some of this might be incredibly stupid, but it's what sticks out to me based on the limited throwing experience I have and also just what looks 'off' as I watch.
