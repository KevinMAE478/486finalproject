My right hip has reduced ROM for flexion which may be part of the issue so I&amp;#39;m working on improving that. Additionally, we are working on my pelvic positioning (keeping my ribs down). The main shifting issue is being addressed by squatting against a band; the linked video covers it and some other general stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnFyYuY2Sro\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnFyYuY2Sro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue may be different then yours so I&amp;#39;d recommend seeing a PT if you have the ability; particularly one that understands lifting. My right hip was causing me pain which you didn&amp;#39;t mention so it&amp;#39;s likely our issues are different; the above video might help though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dgd71t9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492438361.0, "created_utc": 1492409561.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j9wx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j9wx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j9wx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbio2i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lodekim", "parent_id": "t1_dgbhjr2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Very likely.
