Not exactly uncommon, and if that was your last set you&amp;#39;re still looking pretty good. I&amp;#39;d recommend adding some upper back and core focus to help prevent that. In the interim a mental thing to do that might help would be to really try and work your elbows back up under the bar when you start to fold, it can (in my experience) help you engage your back and keep things tight when you start to come forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clean, clean reps though. For your last set on a heavy squat day and the unplanned beltless thing that almost doesn&amp;#39;t even register as an issue for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg48pex", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945871.0, "created_utc": 1491917071.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg46p9w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sam4bama", "parent_id": "t3_64qfyq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can I get a form check?   \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J1aAP1oeis  \n  \n I did 4 x 3 @ 235 and that was the last set.
