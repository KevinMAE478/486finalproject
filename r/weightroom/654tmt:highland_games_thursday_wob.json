Or at least the guys who train Olympic lifts and the guys who don't. If you've never competed in a Highland Games, WOB seems to be one of those events that C/B Class guys can either do a little or not at all, so guys with some gym strength can make up some easy points. WOB being a height event means that you can decide when to come in.. I think it's important to really figure out what you're capable of because you don't want to blow past easy heights and kill your chances of a PR due to fatigue. I've hit 11' in all of my Games so far, but never 12' (*[Although I know I'm capable of it](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvyos2jeup/?taken-by=squat.bot)*) so I tend to come in around 9' so that I can have at least one more warm-up throw that is under the up-rights and will let me figure out how far out infront I need to stand. 11'-12' has been the height that knocks out most B/C Class competitors in the Games I've competed at so I'm really focusing on trying to improve my WOB to 12' and beyond. One thing I'm going to start doing is practicing the [water bottle drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2eGLP8kQ_s) which should teach me to get a longer pull and therefore more height.
