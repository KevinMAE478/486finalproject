Since I like your approach in your books and training, I wonder if you have any routines that helped you reaching your goals (for example, to write your books)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Daily goal setting, limiting distractions (got rid of email, don&amp;#39;t answer phone, etc.) and getting your shit done first (don&amp;#39;t procrastinate).  A little bit of work is better than no work and it adds up over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) You talk about using several groups of people as your research &amp;quot;subjects&amp;quot; to investigate whether certain tweaks to the program work or not. My question is somewhat two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where do you draw inspiration from to incorporate new systems in your program?\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: This is going to sound stupid but I spend a lot of &amp;quot;free time&amp;quot; just thinking and thinking and thinking.  And then you just kind of fall into &amp;quot;in the moment&amp;quot; activities (motorcycle ride, playing guitar, listening to music) and let your mind go.  And it just works itself out; sometimes it takes an hour. Sometimes it takes a year.  But you can&amp;#39;t really force some of this stuff; it just has to happen.  This is the benefit of experience as you can draw upon a ton of ideas/thoughts/observations and they eventually come out.  The more &amp;quot;mindless&amp;quot; the activity, in general, the better results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;How do you go about testing these new ideas? I.e., do you just give half of your subjects something new?\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they want something new, yes. If they need to work around a specific problem/idea, then I try to work something out.  Lots of give/take with the more experienced guys.  NO give/take with the younger ones.  They just don&amp;#39;t have the experience to work through a problem they don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg5064j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491977057.0, "created_utc": 1491948257.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 49}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tzwp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg578i3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 67, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimWendler", "parent_id": "t3_64tzwp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you to everyone that asked questions/read.

I know you have boring but big, but Im more looking for a 5-8 rep range for something like front squats, back squats or some extra volume for bench. All basically assistance compounds. I&amp;#39;m trying to structure my progression in a better way than just &amp;quot;do 5x5 front squats after 531 back squats.\nAdditionally, what is your opinion of hitting the top amrap sets for multiple extra sets of the prescribed number? So if 325 for 5+ was easy but I would rather be conservative and not do too many joker sets, would it be a good idea to just hit a few extra sets of 325 for 5?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg51be2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978514.0, "created_utc": 1491949714.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tzwp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tzwp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54kxl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimWendler", "parent_id": "t1_dg532dr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I learn something every day I work with people.

I have my disagreements with them politically, but never once have I ever felt that those people whom I disagree with ever believed my life was worth less than theirs because of my Jewish background. Like I said, Waggener&amp;#39;s views are extremist and hateful. This isn&amp;#39;t a political topic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t expect you to talk about a candidate you endorse, or talk about your political views, I quite frankly don&amp;#39;t give a shit what they are and I don&amp;#39;t even expect you to openly condemn Waggener, but for fucks sake don&amp;#39;t reblog pieces from outright white supremacists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, it&amp;#39;s not even like the guy wrote a decent piece. The blog post you rehosted amounted to a fluff piece where he just said 5/3/1 worked for him because he&amp;#39;s a busy guy. Big fuckin whoop. You couldn&amp;#39;t have found someone who wasn&amp;#39;t an outright neo-Nazi to write that for you? I&amp;#39;ll tell you what, I&amp;#39;ve purchased and read every single one of your books and I&amp;#39;ve run just about every 5/3/1 variant out there so if you ever need someone to write a fluff review about anything 5/3/1 related I&amp;#39;ll personally write it so weak 4-plate squat having neonazis don&amp;#39;t have to do it for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t get into this here, but neonazis rely on this type of exposure to recruit others. You&amp;#39;re contributing to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you endorse his views, but what I do think is you&amp;#39;re unaware of the effect this has on people who would be in great danger if Waggener&amp;#39;s movement ever gained a foothold in society. If you weren&amp;#39;t politically illiterate this would be a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, thanks for all you&amp;#39;ve contributed to the sport and my goals. I just hope you think about the consequences of your actions and answers for those actions in the future based on the backlash you got for this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg65qax", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045028.0, "created_utc": 1492016228.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg55rkb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 66, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimWendler", "parent_id": "t1_dg54jwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We are talking training, not politics.
