But the side delts need at least about 6 sets per week of direct work to keep their size in most intermediate or advanced lifters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MEV:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most intermediate-advanced lifters need at least 8 sets of direct rear and side delt work per week to make gains. To be more specific, that\u2019s at least 6 sets of each if doing VERY isolation exercises that don\u2019t cross-target between rear and side delts and only 8 sets total if the exercise hits both adequately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MAV:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people respond best to between 16 and 22 weekly sets on average.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MRV:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people seem to encounter recovery problems above 26 sets per week. In reality, there will be a minority (but a substantial one) that can train with much higher volumes than this and still recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg61i4z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040544.0, "created_utc": 1492011744.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6zw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6zw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5w62p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheSecOH", "parent_id": "t1_dg5vhn1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, will do", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, will do&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg5w62p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034403.0, "created_utc": 1492005603.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5vhn1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "marcellonez", "parent_id": "t3_64y6zw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/weightroom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "probably should post on the daily thread", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;probably should post on the daily thread&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "weightroom", "name": "t1_dg5vhn1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033511.0, "created_utc": 1492004711.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
