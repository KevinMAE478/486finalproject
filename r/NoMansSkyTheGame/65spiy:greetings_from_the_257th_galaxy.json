Through this process it was found that all numbers up to 255 (for a total of 256 galaxies) spawned the player in a new, presumably unique galaxy, in the order that they appear through game play progression (at least as far as anyone playing legitimately was able to confirm). However, when the number 256 was entered, the galaxy spawned in was the same as that for when the number 255 was entered. Same for the number 257, 258 etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it was concluded that the number of galaxies was 256, and the game simply interpreted any input greater than 255 as some &amp;#39;max galaxy&amp;#39;, which was 255. It seemed like a reasonable conjecture, though as we have seen here, it turns out the underlying assumption for that was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoMansSkyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgdl7bv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470259.0, "created_utc": 1492441459.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhtgp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dabnis_UK", "parent_id": "t1_dgdgmli", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoMansSkyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think there is 256 galaxies, I'm not sure where that came from but this post seems to disprove it although I didn't see the evidence for there being 256 galaxies so I can't really make many judgements.
