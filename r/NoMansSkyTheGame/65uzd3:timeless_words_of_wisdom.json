Thank you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been busy with in the weeks since release:\n\u2022 A community/support management team has been brought on board.\n\u2022 Support issues raised are been categorised by that team, and we are fixing them in order of priority.\n\u2022 We\u2019ve released a bunch of patches for PC and PS4.\n\u2022 We\u2019ve written up patch notes for all those patches. You can find them here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What matters now, as always, is what we do rather than what we say. We\u2019re developers, and our focus is first on resolving any issues people have with the game as it is, then on future free updates which will improve, expand and build on the No Man\u2019s Sky universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a labour of love for us, and it\u2019s just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions please mail &lt;a href=\"mailto:feedback@hellogames.co.uk\"&gt;feedback@hellogames.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you,\nHello Games&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nomanssky.com/2016/09/development-update/\"&gt;https://www.nomanssky.com/2016/09/development-update/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Acting like those complaints didn&amp;#39;t directly lead to the first patch and the content it brought to the game is ignorant of reality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You give yourself, or at least those spewing hate, way too much credit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You give them not enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoMansSkyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgdon6d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474277.0, "created_utc": 1492445477.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdoh56", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HumbertoGecko", "parent_id": "t1_dgdn4bi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoMansSkyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Patches did not come because of hate, they came in spite of it.
