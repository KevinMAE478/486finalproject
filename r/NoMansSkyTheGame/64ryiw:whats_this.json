I replied to them saying that no, I did not have the limited edition, but that I had received the Photonix core and Boltcaster SM blueprints during normal play. I specifically asked why these items would be left as exclusive to the relatively small number of limited edition customers (limited print run), rather than simply making them immediately available to Limited Edition players, but earnable over time for all others - which seems logical.\n\nAnyway. I deliberately told them that I had those blue prints on my original game save (which I do), and wondered how I could obtain them now on a newer game - especially as the LE is effectively out of print now.\n\nBut to test whether the original release of the game allowed players to acquire the Photonix core and BoltcasterSM blueprints, they may have needed to revert to a earlier build for internal testing.\n\nNow, OK it's probably not that, but I was expecting an answer from them today, and got nothing.
