Now I have a job and what not, so I mean I played for a week....in the free time I had during that week.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nThen in 1.1 I got me a home planet and tried to build it up only to learn I need to research most everything and on survival finding the required mats needed for my builder was a massive PITA!  Spadonium too me over 25 systems to FINALLY find some!  UGH!  Which actually wasn&amp;#39;t until 1.2 was out!  So yeah played 1.1 for a solid 2 or 3 days then moved on.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nGot 1.2, FINALLY got spadonuim to progress my base research and actually got to building the land vehicles!  Enjoyed this quite a bit, explored a LOT of my home planet with them (eventually got all 3) and made good progress on base research!  Was going to actually build my base up a bit but started to feel a bit tedious gathering things for it and fizzled out after a good solid week of playing.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;\nI imagine with 1.3 I&amp;#39;ll come back to it for another 3-4days&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoMansSkyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgdud9h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480626.0, "created_utc": 1492451826.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_325lr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vjac", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdyf3h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Puck-Daddy", "parent_id": "t3_65vjac", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoMansSkyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "might as well go to the Center and teleport back.\nalso, go to the HUB and teleport back.\ngo to the Pilgrim Star and teleport back.\n\nthat way you have those as destinations for whenever something cool happens in those regions - just a thought.\n\n**HOW?**\n\nwarp from your base system to Black Hole.\ngo through - did it put you near the HUB ? if not, reload and try again.\n\neach warp journey originating from your Base can create a unique teleport destination up to 4 outbounds.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;might as well go to the Center and teleport back.\nalso, go to the HUB and teleport back.\ngo to the Pilgrim Star and teleport back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that way you have those as destinations for whenever something cool happens in those regions - just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;warp from your base system to Black Hole.\ngo through - did it put you near the HUB ? if not, reload and try again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;each warp journey originating from your Base can create a unique teleport destination up to 4 outbounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoMansSkyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgdyf3h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492485185.0, "created_utc": 1492456385.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_325lr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vjac", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge6b0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fiziix", "parent_id": "t3_65vjac", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoMansSkyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have no idea where I am haha.
