Why people insist on complain about how the game was suppose to be in their minds? This kinda of crap that makes HG go silent radio... The game was never supposed to be multiplayer, whatever Sean said on interview could have 1000 different interpretation, but obviously what people want is multiplayer, so lie confirmed! \n\nI will say this as clear as I can: I DON'T WANT PLANET ROTATION/TRANSLATION IN NO MAN SKY, and I tell you why you should either and if you want a game that have this feature go play Kerbal Space Program, it's a great game, but it only works with real gravity shit because they have time warp, unlike most movies (and games) tend to show in the space you don't want to be accelerating forever even if fuel isn't a problem, because the more speed you build, more speed you need to stop the ship, and I will not even start talking about faster than light (FTL) speed. So why NMS use a skybox for the sun and don't rotate planets? It's not because they wanted to lie or they can't do it, it's pretty easy actually, so why? Straight answer is visuals, but lets elaborate, so you play this game so that you can explore several planets in the system and then jump to another system? cool, then you realize that you CAN'T do it in a real system right? I mean, not in mere minutes like we can right now, the farthest planet I saw was like 3 or 4 minutes away from the station (where most of time is where you spawn). I will not explain the physics behind but this video illustrate my point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpOJ6fQ0roI\n\nOk but since we are in video game we can bend the rules and make our ship go faster and break \"harder\", right? Yes that would make up for space travels, but not visuals, the chance of planets near each other (without crashing in each other) would make near impossible to have visuals we have in the game, or very rare, so we don't have a real sun not because was a lie, but because it would require to have a real system. with planets that most of time would be so far away from each other that the game would be more boring than people already thing it is.\n\nSecond thing, space battle, while is arguable that the combat system in NMS is pretty crap, real space combat would be ever crappier, for those who watched The Martian, may remember one of the characters say that they would have to match they encounter speed to less than 5m/s because if it was 10 m/s it would be like catching a train or something like that. For those who played Kerbal, may know how fucking tiresome is to dock in a fucking station (without mods or alignment assists). But even with all that I can't even imagine how space combat would actually be like, even airplanes have rules and stuff but we have air resistance, earth gravity, a ground reference. So I can't really say that the way NMS combat is right now is crap, just that feels crap.\n\nI think Gas planets/ringed are like the sun, it would only be for visuals but it won't really would affect the game in any significant way, one time I got to a planet and it bugged on me, I could not see the ground, everything was blurry and \"gassy\" but I still could see structure waypoints, and also it din't let me land, so my first thought was, well that's a gas planet, but I got back to the space station, saved and restarted the game, when I tried again, the planet was fixed. So bottom line, I don't think it's worth the bother to add something like that just so that people feel that there's more than one type of planet.\n\nTL;DL I'm not criticizing the OP, on the contrary, I think people just have to let go of they dream game, because let's be honest, it's never gonna be what you really want to be, this is HG vision of a game, if it's faulty, lacking or whatever it's their vision. Also I'm not sure what OP mean by uncooperative game engine, have the OP ever worked on it to have this insight or are just assuming because they don't do every single thing people suggest in the reddit? If it's the latter I have to say I strong disagree with follow the suggestion of every post, yes you should have a north to what people expect from the game, but you need to have a game designer that understand the project, knows how to plan things and what expect what to expect in the future. So I pray that the HG game designer isn't guiding himself with the suggest/feedback post, because if that's the case the game it's pretty over to me.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ... Why people insist on complain about how the game was suppose to be in their minds? This kinda of crap that makes HG go silent radio... The game was never supposed to be multiplayer, whatever Sean said on interview could have 1000 different interpretation, but obviously what people want is multiplayer, so lie confirmed! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will say this as clear as I can: I DON&amp;#39;T WANT PLANET ROTATION/TRANSLATION IN NO MAN SKY, and I tell you why you should either and if you want a game that have this feature go play Kerbal Space Program, it&amp;#39;s a great game, but it only works with real gravity shit because they have time warp, unlike most movies (and games) tend to show in the space you don&amp;#39;t want to be accelerating forever even if fuel isn&amp;#39;t a problem, because the more speed you build, more speed you need to stop the ship, and I will not even start talking about faster than light (FTL) speed. So why NMS use a skybox for the sun and don&amp;#39;t rotate planets? It&amp;#39;s not because they wanted to lie or they can&amp;#39;t do it, it&amp;#39;s pretty easy actually, so why? Straight answer is visuals, but lets elaborate, so you play this game so that you can explore several planets in the system and then jump to another system? cool, then you realize that you CAN&amp;#39;T do it in a real system right? I mean, not in mere minutes like we can right now, the farthest planet I saw was like 3 or 4 minutes away from the station (where most of time is where you spawn).
