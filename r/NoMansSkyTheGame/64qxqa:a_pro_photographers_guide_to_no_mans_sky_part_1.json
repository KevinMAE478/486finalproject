What I should say is you want to think about every little thing you shoot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure we can have straight on &amp;quot;look at this&amp;quot; shots. They show exactly what you want to show and they get the job done, but if you want to create a pleasing image for the viewer, something that draws their eye? You&amp;#39;re going to want to move that camera. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swing that camera around, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to tilt it and trying some Portrait shots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit of getting used to the inverted axis but it can be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this first post I&amp;#39;ll cover just a couple of examples on the Planet Surface. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example 1 (Rest Stop) : &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/JoAKIFV.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/JoAKIFV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this shot I already had an idea of what I wanted,  I had to land where there was a ridge and birds with a moon in the background and grass in the fore. Construct a signal booster, activate it, take off, swing round and land again. Easy right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only once the ship touched down a second time had I activated Photo mode.\nI tilted the camera to portrait, lined it up as I wanted and started snapping.\n I suggest taking one shot, opening your capture gallery, rotating it (as it will be sideways) and looking at it before taking another, decide what you like or dislike about it and then go back to shooting. This game allows you time to do this, Real on the spot photography will not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have your desired shot framed crack off a few, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to adjust your height or POV, you can&amp;#39;t always get the shot you want from where you are, but you can always move to where you should be. Take wide shots, you can always crop and rotate after. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have a shot you like, start playing. Make it night time, change filters, add loads of fog and just have fun. Shoot what&amp;#39;s pleasing to you. If you&amp;#39;re anything like me anyway you&amp;#39;ll think of a different shot you wanted when you take off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure isn&amp;#39;t it always the way? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example 2 (Start again) : &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/DUphXVZ.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/DUphXVZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really like this shot, It reminds me of my first attempt at Permadeath mode, and my untimely death from fall damage shortly after taking it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically you don&amp;#39;t need a working ship for a good photo. I love the feel of a crash site, the flags, the billowing smoke from wreckage. It all adds to the composition of the image. Added to the inhospitable look of the planets surface this image feels like a cold and dangerous world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To create this shot I climbed a small ridge above the crash site and activated camera mode. I increased the cameras field of view to 150%. (This allows you to almost see the curvature of most planets from a height but will slightly warp things not centre frame). I positioned the camera slightly centre and right of the crash site. Tilted it slightly to the left at about 15\u00b0 so you can see the rise of the hill in the distance and vanishing trees in the frozen fog. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t use any filters but did decrease the fog for a clearer foreground. It&amp;#39;s a simple shot but I feel it shows exactly what I wanted for the feeling if this planet and game mode. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional Tips for on planet photography. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Adjusting time of day after choosing where you want the systems star is a great fine tuner for ambient light. (How ever this changes for each time you move the star)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Clouds don&amp;#39;t always ruin a shot, some people like a clear crisp sky, Some planets don&amp;#39;t look right without cloud cover. Move the percentage about along with the star and you could discover an epic sky all of your own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Tilting the camera changes the direction of plants and rain. (Yup) If you rotate your camera while close to your ship you&amp;#39;ll notice that the direction the grass and loose plants are growing changes with the camera, so will rain in a storm. While this seems silly it can give some great effects for making a storm look much stronger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Get Low, sometimes you can miss the little details in NMS&amp;#39;s terrain if you&amp;#39;re taking a shot from above. There are a lot of little details like flowers and rocks that make great foreground stars for an epic landing shot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Terrain is your friend. Make it work for you, if you&amp;#39;re not getting the desired composition, try a mile over the ridge. Use that land as a canvas and paint your scene. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for now shuttlebugs.
