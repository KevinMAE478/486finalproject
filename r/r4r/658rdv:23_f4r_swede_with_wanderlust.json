I also just found out I have the personality HSP (Highly Sensitive Person), which explains my absentmindedness and day-dreaming a lot : My mind has a hard time filtering everything I take in. As a result, my thoughts and senses are almost always on overdrive and will for instance instantly observe your behavior, way of talking, and (unfortunately) your weird habits. I catch subtle details that normal people would miss and if I don&amp;#39;t stop myself, I will overanalyze to a point where I am completely absorbed by my thoughts and disconnect from my surrounding. Having HSP is both a curse and a gift in many ways, a double-edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My main interests are to hang out with friends, outdoor life (like canoeing, camping, skiing, longboarding), street dance, play league of Legends, editing videos, music (just a keen listener as well as guitarist and pianist, saving the world excessive ear bleeding), watch loads of tv shows (favorites are GoT, TWD, Mr Robot, Sherlock, Rick and Morty, South park, House, Dexter and Modern Family so far) sociology, psychology and the global enviroment. The seed of becoming a psychologist has slowly been sown and grown for a couple of years, and I spent one semester last year in Ohio studying psychology and sociology. However I am torn between if I want a career in the psychology or sociology field. Both subjects are my passion but Sociology is a way for me to chanel and strengthen my open mind and empathy to understand the world and human condition. Above all, it is my way to use that knowledge to better myself and help maneuvering our world in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a huge wanderlust, settling down in this country never seems to please me or leave me serene cause I always yearn to live or travel around in other countries to broaden my perspective, knowledge and acceptance. In other words, to live out my passion for Culture. I see the US as my second home and I am considering to study there again in the near future, not at the same college this time though.
