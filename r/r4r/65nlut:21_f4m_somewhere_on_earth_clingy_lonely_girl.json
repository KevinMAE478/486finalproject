I often have nothing to do when I have vacations and days off work. I need some kind of mental stimulation because frankly I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like a potato.

I don&amp;#39;t think clingy and loyal is the same thing but I have no problem if you&amp;#39;re clingy. You have to be nice and not be cold when it comes to your personality or be unfeeling D: I don&amp;#39;t want you to be busy &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the time. A lot of the conversations I had with people couldn&amp;#39;t even start because the person was constantly busy with Wow, Lol, Cs:Go and Harry Potter books. How are we gonna be buddies if you don&amp;#39;t make any time for me? :c I understand if you have college stuff to do and have work to do but it irks me greatly to have responses delayed by days because you couldn&amp;#39;t even stop playing games for a moment to even say hello to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are mainly looking for a girlfriend don&amp;#39;t contact me. I&amp;#39;m open to a relationship but the chance of that happening is slim to the point that it&amp;#39;s more likely that aliens would come from space to work at McDonalds so they could sell just about anything and get away with it. Wait... that&amp;#39;s probably true o_o so yeah.. don&amp;#39;t count on it happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I am mainly after &lt;strong&gt;friendship&lt;/strong&gt; it does not matter to me what you look like or where in the world you live. What I&amp;#39;m looking for in a potential boyfriend (very small chance of that happening) is someone that looks at least average, at least 19 years old, not a NEET (job searching is fine) and doesn&amp;#39;t do drugs. I have nothing against drug users but I don&amp;#39;t want my first boyfriend to be one. I&amp;#39;m not hot but I&amp;#39;m certainly not disgusting to look at. I&amp;#39;m not mean and I am very loyal. If we end up being friends or something more I won&amp;#39;t ditch you if someone else comes along. I don&amp;#39;t drink or do drugs and cigarette smoke makes me feel sick almost immediately so that&amp;#39;s out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna get my hopes up too high but if we do end up being great pals or click very well I would like to speak to you so having a mic is needed. I do like to share pictures of my room and other stuff that doesn&amp;#39;t seem boring. I won&amp;#39;t send pictures of myself unless I actually start to know you though. The idea of strangers having my picture makes me very uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t get any good results I&amp;#39;m just going to accept it. I see people post the same post daily and I wish they&amp;#39;d stop so I&amp;#39;m not going to do the same thing.

If you do send me your skype actually check it. I&amp;#39;ve had people tell me their skype and they never even sign in to see my friend request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are interested just message me telling me why you think we could be good friends.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uh oh...
