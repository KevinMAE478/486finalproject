I love to laugh and do so a lot. I&amp;#39;ll be the first to admit that I&amp;#39;m picky when it comes to letting people in. I\u2019m a hugely loyal person and I value it immensely in others. I\u2019ve always had a pretty strong work ethic so that is also something I value a lot in others. I\u2019m pretty self aware and try to be introspective any time I can be.

These things include world travel, dogs, a lot of delicious hole in the wall restaurants, a lot of amazing (live) music, and a lot of hiking and camping.
