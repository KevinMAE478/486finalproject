Nothing really substantially stuck around. I mostly got people who were focused in on my kinks and tendencies toward being submissive. That&amp;#39;s fine I suppose. I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m looking for anything serious or not so I always welcome things that are short term or casual. Hell, friendships are probably what I primarily need right now. But still I kind of feel weird about potentially having several people pursuing me for sex or something short term. My focus would be better spent on one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways. I&amp;#39;m 23. 5&amp;#39;4. I live in New York. I spent a lot of my earlier years messing around and not taking life seriously. Now I&amp;#39;m a full time student and working part time. I live in my own home and I have a very clear view of where I want my life to go. While I&amp;#39;m not sure about whether or not I&amp;#39;m staying in New York, I am sure that in the next 2-3 years I&amp;#39;ll be on the right track for finishing school and getting on board with the career that I&amp;#39;ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should add that I do have two kids. One that lives with me full time, and one that doesn&amp;#39;t live with me. I don&amp;#39;t like to discuss this or entertain the possibility of my kids being involved in meeting anybody that I see unless I&amp;#39;ve been seeing them for a year or longer. Just figured I&amp;#39;d throw that in there for those who are going in a different direction in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoy reading, playing games, sewing, working with my hands, writing, music (I&amp;#39;m a pianist), fitness (I&amp;#39;m at the gym daily and keep myself in good shape), enjoying the beautiful Hudson Valley, and cooking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am kinky and have a submissive side. After a negative experience recently I&amp;#39;ve kind of gravitated away from that aspect of my life. So it isn&amp;#39;t a necessity and certainly not the main motivator for me posting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re interested just send me a message. Hopefully something works out. I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and post a &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/njifK\"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of me/my &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Mlxfm\"&gt;face&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who is curious or wanted one. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I posted not long ago and got a few messages.
