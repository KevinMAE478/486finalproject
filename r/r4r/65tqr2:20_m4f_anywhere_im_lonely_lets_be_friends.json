I&amp;#39;m John. I post somewhat frequently here now, but I&amp;#39;m still in search of good friends.

Awesome. Looking for more? Awesome. I&amp;#39;m super chill and my personality is to just go with whatever the person I&amp;#39;m talking to wants. Want to complain? I&amp;#39;ll listen to you rant. Want to send each other selfies? I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re beautiful. Want to escalate things? I&amp;#39;ll go at your pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Humor. I consider humor my biggest asset. In my day to day connections it tends to hurt me, because people often don&amp;#39;t take me serious. But I&amp;#39;m sure that I can make you laugh (also guaranteed or your money back\u2122)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A lasting connection.

All the memes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m looking for:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, as I said above, I&amp;#39;m not really picky when it comes to what I want. I mostly just go with what makes you happy. However, I would prefer someone who wants to stay in frequent communication, even if it&amp;#39;s just text. I would prefer if you include a picture of yourself, though it&amp;#39;s definitely not necessary. I also would like a brief description of you so I can learn what you&amp;#39;re like. Other than that, I don&amp;#39;t really care about where you live, and I&amp;#39;m fine with whatever you&amp;#39;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a pretty diverse guy, I consider myself a jack of all trades. I&amp;#39;m above average at most things I do. However, I really enjoy music, making it, listening, and collecting it. I also love food, though I can&amp;#39;t cook well. I&amp;#39;m always up for travel, whether it be an outdoor adventure or exploring a new city.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hobbies!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Music! Share your music collection with me, I love finding new artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gaming! I mostly play League of Legends and Hearthstone currently but I love all games as well as game theory. Talk to me about whatever games you&amp;#39;re interested in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exploring! I love taking road trips and finding new places. Whether it be abandoned buildings or beautiful nature I&amp;#39;m so down to adventure it. I hope to travel to as many countries as I can in my life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing!&lt;br/&gt;\nI write fiction stories. Come talk to me about books you&amp;#39;ve read, poems you like, or even stuff that you&amp;#39;ve written yourself.

I don&amp;#39;t really like to brag, but if intelligence is your thing, I think I&amp;#39;d suffice. Ask and I&amp;#39;ll even send you the news article about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I made two huge mistakes recently. One involving a road trip and the other involving telling a redditor about said road trip.
