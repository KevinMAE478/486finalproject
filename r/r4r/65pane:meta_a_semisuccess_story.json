It was a breath of fresh air from the college hookup culture I was wrapped up in. He included his Skype name, and I immediately added him. I was worried about whether or not he would add me back on Skype as I was currently using my throwaway sexting Skype with an obvious throwaway sexting Skype name. But eventually, I got a message from him, causing me to click on the conversation and showing he accepted me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We opened up to each other immediately. Mainly, about our mutual struggles with mental illness. Him, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression. Me, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression, body dysmorphic disorder. I shared with him my biggest secret: that I, at the time, posted my nudes to a porn subreddit (hence the throwaway Skype).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take the plunge and asked, &amp;quot;Wanna call?&amp;quot; We started off in a voice call only. I vividly remember talking about music we like, me trying to seem like a bigger rap/hip-hop fan than I was. When asked my favorite rapper, I told the truth--G-Eazy (my celebrity crush). We laughed over how bad he is, and how basic my rap tastes are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We moved to video call. I started laughing out of nervousness, he responded to my laughter with the joke &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not that ugly don&amp;#39;t laugh,&amp;quot; as I watched the Skype screen load his image. He was fucking adorable! He looked even better than the picture, and his first response to seeing me is that I &amp;quot;look more beautiful than [I] do in my pictures.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stayed up until 5am that night. I, having stopped attending lectures for my Intro to Oceanography class, was studying until 3 am. We watched an episode of House, one of his favorite if not his favorite show, and I kept getting grossed out at the gore. After my studying, we watched Disney classic Heavyweights, which would become the basis of many of our inside jokes (where the portly adolescents at). He would later tell me that he fell in love with me while watching it together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stayed up late the next night, watching movies and talking. The next day, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. Not too much longer into the relationship, we said &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first month was pure bliss. Talking, playing League and Hearthstone, watching Stranger Things every day. I had never been happier. I trolled his friends in their Discord, friends that I would later become friends with as well. The inside jokes we had would often evolve to where every 5 minutes we were referencing an inside joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. He was hot as Hell, tall, bearded, tatted, funny, caring, romantic, considerate. He would send me good morning/good night texts that read like love letters. He called me beautiful and cute all the time. He was my go-to for any problem I had. He said he would never leave me, and we were talking marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over Christmas break, I met his sister, brother, and dad over Skype. That same break, my parents approved me purchasing a plane ticket to visit him over Spring break, a decision they would later retroactively rescind, deciding he could fly out here for his Spring break and our birthdays (which are 5 days apart).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks after my Christmas break ended, my Grandma passed away. That signaled a change in our relationship. My depression started exhibiting itself in full force. My panic attacks started happening more often. I became clingier, wanting more time in the day that we would Skype. My mom was recovering from major surgery all the while. I quit my job due to my depression. I started gaining more and more free time as I quit more and more activities, and wanted more and more time with my boyfriend.\nMy depression reached an apex when I had an aborted suicide attempt during a family therapy session. I was admitted to the psychiatric hospital for a week, all the while my patient boyfriend was there for me and my multiple phone calls a day and multiple Facebook messages a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The relationship was different when I got out. I wasn&amp;#39;t better enough to be in the relationship. But we still dating nevertheless. I was convinced that he was unattracted to me, as he would watch porn. I didn&amp;#39;t believe that he loved me. I needed every minute of his free time to be with me. If he and I stopped a call, minutes later I would start having a panic attack. I was trying to get him to mutually masturbate with me even when he was talking with friends. I was addicted to him. I just wanted more and more. He became more and more distant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, I cut myself during a call because he wouldn&amp;#39;t talk to me as I wasn&amp;#39;t telling him what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, he broke up with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An hour later, I tried to kill myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him what I was doing and he contacted my roommate who contacted my parents who contacted 911. I was back in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I was released, I would harass him with random text message sprees, switching between begging him to come back and berating him for leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started seeing another girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he messaged me out of the blue one day about his depression, the conversation progressed to where I threatened suicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the midst of my break-up coping, my new meds kicked in. I stopped having panic attacks. I had a new found confidence. I became sane again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything seems clear in my world now. I see how crazy I was \nacting. I see everywhere I went wrong. I see how I drove him away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My therapist made me block his phone number and block him on all social media in order to get over him, because whenever I thought about him I would get hysterical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t talk to me now, and frankly, I don&amp;#39;t blame him. Two days ago I begged him to give me a second chance, spurred by a recent r4r post by him. No response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I write this to show that r4r works. But, I also write this to say that when you find someone truly special, be grateful. Don&amp;#39;t drive them away. When you find someone that could be the one, don&amp;#39;t let go and don&amp;#39;t make them leave. Every second you spend together is special.
