Our laundry room is on the third floor and the house came with a drain pan.  However, we splurged and bought an LG Wm5000hva with a pedestal washer (sidekick) and the clearance to the ground is very minimal from the lowest point on the drawer (about 1/4 inch).  The drain pan lip is about 1.25 inches high&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the delivery people haven&amp;#39;t yet installed the washer and dryer and gave us a few days to try and sort it out.  We could either go without a pan and sign some forms releasing them of liability, or try to find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone dealt with this issue before?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of googling suggests I could either:\n1) get a pan with a removable front&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) get anti vibration pads that elevate the whole unit by 1-1.5&amp;quot; to get clearance.  This may cause our washer to walk when it&amp;#39;s spinning at high speed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I checked out the &amp;quot;low profile&amp;quot; Plastic GE washer tray that Home Depot has and it&amp;#39;s still too high.
