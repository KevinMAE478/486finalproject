When you&amp;#39;re searching the net, you&amp;#39;re looking for a &amp;quot;Post base&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find these products in construction supply stores not your local Home Depot.  Also the guys working in these stores tend to know their shit and will help you find the right bolts and concrete screws etc... they certainly helped me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT - Upon looking again, it doesn&amp;#39;t look like they make the decorative version for 8x8 posts, but they do for the hidden one.  But there are more out there... for instance my local Lee Valley sells 6x6 (doesn&amp;#39;t help you) versions of &lt;a href=\"http://www.leevalley.com/en/wood/page.aspx?p=73946&amp;amp;cat=1,71685,73945\"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another option you can try if you&amp;#39;re looking for more decorative options, my buddy who sells high end finished lumber recommended... to just call up one of your local timber frame home builders and see what kind of post bases they use and where they get them from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dg82uin", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140454.0, "created_utc": 1492111654.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655q9k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655q9k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg95ihx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "maj-1971", "parent_id": "t1_dg85rct", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "About $220 each from Stine builders supply", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $220 each from Stine builders supply&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dg95ihx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206841.0, "created_utc": 1492178041.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85rct", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ragewu", "parent_id": "t3_655q9k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have been looking for 8x8 cedar posts, what did they run you?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for 8x8 cedar posts, what did they run you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dg85rct", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143636.0, "created_utc": 1492114836.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655q9k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg87ucr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PinkRhino", "parent_id": "t3_655q9k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Here's a bunch of options.](https://www.strongtie.com/capsandbases_woodconnectors/category)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.strongtie.com/capsandbases_woodconnectors/category\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a bunch of options.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dg87ucr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492145985.0, "created_utc": 1492117185.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655q9k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8izwf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "idontthinkyoudo", "parent_id": "t3_655q9k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dg8izwf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160604.0, "created_utc": 1492131804.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655q9k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8k4i1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Phelebas", "parent_id": "t3_655q9k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good answers so far. \n\nI use [these](https://shop.titanbuildingproducts.com/post-anchors-8x8.php) sometimes.
