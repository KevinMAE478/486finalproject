Everything is wireless, so you won't have to worry about running wires through walls, just stick the sensors on your doors/windows.  Once you've got everything set up you call them and they test your system remotely, once it checks out your good to go, it was simple, and very inexpensive to get everything set up.  There are a number of companies like this now, you can probably even find one local to you if you need more hands on help getting set up.

Personally, I&amp;#39;ve used Frontpoint Security (frontpointsecurity.com) for the past 6ish years in 3 different homes and have been very pleased.  They are a monitored DIY solution, so when you sign up, they go over your needs in terms of sensors based on your homes layout; they&amp;#39;ll send you a package with all the sensors, the control panel, anything extra you may want/need (I have a garage door sensor, and a flood sensor in my basement), and instructions to install yourself.  Everything is wireless, so you won&amp;#39;t have to worry about running wires through walls, just stick the sensors on your doors/windows.  Once you&amp;#39;ve got everything set up you call them and they test your system remotely, once it checks out your good to go, it was simple, and very inexpensive to get everything set up.  There are a number of companies like this now, you can probably even find one local to you if you need more hands on help getting set up.
