One project at a time. Most urgent first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask around on your local subreddit. Maybe there is a plumber who just moved to town and doesn&amp;#39;t have a full time job lined up who would be willing to work cheap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are the windows cracked and broken or just don&amp;#39;t open? If it is the latter, they go farther down the list. Is the mold terrifying and on every surface or just ugly? If it is the latter, it goes farther down the list. Is the water heater broken or just a little leak in one of the pipes? If it is the latter, wrap some $4 leak stop tape around it and remember to fix it properly in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You bought a fixer-upper, unless you have a bunch of money to throw at it, it&amp;#39;ll take some time to get everything done. It sounds like you want someone to come do everything for you for free; that isn&amp;#39;t going to happen. Your house, your responsibility.
