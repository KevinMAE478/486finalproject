While he may have done things right, adn left a gap between teh sheetrock and subfloor for just this situation, most people have the sheetrock within 1/2&amp;quot; of the floor, and I would not be hopeful that the water did not at least get up to the sheetrock in some spots.  I would not take his word that the water did not hit the sheetrock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, your baseboards probably are going to need to be replaced, especially if they are MDF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, I would demand a new inspection on his nickel and/or an insurance claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dont let your strong desire to own this house allow you to accept a potential 5 figure liability with you just taking his word for it.  If he flips, he may not have bought the proper home insurance that would cover water damage, and thus might be doing this out of pocket and thus in the cheapest manner possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dgdx07p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492483582.0, "created_utc": 1492454782.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w5ws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge61cc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IAmNotARobot0010", "parent_id": "t3_65w5ws", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would close conditionally on a third party inspection of the cleaned up room ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would close conditionally on a third party inspection of the cleaned up room &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "HomeImprovement", "name": "t1_dge61cc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493891.0, "created_utc": 1492465091.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql97", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w5ws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeaf6b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "three_martini_lunch", "parent_id": "t3_65w5ws", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1.
