So last year around May, I noticed a dark spot in the corner of one of the bedrooms.  It turns out there was a leak.  So I called the only roofing company around this area (I live in a tiny town).  I was told to get an estimate from my insurance company.  So I did that and had to wait about 2 weeks for the estimate to arrive in the mail.  Then I called the roofers, and they said they couldn&amp;#39;t schedule me for about 2 months (end of July). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two months go by and by then this spot is now a full on leak that leaks like a faucet when it rains hard enough.  I ended up having to move everything in the room to one side to avoid damage.  Finally the roofers come and fix a tiny spot, and after everything is said and done and after insurance it costs me around $3000.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we got some pretty heavy rain and it still leaks!  So I end up calling the roofers who want to charge me to come out and fix it again.  I explain how they were just here and must not have fixed the right spot.  I end having to wait til early september for them to come out and fix the roof again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally it seems fixed, but there wasn&amp;#39;t a very heavy rain to really test this out.  Or much rain at all with it being September.  The roof does fine over the winter, although there wasn&amp;#39;t much for snow.  Now fastforward to today.  There is some heavy rain and that same spot is leaking again! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m at a total loss of what to do.  I can&amp;#39;t afford another $3000 to get it fixed all over again and based off the experience with that company I know I&amp;#39;m basically going to get jerked around and doubt they will even fix it in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone tell me if they would even be liable in anyway?  There wasn&amp;#39;t any extra damage done over this time that I can tell as the weather has been pretty lax since they last &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; the spot.  I plan to call them but would it be worth calling a lawyer at all?
