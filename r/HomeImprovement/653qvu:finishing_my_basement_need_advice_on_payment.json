I had been using the space unfinished, unheated as my work from home office for about two years. With this past winter being freezing down there, I decided it was time to make the space comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I hired some contractors to finish the basement. Originally they quoted me at $38k. After some discussion, the price settled on $30k. I paid $1k deposit and provided a loan preapproval that would cover the rest of the work, showing I could and would pay the remainder at time of completion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The floorplan was pretty simple. My house was built in 2015, so the basement was updated. As I actively used it since moving in as my office, it was well maintained. Walls and ceiling were insulated, had a vapor barrier, had no pipes or support beams in the way, and a tall ceiling. This made it straight forward to finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the estimation was itemizing the materials that would likely be necessary. This is where part of my problems start. They estimated everything way too high. 24 wall panels (greenboard), 160 steel studs, 13 recessed lights, 60 rolls of insulation. At the time, I had no idea these numbers were so high. After tracking their work, and seeing all the studs go in, insulation, and drywall I counted 50 steel studs, 4 wall panels, 6 tubes of insulation all unused and they took them away. They also were finishing my basement stairwell, putting in a 14&amp;#39; handrailing on one side, the other side was supposed to be opened up with a railing and spindles, with about 5&amp;#39; of railing. So they estimated they&amp;#39;d need a 14&amp;#39; and an 8&amp;#39; handrail. They accidentally cut the 14&amp;#39; for the 5&amp;#39; part, and now the railing isn&amp;#39;t long enough to fit the other side. The guy said he was planning to leave it like that, with only the first four steps having any railing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other issues along the way as well. I asked for two circuits, one for the area where I&amp;#39;d have my desk for all my computers and equipment (which would have 4 outlets) and the rest of the room would be on a separate circuit containing 7 outlets. They didn&amp;#39;t listen to me and instead extended off an existing outlet in my basement to add the outlets near where my desk will be. This will be a problem very easily, as that was the outlet I was already using for my computers and I would cause the circuit to flip because that circuit is used for utilities. They also only ended up using 8 ceiling lights instead of 13.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original sketch drawn was also not followed very closely. Both soffits that were put in don&amp;#39;t match the plan. One of them now drops covering about 3&amp;quot; of the top of one of my windows, which is a big deal in a basement. The other soffit was supposed to run the entire length of the room, primarily for aesthetics and that only runs the length of the pipe it covers, which is about 75% of the wall, and then it just ends. This soffix was also supposed to be accessible, as I have pluming behind it. I had specifically asked for it to be accessible either with a hinge, door, or use ceiling tiles below it and they agreed and said they&amp;#39;d make sure it was accessible. They ended up putting pine boards all around it, using finishing nails and industrial adhesive to seal the soffit shut, basically locking me out for good unless I take a saw or sledgehammer. The wall paneling was also not applied correctly, I had wanted sound dampening insulation panels used on all sides of my little office cutout to block the sound from my A/C outside and the HVAC/fan/dehumidifer/water heater on the other wall. They ended up putting these panels on the wall with utilities and then against a concrete wall that is a shared wall with my neighbor (I live in a condo). That means these (expensive) panels I paid for are now uselessly installed on a wall I didn&amp;#39;t need to care about insulating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other issues I had along the way. The 2.5&amp;quot; steel studs they used for the interior walls are too short. I wanted to eventually finish the other side of basement, but they used these small studs that don&amp;#39;t wrap around the support beams in my basement fully (which are a standard 4&amp;quot; diameter). Now if I want to finish the other side of the wall, I&amp;#39;d have to put two panels of drywall up or something. I had told them originally that if this went well I&amp;#39;d hire them to finish that side, and even got a quote to finish that side of the basement (far less complicated side) for $7k. So they knew it was in my plans before even starting to order any parts. This one just erks me a lot, because it skrews me more than the other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this isn&amp;#39;t every little issue. Other things they already said they&amp;#39;d fix. I asked for a light to be added to the closet they created, which was originally estimated but forgotten by them; and some extra outlet boxes left empty because I plan to run my own cables for speakers and ethernet (steel studs require special mounting brackets), etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now comes the issue I face. With all of these considerations, I feel I should be due some discount. The material cost for everything originally was estimated to be $22k (this is taking their itemized list of materials, then using HomeDepot.com to create a cart for everything). Based on the actual numbers used, it&amp;#39;s closer to $16k (being generous). On top of the clearly overestimated materials necessary, not following the sketch planned and agreed to leaves me in a poor position when it&amp;#39;s done. I either need them to fix it or I just stick with the problems (possibly ask to reduce the final amount due to these problems as well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions are: (1) How should I go about discussing these problems with them? (2) What would be a fair amount of money to ask them to reduce the total by?
