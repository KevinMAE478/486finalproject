So similarly, I would imagine people like Paul Rudd more than a model because they&amp;#39;ve seen him play that cute nice quiet guy-next-door he always plays and find that appealing. I think it&amp;#39;s not about fame, it&amp;#39;s about the image people have of him due to the characters he portrays.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;some of the most attractive guys actually, &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HKx7vjp.gif\"&gt;better thank me&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;wow not everyone is into the same thing, what a novel concept&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LadyBoners", "name": "t1_dg4zk6g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976295.0, "created_utc": 1491947495.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4wlyi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hardstyle_Shuffle", "parent_id": "t1_dg4v3i9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LadyBoners", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am just curious to find out what looks women prefer most and why. so what if I am not a girl? it shouldn t make any differences, I posted photos of attractive guys...some of the most attractive guys  actually, better thank me. . \"no-personality pants model pics\" https://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBoners/comments/64frae/young_paul_rudd/ ,how does this pic has lower personality then that one?
