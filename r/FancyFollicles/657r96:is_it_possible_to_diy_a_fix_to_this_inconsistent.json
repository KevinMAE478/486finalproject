To me, it looks like a pretty easy fix, but I have experience with hair. It could go a lot of different ways and I think it would be rather complicated for you to do on your own. Plus, you have quite a lot of hair. \n\nEssentially yes you need to bleach your hair pretty light and then you can either leave it blonde or dye over it. \n\nWhen bleaching, you would want to apply to all of the length first and leave it on for maybe 30-40 minutes (avoiding the blonde blotch) and then apply the bleach to the blonde spot and your roots for maybe another 10 minutes because those areas will lighten much more quickly (watch them and be careful because they will turn white fast, especially the roots!!!!!). You are going to have to judge when to apply to your roots and the blonder spot (you should apply to the blonde spot 10 min before the roots because the heat from your head makes the bleach lighten your roots really fast) and when to wash it out to try to make it even and successful. You'll want to have your head wrapped to keep the heat in to help process throughout. As your hair bleaches it will first turn orange and then yellow and then white. You want to get past the orange but not all the way to white - you'll want it to look yellow when you're ready to wash it out. So apply to blonde spot and then the roots when your hair is still in the orange phase\n\nI recommend that you just use L'Or\u00e9al F\u00e9ria extreme platinum (box) (you can buy it at like any store) but you should honestly probably buy 3. You have a lot of hair and don't want to run out. Can return the last box if not needed.\n\nAfterwards I would recommend dying it with a wella gel color charm dye, something that will make it darker but not quite as dark as your natural hair color. I'm going to tentatively recommend mixing in equal parts a level 7 ash blonde with a level 7 neutral. You will have to buy lvl 20 developer to mix that with as well as a bowl and brush and gloves. You don't really need to use the brush, you can use your hands to saturate the hair. \n\nIf you still need to tone it afterwards I would recommend using Argan oil one n only demi gloss at a level 10. I'm not sure what tone it would end up needing, it may not need it at all.\n\nThis is all tentative because the pics provided only show so much and I don't know what the color will turn out like after you bleach it. If you want to talk over kik I could help walk you through it as you go? Normally you have to judge each step as it goes in case things don't turn out as expected. Or you can pm me.
