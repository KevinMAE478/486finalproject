The gray faded out after the first wash but left me with a nice silver color that was easily maintained with purple shampoo. After about three months (because I always get bored), I thought since I already had a nice even canvas, I would go for a crazy color. We used Redken city beats to get my hair blue, and I maintained it by using overtone in extreme blue. About three months later, I decided I wanted to go lilac. I started trying to strip the color out of my hair for about two weeks before my appointment but was still left with what looked like galaxy hair: a mix of light blue and purple streaks. When I went to the salon, we bleached it, and my new growth went yellow and my ends turned green. We used color correction by applying a red toner all over to neutralize the green to get it light enough to cover, and I ended up leaving with a dark purple instead of lilac, which I was fine with. After about my third wash I noticed that my roots were lighter than the rest of my hair, and this is where my nightmare starts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the rest of my hair was fading to the lilac color I originally wanted, my roots were fading to an orange color. I read that this was most likely because my roots weren&amp;#39;t lifted enough and could be because we used a red toner to neutralize my hair, which left my roots a nice strawberry blonde. So I decided to bleach a few test patches on my hair, and then use the direct dye (a mix of Joico Intensity in violet and indigo) and see if I could get the roots purple. I bleached the sections to a pale blonde yellow and applied the direct dye. However, instead of taking the purple as hoped, they just went right back to the orange color, now with a hint of pink. I was so frustrated at this point that I just decided to leave it alone until my next hair appointment. In order to make the orange manageable, I would just use the direct dyes on my roots every time after I washed my hair (about once a week) as my ends didn&amp;#39;t really need the color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to the salon and told her I wanted to go as blonde as possible, aware that I might have to go through the yellow stage first. We bleached my roots first as they were the darkest, and then blended the bleach down to my ends for the last 5 minutes, as they were such a light purple that that was all they needed to turn white. After washing, we bleached my roots again because they didn&amp;#39;t lift enough the first time. After washing again, we applied a pearl shade toner in the bowl and left it for 5 minutes. When it was all said and done, my hair was a beautiful pearl color, and the ordeal only took about 3 hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I washed my hair about 4 days after with a sulfate free purple shampoo, and as soon as I got out of the shower, I knew something was wrong. My roots looked orange, but the rest of my hair looked white. After blow drying, there was a very obvious line of demarcation, and the top was a banana yellow, while the bottom was white. I called my hairstylist and she agreed to fix it. I went back exactly a week later, and she re-bleached the yellow sections, and this time I was able to see the final color, which was a super pale yellow. This time we used a mix of pearl and violet toners that we left on for 30 minutes, and when I left my hair was uniformly white. WELL, of course, after washing it again, the toner came out, and while my hair is not nearly as yellow as it was, it definitely does not match the bottom of my hair. So after trying to use various purple shampoos and masks, I picked up some Wella T18 toner and 20 vol. cream developer, and applied it to my roots for 30 minutes, and only pulled it through my ends in the last 5 to make it evenly colored.  While it did take out some of the yellow, my roots are still considerably darker than the ends (which are now a silver color), and I have no idea what to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always gotten my hair professionally done and just did basic upkeep at home, but I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem like this before. Why isn&amp;#39;t my hair holding onto toner, and is something to do with the bleach being used? The salon is a Redken certified salon if that helps? I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem getting my hair to take color or keep color and this is so frustrating. Any help is appreciated!
