During my VACation I had to prime a new account (I had a second account, but it was linked to the same cell# soooo it got banned too)\nDuring my non-primetime I usually played with 4-5 stacks on my side and about 2/3 games had suspected hackers, and about half of those said games had blatant spinbots or wallhacks, rarely &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; an aimbot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has likely not been an constructive post, but I had to rant about my ban a little, since I could not actually post here when I -was- banned due to the rules. for us unknown people it apparently takes 70+ days of non-support to get the ban reviewed and actually removed - I do hope someone who has an illegitimate ban gets some, well, hope back from reading this\nKeep on reporting them cheaters, even if innocents occasionally do get caught it is worth it (though I admittedly was VERY upset during these weeks of being banned, and apparently lied to)\nSee you back in primeMM! Lost a ton of ranks because I &amp;#39;played with a cheater&amp;#39; down to MGE so I am now a smurf on my main account :(\nnot to mention all my friends lost 2-3 ranks too, but meh!\nrant over, sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: \nI got VAC banned, removed after 75 days. Salty about it so ranted a little&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "name": "t1_dgc80ok", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388870.0, "created_utc": 1492360070.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65onm3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgct7gg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rddsos", "parent_id": "t1_dgcq4bp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GlobalOffensive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Feel free to donate skins [here](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198245662474) :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to donate skins &lt;a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198245662474\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "name": "t1_dgct7gg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492416987.0, "created_utc": 1492388187.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcq4bp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cysun", "parent_id": "t1_dgcl50m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GlobalOffensive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Please, dude.
