No, it&amp;#39;s not based on Panorama and it doesn\u2019t have any relation to what Valve might be working on. You can watch a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clxml6Pkrc8\"&gt;video of it here&lt;/a&gt;. No, this is not how the final version will look. What you will see here is just its current form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we get into details, let&amp;#39;s jump into a time machine and go back to 2015, during CCS / PGL Season 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the CCS debut, we were very happy to see that the crazy ideas we had were well received by the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But among the feedback we were getting, there was one that always stuck out: the fact that the Picture in Picture screens were covering the team info blocks, even if only for a couple of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that the PiP screens were created with new viewers in mind (who don\u2019t yet know the tactical importance of one dot on the radar going left instead of right), we considered this to be a trade-off worth having in order to better visually indicate a flank, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, after Cologne 2016 we decided to return to the drawing board with pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While iterating through various solutions, the most tempting one was to move the PiP screens exclusively in the top-right corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This way, newer viewers would know that if something was happening somewhere else on the map, it would be shown there, while veterans would get to see the team info blocks all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One problem though: this meant covering up the killfeed pretty often. Something we already knew was a big no-no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there was the bottom-center area (where the Off-screen action PiP resided), but that didn\u2019t go well in internal testing either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we were in a situation where we had extra information that we wanted to show, but no free real estate for it. And there was no way around it, because the HUD elements were fixed. They couldn\u2019t be changed or moved\u2026 right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For us, the idea of having a custom CS:GO HUD goes back all the way to the DreamHack Cluj-Napoca 2015 Major, when we first implemented the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3qu4s3/pgl_arena_effects_clujnapoca_major/\"&gt;Arena Effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course, back then we were more concerned with not burning the whole building down when a bomb went off. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, almost a year later, we realized that the existing HUD was no longer a limiting factor. We could reshape it into something that could have the best of both worlds. And knowing that this was going to be a very sensitive matter for everyone involved, we set a number of strict design guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The new HUD must show at least the same information as the original&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The layout must be as close to the original as possible. Don\u2019t move stuff around just because we can&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If we do have to move stuff around, make sure there\u2019s very good reason for it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The PiP screens have to cover as little as possible of the on-screen information. Preferably none&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And after months of work, dozen of iterations and feedback integration (shoutout to Sadokist, HenryG, Natu, RedEye, Machine and Thorin for the initial peer review), the &lt;strong&gt;Adaptable Broadcast HUD&lt;/strong&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; that you see here is final. This is just the &lt;strong&gt;current&lt;/strong&gt; state of the ABH, reached through internal testing and a \u201cclosed beta\u201d phase, not its final form :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now then...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from finding a layout that could house both our features and the information CSGO players are relying on when viewing a match, another goal with the ABH was to maximize what we call \u201caction space\u201d: the area where stuff generally happens on screen during the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that end, we chose the crosshair as a focal point and started to clear space around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did this by:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moving the team info blocks down to the corners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consolidating the spectated player info in the center of the screen (Health, Armor, Ammo, Gear, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moving the player picture / cam over the currently active weapon - this also had the added benefit of being &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://major.pglesports.com/media/sniper-scope-flashed-off-screen.jpg\"&gt;out of the way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; when a player is scoped&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, the ABH is divided into five main information blocks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Match&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Radar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Killfeed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Team Info&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Spectated Player Info&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we had everything laid out, we started to add information that we felt will improve the viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, the &lt;strong&gt;Match Info&lt;/strong&gt; block at the top has indicators for the number of &lt;strong&gt;Pistol Rounds&lt;/strong&gt; won by each team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re still on the fence if we\u2019re going to keep it there or not, but the idea behind it is that when someone jumps in on the stream, they will immediately know how many pistol rounds a team won up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Series score (if needed), format and tournament phase have also been included to pinpoint the match in the overall event, without the need to check brackets or the stream title.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;Team Info&lt;/strong&gt; blocks, we decided to do away with the personal photos and add &lt;strong&gt;player and team money instead&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as &lt;strong&gt;player status and IGL indicators&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that now viewers can see if someone is flashed, smoked or on fire even if they\u2019re not currently spectated. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://major.pglesports.com/media/sniper-scope-flashed-off-screen.jpg\"&gt;Like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as PiP screens go, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://major.pglesports.com/media/crowd-reaction.jpg\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is how a shot of the audience will look like after a huge play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;adaptable&lt;/em&gt; part of the HUD means that we can tweak, add or remove any element on screen as we see fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Information can be displayed as needed, rotated in and out at set times (the team money indicator currently disappears when the buy time is done) or at specific events (player status indicators), so there\u2019s plenty of flexibility in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During replays, we can keep just the Match and Spectated Player blocks. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://major.pglesports.com/media/replay.jpg\"&gt;Like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since a video is always worth a thousand screenshots, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clxml6Pkrc8\"&gt;here are two rounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the SK Gaming vs Hellraisers Swiss stage match in Atlanta, played out using the ABH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that the recording was made on a GOTV demo, so the radar callouts, player movement and the killfeed are slightly bugged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also have other elements that we are working on, chief among them being the &lt;strong&gt;economy when out of game&lt;/strong&gt; (after cutting to a team cam for instance) and the &lt;strong&gt;scoreboard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first version of the scoreboard was used during CCS / PGL Season 1 and version 2.0 was shown at Cologne 2016, which incorporated the feedback we got regarding the absence of the equipment buys during freeze time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going forward, version 3.x is going to include everything that 2.0 had, but with additional information to help out both casters and viewers alike to get a better picture of the overall match situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thus we have reached the end of this feature preview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our thanks if you had the patience to read everything up until this point and do let us know your thoughts regarding the ABH, as we will continue to work on it until the Major rolls-in and are always looking for ways to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know the largest obstacle will be for viewers to get used to the new layout, which is why we intend to roll out the ABH starting with the &lt;strong&gt;Asia Minor&lt;/strong&gt;

If I tune in and one team has 10 rounds and the other has 10 rounds but I notice that team1 has 2 pistol rounds under their belt, I can see that objectively team2 are playing better than team1. It's a nice addition! \n\nHowever, I don't think the deagle is the correct indicator. I'd say that if you win CT pistol, you get a USP. If you win T pistol, you get a glock. This shouldn't change at half time as you suggested. I think that's a fairly easy concept for people to follow as the gun shown directly translates to the side the team was on when they won the pistol round. \n\nIt's easy to infer information using this method aswell. For example, if it's the 18th round and a team1 is on terroist side and they have a usp and a glock, you know they won both pistol rounds. If it's the 18th round and team1 is on terrorist side and they only have a usp, you know that they won the 1st pistol round but lost the 2nd (As is also indicated by team 2's USP).\n\nOverall great idea, definitely needs a rework though. :)\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of this indicator, gives useful information to how teams are actually playing against each other.
