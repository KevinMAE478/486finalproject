How they work on how they interact with the community. The chances that they see this very video - minimal, unless it is on top of reddit for a full week so someone stumbles across it, but trust me browsing reddit just to read and hear about stuff you did wrong is something you don&amp;#39;t want to do and then you stop doing it until you basically delete reddit and go to a different project at valve. becuase cs has so many issues and little problems, nobody likes to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest the whole lenghts of all round tables, they can be found at the VNN channel. or sigafoos video about the visit to the tf2 team instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the demo system is years old and unique. it is powerful but the tools are not. Valve did work on it for the highlights and demo analyser tool on github; but the developper on it stopped doing so as he never finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "name": "t1_dg9k0qj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492224183.0, "created_utc": 1492195383.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65drwi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9w3sm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Matt_clausen2", "parent_id": "t3_65drwi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GlobalOffensive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "could have just left it at csgo is broken.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;could have just left it at csgo is broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "name": "t1_dg9w3sm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239275.0, "created_utc": 1492210475.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
