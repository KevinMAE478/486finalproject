Darting around with the Tec-9 spamming at head level at close range getting one-hit kills isn't fun to play against, nor is it reliable enough to feel rewarding.  Previously, when I made adjustments to pistols in my Weapon Balance Mod, I would get criticized for \"nerfing pistols\" as it would make eco rounds harder to win and less interesting to play.  My goal however was never to nerf the pistols, but rather rework them to allow for more skillful play while still keeping eco rounds just as engaging as they are in CSGO.\n\nEach time I update the balance mod I feel like I get closer to this goal.
