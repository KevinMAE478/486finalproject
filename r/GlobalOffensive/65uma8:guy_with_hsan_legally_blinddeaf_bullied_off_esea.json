If by some means the rest of the team actually understood that it was an actual disabled/disadvantaged individual playing, I'm very sure that they would have been much more understanding of his plight.  \n\nIt's like how people react to fire alarms. Mild annoyance and doubt being the majority reaction would be surprising if you present it as it is, but given the context that, say, the building has had a history of false alarms from a malfunctioning fire exit, it would become understandable. The blame for the subsequent death of 50 people due to the delayed evacuation would then shift from the individuals, who seemingly reacted poorly, to those responsible for creating the environment in which such behaviour became encouraged.  \n\nIn short - there's two sides to every story. Yes, what the people in this pug did was wrong, but I cannot demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that they are behaving out of spite of Loop's disability, but rather, can only suggest that it is very possible that their reaction is the culmination of the environment that is ESEA, rather than specifically Loop's participation in the game.  \n\nIf you're wondering why I'm posting this in multiple places: I'm just trying to bring more level-headedness to the table.

If by some means the rest of the team actually understood that it was an actual disabled/disadvantaged individual playing, I&amp;#39;m very sure that they would have been much more understanding of his plight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like how people react to fire alarms. Mild annoyance and doubt being the majority reaction would be surprising if you present it as it is, but given the context that, say, the building has had a history of false alarms from a malfunctioning fire exit, it would become understandable. The blame for the subsequent death of 50 people due to the delayed evacuation would then shift from the individuals, who seemingly reacted poorly, to those responsible for creating the environment in which such behaviour became encouraged.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short - there&amp;#39;s two sides to every story. Yes, what the people in this pug did was wrong, but I cannot demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that they are behaving out of spite of Loop&amp;#39;s disability, but rather, can only suggest that it is very possible that their reaction is the culmination of the environment that is ESEA, rather than specifically Loop&amp;#39;s participation in the game.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re wondering why I&amp;#39;m posting this in multiple places: I&amp;#39;m just trying to bring more level-headedness to the table. As of the time of my post, it&amp;#39;s nothing more than a groupthink against the alleged perpetrators, rather than any form of discussion of their wrongdoing and/or guilt. I may be wrong - they might very well have known that Loop was disabled - but I&amp;#39;d very much like for this side of the discussion to not become buried under the influx of blind hate that is typical of a highly polarising &lt;em&gt;social justice&lt;/em&gt; matter on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "name": "t1_dgddgow", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492457299.0, "created_utc": 1492428499.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 432}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uma8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uma8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uma8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uma8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdsm7v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NMD_", "parent_id": "t1_dgdn9h9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GlobalOffensive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "About 3 weeks ago I played an esea match where the dude trolled the whole game about having a speaking disability. at the end of the game, he said that it was just a troll.
