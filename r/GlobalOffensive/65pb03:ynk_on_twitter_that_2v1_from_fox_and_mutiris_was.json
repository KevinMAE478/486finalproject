And a lot of times from tier 1 teams. It happens, players make mistakes. I&amp;#39;ve seen even prime SK doing shit due to bad calls, nervs, etc. I prefer to think Yanko is just hyperboling it. Of course some fox fans won&amp;#39;t like it, the guy has been consistently shitted on by analysts ever since he joined G2, sometimes for no other reason than Thorin and Lurppis realizing their fans were very fond of him (only significant player in the country, duh) and would get mad at shitposting. I don&amp;#39;t think Ynk is a douchebag tho, and doubt he typed it for that reason. But I don&amp;#39;t blame some fox fans because of taking it the wrong way.
