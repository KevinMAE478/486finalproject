And it draws the trolling and general non-competitive shit away from Ranked a LOT (NA East/Diamond). And there&amp;#39;s a reason Valve penalises leavers in ranked, same as Overwatch; because they want people to be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Valve should want players to be serious about their rank. YOU should want players to be serious about their rank. Everyone should. Literally everyone benefits. There&amp;#39;s not one pro-community reason why we should want people who play MM not to care. It&amp;#39;s a win/win for everyone involved. Assuming player population doesn&amp;#39;t massive spike due to the implementation of unranked competitive, it literally wouldn&amp;#39;t even cost Valve anything in terms of server costs.
