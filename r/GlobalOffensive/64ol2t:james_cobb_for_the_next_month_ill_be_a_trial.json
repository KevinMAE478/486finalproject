Coaching is a very different ballgame than playing or in-game leading. Before, the coach could be your IGL, so an IGL could transfer fairly well. Nowadays, the IGL is still the best equipped to transition into a coaching position, but they are still two very different worlds, specially when the team presumably has a new caller. A coach and an IGL usually work together to create strategies, study themselves and their opponents etc. But a coach's job is to prepare the team, whereas the IGL's job is to lead them, both in preparation and in game.\n\nBut it certainly helps to have a high level understanding of the game, that's for sure.\n\n&gt; With those limitations, what does being a \"good coach\" look like right now?\n\nIt varies from team to team but in essence, your job is to critically assess your players and team, and prepare them for actual matches. What I personally do if look at demos from my players' POV a lot and figure out what they're doing, how they're thinking and how to fix that. For example, in pressure situations on CT side, when you are getting executed on and need to react, people make stupid decisions a lot. As a coach, your job is to make sure that come match time, your team makes the *right* decisions. You also need to be a leader, not in terms of tactics, but in terms of morale and mentality. You need to make your team practice, practice right, and keep their head in the game.\n\n&gt; How do you think Hazed will do this month considering he will be working with JasonR, an IGL that is also on trial?\n\nI think he'll do alright, he has a good head on his shoulders and a great beard on his face. But only time will tell. With IGLs, you really can never tell how they'll fare with a given team.\n\n&gt; What do you think it will take for Hazed to be kept as the coach, aside from winning matches?\n\nIt won't even take winning matches, because there's only so much a coach can do from outside of the game. But what it will take is for the team to like him and feel like he is positively contributing to them, and for the org to be happy with the way they see him conducting himself, both in terms of his coaching work, and with the org and the public. It's not very complicated to be a good coach, but it is difficult. You need to be the rock of the team in terms of work ethic, mental resilience and attitude. That's the hardest part IMO; you need to be \"the guy\". When tensions run high and tempers bubble over, you need to be there to make sense and maintain order, and drag them through a match.\n\nHazed will need to display the work ethic that he wants his players to have, be the voice of reason in emotional and difficult situations and generally be \"team dad\" in many ways. He has to be outside and above the team and the game in many ways to do so, but also feel like a part of the team.

Because I&amp;#39;m newer to the CS scene, I was hoping someone from this subreddit could help me out with some questions I&amp;#39;ve got!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does playing professionally transfer well into being a successful coach, considering the limitations of coaching in-game? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With those limitations, what does being a &amp;quot;good coach&amp;quot; look like right now? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do you think Hazed will do this month considering he will be working with JasonR, an IGL that is also on trial? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What do you think it will take for Hazed to be kept as the coach, aside from winning matches?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a ton for any insight you can give! Hopefully this also starts up some good discussion. Looking forward to seeing how things work out!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "name": "t1_dg3wnj8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491917054.0, "created_utc": 1491888254.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ol2t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3y6tj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fac3ts", "parent_id": "t3_64ol2t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GlobalOffensive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Idk what the situation with JR is after Sydney (he's not gonna be attending), but a skilled player with at least half decent strats in JR, and smart committed coach in Hazed could def help OG out quite a bit.
