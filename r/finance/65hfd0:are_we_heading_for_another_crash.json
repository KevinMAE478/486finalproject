Loaning money to service existing loans. No one really knows how bad it is but a collapse in demand could cause a lot of issues.\n\n2. EU. There's growing populism and protectionism a la trump that looks like it might tear apart the EU. Regardless if it's good or bad in the long term, more Brexit's will create more uncertainty and may constrict credit and growth and reduce trade. Further economic constriction in the EU could affect China.\n\n3. Venezuela and Brazil.  The former is a shit show and the latter is getting there. Further collapse in Venezuela could create a refugee crisis that further destabilizes Brazil. Brazil is 300 million people and if they get into shit they're coming to the US. \n\n4. The Fed. They've said they're planning to start selling the $4.5 trillion in assets (a lot are/were shitty mortgages the banks needed off their balance sheets). It's argued that the Fed's buying spree is mostly responsible for our current bull market. Granted they can sell these assets in a controlled manner but there's going to be a lot more \"supply\" soon in the stock market.\n\n5. Pensions. There arent a lot of public pensions in good shape right now. A lot rely on pretty unrealistic stock market growth. If the Fed stops stimulating, those pensions cant meet obligations and city/county/state gov's may become insolvent or millions lose their financial safety net. \n\nI don't think the next downturn will have a single catalyst and I think it will be outside of the US.
