Have you never bother studying modern portfolio theory?  Risk and correlations are everything.  How much return you get for the risk you take is king.  If I tell you I'll give you 10$ if this coin flip is heads or you pay me 100$ if it's tails would you agree?  No, because the risk/reward is skewed against you.\n\nSo now think of a portfolio context.  Compare 2 scenarios:\n\n/1.  \n\nLets say first is you invest all 100$ of your money in the s&amp;p index for the past 10years.  You now get an annualized avg return of 7% and it costs you 18% in std deviation, pretty typical with it's figures for the long run.  Sharpe ratio (lets ignore risk free for simplicity) is like ~.35.  On a year like 2008 happens, you lose 40$ of your 100$ (roughly a 2 sigma event) and nothing to do but wait for it to come back up.  Looking forward 9 years you would expect to have 110$ in assets based on the mean return and where you're currently at (60$ in asset value).  Congrats!\n\n/2.  \n\nNow lets say you invest 50% of your money in S&amp;P vs 50% in a completely uncorrelated asset to S&amp;P (r=0, unrealistic due to simple law of big numbers but there are many fund strategies which run in the .2's and .3's) that has only 5.5% returns standard deviation of 8%.  Simply speaking, you now get an overall annualized return of 6.25% but you only have a portfolio standard deviation of 9.8% (pretty basic mean variance formula).  This means your sharpe ratio on all assets is now .63.  Simply put, your portfolio earns you more return per unit of risk you're willing to take.  If you wanted to invest only in S&amp;P 500 and have the exact same level of risk, you'd invest 54% of your assets in the index and keep 46% cash/risk free.  Your returns on 100$ would only be 7% on 54$ and then whatever risk free is (we assumed nothing/negligible) on 46$.  Your return on 100$ portfolio is now 3.78%.  If you don't want to take more than 10% risk in your portfolio, this is a very bad return compared to having 2 assets.\n\nNow lets take a scenario like 2008.  You still constrain yourself to 10% absolute risk.  You lost 40% of your 50$ in S&amp;P = 20$.  Given your uncorrelated assets you know with a confidence of 95% your other asset made returns in the range of [-10.2%,21.2%].  For simplicity sake, lets pretend it stays average (justified since it carries no correlation to what's happening in the S&amp;P) and you get your 5.5% return.  Well now your 50$ invested has turned into 52.75$ by the end of 2008 and total assets of 82.75$ (52.75$ in uncorrelated asset and 30$ in S&amp;P).  Fantastic but you're now massively overweight in allocation to the uncorrelated asset (63.7% in uncorrelated asset and 36.3% in S&amp;P).  You don't like that.  That brings down your portfolio risk to 8.3% and mean return to 6.05%.  You're now taking below you're ideal amount of absolute risk in the portfolio (and your return is lower because of it).  So very simple answer, you rebalance.  You sell out of your uncorrelated assets and buy more in S&amp;P to bring the level of risk back to where you want it (50/50).  So now you have 41.38$ in S&amp;P and 41.37$ in uncorrelated asset.  Your return is back to 6.25% on avg and you're back to taking 9.8% in risk.  Based on expected returns, you'd look to have 142.8$ in assets at the end of 9 years.  Quite a bit more than a non-diversified forward look on S&amp;P.\n\n\nBottom line:\n\nIf you have wealth and can find investment managers who run specific strategies (yes hedge funds are absolutely constrained to the investment strategy of their fund which gets documented explicitly in their prospectus and the IPS they write for their investors) with low correlations to your other assets which are in the broad market, you receive much higher risk adjusted returns (meaning actual returns for the amount of risk you take) AND absolute returns by managing and diversifying your portfolio of assets across them.  \n\nYou don't put all your assets in a hedge fund and pretend that they're some magical box that is meant to do anything other than what their strategy is.  Likewise, you don't compare the returns of your uncorrelated asset as being lower on an absolute basis and say \"well fuck all this, this uncorrelated asset manager's investment fund is shit!\" and buy S&amp;P.  The allocation to the uncorrelated hedge fund is giving you exposure you need to keep your overall portfolio risk lower and returns higher.", "edited": 1492199434.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How is return on capital not an apples to apples comparison?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because asset management isn&amp;#39;t purely based on return on capital.

The reason to invest in a hedge fund is to allocate parts of your assets into a manager with a strategy such as event driven, vol arb, convert arb, stat arb, special situations credit, securitized products, etc that doesn&amp;#39;t correlate with your broad market portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "finance", "name": "t1_dg9jq45", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492223831.0, "created_utc": 1492195031.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9iwvo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "__Cyber_Dildonics__", "parent_id": "t1_dg9hszq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/finance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right, but isn't the metric used to define the index still simple and automatic?
