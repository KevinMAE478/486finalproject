Then he goes to say that in DaS2 cutscene it shows how you came to be in the situation you are in, you becoming undead and trying to go find a cure, on which you are directly involved because it's basically your backstory. So the way I see it is that he's making a counterpoint to Mattews argument that DaS2 cutscene is strictly worse to DaS1 cutscene because the DaS1 cutscene lays out the story a lot better and then goes on to say why the DaS2 cutscene is actually quite relevant and how it exposes the themes that are going to be shown through the game, which I found to be a pretty reasonable argument. \nObviously everyone has their own opinion on it, I personally didn't care much for the intro cutscene either but woudn't go as far as to say it's bad, but the argument he makes in response to mattews one is pretty levelheaded.\n\n&gt;(third paragraph in general)\n\nYup, as shields can be useful at times the game gives them to you as an option while still encouraging you to mostly roll, what you said now doesn't contradict what bomber said at all.\nAnd the jab at Mattew did come off as a bit over the top, but it was pretty funny so it helped make the video more digestible (which he points out he tried to do the video as entretaining as possible near the end).\n\n&gt;(fourth paragraph in general)\n\nwell, the video is titled \"In Defense of DS2\", so it's normal that the arguments made within are defending DaS2. That they are right or wrong is a whole other thing, but if it listed all the good and bad things about the game then it would be listed as an analisys, which Joseph already did and he already went through all of this.\nAnd yup, it would indeed make a lot of sense to mention agility, so no discussion there from me.\n\n&gt;Feels like he is trying to hard to defend it.\n\nwell you're not wrong there\n\n&gt;[...]and how lots of his arguments are either faulty,or entirely subjective and boil down to him liking the game.\n\nyup, that's one thing I don't like about this kind of discussion on both sides. Both Mattew's and bomber's video are both a list of reasons why each one of them didn't like or thought the game was good respectively, so they end up being subjective pieces about the game which obviously doesn't have anything wrong with it. That's why both videos are listed as a Critique and a Defense respectively, because they aren't suposed to be an objective analysis, rather an explanation of ones experience with the game and the things one didn't like or liked about the game.\n\nBut then people take these videos as being completely, 100% objective analysis that give a completely unbiased overview on the hits and shortcomings of a game and list points that originate on personal preference as objective facts, like \"DaS combat isn't made for fighting against mobs\" or \"DaS1 did healing better than DaS2\", when in reality those arguments come from the fact that Mattew didn't like that aspect about the game, be it because he didn't knew the actual intention behind those mechanics or just out of personal preference, and stated them as if they were objective facts, which are now usually used as \"common knowledge\" against the game.\n\nSo the bomber makes his video, among other things, trying to disprove the \"objective facts\" mattew listed on his video and refuted actually wrong information mattew said like there being no way to deal with mobs and that fights against mobs don't work because lock-on without actually saying that you aren't allowed to not like that aspect of the game. Like the point he made about the world not being cohessive adding to the mistery, I can perfectly comprehend that point sounding dumb af to a lot of people, but the point he was trying to make isn't that it's imperative for one to like the non-cohesiveness of the world, but instead that the world not being cohesive isn't an objectively wrong thing about the game by providing his point of view about why he likes that aspect of the game.\n\nBut then everyone also starts interpreting this video as an analysis, so we have both sides arguing about points people made as if they were objective facts, when in truth they were subjective preference. Like, the point of Josephs analysis was indeed to go through all the game and list how mechanics work with each other, and when he listed his opinion on something he explicitly mentioned it was his opinion, so one can argue a point like \"Soul Memory doesn't work as a mechanic because of X, Y and Z\" because it's not just a personal preference, it's something you can discuss using facts, while trying to argue about if I liked the Smelter demon fight or not doesn't go anywhere.\n\nSo guess what I'm trying to say is that people, including the critics themselves, confuse the opinion one has about the game with how a game objectively is, which causes a lot of the discussion to go nowhere.\nLike for example Deadly Premonition. Is it an objectively bad game, with horribly clunky gameplay and so buggy on pc it might crash every half an hour? Yup! Do I also love that game to death? Also yup! So one can admit that a game has a lot of flaws but still like it, the same way one can not like a game while admiting some of the stuff it does is objectively not strictly bad.\n\nOh wow, I think I might have gotten a bit too rambly there. Well anyways, going to sleep as to not get even rambly-err.\n\n(edit: just saw bomber posted this response which pretty much sums up what I said pretty nicely: https://curiouscat.me/Hbomberguy/post/135543240?t=1492398378 )", "edited": 1492401472.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(first paragraph in general)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yeah, I can see that if you didn&amp;#39;t like how DeS handled healing in the first place then justifying livegems with saying they expand on DeS doesn&amp;#39;t work at all as an argument. \nPersonally I prefer Joseph&amp;#39;s way to look at lifegems, where they are intended to be an alternative to the estus flask which is safer to use, as it&amp;#39;s faster to use and you can still move while using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and the hyperbole is a bit hyperbolic, but it&amp;#39;s that or having 80 minutes of flat-voiced narration \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(second paragraph in general)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;eh, both opening cutscenes achieve diferent things. the DaS1 cutscene introduces the whole lore of the universe quite efficiently as Mattew put it, as it gives a basic overview of all the important stuff that happened, and the way I understand it bomber just said that your character isn&amp;#39;t directly involved in the actions shown on that cutscene, as in you are not fighting in the war alongside Gwynn.

Like the point he made about the world not being cohessive adding to the mistery, I can perfectly comprehend that point sounding dumb af to a lot of people, but the point he was trying to make isn&amp;#39;t that it&amp;#39;s imperative for one to like the non-cohesiveness of the world, but instead that the world not being cohesive isn&amp;#39;t an objectively wrong thing about the game by providing his point of view about why he likes that aspect of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then everyone also starts interpreting this video as an analysis, so we have both sides arguing about points people made as if they were objective facts, when in truth they were subjective preference. Like, the point of Josephs analysis was indeed to go through all the game and list how mechanics work with each other, and when he listed his opinion on something he explicitly mentioned it was his opinion, so one can argue a point like &amp;quot;Soul Memory doesn&amp;#39;t work as a mechanic because of X, Y and Z&amp;quot; because it&amp;#39;s not just a personal preference, it&amp;#39;s something you can discuss using facts, while trying to argue about if I liked the Smelter demon fight or not doesn&amp;#39;t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that people, including the critics themselves, confuse the opinion one has about the game with how a game objectively is, which causes a lot of the discussion to go nowhere.\nLike for example Deadly Premonition. Is it an objectively bad game, with horribly clunky gameplay and so buggy on pc it might crash every half an hour? Yup! Do I also love that game to death? Also yup! So one can admit that a game has a lot of flaws but still like it, the same way one can not like a game while admiting some of the stuff it does is objectively not strictly bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh wow, I think I might have gotten a bit too rambly there. Well anyways, going to sleep as to not get even rambly-err.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(edit: just saw bomber posted this response which pretty much sums up what I said pretty nicely: &lt;a href=\"https://curiouscat.me/Hbomberguy/post/135543240?t=1492398378\"&gt;https://curiouscat.me/Hbomberguy/post/135543240?t=1492398378&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dgd2a1j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492429452.0, "created_utc": 1492400652.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcyqsg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jemd13", "parent_id": "t1_dgcwsk7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thats my problem.
