its downvoted into oblivion, or i could make a generic i love ds comment and get upvoted into the heavens. \n\nIts piss poor, Most things implemented into DS2 Softs are designed to trick you making it more akin to 1, i remember 3 good patches, 1 vanilla fuck yes stuff was overpowered, fuck yes weapons broke fast as shit - but it was good and it forced people to have multiple weapons patch 2, i think the DX11 patch for PC was the PVP patch nerfs to tons of weapons but it was for PVP again not PVE, no one uses 200 damadge katanas in pve and if you do im so fucking sorry for your loss. and the 3rd which was the shittiest softs.\n\nSofts is single player mode, a string to tie loose ends - because without it people would hate on the game. \n\nMany phantoms are added to assist you, and about 4 including anyone you summon at iron king are there to hinder you.\nThere are 3 new NPC invaders, Armorer, Forlorn and, some other woman all with there various flaws forlorn being the strongest. they dont add anything to the game and serve to anger returning players outside of that there is no other reason for them to be in the game. forlorn will invade you anywhere but only if you walk by a specific place meaning hes completely avoidable, The other two spawn at iron keep, the armorer is a misnomer, a mage who holds his sheild up a bit too long, so the noobs go oh mah god this fucking mechanic i never use has a use im so good let me try PVP, but we all know the fucking trick, noob blood in the water. you cannot currently do a no death run in softs, because of the elephant door in the mansion, it is an instant death no matter the armor or hp dont even try to get the ring. spells have been nerfed so hard that being a spell caster is screaming im new, im mentally impaired or i dont care about the meta, the game has devolved into using 400+ar thrusting counter weapons, being a tank who heals, being a mage who spams and dies, or being a sun bro because your new and the internet told you and autism and what not.\n\nMechanically speaking if your on console all controllers have a 14ms lag omg rip right, too bad its literally just enough for you to get fucked every time you chug. Seriously, chug an estus then spam tap square or whatever the equivalent is when your 7-8 taps in and you finally roll there might be a problem, and im talking after the animation ends - thats annother thing that sucks in softs only linger frames have been increased on two bosses vendrick and that fucking cat from the dlc, vendrick needed it, the cat , you can litterally watch him swipe or spin around or flip or whatever and then you run up to hit him and then you get thrown back like no ones buisness, you know a boss is a fuck up if the crystal homing soul mass behind him isnt the greatest problem in the fight.\nThe game cannot handle itself in the shrine of amana, everything behind you gets un-rendered meaning the mage enemeys can shoot you from anywhere on the map if you pass them, also there spells semi-hone meaning you will die in the shrine of amana or you will fight every enemey in the shrine of amana only to possibly die anyway, upgrading armor doesnt help. the iron king nerfs sort of dont exist anymore because hes unreadable now, thats not a yay his fire breath also hones, but heres the weird part it only hones if it hits the wall, thats pretty fucking weird and may seem like a lie but its not i dodged the fire breath instead of running to the back right of the platform, i watched the flame 360 and head my way, and it corned me until it knocked me off the ledge he wasnt in the animation either he did it and went to do annother one. the old sun ring is also a spot where you can die instantly the npc that backstabs you doesnt always spawn and since you cant see him and cant wait to find him you just gotta gun it and hope. Enemeys dont need to be seen or have special locations to spawn now, if you walk out the door in the lost bastille behind the persuer well then have fun, those two dudes you killed that explode when they jump, annotherone just outa fucking nowhere. \n\nim not saying the game is bad i prob play this the most. \nim just saying the community is mentally retarded and cannot see they're short comings from a lore or mechanical perspective. \n\nhave fun get the sun sword or be a scrub and go dual utra greatswords, fun is the name of the game in the end of the day, but the game is on its death bed.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im not a fan of dark souls 2 im just gunna say that now and this is a website for fanboys so expect to read this once befor its downvoted into oblivion, or i could make a generic i love ds comment and get upvoted into the heavens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its piss poor, Most things implemented into DS2 Softs are designed to trick you making it more akin to 1, i remember 3 good patches, 1 vanilla fuck yes stuff was overpowered, fuck yes weapons broke fast as shit - but it was good and it forced people to have multiple weapons patch 2, i think the DX11 patch for PC was the PVP patch nerfs to tons of weapons but it was for PVP again not PVE, no one uses 200 damadge katanas in pve and if you do im so fucking sorry for your loss. and the 3rd which was the shittiest softs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Softs is single player mode, a string to tie loose ends - because without it people would hate on the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many phantoms are added to assist you, and about 4 including anyone you summon at iron king are there to hinder you.\nThere are 3 new NPC invaders, Armorer, Forlorn and, some other woman all with there various flaws forlorn being the strongest. they dont add anything to the game and serve to anger returning players outside of that there is no other reason for them to be in the game. forlorn will invade you anywhere but only if you walk by a specific place meaning hes completely avoidable, The other two spawn at iron keep, the armorer is a misnomer, a mage who holds his sheild up a bit too long, so the noobs go oh mah god this fucking mechanic i never use has a use im so good let me try PVP, but we all know the fucking trick, noob blood in the water. you cannot currently do a no death run in softs, because of the elephant door in the mansion, it is an instant death no matter the armor or hp dont even try to get the ring. spells have been nerfed so hard that being a spell caster is screaming im new, im mentally impaired or i dont care about the meta, the game has devolved into using 400+ar thrusting counter weapons, being a tank who heals, being a mage who spams and dies, or being a sun bro because your new and the internet told you and autism and what not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mechanically speaking if your on console all controllers have a 14ms lag omg rip right, too bad its literally just enough for you to get fucked every time you chug.
