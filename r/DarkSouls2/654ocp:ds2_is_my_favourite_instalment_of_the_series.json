If anything, I think DS3 did it quite bad compared to 2. Obviously, DS2 had the four Great Ones and they were somewhat a retreading of the Lord Soul holders of the first game, but I thought it was rather cleverly done; while they were obviously heavily based off of the originals, they still managed to be unique and it was actually quite cool to see how the Lord Souls had influenced them. Seath's soul made a town go mad because of his own incredible madness, Nito's made a character embrace the forgotten and ostracized just like Nito's compassionate wish for the undead to be released in death, the Witch's soul made a character repeat her mistake which is felt *very* heavily in the DLC, and Gwyn's soul influenced a King to abuse his power and sink into depravity. These all felt like cool homages to the Lord Soul holders of DS1.\n\nAnd even then, DS2 offers a lot more than that:\n\n * The entire plot line of Manus' daughters was a beautiful continuation of his story and character. By exemplifying the nature of his humanity, they explore both him as a character and what it means to be consumed by one's own Humanity. \n\n * Vendrick and Aldia are two of the most influential and emotionally impactful characters in any of the games and that's without even accounting for your sparse personal interactions with them. I really only think DS3 reaches their complexity with Sulyvahn and I didn't really end up caring about him in the end because his aspirations amounted to nothing. \n\n * The idea of marriages between a King and a Queen and the deception involved were also very interesting and new. And the subsequent idea of a marriage between and the Flame and Dark as well. Even the mundane aspect of it being a Queen subverting a King for his power and all the tragedy that befalls everyone because of it were fantastic stories.\n\n * The whole story about the Iron King, Alonne, Mytha, and Nadalia was some of the best storytelling in the games. As was the heroic and heartbreaking tale of Eleum Loyce (so much was said with just Loyce Knights and they didn't even have dialogue) and the tragedy of Shulva between the devout people, deceptive Elana, invading knights, and apathetic and incidentally destructive Sinh. Each of those stories were phenomenal and I appreciated how much they didn't try to be too in-your-face about it. There's no great prophecy or narrative, just an unveiling of history and tragedy while seeking the crowns. It felt more personal and natural than a lot of the things in DS3.\n\n * The Giants were more sympathetic and interesting than their DS1/DS3 counterparts. They felt ancient and important and *alive* despite their very inhuman nature, and not one ever even spoke to you.\n\nIn comparison, DS3 seemed to try too hard to ride on the back of DS1 characters. Honestly, other than Lothric and Lorian, who were amazing but criminally underused/misused characters, all of the Lords of Cinder were overshadowed by others. The Abyss Watchers were literally fanboys of Artorias that fought like a mix between him and the hunters from Bloodborne, Yhorm was trivialized by the inclusion of the Stormruler and his personal story overlooked for a cool but unnecessary story arc for Siegward (a cool character and nice contrast to Siegmeyer, but still a DS1-esque character instead of a new one), and Aldrich was actually given a pretty expansive and interesting story before he was set aside for being some lump that was eating Gwyndolin. Compared to the more obscure relationships that the four Great Ones had with DS1 (plus, the confirmation of the Lord Souls in NG+ being fucking awesome), these seemed very clumsy and just felt like poor storytelling.\n\nBut the thing that really makes me dislike DS3's lore is just how insignificant everything is. I mean DS2's whole schtick was how every kingdom eventually crumbles, but it still felt like a lesson was being learned about aspirations and motivations. You *learn* from them. In DS3, everybody loses, but who cares about that? Go make their existence suck more because the Flame says so (Lothric and Lorian did nothing wrong!). And following that, your character lacks autonomy. DS2 was a very personal journey about curing the curse, but DS3 has you as a proxy either to the First Flame itself, the Firekeeper, or Londor.

Some of them even had rich narratives which spread to other characters and enriched the world. There was no such equivalent in DS2, not even one.\n\nThis one I disagree on.  We have a very clear understanding of the origins of the Iron King, Ivory King, Vendrick, the shards of Manus, Freja, arguably the Rotten (I believe it's made up of escapees from Shulva) and Aldia.  The only \"major\" boss who doesn't have a well defined origin is the Lost Sinner.\n\n&gt;There were characters connected to new places, but not for any sensible reason.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by this one. I agree that sometime NPCs are found in weird places- is that what you mean?\n\n&gt;When it comes to details or even linking together simple things Dark Souls 2 fails at the most basic of tasks. For example the Lost Sinner. It's heavily implied that the Lost Sinner is the Witch of Izalith, the Soul itself describes the sinner as female, and as a witch and what is the boss? A male slave wielding a very large soul in a dark room.\n\nThe Lost Sinner isn't male.  She looks like she has a beard, but even women can grow facial hair.  She's been there a *long* time.  Also, no.  She isn't the Witch of Izalith.  She's a completely different person who found the Soul of the Witch of Izalith which drove her to try and link the Fire, which ties in with the Witch's own desperate attempt to keep the Age of Fire going.  But as I said earlier, she probably has the weakest backstory of any of the major DkS2 characters.\n\nNow, here are the things I think DkS2 did much better than the others:\n\n* **The world**.  I'm not talking about the actual game world, which I agree is the worst in the series.  I'm talking about the actual world of DkS2.  The various kingdoms.  The game goes into so much depth describing places like Volgen and Forossa.  In DkS1 the kingdoms were really just origins for RPG archetypes. Vinheim was the mage place, Thorolund was the cleric place, Astora was the knight place etc.  Only Thorolund and Carim really had any intrigue.  At most we got a reference to a beast that attacked Astora, or the shady dealings of the ruler of Balder or Carim.  DkS2 does so much more.  Let's compare Vinheim and Melfia.  Vinheim had next to no lore.  There was a school there, and there was an order of magic blacksmiths there.  There were also some sneaky mage-assassins.  So we know the kind of people that live there, but nothing about the place.  In DkS2, we know that the academies of Melfia were founded by persecuted sorcerers who escaped the Lost Bastille where they were locked up by the king of Olaphis.  See?  We have a badass origin story which DkS3 could have capitalised on, instead of bringing back Vinheim and telling us nothing new about it.  Or look at Volgen.  Listen to what Maughlin has to say about it.  A city bustling with merchants but controlled by the Blue Sentinels.  Compared to TES or Dragon Age it's nothing, but compared to DkS1 that's a lot of depth for a place we never visit.\n\n* **It feels more human**.  I guess I just never liked Gwyn as a character.  He felt too generic.  Based on DkS1 alone he really feels too much like the cliche heroic king who sacrificed himself for the good of his people\", and the only doubt cast on this comes from a sneering Serpent who is definitely not trustworthy.  Vendrick, his counterpart, was a complex and fleshed-out character.  He committed some awful crimes- declaring war on the Giants, bringing them back for experimentation, possibly instigating the destruction of Shulva among others.  But he did it for believable, human reasons.  He was in love, and he was real angry at the world and the supposed natural order.  And rather than being all heroic and badass, in the end he just gave up.  He's the Crestfallen Warrior archetype turned up to 11.  Also, funnily enough, it was DkS2 that actually lent pathos to Gwyn.  Read the description of Blinding Bolt.\n\n* **It actually did something meaningful with DkS1's lore**.  DkS1 isn't referenced too often in DkS2, but when it is it actually means something.  In DkS1 Nito was an interesting, enigmatic figure.  We knew he could grant death to anyone, and had sacrificed most of his Soul to do so, and we knew he had chosen to play no part in current affairs.  There was a lot to flesh out and explore.  And DkS2 did that.  By introducing the Fenito and Milfanito, we learn that Nito was actually a compassionate dude.  He created two races to soothe and protect the Undead, those who he could not grant death.  And they created a whole crypt for those Undead to rest.  Without even saying his name DkS2 added an extra layer to Nito's character.  \n\nIt did the same with Seath too.  As you explore Brightstone Cove you can feel Seath's influence everywhere.  You learn that his residual madness has driven the people of the Cove insane, including Lord Tseldora himself.  Basically, Seath has become a Lovecraftian Great One, a long dormant being who still holds sway over the minds of mortals.  And Seath's name isn't mentioned once.\n\nInversely, when DkS3 brings back Gwyndolin it adds nothing to his character.  We know how he died, and we know he maybe became a better bloke than he was before, but that's it.  There are hints we could have gotten more- originally we would return Gwyndolin's severed finger to Yorshka and learn what a wonderful and compassionate brother he was.  But that didn't come to pass.  Instead we just watch him get killed.  If they took the DkS2 approach we'd find the barely recognisable ruins of Anor Londo, and learn about the \"Dark Moon whose death brought despair upon the Age of Gods\" or something- a little nod that people who played DkS1 can read and understand because they remember Gwyndolin.\n\n* **It gave partial answers to some of the questions from DkS1**.  This is a little one, but it irks me.  DkS2 added a tiny extra detail to the Undead Curse by revealing it's caused by Want.  Not much, but a hint with the potential to mean a lot more.  The perfect little thread for the finale to tie up.  'Cept it didn't.

And rather than being all heroic and badass, in the end he just gave up.  He&amp;#39;s the Crestfallen Warrior archetype turned up to 11.  Also, funnily enough, it was DkS2 that actually lent pathos to Gwyn.  Read the description of Blinding Bolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It actually did something meaningful with DkS1&amp;#39;s lore&lt;/strong&gt;.  DkS1 isn&amp;#39;t referenced too often in DkS2, but when it is it actually means something.  In DkS1 Nito was an interesting, enigmatic figure.  We knew he could grant death to anyone, and had sacrificed most of his Soul to do so, and we knew he had chosen to play no part in current affairs.  There was a lot to flesh out and explore.  And DkS2 did that.  By introducing the Fenito and Milfanito, we learn that Nito was actually a compassionate dude.  He created two races to soothe and protect the Undead, those who he could not grant death.  And they created a whole crypt for those Undead to rest.  Without even saying his name DkS2 added an extra layer to Nito&amp;#39;s character.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It did the same with Seath too.  As you explore Brightstone Cove you can feel Seath&amp;#39;s influence everywhere.  You learn that his residual madness has driven the people of the Cove insane, including Lord Tseldora himself.  Basically, Seath has become a Lovecraftian Great One, a long dormant being who still holds sway over the minds of mortals.  And Seath&amp;#39;s name isn&amp;#39;t mentioned once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inversely, when DkS3 brings back Gwyndolin it adds nothing to his character.  We know how he died, and we know he maybe became a better bloke than he was before, but that&amp;#39;s it.  There are hints we could have gotten more- originally we would return Gwyndolin&amp;#39;s severed finger to Yorshka and learn what a wonderful and compassionate brother he was.  But that didn&amp;#39;t come to pass.  Instead we just watch him get killed.  If they took the DkS2 approach we&amp;#39;d find the barely recognisable ruins of Anor Londo, and learn about the &amp;quot;Dark Moon whose death brought despair upon the Age of Gods&amp;quot; or something- a little nod that people who played DkS1 can read and understand because they remember Gwyndolin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It gave partial answers to some of the questions from DkS1&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is a little one, but it irks me.  DkS2 added a tiny extra detail to the Undead Curse by revealing it&amp;#39;s caused by Want.  Not much, but a hint with the potential to mean a lot more.  The perfect little thread for the finale to tie up.  &amp;#39;Cept it didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dg8ajul", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492149292.0, "created_utc": 1492120492.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg88f8r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Griffith", "parent_id": "t1_dg87spf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I said why in one of the original replies.

Parrying works great in Dark 2.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;no way, man. and i&amp;#39;m not even talking about the post-parry attack animation (which i dont really like), parries are waaaayy less likely to work in DS2, they messed with the timing and broke it, to the point that i gave up &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; on using parries in DS2, i just shield block and counter-attack.&lt;br/&gt;\ni DS1 parrying used to be my main method of killing foes like Black/Silver Knights, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had any of that happen, and honestly these last three points sound like user error.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s not, you can try doing the same thing in DS1 and it works, in DS2 it doesnt work anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) there&amp;#39;s no reason the game should target an enemy that&amp;#39;s way in the back instead of one that&amp;#39;s right in front of you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) there&amp;#39;s no reason why you should be facing backwards when you rollback, since you used to be facing the same direction after the roll in DS1  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) there&amp;#39;s no reason for you to now attack in the same direction that you roll, instead of being able to attack in a difference direction like in DS1.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the combat is just broken in DS2, they added a lot of other things to the game, but they broke the combat, it&amp;#39;s more dynamic and reliable in DS1.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you dont think so, go back and play them at the same time, switching between games, you&amp;#39;ll notice the difference, in DS1 you can be more confident in what actions you do yourself, in DS2 you have to guess what the game&amp;#39;s gonna decide to do with the camera/aim/timing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dg80ah5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137681.0, "created_utc": 1492108881.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7z3pc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hype348", "parent_id": "t1_dg7uo72", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; BUT fact that you can still get invaded while Hollow\n\nYou can burn an effigy to turn the online functionality off.

The themes in DkS2 all wrap around each other in quite clever ways, especially the themes of \"monarchy\", \"want\", and \"strength\".\n\nSo DkS2 has this concept of the \"true monarch\", someone with the strength to link the Fire.  DkS3 adapted this into the idea of Lords of Cinder and Champions, but the concept is basically the same.  A monarch is someone defined by their \"strength\", but it's up to you to decide what \"strength\" really means.  Is it the strength of your Soul?  Is it determined by your actions?  Your morality?  Anyway, Vendrick was someone with the strength to link the Fire.  He could have been the True Monarch, but he abdicated the Throne of Want (which is fairly explicitly stated to be used to link the Fire).  So you, the Bearer of the Curse, wind up in Drangleic.  You're there to seek a cure for the Curse, but the Emerald Herald drags you into a quest to find Vendrick and learn the nature of the Soul, so you can become a true monarch.

The themes in DkS2 all wrap around each other in quite clever ways, especially the themes of &amp;quot;monarchy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;want&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So DkS2 has this concept of the &amp;quot;true monarch&amp;quot;, someone with the strength to link the Fire.  DkS3 adapted this into the idea of Lords of Cinder and Champions, but the concept is basically the same.  A monarch is someone defined by their &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s up to you to decide what &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot; really means.  Is it the strength of your Soul?  Is it determined by your actions?  Your morality?  Anyway, Vendrick was someone with the strength to link the Fire.

Why? Its pacing. Its stiffness. Its slowness. The clunky movement. Every time I fight a boss it feels like I'm fighting a robot. The character movement and dodging is just so fucking bad that I truly believe Dark Souls 1 does a much better job. Combat is lifeless, that's the best I can put it. Again, I'm gonna mention the Dancer and Pontiff from Dark Souls 3. That is what combat should feel like: Swift, fluid, and seamless. Not a single boss in Dark Souls 2 accomplishes that. Every fucking fight is a repetitive mess of \"wait for an opening, hit, back away, repeat.\" Look at Champion Gundyr from Dark Souls 3 and try to find one boss from Dark Souls 2 that comes even remotely close to his aggressive and seamless style. Dark Souls 3 combat actually *feels* like you're fighting a *person* or *thing*, not a bunch of code.\n\n**Bosses**\n\nI didn't think I'd have to explain why Dark Souls 3 bosses are better than Dark Souls 2's. I think anyone that's played both can easily see why. First, let's start with what makes a good boss fight: The boss itself, obviously. The boss's design and how it looks, its moveset and how varying it is, its difficulty and fairness, and maybe even the lore. Other things that contribute to a good boss fight are the arena and, abso-fucking-lutely, the soundtrack.\n\nNow, let's start off with the bad bosses, those that don't do a good job at satisfying the criteria above.\n\nDark Souls 3: \n\n1. The Deacons \n1. High Lord Wolnir\n1. Ancient Wyvern\n\nDark Souls 2: \n\n1. Royal Rat Vanguard \n2. Royal Rat Authority \n3. Skeleton Lords \n4. Congregation\n5. Covetous Demon\n6. Executioner's Chariot \n7. Baneful Queen \n9. and the god forsaken Afflicted Graverobber gang bang.\n\nYikes. I don't know what to tell you if you can't see what I meant by the quality over quantity argument anymore. Does that mean every boss not on this list is good? No. I'm just listing the ones that are atrociously bad. The mediocre ones are not on this list.\n\nNow let's look at some great bosses, those that excel at the criteria above.\n\nDark Souls 3:\n\n1. Sister Friede\n1. Nameless King\n1. Lothric and Lorian\n1. Dancer of the Boreal Valley\n1. Slave Knight Gael\n1. Soul of Cinder\n1. Champion Gundyr\n1. Pontiff Sulyvahn\n1. Dragonslayer Armour\n1. Abyss Watchers\n\nAs for Dark Souls 2 there isn't a single boss that sticks out to me. Not one boss gave me goosebumps from its soundtrack, not one boss has the fluidity and grace that the bosses in Dark Souls 3 possess. Not a single boss was burned into my mind in which I'll never forget. When a boss in Dark Souls 2 isn't bad, it just means the boss fight was \"okay\" or \"good,\" and that is a real shame. There are CHALLENGING bosses, I'll give it that, but as for challenging AND excelling *as* a boss fight? I don't know. Fume Knight was good, and Sir Alonne was cool too I guess.\n\n**Level design**\n\nNothing to say here besides the level design in Dark Souls 2 being average, and the world design being fucking stupid. You go UP an elevator into a lava area. You go through a 10 foot long tunnel that is bright and sunny on one side, and rainy on the other. What the fucking fuck is up with that? Is time so convoluted in Drangleic that it can't decide what the weather is? Again, the individual level design is mediocre at best, but the areas as a \"world\" don't mesh well at all.\n\nDark Souls 3 has some average level design as well, but instead of having some bad ones it excels in a few. Irithyll Dungeon comes to mind. Amazingly designed area. The Grand Archives as well. When you open a shortcut in Dark Souls 3, it actually means something. I laugh every time I open a shortcut in Dark Souls 2 because I know I'll never use it again.\n\nEven Dark Souls 1 has godly world design and great level design, like the Undead Burg and Sen's Fortress. Just thought it deserved a mention.\n\nDark Souls 2 is easily the worst of the series and easily has the worst gameplay out of all of them.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You literally said to NAME things it does better, and I did, but since you really want me to explain them then I guess I can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dark Souls 2 combat is garbage.
