But since there's no \n\nvariable wind-up time before the active frames you can parry really \n\nconsistently with any shield.\ufeff\n\n\n\nhe criticize DeS' healing system because you get virtually infinite healing \n\nitems, and then go and praise the Lifegem system? \n\n\n\n\nhe criticize DaS for blocking content with those orange magic walls, but \n\nconveniently fail to mention the ton of idiotic petrified dudes doing the \n\nexact same thing ALL OVER Drangleic. \n\n\n\nhe talk about how this game encourages rolling, but fail to mention that \n\nyour starting roll is shit until you put a bunch of levels into ADP. \n\n\n\nThe amount of \"dude in armor\" boss fights was never the problem. The problem \n\nwas just how boring and similar their movesets are (Dragonrider, Pursuer, \n\nSmelter Demon, etc.). Compare that to Artorias, Gwyn, Gundyr, Dancer, etc. \n\nAll of them have extremely different and creative movesets. \n\n\n\n\n\nhe talk about how some design choices in DaS or DeS make the game less fun, \n\nbut fail to mention how DaS2 is the most frustrating and least fun out of \n\nall the games PRECISELY because of some of the design choices you \"praise\" \n\n(the slowness of estus healing, the copy pasted enemies, i-frames depending \n\non ADP, the boring dude in armor boss fights that all play the same, the \n\nlack of enviromental story telling because of the \"beautiful and surprising \n\nincohesiveness\" of the level design you have a boner for, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n22:22  he criticize matthew for not criticizing demon's soul for using multi \n\nboss but  I'm almost certain that Matthew used the Tower Knight as an \n\nexample of how mutliple-enemy boss fights should be done, and even if he \n\ndidn't he cited the number of multiple-enemy boss fights in Demon's and Dark \n\nSouls 1, showing that he's perfectly aware of them. He just thought that the \n\nuse of multiple enemies in boss fights in DSII was less thoughtful than the \n\nprevious games and was used more as a crutch. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument made around 30:25 is nonsense. You don't need magical elevators \n\nor nonsensical level connections from Dark Souls 2 to provide a sense of \n\nmystery. You can literally see Duke's Archives from Anor Londo, yet you have \n\nno idea what the area looks like. You can't see Ash Lake from Sen's Fortress \n\nor Firelink Shrine, or heck even Blighttown, but those are logically \n\nconnected.\ufeff\n\n\n\n\nBadworld design is now 'giving it a sense of mystery' Holy shit that's the \n\nworst mental gymnastics I've seen in a while. It's like a different version \n\nof 'it's not a bug, it's a feature'.\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n8:51 \"...because dying while healing, or dying because you were unable to \n\nheal because tactically it would have killed you, is just never fun or \n\ninteresting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n This is the most incorrect thing I have ever heard anyone say about a Dark \n\nSouls game. The entire game is about managing your attacking, dodging, and \n\nhealing-your whole moveset, as well as your positioning-relative to what \n\nyour enemies are doing in order to not get hit. You have to time your dodges \n\nto not get hit and open up attack opportunities, you have to time your \n\nattacks in order to not get hit during your recovery time, and yes, you have \n\nto time your healing in order to not get punished. This creates tension-you \n\nare always looking for chances to get in damage, but always also at least a \n\nlittle scared of getting hit yourself! That is what makes Dark Souls both \n\ninteresting and fun. ESPECIALLY when healing, because when your health is \n\nlow and you are trying to get it back is when the stakes are highest... and \n\nthus, the tension the highest as well. This makes it very rewarding when you \n\nget a clutch heal off, and it would not feel nearly as good if it was easier \n\nto do.\n\n\n\nhe even describe this very thing at 9:06 , I don't really see why he\n\nthink it's a negative that healing is tantalizing but hard. he say that \n\nmore players have trouble with it, but that certainly does not mean it's the \n\nworse system, unless the best system is simply the one that the most players \n\ncan handle. And I say this all as one of the people who also likes ds2, for \n\nwhat it's worth. \n\n\n\n\nbasically the way he defends dark souls 2 is \n\n\n\n\n\"Dark souls 2 doesn't suck, because dark souls 1 and demon's souls does!also \n\nmatthewmatosis is wrong.\"\n\n\nhis video about defending  Dark Souls 2 is you spend as much if not more \n\ntime shitting on Dark Souls 1 and demon's souls and Matthew.\n\n\nis there any better video or even posts which does a better job defending the game than this guy.\n\n\nJoseph Anderson  kinda does that", "edited": 1492456898.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i posted this video here  as a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he tries to defend dark souls 2 which i really wanted since dark souls 2 is &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a really good game that i enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;however he made quite good number of errors that really made me not agree &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;with him even though i really enjoyed dark souls 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23:30  Matt was literally walking into the enemy&amp;#39;s back intentionally to &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;show off how they have a built in counter to being attacked from being.

You can&amp;#39;t see Ash Lake from Sen&amp;#39;s Fortress &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or Firelink Shrine, or heck even Blighttown, but those are logically &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;connected.\ufeff&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Badworld design is now &amp;#39;giving it a sense of mystery&amp;#39; Holy shit that&amp;#39;s the &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;worst mental gymnastics I&amp;#39;ve seen in a while. It&amp;#39;s like a different version &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of &amp;#39;it&amp;#39;s not a bug, it&amp;#39;s a feature&amp;#39;.\ufeff&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8:51 &amp;quot;...because dying while healing, or dying because you were unable to &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;heal because tactically it would have killed you, is just never fun or &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;interesting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the most incorrect thing I have ever heard anyone say about a Dark &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Souls game. The entire game is about managing your attacking, dodging, and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;healing-your whole moveset, as well as your positioning-relative to what &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;your enemies are doing in order to not get hit. You have to time your dodges &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to not get hit and open up attack opportunities, you have to time your &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;attacks in order to not get hit during your recovery time, and yes, you have &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to time your healing in order to not get punished. This creates tension-you &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;are always looking for chances to get in damage, but always also at least a &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;little scared of getting hit yourself! That is what makes Dark Souls both &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;interesting and fun. ESPECIALLY when healing, because when your health is &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;low and you are trying to get it back is when the stakes are highest... and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thus, the tension the highest as well. This makes it very rewarding when you &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;get a clutch heal off, and it would not feel nearly as good if it was easier &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he even describe this very thing at 9:06 , I don&amp;#39;t really see why he&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;think it&amp;#39;s a negative that healing is tantalizing but hard. he say that &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;more players have trouble with it, but that certainly does not mean it&amp;#39;s the &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;worse system, unless the best system is simply the one that the most players &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;can handle. And I say this all as one of the people who also likes ds2, for &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;what it&amp;#39;s worth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;basically the way he defends dark souls 2 is &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dark souls 2 doesn&amp;#39;t suck, because dark souls 1 and demon&amp;#39;s souls does!also &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;matthewmatosis is wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;his video about defending  Dark Souls 2 is you spend as much if not more &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;time shitting on Dark Souls 1 and demon&amp;#39;s souls and Matthew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;is there any better video or even posts which does a better job defending the game than this guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joseph Anderson  kinda does that&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dgcsxxo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492416624.0, "created_utc": 1492387824.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr32", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge2wur", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cryse_XIII", "parent_id": "t1_dge1i8e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "umbrage, got it.\n\n&gt;I don't think that's his argument.
