The damage asorption is way good to pass up.\n\nI find my weapons often enough, or avoid fighting enemies if I don't need to kill them. I break my weapons on Shaquoir and repair them each time I visit Majula, and also buy/use repair powder. If I skipped too many enemies I will do the Undead Purgatory boss, it's not really out of the way and only adds 15 minutes to the run. There is a risky strategy that can make the run twice as fast.

I'd use Rapier for enemies and Great Club for bosses and enemies with high poise. My shield is the Blossom Kite Shield, and rings change depending on the area, but usually keep Royal Soldiers Ring and Silver Serpent Ring +1 on at all times.
