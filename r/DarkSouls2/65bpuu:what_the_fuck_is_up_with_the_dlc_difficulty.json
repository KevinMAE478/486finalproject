And there is always more soul vessels, literally an infinite numbers, so respec as you like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And let me reiterate one thing: &lt;em&gt;you do not have to respec into straight melee for this!&lt;/em&gt; Casters can do just fine in the DLC in NG by infusing and buffing (although having access to high pure physical damage is more convenient).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i did this as a sorcerer, I used a magic infused longsword and a lightning infused winged spear. I did it again later at SL1 with a lightning infused rapier. And then again at SM 40k with a dark infused bluemoon greatsword. The mob enemies will usually go down in 2 to 3 hits, and you can keep them stun locked if you 2h and/or use the stone ring (don&amp;#39;t hit them with any attack that doesn&amp;#39;t break their poise!). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, the only spells I used were yearn, great magic weapon, and great soul arrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dg95w5j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207383.0, "created_utc": 1492178583.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg98ho8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JFConz", "parent_id": "t1_dg936hc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I used to run 70 INT, but the second I respec'd I found out why that is a bad idea.

The rest of the game is the most varied Souls game in terms of viable builds, basically anything you do will work, but magic builds (which are actually amazing, my lightning spears were one-shotting most enemies in the later half of the game) get the finger in the DLC areas and are suddenly not viable anymore for 3 specific areas. It&amp;#39;s weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The DLCs are still some of the best content in this game though, just not for builds that rely heavily on magic. It becomes bullshit when you have to cast 4-5 spells to take out basic enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dg9cztl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216036.0, "created_utc": 1492187236.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9d2k6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Alexis117", "parent_id": "t1_dg9crta", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But you'd be considered a man for using weapons.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;d be considered a man for using weapons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dg9d2k6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216120.0, "created_utc": 1492187320.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bpuu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgay4rv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExcessiveCAPS", "parent_id": "t1_dgagy1h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're attacking a straw-man you fucking idiot", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re attacking a straw-man you fucking idiot&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dgay4rv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492308037.0, "created_utc": 1492279237.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagy1h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NotLordShaxx", "parent_id": "t1_dgabk9c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How dare he play the game in a way he enjoys!?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How dare he play the game in a way he enjoys!?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dgagy1h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492275152.0, "created_utc": 1492246352.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgabk9c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExcessiveCAPS", "parent_id": "t1_dgabafw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not \"locked off\" at all, it's just the price you pay for picking the easiest fucking playstyle in the entire game.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;locked off&amp;quot; at all, it&amp;#39;s just the price you pay for picking the easiest fucking playstyle in the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dgabk9c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261848.0, "created_utc": 1492233048.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgabafw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "White_sama", "parent_id": "t1_dga6stc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well that's more of a bow thing.
