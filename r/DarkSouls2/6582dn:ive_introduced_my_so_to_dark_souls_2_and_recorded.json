I usually have a decent ear for identifying languages for some reason (I&amp;#39;m not trained in any other language aside from English, and a small amount of Spanish). I guess I&amp;#39;ve heard and seen enough of it to notice patterns. But when it comes to Portugese, yeah, it always throws me for a loop. Not that that&amp;#39;s a bad thing. I love how complex it is, at least from the perspective of a non-speaker of the language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "name": "t1_dga5ekt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492251916.0, "created_utc": 1492223116.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6582dn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6582dn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6582dn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9y988", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nothus", "parent_id": "t1_dg9pmuu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DarkSouls2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ha I'm happy for that!
