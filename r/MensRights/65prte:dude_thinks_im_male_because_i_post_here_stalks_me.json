Some people just can't wrap their heads around the idea that you can be *for* gender equal rights, but have serious reservations about, or even be against, feminism.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in Western Europe, the Catholic Church asserted an absolute monopoly over how Christians established a relationship with God. Among the secular population, it was taken for granted that the only way to be a good, pious Christian was to be a good Catholic, and follow unquestioningly the dictates of the clergy. To even hint that a person could be a good Christian without following the Church was at some times a crime punishable by death.\n\nFinally, somebody got fed up. A theologian named Martin Luther, basing his reasoning on good scholarship and careful reasoning, rejected the notion that a person could establish their relationship with God only through the Catholic Church. He advanced the novel idea that people could establish a closer relationship with God and the teachings of Jesus through direct examination of both the New Testament and their own conscience.\n\nThis is pretty much taken for granted nowadays. But it was appallingly heretical by the Catholic hierarchy when it first emerged. They had no way of fitting it into their worldview. It challenged the Church's monopoly over Christian thought. The idea that a person could find their own relationship with the Almighty without the intervention of clergy was anathema. So they branded Protestants as heretics, Satan-worshippers, etc. - as it was the only way they could fit Protestantism within their limited worldview. \nThey were psychologically incapable of of seeing the good points of this argument or understanding that a person could be both a good Christian and a non-Catholic.\n\nThe same thing is happening with the challenge to feminism that the men's rights movement presents. The MRM breaks the monopoly in the debate over how gender is 'constructed' and/or how equality is achieved. The MRM posits that men have their own concerns, their own worldviews, their goals and ways of breaking out of gender stereotypes and roles assigned to men, their own take on equality and human rights. That one can be both in favor of human rights for women as well as for men.\n\nThis seems to be extremely threatening on an intellectual level to some (not all) people who profess to be feminists. They assume that gender roles, constructs and relationships can only be examined within a framework of feminist thought. Some of them simply don't know how to fit the MRM into their worldview, not realizing \u2013 or perhaps, simply not accepting - that it's their worldview that is in need of adjustment. Their discomfort and confusion drives them to search relentlessly for the smallest nugget of evidence to brand MRAs as misogynist, homophobic and racist. In the same way the Protestant challenge drove the Catholic hierarchy to brand all Protestants as in league with the devil.\n\nIt's easier that way. There is nothing you have to change in your worldview. Nothing you have to re-think. Nothing that has to change.\n\n\nThe confusion and discomfort is also evident when they make claims like, 'If you want to achieve better rights and conditions for males, you must do it through feminism and by working with feminists.' It's like the Catholic Church saying to Luther, 'If you want to have a closer relationship with God, you must only do it through the Church.'\n\nThis person thinks you're a man because they are simply psychologically incapable of understanding the concept that a female can think men's concerns are important, too.
