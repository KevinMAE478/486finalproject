Let's look at some legal norms they changed:\n\nChild custody: \n\nPrior to the mid 1800s, men got the kids in a divorce. This is because he was solely financially responsible for them. \n\nCaroline Norton in the UK convinced the establishment to change the system such that children of \"tender years\" (under 8 or so, later expanded to all minors) rightly belonged with the mother. Of course, dad still got stuck with the cost of financially supporting the kids's household, regardless of whether his ex wife was wealthy in her own right.\n\nMarital property: \n\nPrior to the mid 1800s, women handed some (not all) of their property to their husbands upon marriage. In return, they were granted an entitlement to his financial support, rights as his agent to purchase goods on his credit, the right to legal redress if he failed to support her adequately (or used her \"portion\" not to her benefit), dower rights to his real property, and immunity from prosecution/penalty even on debts she solely accrued. \n\nFirst wave feminists changed things such that a married woman held her income and property \"femme sole\" (as if unmarried), meaning her husband (and children) had no right or claim to it (in fact, her husband had no right to even see documentation of it). Yet all of the benefits and entitlements of marriage for women remained in place. A woman could invest her money unwisely and go into debt, and her husband was held responsible for repayment. If she refused to pay her taxes, her husband could go to prison for tax evasion, because paying the taxes on her income and property was still legally his responsibility. She could still accrue debt in his name. She still maintained the right to demand he support her and the children, even if she was wealthy, and had the right to sue him if she was forced to spend a penny of her own money on her own upkeep, let alone his or the children's. Dower rights remained in place, meaning she could sell a house she owned without his permission or knowledge, but he could not sell a house he owned without her consent. \n\nIncidentally, feminists in New York State in 1910 were claiming that these changes didn't go far enough. They insisted that rights regarding children discriminated against mothers, and should be equalized. Of course, by then, the Tender Years doctrine was in place (favoring women), and within marriage mothers were considered equal custodians and guardians of their children. The only part of the law that discriminated against women was regarding minor children's property and income, which the law rightly placed in the care of the father (the parent financially responsible for supporting said children). Feminists, however, wanted women to have equal control over their children's money, despite legally bearing no financial responsibility to them whatsoever.\n\nContracts:\n\nBy the late 1800s, feminists, in conjunction with changes to marital property law, won the right for married women to enter into contracts in their own names. Of course, at the time, their husbands were still legally liable for any debts their wives might accrue, so it became common practice for lenders to require a male cosigner on mortgages and loans. That is, they wanted to identify a male who would take responsibility for the debt if she defaulted, and have access to his credit rating before lending money. This avoided the inevitable sticky legal mess of locating the man responsible after the fact and getting their money back. \n\nImagine if your spouse could walk into a bank and be given a credit card in her name without your knowledge or consent, and then when the bill came due you were held responsible for paying it. \n\nIncidentally, by the 1960s, feminists were complaining that the practice of requiring a male cosigner arbitrarily discriminated against women and it was made illegal.

Let&amp;#39;s look at some legal norms they changed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Child custody: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to the mid 1800s, men got the kids in a divorce. This is because he was solely financially responsible for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caroline Norton in the UK convinced the establishment to change the system such that children of &amp;quot;tender years&amp;quot; (under 8 or so, later expanded to all minors) rightly belonged with the mother. Of course, dad still got stuck with the cost of financially supporting the kids&amp;#39;s household, regardless of whether his ex wife was wealthy in her own right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marital property: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to the mid 1800s, women handed some (not all) of their property to their husbands upon marriage. In return, they were granted an entitlement to his financial support, rights as his agent to purchase goods on his credit, the right to legal redress if he failed to support her adequately (or used her &amp;quot;portion&amp;quot; not to her benefit), dower rights to his real property, and immunity from prosecution/penalty even on debts she solely accrued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First wave feminists changed things such that a married woman held her income and property &amp;quot;femme sole&amp;quot; (as if unmarried), meaning her husband (and children) had no right or claim to it (in fact, her husband had no right to even see documentation of it). Yet all of the benefits and entitlements of marriage for women remained in place. A woman could invest her money unwisely and go into debt, and her husband was held responsible for repayment. If she refused to pay her taxes, her husband could go to prison for tax evasion, because paying the taxes on her income and property was still legally his responsibility. She could still accrue debt in his name. She still maintained the right to demand he support her and the children, even if she was wealthy, and had the right to sue him if she was forced to spend a penny of her own money on her own upkeep, let alone his or the children&amp;#39;s.
