One man ogles the butt of the woman in front of him, meanwhile his butt is being ogled by the gay man behind him. When he realizes this, the straight man turns on the gay man and yells at him aggressively, and the cartoon says something like &amp;#39;men upset when they&amp;#39;re treated the same as they treat women&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s the moral of the story then? Was it terrible for the gay man to ogle the other guy&amp;#39;s butt? Most people would say he shouldn&amp;#39;t get so offended and take it as a compliment, because otherwise it&amp;#39;s seen as homophobic. And what about the straight man&amp;#39;s aggressive reaction?
