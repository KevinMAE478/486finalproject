I agree that Cassie would have a much better chance of prevailing in Australia, but I think things would still get messy and therefore very expensive very quickly.  \n\nLayman's guess, but a lot of the argument would probably revolve around whether USU's statement constituted, in the eyes of the law, assertion as fact rather than honest opinion (which is never defamatory; notice their wording, \"We believe that there is ... the possibility ...\") and what is *actually* true.  \n\nThat latter point can prove much more complicated in matters of this kind that you might think.  To the extent that they state anything as fact, nothing (in my reading of it) is obviously false.  The film could quite reasonably be construed anti-feminist.

To find that such an assertion is a statement of fact could have far reaching consequences and judges, especially at appellate level and higher, are often reluctant to create precedents that could be misused or pose significant risk of unintended consequences.\n\nTo complicate matters, the USU Board has a legal obligation to uphold their constitution to the best of their ability and they have a fiduciary duty of care toward their members.  Their statement cites a constitutional rule which, in their opinion, likely precludes the showing of the film at their properties.  Since application of their constitution is contingent on their interpretation of the film, an explanation of that interpretation is probably in order and not obviously defamatory (because interpretation is opinion).\n\nu/real-boethius's link contains an interesting comment about ambiguous statements.  It is for the court to decide whether a reasonable person would impute defamation of Cassie Jaye herself from what USU wrote, and their likely conclusion is not obvious.  \n\nI've already pointed this out, but I'll say it again: \n\nThere's a difference between defamation of a person's character or reputation and injurious falsehood about a person's product or commercial enterprise.  USU's statement says very little that could be defamatory of character.  Most of it is directed at the film itself, in which case the tort would more likely be injurious falsehood which, as I've already pointed out, is a high bar, approximating that of US defamation of public figures.\n\nShe might well win, but it's by no means guaranteed.

Instead of talking about the issues that women face she chooses to focus on feminazi extremists like big red and baits them into saying that men&amp;#39;s rights don&amp;#39;t matter.  But to say that is anti woman is just outright false.  The film didn&amp;#39;t once touch on a woman&amp;#39;s rights issue so therefore cannot be anti woman. (unless you count the segment about abortions, but that was focused on how men don&amp;#39;t have a say in the matter).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish she would have taken an approach to illustrate that men&amp;#39;s rights and woman&amp;#39;s rights are two separate issues and that they do not directly conflict one another.
