Civil War, a horrible backlash against racial minorities, utterly destroying the left for generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the stupidest thing the huffington post has ever put out, even MTV and Buzzfeed didn&amp;#39;t get this fucking stupid. Seriously the Huffington post should print an apology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The irony is that this article will hurt minorities because its so unrealistic it will never happen, but it will be an all you can eat feast for the more racist elements of the alt right and encourage racial divisions leading to racial minorities dealing with more bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These kinds of idiots will destroy the left yet and fuck over those of us on the left who actually have a brain. All an article like this will do will be to push white men further to the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MensRights", "name": "t1_dg7pwoh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126637.0, "created_utc": 1492097837.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65616h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sit7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "want-to-say-this", "parent_id": "t3_65616h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Who will enforce such laws?\"  \"White men!\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who will enforce such laws?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;White men!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MensRights", "name": "t1_dg7sit7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129414.0, "created_utc": 1492100614.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65616h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65616h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8l4z8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HellsGate_", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dxf7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It used to be well understood on the left.
