The problem is the unconscious bias, when you close your eyes and picture a software engineer, someone who &amp;quot;fits in with the team&amp;#39;s culture&amp;quot;, you probably don&amp;#39;t picture a woman. The same way that I am sure that male nurses or male kindergarten teachers have trouble getting hired as easily as women in those fields. People don&amp;#39;t imagine a man when they think of a nurse, so men need to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; they are worthy of the job even more than a woman would have to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edited to make my argument more gender neutral.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MensRights", "name": "t1_dgbs6vl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492353183.0, "created_utc": 1492324383.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbs15z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "renloo", "parent_id": "t1_dgbpns0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I work in software and have noticed that this happens", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in software and have noticed that this happens&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MensRights", "name": "t1_dgbs15z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492352801.0, "created_utc": 1492324001.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpns0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 38, "report_reasons": null, "author": "seahorses", "parent_id": "t1_dgbpi1i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Source for \"Women are more likely to be hired even if they are less qualified than a male \"?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source for &amp;quot;Women are more likely to be hired even if they are less qualified than a male &amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MensRights", "name": "t1_dgbpns0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347815.0, "created_utc": 1492319015.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l4sw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbz66o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ClefAria", "parent_id": "t1_dgbpi1i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The gap is 1.6%, most likely within the margin of error, once you compare only within the same company, at the same level.\n\nhttp://info.haygroupupdate.com/global-en-GenderPayWhite-Paper_technicalreport-X1Y1.html", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap is 1.6%, most likely within the margin of error, once you compare only within the same company, at the same level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://info.haygroupupdate.com/global-en-GenderPayWhite-Paper_technicalreport-X1Y1.html\"&gt;http://info.haygroupupdate.com/global-en-GenderPayWhite-Paper_technicalreport-X1Y1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MensRights", "name": "t1_dgbz66o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492374455.0, "created_utc": 1492345655.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l4sw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l4sw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbwlru", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EtherMan", "parent_id": "t1_dgbrrt5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd suggest you actually go read the actual study for that link.
