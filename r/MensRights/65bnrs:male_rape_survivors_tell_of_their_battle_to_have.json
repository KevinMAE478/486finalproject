Women are always able to empathize and relate to other women but when it comes to men or male victims.. they can barely muster up any empathy for us unless we happen to be a close loved one to them.. \n\nBefore I start getting accused of talking out of my ass and just being \"misogynistic\".. these biases have been proven with multiple scientific studies that I will link below. \n\nHere is a good abstract to the following study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15491274/\n\n&gt; Four experiments confirmed that women's automatic in-group bias is remarkably stronger than men's and investigated explanations for this sex difference, derived from potential sources of implicit attitudes (L. A. Rudman, 2004). In Experiment 1, only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem (A. G. Greenwald et al., 2002), revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic own group preference. Experiments 2 and 3 found pro-female bias to the extent that participants automatically favored their mothers over their fathers or associated male gender with violence, suggesting that maternal bonding and male intimidation influence gender attitudes. Experiment 4 showed that for sexually experienced men, the more positive their attitude was toward sex, the more they implicitly favored women. In concert, the findings help to explain sex differences in automatic in-group bias and underscore the uniqueness of gender for intergroup relations theorists.\n\nAnd here is the full paper\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2c44/14cde6b6a011e9f4910e6389d658278e3a7a.pdf\n\nAnd here is the Wikipedia page about the \"women are wonderful effect\".

A. Rudman, 2004). In Experiment 1, only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem (A. G. Greenwald et al., 2002), revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic own group preference. Experiments 2 and 3 found pro-female bias to the extent that participants automatically favored their mothers over their fathers or associated male gender with violence, suggesting that maternal bonding and male intimidation influence gender attitudes. Experiment 4 showed that for sexually experienced men, the more positive their attitude was toward sex, the more they implicitly favored women. In concert, the findings help to explain sex differences in automatic in-group bias and underscore the uniqueness of gender for intergroup relations theorists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is the full paper&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2c44/14cde6b6a011e9f4910e6389d658278e3a7a.pdf\"&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2c44/14cde6b6a011e9f4910e6389d658278e3a7a.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is the Wikipedia page about the &amp;quot;women are wonderful effect&amp;quot;.

That is why changes get saved up and made in big jumps.  Everybody knows not to compare data before &amp; after 1992 because so many big changes were made then.  \n\nThe other thing is that FBI data comes from state police, who have varying laws and policies.

You should research [Erin Pizzey](https://honest-ribbon.org/domestic-violence-law/refuting-40-years-of-lies-about-domestic-violence) . She's a women that created the very first women's shelter. After she had spent so much time with DV victims (men and women because she didn't discriminate) she learned that men were victims just as often as women, and that the abuse often went both ways. When she tried to release her findings feminists fought to censor her. They threatened her, harassed her and ran her out of the country. She went on to co-found [A Voice for Men](www.avoiceformen.com) and became a strong supporter of Men's Rights issues.\n\nThis kind of behavior and pushback is the reason that there are thousands of DV shelters for women today, but only one men's shelter. And out of all the female domestic violence shelters, less than 5% are willing to take in men.\n\nAlso the [Duluth Model](http://www.batteredmen.com/batdulut.htm)  that was created by feminists which states that DV is caused by the patriarchy giving all men power over all women. They claim that because women are the oppressed gender, it's impossible for them to be the aggressor. These ideas were made into laws that have discriminated against male victims for decades and these practices are still in use in many states today. \n\nIf you take the time to actually research the feminist movement, you might learn that feminism has harmed men and fought against men's issues a lot more that you ever imagined. \n\nThere's a reason we are anti-feminist.. \n\nEDIT: if you truly want to understand the Men's Rights Movement then I encourage you to watch a new documentary, [\"The Red Pill\" by feminist filmmaker Cassie Jaye.](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt3686998/) (No, it has nothing to do with TRP subreddit, I promise. Yes, it is a poor choice of a title). \n\nThat movie is a great starting point and it gives a fair and balanced overview of the Men's Rights movement.
