While the law generally only covered items that would be considered necessaries, many women used their authority as their husbands' agents to purchase livestock, business inventory and other things that did not fit the definition of \"necessaries\".

Low-status males are duped into accepting their fate via manipulative social norms. Being treated as property is bad for women, but at least they are generally a valued resource in patriarchal societies; low-status men have it worse.\n\n&gt; In fact, the worst victims of patriarchy are the low-status, unmarriageable men who do the most dirty, dangerous jobs in society for peanuts.\n\nYou keep referring to traditional marriage-based societies and mistaking them for patriarchies. They are not. Marriage was the solution to patriarchy. Social norms that dictate men &amp; women couple up in 2-person marriages ensure that almost all men are able to find a mate, just as almost all women have always been able to.\n\nSo looking back at the structure of a patriarchy, which sounds like the least appealing way to live out your life?\n\na) as any woman, meaning that you'd be one of several/many mates of a high-status male who had the power &amp; resources to support a large family;\n\nOR\n\nb) as a non-elite male, who would spend your entire life in grinding drudgery, working in the service of an elite male - unless you died young as cannon fodder in battle - with no hope of ever having a female partner, let alone kids and raising a family.\n\nI'm gonna say a) is the far more appealing option.
