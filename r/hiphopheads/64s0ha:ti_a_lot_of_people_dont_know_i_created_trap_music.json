The term Trap is meant to describe the overwhelming sentiments that many people feel or experience, they literally feel &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot; due to their circumstances: lack of opportunities, economic and educational inequalities, discriminatory practices by corporations and law enforcement, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m of the mind that the term Trap, in the sense that T.I. and others such as OutKast, and Jeezy have used it conform to the definition used above. Hence, when TIP says on &amp;#39;Trap Muzik&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Nigga this tha trap! This ain&amp;#39;t no album, this ain&amp;#39;t no game, nigga this tha trap&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s by and large a representation, a manifesto of those that find themselves in the very same environment where the dominating sentiment as it relates to pulling oneself out of said environment is through one of the trifecta of rapping, hooping, or selling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "name": "t1_dg5ceel", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993212.0, "created_utc": 1491964412.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5bs8p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ForeverxJoker", "parent_id": "t1_dg56trv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hiphopheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean they didn't come up with the term trap, in this case Big Boi isn't using it do describe music anyway so it's not the same ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean they didn&amp;#39;t come up with the term trap, in this case Big Boi isn&amp;#39;t using it do describe music anyway so it&amp;#39;s not the same &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "name": "t1_dg5bs8p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491992365.0, "created_utc": 1491963565.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg56trv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jspeed04", "parent_id": "t1_dg4x46a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hiphopheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not to mention 'Spottiottidogalicsious'.\n\n\"And now you in the trap, just that... trapped.
