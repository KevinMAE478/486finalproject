With the rise of the internet and the pending death of industry-based music, we&amp;#39;re quickly advancing into a post-genre paradigm. Pop is influenced by hip-hop is influenced by jazz is influenced by rock is influenced by...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays music is just music, and it&amp;#39;s dope. We&amp;#39;re in a world where U2 can work with Kendrick Lamar and sound totally natural, among so many other collabs. Some of the best music out there nowadays reaches across multiple genres without sounding contrived or gimmicky, it just happens. Music is better now than it ever has been and I can&amp;#39;t wait to see where it goes over the course of my life.
