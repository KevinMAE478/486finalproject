Obviously the cover takes some inspiration like minimalistic coves in the same vein as Viper's, but there's like still a lot of important decisions that make the cover more than just slapping a word and a parental advisory logo on a photo.\n\n- The text bleeds the edge in a very deliberate way. The size is well thought out, and to compensate, the period is stylized by also bleeding the edge and being letterspaced to the point where it's very noticeable. \n\n- The red is hella saturated, definitely fighting for attention with Kendrick's near pure white shirt.\n\n- The parental advisory sticker bleeds as well, and it's not tucked in a corner as the designer said. It's much large than usual, and it's moved up so it doesn't hide Kendrick's arm.\n\n- I've seen a lot of complaints regarding the wall clashing with the text, or not being even, but honestly, that's the point. It's aggressive. It's not made to be tidy.\n\n- The lighting is sublime here. If the light was moved a little to the left, it would be too dark, and a little to the right and you lose quite a bit of tension.\n\nHonestly, think whatever you wanna think, but I hate when people act like something that's simple is devoid of decisions being made. Every move here is calculated to make the cover feel impromptu, hectic, and abrasive. It looks like it's zoomed in, cropped, to be more fierce. The position of Kendrick in front of the bricks is really well balanced. Even the way the text interacts with his hair doesn't feel awkward.
