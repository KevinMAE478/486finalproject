He's definitely a good lyricist, and he can flow pretty well. What impacts him negatively is his overly reverent approach to rapping. His style is almost 100% influenced by old-guard New York rap cliches, and as such he's very predictable in terms of what he says and how he goes about saying it.\n\nThe conscious thoughtful lyrical approach is one that can be interesting if done well, but it doesn't stick out as a fresh execution in 2017, where charisma is more useful as a distinguishing factor than lyrical skill. This is self-evident on the true-school posse cut \"Ring the Alarm,\" where Meechy Darko's hook alone is more memorable than a whole slew of lyrical miracle verses that all sound largely the same. Styles P and ScHoolboy Q similarly steal Badass's thunder with their more distinctive voices and flows.\n\nIt's also a shame that, considering how well Joey has freestyled over beats like \"Mask Off\" and \"Tunnel Vision,\" the beats on here are so unmemorable and unadventurous. Much like Joey himself, the beats are very clean-sounding and do a good job of making a cohesive album, but they ultimately display relatively little variation from song to song. There's a cool laid-back sound on this album as a whole, but there is no beat here that I thought stood out among the others.\n\nJoey's political angle here is fine, and adds some diversity to his lyrical palette. I enjoy seeing political rap make something of a resurgence these past few months.\n\nAnyway, this is a perfectly fine album, but not a particularly memorable one. Joey Badass's skill as a rapper is apparent immediately, but I don't usually remember any of the lines that he says because of his samey delivery. Most of the songs on here lack replay value to me besides the ones with strong features. It all sort of washes over you like good-but-not-great albums tend to do. In my opinion, rap has moved past this type of music for the most part. People should stop gauging a rapper's abilities based on their ability to fit into a cypher in 1996 New York. Put on some Nas or something if you want to hear \"real\" lyricism that isn't derivative, otherwise I recommend exploring people who actually have their own sound. 6/10.\n\nStandouts:\n\"FOR MY PEOPLE\"\n\"LAND OF THE FREE\"\n\"ROCKABYE BABY (feat. ScHoolboy Q)\"\n\"SUPER PREDATOR (feat. Styles P)\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdict: It&amp;#39;s alright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joey Badass is a good rapper. He&amp;#39;s definitely a good lyricist, and he can flow pretty well. What impacts him negatively is his overly reverent approach to rapping. His style is almost 100% influenced by old-guard New York rap cliches, and as such he&amp;#39;s very predictable in terms of what he says and how he goes about saying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conscious thoughtful lyrical approach is one that can be interesting if done well, but it doesn&amp;#39;t stick out as a fresh execution in 2017, where charisma is more useful as a distinguishing factor than lyrical skill. This is self-evident on the true-school posse cut &amp;quot;Ring the Alarm,&amp;quot; where Meechy Darko&amp;#39;s hook alone is more memorable than a whole slew of lyrical miracle verses that all sound largely the same. Styles P and ScHoolboy Q similarly steal Badass&amp;#39;s thunder with their more distinctive voices and flows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a shame that, considering how well Joey has freestyled over beats like &amp;quot;Mask Off&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tunnel Vision,&amp;quot; the beats on here are so unmemorable and unadventurous. Much like Joey himself, the beats are very clean-sounding and do a good job of making a cohesive album, but they ultimately display relatively little variation from song to song. There&amp;#39;s a cool laid-back sound on this album as a whole, but there is no beat here that I thought stood out among the others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joey&amp;#39;s political angle here is fine, and adds some diversity to his lyrical palette.
