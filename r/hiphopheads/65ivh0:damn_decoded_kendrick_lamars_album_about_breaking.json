I think this is one of the most ambitious rap albums I&amp;#39;ve heard to date because Kendrick attempts to bridge the gap between a God-centric rap album and just a great sounding album. It&amp;#39;s about suffering and sacrifice, insecurity, and fear. That&amp;#39;s what a godly man encounters daily, and Kendrick pulled off translating that into music.

He wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same artist he is if he kept these things out of the music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, to me his albums feel more like a message to himself rather than others. I don&amp;#39;t feel like he is telling others how to feel very often.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "name": "t1_dgbh6qn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492334581.0, "created_utc": 1492305781.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh4c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivh0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh4c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ivh0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb4ixy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "funkybuttl0vin", "parent_id": "t1_dgb0po1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hiphopheads", "controversiality": 1, "body": "So Kendrick, of all people, is just making empty superficial songs with no meaning?
