The beat is noticeably darker than earlier tracks. It starts with a long chorus and interlude before swinging into K-Dot\u2019s verses. In his verses, he raps from the perspective of different people going about their lives in the ghetto. The first guy wakes up thinking about money, gets high, hangs with his homies, stunts on his baby mama, sips some lean, gets a pistol, shoots out the window, etc. He delivers it fairly monotone, stressing the predictability of the routine. The woman showers, puts her weave on, makeup on, bitches at her man, pops a pill, goes to the club, and twerks the night away. There\u2019s omnipresent repetition that you cannot miss. It\u2019s clearly deliberate. It drills home that these peoples\u2019 lives have reached a point of routine banality\u2014that they\u2019re somehow lacking the spark of \u201cnewness.\u201d This could be the thirst he\u2019s talking about, about \u201cputting the head in.\u201d Indeed, near the end, he even describes this sort of routine as having \u201cshame.\u201d The musical texture of this song is imbued with a very low-key, inescapable despair. There\u2019s intense beauty in his portrayal of this sorrow. It\u2019s an intense criticism at the mindless ways in which we conduct our daily life; I want to listen to it more and more, to be moved by its beauty, but a part of me is repulsed by the horror he's so artfully articulating.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cLove.\u201d: Damn, Zacari\u2019s vocals are wispy and enchanting. The way his chanting of \u201clove me\u201d floats ethereally over K-Dot\u2019s bars has an element I\u2019ve never heard in a hip-hop album before. Here, the album seems to put the brakes on: the beats return to the sweeping, epicness we saw in the very beginning of the album. The \u201cwhoooph\u201d effect reminds me of some lighter effects we hear in dubstep. This is one of those songs that it\u2019s hard to say is purely hip-hop, where he blends genres in a unique, interesting way. Light, airy, and melodic, this is some great art that will most definitely have a very broad group of listeners bobbing their head to its melody.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cXXX.\u201d: I was terrified at the U2 feature, so I\u2019m happy as shit to tell you: this track is dope. Bono leads in with \u201cAmerica, God bless you if it\u2019s good to you,\u201d which is a pretty sly way to jump right into a politically-dense track. All men (and women) might be created equal; however, we are thrust into whatever environment we are given, and not all environments are equal. We are the product of vast, inexorable historical forces, forces that extend beyond the scope of our vision. Kenny raps over a cop car siren about violent revenge\u2014the limitlessness of his rage if anyone touches his \u201cmama, sister, woman, daddy, niece, nephew, brother\u201d\u2014before subsiding into Bono singing about the sounds of drum and bass in America. In the context of K-dot rapping about violence and revenge, what should be musical beauty is transformed into screeching tires, gunshots, police loudspeakers. Cornrow Kenny\u2019s follow-up verse has a correspondingly much slower tempo, and the lyrics plunge a level deeper into socio-political meditation: powerful lines like \u201cThe great American flag / is wrapped and dragged with explosives,\u201d and \u201cWall street, corporate offices, banks / Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts.\u201d There\u2019s something subversive about this imagery. The flag, freedom, is tainted with death and destruction. Financial leaders are painted as murderers. The capitalistic forces that have generated tremendous wealth have done so at great cost. He brings FOX news up again as an agent of these forces, complicit in the cost.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cFear.\u201d: Here we FUCKING go. I\u2019m saying it right now: in an album chock-full of amazing music, this is the best track on the album. When I heard the guitar licks in the beat on \u201cThe Heart Pt. 4,\u201d I was salty as fuck that they only lasted less than 20 seconds. Here they are, fully developed. It starts with his cousin Carl leaving a voicemail on his answering machine. Carl wants to reassure Kenny. He knows K-Dot been feeling down about people not praying for him, so he quotes Deuteronomy 28:28: \u201cThe Lord shall smite thee with a madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart.\u201d It feels like a warning\u2014a stern reminding that everyone around Kenny is dealing with their own shit too, so he\u2019s got to cut others some slack for not \u201cpraying for him,\u201d despite having \u201ca chip on his shoulder.\u201d What follows afterward is some of the smoothest, most evocative rapping I\u2019ve heard in my life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the first verse, he raps from the perspective of his mom raising a young seven-year-old Kenny (seven deadly sins, anyone?). She delivers a series of edicts about must and must-nots\u2014very similar to the style of an Old Testament God. If Kendrick disobeys, she threatens him with a beating. Here, the smoothness and tranquility of the guitar licking over the even-tempo drumming has an irony: when Kendrick was young and innocent, his mom loomed large, like a vindictive Ancient God whose words were absolute law and transgressions were to be severely punished.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis leads to the dope AF line in the chorus of \u201cIf I could smoke fear away, I\u2019d roll that motherfucker up.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext verse, he\u2019s 17, so 10 years have passed. Now, in an onslaught of bars all beginning \u201cI\u2019ll prolly die,\u201d he lists all the ways a 17-year-old black man can die in contemporary America: \u201cfrom buying weed; from trying to diffuse two friends arguing; from blue badges; from those colors standing out.\u201d It seems inevitable, his soul being extinguished at the tender age of 17, on the cusp of adulthood, but what can you do when statistics point toward insane violence around African-American men of that age? He delivers these bars with monotone vocals, suggesting an indifference, an inevitability, a resignation to his fate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext verse, he\u2019s 27, so 10 more years have passed. At 27, he\u2019s terrified of losing his money and returning to the entrapping system of poverty in Compton\u2014back to Section 8. This is the most overwhelming emotional force on this verse: fear. This segues into the final verse where he reveals the way fear infects people and destroys their confidence: fear paralyzes and leads to inaction and regret; fear destroys knowledge of humility and love; and fear acts as the main motivator behind all his actions, all his desires to be a catalyst for good in the world. If they\u2019re all rooted in fear, then does that imply his soul is impure, his motives don\u2019t mean shit? Carl clarifies it later in the call, when he explains the relevance of the scripture as God punishing us for our own good, that our emotional instability, our constant insecurity, our self-inflicted torment, is our \u201ccurse,\u201d is how he \u201cchastises\u201d us. He says there\u2019s no hope for escaping this until we follow scripture strictly and ends by saying he prays for Kendrick. Fucking amazing song.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cGOD.\u201d: Not a super memorable track, tbh\u2014especially following up the glory that is \u201cFear.\u201d I\u2019d put it in the same league as \u201cLoyalty.\u201d It feels a bit poppy and fluffy, and in an album with so many great moments, it\u2019s easy to lose this one in the sea of awesomeness. Feel free to convince me otherwise, but I\u2019d probably put this as my least favorite track. It starts to introduce the feeling of \u201cthe album is winding down,\u201d which is a nice setup to \u201cDuckworth.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cDuckworth.\u201d: This track is one humongous verse spat over a banging beat, jam-packed with a detailed narrative that loops back into the first track. His wordplay and syllabic mastery is ridiculous here, with this standout moment: \u201cSo many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works / Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious, / Prevalent propositions with nines.\u201d His delivery here is sputtered, broken up, like a staccato violin. It\u2019s fucking dope. This track is a meditation on the ways in which the lives of strangers intersect. It\u2019s first-class storytelling, as well, as we get to see the origin story of Anthony \u201cTop Dawg\u201d and Kendrick\u2019s dad, Ducky. We learn because K-Dot\u2019s dad gave him free chicken and biscuits at the KFC he worked out, Anthony didn\u2019t hurt him when he robbed the place. Because of this, TDE exists, and Kendrick grew up with a dad. It leads into a cyclical reversal of the album back to the moment on the first track with his encounter with a blind person. Fan-fucking-tastic narrative force, concise bars, and a smooth conceptual roundup to the album\u2019s overall ideas surrounding chance, of punishment, and divine retribution.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStandout Moments: \u201cYAH.\u201d \u201cPride.\u201d \u201cLove.\u201d \u201cXXX.\u201d \u201cFear.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLeast Memorable Moments: \u201cLoyalty.\u201d \u201cGOD.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverall Score:  9/10", "edited": 1492214794.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLust.\u201d: This song is a compelling criticism on mundane life-routines. The beat is noticeably darker than earlier tracks. It starts with a long chorus and interlude before swinging into K-Dot\u2019s verses. In his verses, he raps from the perspective of different people going about their lives in the ghetto. The first guy wakes up thinking about money, gets high, hangs with his homies, stunts on his baby mama, sips some lean, gets a pistol, shoots out the window, etc. He delivers it fairly monotone, stressing the predictability of the routine.

I wanted to wait until the evening to listen to it, since my roommate was home during the day and I wanted no interruptions, plus the nighttime vibe gives me the same feel I\u2019d get if I were listening to it when it dropped on the west coast.    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just finished lying on my bed, lights off, headphones on, having one of the fucking coolest musical experiences of my life. These are my immediate impressions of \u201cDAMN.\u201d I haven\u2019t read any other reviews yet, nor have I had much time to digest. These thoughts are the product of one listen, and I\u2019m 100% sure this is going to be on permanent rotation for the foreseeable future. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*General Impressions:* There\u2019s a dramatic divergence in sound here. His sound has gone in a completely new direction. I love seeing an artist pushing his creative limits. Usually it doesn\u2019t come off as well as it came off in \u201cDAMN.\u201d but fuck me\u2014this feels like the creation of a new genre. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHis vocals remain as sharp and powerful as ever, and his track list's structure feels purposeful: he leads into tracks with coherence and talent. It feels so cohesive\u2014this is what happens when your other released albums have already demonstrated an ability to deliver cohesive content that remains intact despite spanning long, complex track listings. He blends his spirituality with a hip-hop ethos in the most compelling way I\u2019ve seen yet\u2014more compelling than hearing Chance or Kanye\u2019s treatment of their religiosity. He switches between contemplating philosophy to incisive anecdotes on a dime, which creates a cool-as-shit musical experience in which one track can be incredibly dense, laden with both recondite biblical scripture and down-to-earth, jamming melodies, to say nothing of the rich storytelling layered over thick, lyrically dense bars. *I feel like Kung Fu Kenny chops us up with a syllabic katana.* He also sings more than I\u2019ve heard in his other work, and for a rapper, he has a pretty incredible range. He also drops some excellent point-of-view switch-ups that remind me of his older work. He remains a master craftsman of a poignant and vivid narrative that challenges the listener\u2019s assumption. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe beats were incredibly varied. There is a lot to listen to here. I\u2019d go so far as to say it\u2019s his most accessible album: you\u2019ve got the rolling, epic beats that remind me of \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d whose melody can only be described as slowly overwhelming you before receding; there are some standard drum and bass setups with auto-tune that fit nicely into the pop audience\u2019s expectation of what modern \u201chip-hop\u201d (lol) sounds like, which is also interesting, because the more tame beats tend to have some of the more subversive lyrics/deliveries; and then there are also moments that hearken back to music\u2019s earlier ages, where there has been some fucking amazing sampling work. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe album\u2019s overall cohesiveness is top notch. The audio levels sound correctly balanced, the mixing is smooth, and the general melodic structure exceeds expectations. There are hints of the upcoming tracks in the previous tracks through smart teasing of melodies and sounds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Track Breakdown:* \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cBlood.\u201d: This intro track establishes the narrative that wraps around the album. It\u2019s a skit of Kenny walking over to help a blind woman, who ends up shooting him. The relentlessness of the drums and the haunting chorus of \u201cIt is wickedness or weakness? You decide, are we gonna live or die?\u201d strike a very ethereal note\u2014much like the \u201cparanormal vibe\u201d lyric he dropped on \u201cThe Heart Pt. 4.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty interesting way conceptually to begin an album and immediately hooked my attention. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cDNA.\u201d: Immediately, the surreal, pulsating mood is shattered after listening to a brief clip of FOX news reporters misinterpreting \u201cAlright\u201d from TPAB. The mood in \u201cDNA\u201d is fast and furious, angry and fuming. It establishes a very aggressive attitude, which emerges at other important moments in the album. The lyrics are full of pride and a general feeling that Kendrick is shaming the FOX news reporters by claiming his heritage, claiming his history, and claiming his history. It feels like a challenge: his message is a bold, unapologetic \u201cFUCK YOU,\u201d and it\u2019s hyph as fuck.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cYAH.\u201d: Immediately, the rhythm slows down. Kendrick\u2019s voice becomes more mellow, mesmerizingly chanting that the radar is \u201cbuzzzzzzzin.\u201d The beat is also much more laid back. This is a track for bobbing your head; it\u2019s catchy as fuck, relaxing, and will definitely have a ton of mainstream appeal. The beat is also a bit more trappy. For only being 2:40 long, it\u2019s one of the more memorable tracks, purely because of how comfortable and blissful it leaves you feeling. This is also the first track on which he tackles identity in within a more pronounced spiritual context: now, he\u2019s \u201can Israelite, don\u2019t call me Black no mo\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting transitional piece, especially coming from the previous track on which he blisteringly raged against the FOX people and shouted from the rooftop his pride for his \u201cblackness.\u201d This track seems to prepare the listener for the upcoming musings on religious matters. It also leads you to wonder: to what extend does his \"blackness\" and his being an \"Israelite\" occupy the same socio-spiritual sphere of reality?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cElement.\u201d: The track feels a bit more minimalistic, especially in its beginning. It gives K-dot more space for his voice, and his lyrics come through quite strong. So, we\u2019re forced to look more closely at his lyrical content, and what is he saying? Well, he\u2019s blending some very different imagery. He\u2019s got some comedic imagery about slapping a \u201cpussy-ass nigga\u201d and making it \u201clook sexy,\u201d which gets repeated a couple times, and is modulated later in the track. At the same time, he talks about some deathly real shit, about how all his \u201cgrandmas dead / so ain\u2019t nobody prayin\u2019 for me,\u201d which is a somber reflection on a sort of isolation enclosing him. It\u2019s a nice track that seems to want to be both playful and somber.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cFeel.\u201d: This is where we realize the significance about his \u201cain\u2019t nobody prayin\u2019 for me\u201d line. It repeats as the chorus here. It seems important in the context of him as feeling very alone and separated from the divine intervention (prayer) that exists in others\u2019 lives.  His bars here are dense as fuck in their wordplay, and he hits them fast. It\u2019s an impressive display of worthsmithery. His bars are fast and furious, but the beat feels a bit more slow, like it might be holding him back a bit. However, near the end of the track, he changes the delivery: he goes EVEN faster, EVEN harder, saying, \u201cFUCK your feelings, I mean this for imposters,\u201d and then proceedings to pop off. His voice is raw and full of pathos, while he delivers poetically top-notch imagery like \u201cI can feel it, the phoenix is sure to watch us\u201d and \u201cI can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic.\u201d The track ends stirringly and packs an emotional wallop. Pure poetry.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cLoyalty.\u201d: Honestly, I wasn\u2019t really feeling this track. Rihanna wasn\u2019t super amazing and the auto-tuned dude wasn\u2019t that musical. Kendrick\u2019s bars felt a bit filler-y. The moment for me that saved this one was when he asks a series of provocative questions to the listener: \u201cTell me who you loyal to / Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink? / Is it comin\u2019 down with the loud pipes and the rain? ... Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark? Is it unconditional when the \u2018Rari don\u2019t start?\u201d This is a cool meditation on what/who we owe ourselves to, and the conditions that exist around that allegiance. In the last line, for example, when a gold digger\u2019s Ferarri doesn\u2019t start, is she still cool staying with her sugar daddy, despite being unable to take advantage of his material benefits? Aside from this, the track feels a little excessively poppy. While it\u2019s a standalone decent track, in an outstanding album, it didn\u2019t really stick in my memory.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cPride.\u201d: YES. This track was incredible. The beat was slow and had a sort of 80's synth feel to it, with Kenny\u2019s voice wafting in and out over the sweeping melody. His bars come in perfectly on-beat, and he manages to maintain one of the coolest, smoothest flows I\u2019ve ever heard him spit. Anna Wise\u2019s vocals are stunningly beautiful on this. The lyrical content seems to be a discourse on the relationship of a man and a woman. He criticizes his own actions in the relationships; he apologizes for his shortcomings. He also brings up the topic of humility, which is the next track\u2019s topic. The haunting chorus \u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t there\u201d is so absurdly melodic that it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m listening to hip-hop anymore. This is what high art sounds like. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cHumble.\u201d: Dope as shit, we\u2019ve all seen enough reviews of this track. The first couple of lines are changed on the album version to be \u201cNobody pray for me / It\u2019s been a day for me,\u201d which seems to fit cohesively into the earlier lines about no one praying for him. My opinion of this track is that it is very solid: it feels like it could be a subversive criticism of the sort of materialistic, hedonistic rap we see in mainstream hip-hop. \"Humble's\" placement after his worryings in \"Pride\" imply a sort of reversal of the penance he seems to be displaying in \"Pride\": he goes from questioning his worth as a partner into aggressive braggadocio. Indeed, the road of the wise man is plagued with many pitfalls. It could also just be Kung-Fu Kenny dropping a banger and having a blast. Regardless, the piano keys in smoothly, the bars are solid, though a little repetitive, and the music video has already been a massive success (I think the music video might be better than the actual song in terms of artistry, tbh). Definitely a solid track with lots of mainstream appeal.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHit the character limit, post continued in comments:", "edited": 1492236335.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I live in China, so the album dropped around lunchtime Friday here. I wanted to wait until the evening to listen to it, since my roommate was home during the day and I wanted no interruptions, plus the nighttime vibe gives me the same feel I\u2019d get if I were listening to it when it dropped on the west coast.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just finished lying on my bed, lights off, headphones on, having one of the fucking coolest musical experiences of my life. These are my immediate impressions of \u201cDAMN.\u201d I haven\u2019t read any other reviews yet, nor have I had much time to digest. These thoughts are the product of one listen, and I\u2019m 100% sure this is going to be on permanent rotation for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Impressions:&lt;/em&gt; There\u2019s a dramatic divergence in sound here. His sound has gone in a completely new direction. I love seeing an artist pushing his creative limits. Usually it doesn\u2019t come off as well as it came off in \u201cDAMN.\u201d but fuck me\u2014this feels like the creation of a new genre. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His vocals remain as sharp and powerful as ever, and his track list&amp;#39;s structure feels purposeful: he leads into tracks with coherence and talent. It feels so cohesive\u2014this is what happens when your other released albums have already demonstrated an ability to deliver cohesive content that remains intact despite spanning long, complex track listings. He blends his spirituality with a hip-hop ethos in the most compelling way I\u2019ve seen yet\u2014more compelling than hearing Chance or Kanye\u2019s treatment of their religiosity. He switches between contemplating philosophy to incisive anecdotes on a dime, which creates a cool-as-shit musical experience in which one track can be incredibly dense, laden with both recondite biblical scripture and down-to-earth, jamming melodies, to say nothing of the rich storytelling layered over thick, lyrically dense bars. &lt;em&gt;I feel like Kung Fu Kenny chops us up with a syllabic katana.&lt;/em&gt; He also sings more than I\u2019ve heard in his other work, and for a rapper, he has a pretty incredible range. He also drops some excellent point-of-view switch-ups that remind me of his older work. He remains a master craftsman of a poignant and vivid narrative that challenges the listener\u2019s assumption. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beats were incredibly varied. There is a lot to listen to here. I\u2019d go so far as to say it\u2019s his most accessible album: you\u2019ve got the rolling, epic beats that remind me of \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d whose melody can only be described as slowly overwhelming you before receding; there are some standard drum and bass setups with auto-tune that fit nicely into the pop audience\u2019s expectation of what modern \u201chip-hop\u201d (lol) sounds like, which is also interesting, because the more tame beats tend to have some of the more subversive lyrics/deliveries; and then there are also moments that hearken back to music\u2019s earlier ages, where there has been some fucking amazing sampling work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The album\u2019s overall cohesiveness is top notch. The audio levels sound correctly balanced, the mixing is smooth, and the general melodic structure exceeds expectations. There are hints of the upcoming tracks in the previous tracks through smart teasing of melodies and sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Track Breakdown:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBlood.\u201d: This intro track establishes the narrative that wraps around the album. It\u2019s a skit of Kenny walking over to help a blind woman, who ends up shooting him. The relentlessness of the drums and the haunting chorus of \u201cIt is wickedness or weakness? You decide, are we gonna live or die?\u201d strike a very ethereal note\u2014much like the \u201cparanormal vibe\u201d lyric he dropped on \u201cThe Heart Pt. 4.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty interesting way conceptually to begin an album and immediately hooked my attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDNA.\u201d: Immediately, the surreal, pulsating mood is shattered after listening to a brief clip of FOX news reporters misinterpreting \u201cAlright\u201d from TPAB. The mood in \u201cDNA\u201d is fast and furious, angry and fuming. It establishes a very aggressive attitude, which emerges at other important moments in the album. The lyrics are full of pride and a general feeling that Kendrick is shaming the FOX news reporters by claiming his heritage, claiming his history, and claiming his history. It feels like a challenge: his message is a bold, unapologetic \u201cFUCK YOU,\u201d and it\u2019s hyph as fuck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYAH.\u201d: Immediately, the rhythm slows down. Kendrick\u2019s voice becomes more mellow, mesmerizingly chanting that the radar is \u201cbuzzzzzzzin.\u201d The beat is also much more laid back. This is a track for bobbing your head; it\u2019s catchy as fuck, relaxing, and will definitely have a ton of mainstream appeal. The beat is also a bit more trappy. For only being 2:40 long, it\u2019s one of the more memorable tracks, purely because of how comfortable and blissful it leaves you feeling. This is also the first track on which he tackles identity in within a more pronounced spiritual context: now, he\u2019s \u201can Israelite, don\u2019t call me Black no mo\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting transitional piece, especially coming from the previous track on which he blisteringly raged against the FOX people and shouted from the rooftop his pride for his \u201cblackness.\u201d This track seems to prepare the listener for the upcoming musings on religious matters. It also leads you to wonder: to what extend does his &amp;quot;blackness&amp;quot; and his being an &amp;quot;Israelite&amp;quot; occupy the same socio-spiritual sphere of reality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cElement.\u201d: The track feels a bit more minimalistic, especially in its beginning. It gives K-dot more space for his voice, and his lyrics come through quite strong. So, we\u2019re forced to look more closely at his lyrical content, and what is he saying? Well, he\u2019s blending some very different imagery. He\u2019s got some comedic imagery about slapping a \u201cpussy-ass nigga\u201d and making it \u201clook sexy,\u201d which gets repeated a couple times, and is modulated later in the track. At the same time, he talks about some deathly real shit, about how all his \u201cgrandmas dead / so ain\u2019t nobody prayin\u2019 for me,\u201d which is a somber reflection on a sort of isolation enclosing him. It\u2019s a nice track that seems to want to be both playful and somber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFeel.\u201d: This is where we realize the significance about his \u201cain\u2019t nobody prayin\u2019 for me\u201d line. It repeats as the chorus here. It seems important in the context of him as feeling very alone and separated from the divine intervention (prayer) that exists in others\u2019 lives.  His bars here are dense as fuck in their wordplay, and he hits them fast. It\u2019s an impressive display of worthsmithery. His bars are fast and furious, but the beat feels a bit more slow, like it might be holding him back a bit. However, near the end of the track, he changes the delivery: he goes EVEN faster, EVEN harder, saying, \u201cFUCK your feelings, I mean this for imposters,\u201d and then proceedings to pop off. His voice is raw and full of pathos, while he delivers poetically top-notch imagery like \u201cI can feel it, the phoenix is sure to watch us\u201d and \u201cI can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic.\u201d The track ends stirringly and packs an emotional wallop. Pure poetry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLoyalty.\u201d: Honestly, I wasn\u2019t really feeling this track.

Love how Kendrick tells a story from three different moments in his life, where he experiences fear, with the fourth verse giving us his current anxieties and fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIDE is glorious, the fact Steve Lacy is 18(my age) and making beats of this calibre, on an iPhone might I add, has me wondering wtf I&amp;#39;m doing with my life ahahaha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUST is amazing, Kendricks singing is actually pretty good, and that Ratboy sample had me feeling some kinda way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those Kid Capri DJ tags are wonderfully placed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love may be my least favourite track, and even then I still enjoy it, Zacri has a great voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 Best tracks are probably:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUCKWORTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;XXX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to rank it with his other projects, it&amp;#39;d go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10/10= TPAB(Imma sidebar real quick and say, I actually listen to this on the regular, not just ranking it as his best bc of its message and shit, I just love me some Jazz rap)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-9.5/10= DAMN &amp;amp; GKMC(I may slightly prefer DAMN over GKMC since I&amp;#39;m not too keen on Poetic Justice)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-8.5/10= Section 80, OD &amp;amp; UU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, another great project by Ken-dog, Not many artists have such a consistently good solo discography, even Nas had dropped Nastradamus by this point in his career.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never wrote something like a review, I&amp;#39;m not a reviewer, so excuse the fact that this may seem like the ramblings of a mad man.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "name": "t1_dg9vwjy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239005.0, "created_utc": 1492210205.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 303}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh4c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fpbu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh4c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fpbu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9zftf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 91, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pbaylis", "parent_id": "t1_dg9yv8w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hiphopheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yea there definitely has but it's the mark of a great album.

Hesitant to rate it due to only being out for a day, but I&amp;#39;ve given it 4-5 listens and right now probably a strong 8 on the Fantano scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "name": "t1_dg9vhck", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492238437.0, "created_utc": 1492209637.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 60}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh4c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fpbu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9w3jf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 64, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Drippin7", "parent_id": "t3_65fpbu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hiphopheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "After listening to it five times through it's hard and a little overwhelming to put into words how it makes me feel.
