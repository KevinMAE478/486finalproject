Most reading this probably know little about him, which is why this discography guide was created. Z-Ro is one of the most talented rappers most people have never heard of. Often called &amp;quot;The Houston Nate Dogg&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Houston Tupac&amp;quot;, Z-Ro was born Joseph Wayne McVey IV in Houston&amp;#39;s\u00a0South Park\u00a0neighborhood on January 19, 1977. At age six his mother died, and he was shuttled from household to household in search of stability, eventually settling in the Ridgemont area, a middle-class suburb in\u00a0Missouri City in Southwest Houston.\u00a0When Z-Ro reached his late teens he was unemployed and resorted to drug dealing and hustling on the streets. According to Z-Ro, listening to the music of\u00a02Pac, Geto Boys, Street Military, K-Rino and Klondike Kat inspired him to work harder for his goal of leaving the streets. Z-Ro discovered his talent of\u00a0freestyle rappingand after going through a couple of recording studios to make a demo,\u00a0the CEO of a local label discovered and signed him. He released his first album independently in 1998 titled &amp;quot;Look What You Did To Me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z-Ro released his critically acclaimed Rap-a-Lot debut titled\u00a0The Life Of Joseph W. McVey\u00a0The record was a huge success and helped expand Z-Ro&amp;#39;s fan base beyond the South. In 2005, Z-Ro released\u00a0Let The Truth Be Told, which was well received. Z-Ro&amp;#39;s 2006 album\u00a0I&amp;#39;m Still Livin&amp;#39; was released while he was imprisoned for\u00a0drug possession to positive reviews. It was called &amp;quot;a great album... powerful&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;relentlessly bleak&amp;quot; by\u00a0The Village Voice and &amp;quot;one of the best rap albums to come out of Houston&amp;quot; by the\u00a0Houston Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z-Ro is a story of rags to riches, and wears his heart on his sleeve. He bleeds his soul into his music and gives a look into his life in all aspects from being a 52 Hoover Crip, to struggling with depression and addiction, to wanting to commit suicide as a homeless rapper with a record deal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This in depth guide to Z-Ro will show a personally made review of each of his official albums, some notable collaboration albums, his best 10 songs, and 10 most notable features. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Essential Z-Ro songs:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/3gN_UDm4zWo\"&gt;These Niggaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/2vqV-alkv0c\"&gt;Happy Alone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/H5srCqjVnw0\"&gt;Lonely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/MqEUeoXnG3M\"&gt;Too Many Niggaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/b2Nu8RVhpwY\"&gt;Can&amp;#39;t Leave Drank Alone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/qY0xcXGDiFE\"&gt;I Hate U Bitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/lLLjTZ2cikg\"&gt;Crooked Officer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/nuLpuRog8f8\"&gt;Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/nDvP6-YVHow\"&gt;Miss My Mama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/9iTDwqmvumI\"&gt;Mo City Don(Intro)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Essential Features :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Jin6_sDKHnI\"&gt;City Of Syrup - Big Moe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/iLwEoNlke1I\"&gt;Boxframe Caddilac- Freddie Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/iKCDrH1zz-8\"&gt;Get Throwed - Bun B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/wFScpn62rmQ\"&gt;Trill Niggas Don&amp;#39;t Die - UGK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/TRIdb6kfvd0\"&gt;Grindin&amp;#39; - Big Moe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/3itatBX3oV8\"&gt;II Trill - Bun B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/ST75z4s_R2Y\"&gt;It Can&amp;#39;t Rain Forever - Lil&amp;#39; O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/mJNA691ADkU\"&gt;Southside - Big Mello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/KpJ-UhaQes4\"&gt;On My Grind - Scarface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dtK8-94Pibw\"&gt;I Miss U - Pimp C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 Essential Z-Ro Albums :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.The Life Of Joseph W.

It may look daunting, but it&amp;#39;s very diverse and easy to find an album you love. It starts on his most popular and acclaimed album The Life Of Joseph W. McVey, and from there you can follow the chart based on what characteristics you like of each album. Below I am posting my personal review of each album you see on the chart. I also posted my personal rating, but don&amp;#39;t avoid an album just because of a lower rating. For example, I have Let The Truth Be Told rated on the bottom half of the list, but I am absolutely in the minority for not loving that album. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Life of Joseph W. McVey -2004&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : These Niggaz, Crooked Officer, I Hate U Bitch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : Most agree this is Z-Ro&amp;#39;s best project. Lyrically he is at his best, and has some great features, most notably from Scarface. You can see a very strong 2Pac influence throughout this album, and he even sounds like Pac on &amp;quot;These Niggaz&amp;quot;. This album has some of his greatest songs, is an absolute southern classic, and also in my top 10 favorite albums. Personal Rating 9/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crack - 2008*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Mo City Don, Lonely, 25 Lighters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summery : Absolutely in the running for Z-Ro&amp;#39;s best project. Great production, solid lyrics and outstanding hooks. Also worth noting that he uses a Pimp C sample on &amp;quot;Top Notch&amp;quot;, and expresses his gratitude to UGK on &amp;quot;25 Lighters&amp;quot;On certain days this is my favorite Ro project, and the best out of the &amp;quot;drug series&amp;quot; albums. Personal Rating 8.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drankin&amp;#39; and Drivin&amp;#39; - 2016. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Devil Ass City, My Money, Where The Real. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This project was released last year, and has outstanding production. So many great tracks, with phenomenal hooks from Ro. It could have easily been tied with his best projects, however there are some definite lows with Hostage being the lowest. Overall, this is one of my favorites, but I can&amp;#39;t rank it as highly as I&amp;#39;d like due to the fact that there are tracks I consistently skip. Personal Rating 8/10 This album was rated 7.2 by Pitchfork&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z-Ro - 2002 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Mirror Mirror On The Wall, Still In The Hood, Hard Times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album is very consistent both production wise and lyrically. Z-Ro has top notch hooks, verses, and features. There&amp;#39;s only one low point which is &amp;quot;All Night Long&amp;quot;, and even that track isn&amp;#39;t bad. Overall a very high quality ZRo project and a must listen for Ro fans. Personal Rating 8/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Screwed Up Click Representa - 2002 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Plex, Freestyle, Final Curtain Call. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album is excellent throughout. If you&amp;#39;re a fan of 2Pac, you will most likely enjoy this project, because if Pac rapped most of the verses on this album, it would fit right in with his expressions and subject matter. Z-Ro is always open in his raps, but in this album he takes it further. At this point in his career you could feel the depression he was going through with songs like &amp;quot;Maintain&amp;quot;. This albumm also has a strong Screwed Up Click presence wjth features from H.A.W.K, Lil Keke, and Lil O. Personal rating 7.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Melting the Crown - 2015 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Intro, Keep It Real, Way 2 Fly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : One of his lessern known projects, but still very good. Intro is one of his best intro tracks, and he has a great Rick Ross feature on Keep It Real. Z-Ro also gives a very personal look on the death of his mother on Miss My Mama. The only flaw is that the album is some of the ending tracks being sub par, specifically Porcupine. Personal Rating 7.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m Still Livin - 2006&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Man Cry, Life Ain&amp;#39;t Live, No More Pain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : Z-Ro had a clear message with this album. He is clearly upset at state of gangbanging, and the damage it causes, even though he knows he&amp;#39;s a part of it. He turns to God for answers on T.H.U.G. and that may be his only song without curse words in it. He gives his take on the classic Scarface song &amp;quot;I Seen A Man Die&amp;quot; as well. The production is unique for him in that it relies on string instruments such as guitar and violin, but it&amp;#39;s executed very well. Personal Score 7.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solid - 2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Legendary, Thru The Roof, Comin Dine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This is a solid project. Only 7 tracks makes it a very easy listen with no filler. His singing on songs like Legendary is top notch, and show why he&amp;#39;s referred to as &amp;quot;The Houston Nate Dogg&amp;quot;. A short but sweet Ro project that gives you a taste for his style across the board. Personal Rating 7/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angel Dust - 2012 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Never Been, Truth Is, Phuc With Me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album is definitely heavy on singing. It has a very good start, up until the song Dicc In You, which is the low point and might just be Z-Ros worst song. Z-Ro has an obvious message in this album and that message is on the state of the prison system, and how it does more harm than good. It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that &amp;quot;Truth Is&amp;quot; is one of the most open rap songs you&amp;#39;ll hear. He touches on a lot of personal issues (which isn&amp;#39;t new to Z-Ro), but a painfully honest way. Personal Score 7/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life - 2002 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Screw Did That, Life, Hatin&amp;#39; Me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : Life has some very unique production for Z-Ro. The album is entirely self produced, and relies heavily on live instruments. The subject matter is fairly standard, but the way he presents it is definitely new. He also takes an aggressive tone to call out people disrespecting DJ Screws legacy in the standout track &amp;quot;Screw Did That&amp;quot;. Personal Score : 7/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Crown - 2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Mo City, Hands Up, Imposters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : A consistent project. Less highs than some of his other projects, but also less lows. A smooth listen through. He uses nice Pimp C sampling on P.A.N. Personal Rating 6.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;King of Da Ghetto - 2001 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Pain, Block Bleeder, Grippin Grain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album is very consistent front to back. It starts out being hyper aggressive, but ends on a very sad note. There are many features on this album, with only 4 solo songs, but all the features are quality additions to the project. Z-Ro shows a very heavy Pac influence with his voice and subject matter, but attacks songs with very fast flows. The biggest negative is that the production isn&amp;#39;t up to par with his other projects, which ultimately holds the album back. Personal Score 6.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heroin - 2010. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Do Bad On My Own, Blast Myself, Rollin Swangaz. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album starts out weaker, but steadily gets better as it goes on. Production from Mike Dean and Z-Ro make a good combination of beats throughout the album. While making this album Ro was in the middle of a trial for drug charges, and the stress of the possibility of going back to the pen shows in his music. He talks about depression and contemplating suicide on &amp;quot;Blast Myself&amp;quot;, which pays homage to the opening lines of 2Pac&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Changes&amp;quot;. This album also has a very Jamaican inspired song (which is nothing new for Z-Ro) called &amp;quot;Move Ya Body&amp;quot;. Personal Rating 6.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z-Ro vs. The World - 2000&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Dirty 3rd, 3rd Coast, Gonna Get Easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album shows a heavy Pac influence, which is no surprise considering it came out around the same time as his other albums with Pac influence on them. Z-Ro was still using rapid fire rapping on this album, and it made a unique sound. If you ever wondered what a cross between Bone Thugs and Pac would sound like, this album is the answer. On another note Ro was at a low point in life and was struggling with homelessness, suicidal thoughts, and depression: all of those issues are addressed in &amp;quot;Gonna Get Easier&amp;quot;. Personal Score 6/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meth - 2011&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : HTown Kinda Day, Happy Alone, No Reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album has a bit more filler in it than most Ro projects. It starts with a few weaker tracks like Pigs Feet, but gets much better towards the end. Happy Alone is absolutely one of Z-Ros best songs. He also has No Reason which is one of his most aggressive songs to date. Personal Rating 6/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let The Truth Be Told - 2005 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Don&amp;#39;t Wanna Hurt Nobody, Mo City Don (Freestyle edition), I&amp;#39;m A Solider. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : Some Ro fans will hate me for ranking this so low. Don&amp;#39;t let it&amp;#39;s position on the list keep you from listening, it&amp;#39;s definitely a top 5 Ro project for a lot of fans. I just cant get into this project. The production is very unique on this one, and that can be good or bad depending on taste. Personal Rating 6/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cocaine - 2009 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Can&amp;#39;t Leave Drank Alone, Quarterback Vision, On My Grind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album is similar to Meth in that it has a bit of filler holding it down. No big lows, but not many standouts. However, Can&amp;#39;t Leave Drank Alone is easily a top 5 ZRo song in my eyes. Not a bad project whatsoever, just not outstanding either. Personal Rating 5.5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look What You Did To Me - 1998&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : ZRo The Crooked, Pimp On, And 2 My G&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This is where the southern rap legend got his start. This album shows very heavy Bone Thugs influence. If you like Bone Thugs you will enjoy this album for sure. It didn&amp;#39;t really do it for me personally, but it&amp;#39;s still a good debut nonetheless. Personal Rating 5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;King Of Tha Ghetto: Power - 2013&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Greed, My Life, Ride All day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album was almost entirely produced by Z-Ro himself. It has a heavy 2Pac influence on it, which can be found in his subject matter, and inflections on his voice. He provides listeners with a rare story telling track in the song Greed as well. Overall this album doesn&amp;#39;t have as many high notes as others, and it seems to be a bit unpolished and rushed out. Personal Rating 5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z-Ro Tolerance - 2003&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standout Tracks : Real Niggas, Who Could It Be, Move Around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary : This album almost feels like a sequel to &amp;quot;Look What You Did To Me&amp;quot;, so if you enjoy that album, you should enjoy this one as well. Rapper Daz is featured on most of the songs, so you wknt get much solo Ro on this one. Theres still a heavy Bone Thugs influence, though not as much as his debut album. Personal Rating 5/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this guide will be helpful to those wanting to get into this Houston legend. Feel free to ask me anything about this post or Z-Ro in general.

Overall a very high quality ZRo project and a must listen for Ro fans. Personal Rating 8/10\n\nScrewed Up Click Representa - 2002 \n\nStandout Tracks : Plex, Freestyle, Final Curtain Call. \n\nSummary : This album is excellent throughout. If you're a fan of 2Pac, you will most likely enjoy this project, because if Pac rapped most of the verses on this album, it would fit right in with his expressions and subject matter. Z-Ro is always open in his raps, but in this album he takes it further. At this point in his career you could feel the depression he was going through with songs like \"Maintain\". This albumm also has a strong Screwed Up Click presence wjth features from H.A.W.K, Lil Keke, and Lil O. Personal rating 7.5/10\n\nMelting the Crown - 2015 \n\nStandout Tracks : Intro, Keep It Real, Way 2 Fly. \n\nSummary : One of his lessern known projects, but still very good. Intro is one of his best intro tracks, and he has a great Rick Ross feature on Keep It Real. Z-Ro also gives a very personal look on the death of his mother on Miss My Mama. The only flaw is that the album is some of the ending tracks being sub par, specifically Porcupine. Personal Rating 7.5/10\n\nI'm Still Livin - 2006\n\nStandout Tracks : Man Cry, Life Ain't Live, No More Pain. \n\nSummary : Z-Ro had a clear message with this album. He is clearly upset at state of gangbanging, and the damage it causes, even though he knows he's a part of it. He turns to God for answers on T.H.U.G. and that may be his only song without curse words in it. He gives his take on the classic Scarface song \"I Seen A Man Die\" as well. The production is unique for him in that it relies on string instruments such as guitar and violin, but it's executed very well. Personal Score 7.5/10\n\nSolid - 2014\n\nStandout Tracks : Legendary, Thru The Roof, Comin Dine. \n\nSummary : This is a solid project. Only 7 tracks makes it a very easy listen with no filler. His singing on songs like Legendary is top notch, and show why he's referred to as \"The Houston Nate Dogg\". A short but sweet Ro project that gives you a taste for his style across the board. Personal Rating 7/10\n\nAngel Dust - 2012 \n\nStandout Tracks : Never Been, Truth Is, Phuc With Me. \n\nSummary : This album is definitely heavy on singing. It has a very good start, up until the song Dicc In You, which is the low point and might just be Z-Ros worst song. Z-Ro has an obvious message in this album and that message is on the state of the prison system, and how it does more harm than good. It's also worth noting that \"Truth Is\" is one of the most open rap songs you'll hear. He touches on a lot of personal issues (which isn't new to Z-Ro), but a painfully honest way. Personal Score 7/10\n\nLife - 2002 \n\nStandout Tracks : Screw Did That, Life, Hatin' Me.\n\nSummary : Life has some very unique production for Z-Ro. The album is entirely self produced, and relies heavily on live instruments. The subject matter is fairly standard, but the way he presents it is definitely new. He also takes an aggressive tone to call out people disrespecting DJ Screws legacy in the standout track \"Screw Did That\". Personal Score : 7/10\n\nThe Crown - 2014\n\nStandout Tracks : Mo City, Hands Up, Imposters. \n\nSummary : A consistent project. Less highs than some of his other projects, but also less lows. A smooth listen through. He uses nice Pimp C sampling on P.A.N. Personal Rating 6.5/10\n\nKing of Da Ghetto - 2001 \n\nStandout Tracks : Pain, Block Bleeder, Grippin Grain. \n\nSummary : This album is very consistent front to back. It starts out being hyper aggressive, but ends on a very sad note. There are many features on this album, with only 4 solo songs, but all the features are quality additions to the project. Z-Ro shows a very heavy Pac influence with his voice and subject matter, but attacks songs with very fast flows. The biggest negative is that the production isn't up to par with his other projects, which ultimately holds the album back. Personal Score 6.5/10\n\nHeroin - 2010. \n\nStandout Tracks : Do Bad On My Own, Blast Myself, Rollin Swangaz. \n\nSummary : This album starts out weaker, but steadily gets better as it goes on. Production from Mike Dean and Z-Ro make a good combination of beats throughout the album. While making this album Ro was in the middle of a trial for drug charges, and the stress of the possibility of going back to the pen shows in his music. He talks about depression and contemplating suicide on \"Blast Myself\", which pays homage to the opening lines of 2Pac's \"Changes\". This album also has a very Jamaican inspired song (which is nothing new for Z-Ro) called \"Move Ya Body\". Personal Rating 6.5/10\n\nZ-Ro vs. The World - 2000\n\nStandout Tracks : Dirty 3rd, 3rd Coast, Gonna Get Easier. \n\nSummary : This album shows a heavy Pac influence, which is no surprise considering it came out around the same time as his other albums with Pac influence on them. Z-Ro was still using rapid fire rapping on this album, and it made a unique sound. If you ever wondered what a cross between Bone Thugs and Pac would sound like, this album is the answer. On another note Ro was at a low point in life and was struggling with homelessness, suicidal thoughts, and depression: all of those issues are addressed in \"Gonna Get Easier\". Personal Score 6/10\n\nMeth - 2011\n\nStandout Tracks : HTown Kinda Day, Happy Alone, No Reason. \n\nSummary : This album has a bit more filler in it than most Ro projects. It starts with a few weaker tracks like Pigs Feet, but gets much better towards the end. Happy Alone is absolutely one of Z-Ros best songs. He also has No Reason which is one of his most aggressive songs to date. Personal Rating 6/10\n\nLet The Truth Be Told - 2005 \n\nStandout Tracks : Don't Wanna Hurt Nobody, Mo City Don (Freestyle edition), I'm A Solider. \n\nSummary : Some Ro fans will hate me for ranking this so low. Don't let it's position on the list keep you from listening, it's definitely a top 5 Ro project for a lot of fans. I just cant get into this project. The production is very unique on this one, and that can be good or bad depending on taste. Personal Rating 6/10\n\nCocaine - 2009 \n\nStandout Tracks : Can't Leave Drank Alone, Quarterback Vision, On My Grind. \n\nSummary : This album is similar to Meth in that it has a bit of filler holding it down. No big lows, but not many standouts. However, Can't Leave Drank Alone is easily a top 5 ZRo song in my eyes. Not a bad project whatsoever, just not outstanding either. Personal Rating 5.5/10\n\nLook What You Did To Me - 1998\n\nStandout Tracks : ZRo The Crooked, Pimp On, And 2 My G's. \n\nSummary : This is where the southern rap legend got his start. This album shows very heavy Bone Thugs influence. If you like Bone Thugs you will enjoy this album for sure. It didn't really do it for me personally, but it's still a good debut nonetheless. Personal Rating 5/10\n\nKing Of Tha Ghetto: Power - 2013\n\nStandout Tracks : Greed, My Life, Ride All day. \n\nSummary : This album was almost entirely produced by Z-Ro himself. It has a heavy 2Pac influence on it, which can be found in his subject matter, and inflections on his voice. He provides listeners with a rare story telling track in the song Greed as well. Overall this album doesn't have as many high notes as others, and it seems to be a bit unpolished and rushed out. Personal Rating 5/10\n\nZ-Ro Tolerance - 2003\n\nStandout Tracks : Real Niggas, Who Could It Be, Move Around. \n\nSummary : This album almost feels like a sequel to \"Look What You Did To Me\", so if you enjoy that album, you should enjoy this one as well. Rapper Daz is featured on most of the songs, so you wknt get much solo Ro on this one. Theres still a heavy Bone Thugs influence, though not as much as his debut album. Personal Rating 5/10\n\nHopefully this guide will be helpful to those wanting to get into this Houston legend. Feel free to ask me anything about this post or Z-Ro in general.
