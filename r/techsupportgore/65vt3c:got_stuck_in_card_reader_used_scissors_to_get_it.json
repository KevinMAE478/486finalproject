You probably know that computers \"think\" in binary, and that that's important. Well, not really, it isn't, it's just numbers. 10 binary digits(11,1111,1111) can store 1024 different numbers, which is roughly close to what 3 base-10 digits can(999, or 1000 unique numbers including 0). \n\nNow, data storage is all about encoding information as numbers in various ways(some are straightforward, others utilize statistics and math to compress it). Say, if you had 95 different characters, letters and numbers and a bunch of other symbols, you could represent one of them using two digits, 00 to 94, leaving 95-99 free. \n\nText is a very simple case, though, and takes very little place. Much more storage is consumed by multimedia, pictures and movies. But in reality, images aren't made of small building blocks like text is made of letters, which is why images(and video, which can be described as series of images) must first be digitized into pixels - think taking the view of the horizon and representing it on a grid of 10x5 pixels, bottom three rows green for grass and upper two blue for sky. Very abstract, but up that to 100x50 pixels and you'll be able to tell what it is, go to 1000x500, and there'll even be some detail. Either way, each of these pixels has a specific color, and while there might be infinite colors in nature, computers don't need that much. And if we have a finite amount of colors, we can give each of them a number. The actual way it's often stored is three numbers for red, green, blue, from 0 to 255, which corresponds to 8 bits(or 1 byte) exactly, so 3 bytes per pixel. Of course, images and especially videos use complex algorithms to store that information in much less space than 3 bytes per pixel - often by cutting out parts that don't matter to the human eye, like precise detail during fast motion, or tiny differences between 255-white and 254-white, but anyway that's the gist of it.\n\nAs for how it's stored physically... I'm afraid I'm not knowledgeable enough to do an ELI5 on that, and it really depends on the medium too - but basically, it's just a way to write and read those numbers(bits and bytes) to and from a medium.
