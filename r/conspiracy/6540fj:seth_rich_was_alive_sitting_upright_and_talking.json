Under the agreement, Hastert pleaded guilty to the &amp;quot;structuring&amp;quot; charge (a felony), and the charge of making false statements was dropped.[17] In court submissions on sentencing considerations filed in April 2016, federal prosecutors made allegations of sexual misconduct against Hastert, saying that he had molested at least four boys as young as 14 while he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades earlier.[18] At the sentencing hearing later that month, Hastert admitted that he had sexually abused boys whom he coached.[19] The judge in the case referred to Hastert as a &amp;quot;serial child molester&amp;quot; and imposed a sentence of fifteen months in prison, two years&amp;#39; supervised release, and a $250,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg7wcnq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492133492.0, "created_utc": 1492104692.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7r0sw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Prgjdsaewweoidsm", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nxj8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;
