G Suite management allows the district to push settings and extensions to their domain users that are then applied to Chromebooks and also Chrome browser (since they&amp;#39;re basically the same thing). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the system can&amp;#39;t differentiate between a school computer and a home one. So if your kiddo logged into Chrome browser on the home PC, the District settings will get applied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as your kiddo doesn&amp;#39;t log into the Chrome browser (upper right side of the screen) and just logs into the web page, for say Gmail, then they shouldn&amp;#39;t get the management settings applied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or like someone else said - just have kiddo use Firefox. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS I promise you the IT Department doesn&amp;#39;t want to snoop on your kids at home. There have been several high profile cases where districts got sued and everyone in K-12 knows not to be the next one. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg90hzx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492197102.0, "created_utc": 1492168302.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a3u1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8wmy5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShepDoggg", "parent_id": "t1_dg8qjze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yea check IP communications and report back if they are sending out private info collected from non-school network use.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yea check IP communications and report back if they are sending out private info collected from non-school network use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg8wmy5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492184874.0, "created_utc": 1492156074.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8qjze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 55, "report_reasons": null, "author": "omnicidial", "parent_id": "t1_dg8qaeb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This happens, verified, on ANY computer they log into with chrome immediately upon them logging in it installs new browser extensions and a blocklist.\n\nOnce I can prove without a doubt they're phoning home, I'll say they are for sure.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens, verified, on ANY computer they log into with chrome immediately upon them logging in it installs new browser extensions and a blocklist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I can prove without a doubt they&amp;#39;re phoning home, I&amp;#39;ll say they are for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg8qjze", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492171665.0, "created_utc": 1492142865.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 55}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65a3u1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8sgx7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "alreadyburnt", "parent_id": "t1_dg8qaeb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you ever happen to buy an old Chromebook from an educational or Corporate deployment, YSK about the John Lewis Chromebook Coreboot ROM's.

So if you sign into a Google account using Chrome on a school computer, the settings on that computer can be applied to your Google account. Then, when you sign into your home PC using the same account, your Chrome Browser will use those settings too.
