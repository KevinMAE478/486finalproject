That means Fox5 does not have reporters on the ground in New York and are instead relying on affiliates and wire reports for updates. \n\nKeep in mind, they are also dealing with the attack on the Pentagon as well. \n\nSecond, in a scenario like this when there is widespread destruction and an unknown number of deaths A WHOLE LOT of inaccurate details emerge in the first minutes and hours because people are listening to scanner traffic or hearing parts of a radio call or conversation. \n\nIt is literally the most nightmarish game of telephone you could ever imagine times 10,000. You are seeing things you don't want to see and hearing things you can never prepare for -- and then you have to relay that information. \n\nIt gets jumbled. It's just human nature because it's really fucking hard to detach your mind from your emotions and do your job. \n\nAdd to that the game of telephone happening between newsrooms and this gets out of control in a hurry. Here's a likely scenario that I've experienced, just changed to the details of 9/11: \n\nA reporter is sticking close to a first responder s/he knows and can use as a source to help coordinate coverage and hears something about a building coming down. S/he asks what that's about and the first responder relays the message -- a CONCERN that one of the other nearby buildings was damaged and could come down or needed to be brought down for safety. \n\nThe reporter sends that info to the newsroom, likely the assignment desk team, who relays it to the producers and APs putting together wall to wall coverage. Keep in mind most stations, especially in DC and NYC were running nonstop updates and searching for anything new to report for days. \n\nAn AP or producer writes an update (sources near the scene are concerned more buildings may come down) and relays that to the producer in the booth. Chances are this is just bullet points for the anchors to talk through as they free associate on the live pictures. \n\nThe producer in the booth then gets in the anchors' ears and says there's an update from sources, it's going in after a certain script number, and just work from the bullet points in the prompter. \n\nMeanwhile, DC is calling to see if NYC has anything new and someone on the assignment desk or working in the newsroom who didn't pay attention relays another building is collapsing. \n\nThat passes quickly through the DC newsroom and makes in on air. The anchors there are talking about it having already collapsed and see it possibly happen on tv -- chances are they don't really know if they've seen WTC7 fall or a fourth building fall. \n\nNow, in retrospect, the info on the ground was solid. The source was right. And the building did fall. But the way it gets shared from one person to the next ended up screwing up the actual reporting in that moment. \n\nAnd then it's blown out of proportion by people who don't understand news.
