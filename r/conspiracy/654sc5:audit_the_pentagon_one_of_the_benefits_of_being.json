Thanks for your politeness.\n\nMinarchism is the belief that for all its ills, some sort of state is necessary to maximize liberty. Its primarily focused on Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand. I myself am more of a Nozick fan than a rand fan, but I digress. Most minarchists would agree with Nozick's points in his book [i] Anarchy the State, and Utopia [/i} that even should an anarchism come about, a state would come back, through necessity, and natural processes anyways. There is no way to have a true anarchism, and even if there would, it would be undesirable because of the lack of enforcement on the non-aggression principle, which is why I support the state-in a limited form. Instead of advocating for no state like anarchists, minarchists instead advocate for what is commonly called a 'night watchman state' or a state that we reduce to the size that maximizes liberty. The general consensus is the smaller the better. I would argue that taxes are necessary for such a night watchman state. Voluntary donations would be disastrous and counter productive. Thus taxation is needed, regardless of its undesirably icky moral foundation. Its simply the lesser of  two evils\n\nAs tot he free market having 'failed', im really not sure what you refer to. I agree that free markets can 'fail' in the sense of the rule of law, which is why I support a night-watchman state, but I doubt we mean the same. I would think ( If I may be so bold) That most of the 'failings' you refer to are not really instances of the free market per se, but rather government interventions under a free market, like in the Reagan era or Thatcher era. These neoliberal economists aren't really free marketeers in the pure sense ( Although I suppose the argument can be made for the chicagoians being free marketeers ( Chicagoites? Chicagese?))\n\nI then notice you mention that education and health care are 'rights'. Forgive me if I use tired old arguments here, but why are they rights? Were they always rights? If not when did they become rights, and did medieval peasants and cavemen under a chief have those rights? Because if not, it stands to reason that 'rights' can be added to- and, then unfortunately, it then stands to reason that they can be taken away. Not only that, but these 'positive rights' (As I believe they are called)  leads to numerous other problems as well, philosophically, practically, and morally. If you have a right to an education, do you have the right to demand education from the state? From any teacher that you like? What if he/she refuses? Should he be coerced into teaching you as part of your 'right'? The same with doctors, as it relates to healthcare. Does your right for healthcare trump the doctors rights to  pursuit of happiness, his property rights, his ethical, religious, moral,his you-name-it rights? This in essence is the problem with positive rights, those rights which require somebody to give you something else. They always infringe on somebody else's liberty. This is absolutely antithetical to the libertarian position and the holy grail of libertarianism, the non aggression principle.\n\nI agree, hesitantly, on the idea that if we can lift others up, we should. Obviously you aren't writing a philosophy book or a manifesto here, but the absolute poses problems. Should you, in every circumstance, help others? What if it hurts other people? Is it ok to 'help' 5 people but in the process hurt 4? What if they don't want the help? Is it ok to force others to help other people? \n\nLastly, you paving analogy is flawed in several regards. Firstly is your idea that everyone would just pave in fort of their own house. While I am not a proponent of privatizing the road system, I don't believe it would turn out that way whatsoever. People organize themselves far better than any top authority can organize them. This is core theme of Hayek's writings and of the famous I, Pencil essay by Leonard Read. Inf act people tend to do specifically what you are advocating for, pool their resources on their own, voluntarily, to achieve something that they all benefit from. Secondly, government funded programs are not cheaper. When its not your money, you don't care how much it costs. You don't have competition. You don't have incentives. You just buy and buy and spend and spend. Thirdly and finally you say everyone will 'chip in'. But taxation isn't 'chipping in'. If it was, then it would be voluntary. But it simply isn't. You're forced to pay it. If you don't eventually, a government agent will come for you and if you resist that you will get shot. That isn't voluntary.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, and for the typos.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I&amp;#39;ll start here. Thanks for your politeness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minarchism is the belief that for all its ills, some sort of state is necessary to maximize liberty. Its primarily focused on Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand. I myself am more of a Nozick fan than a rand fan, but I digress. Most minarchists would agree with Nozick&amp;#39;s points in his book [i] Anarchy the State, and Utopia [/i} that even should an anarchism come about, a state would come back, through necessity, and natural processes anyways. There is no way to have a true anarchism, and even if there would, it would be undesirable because of the lack of enforcement on the non-aggression principle, which is why I support the state-in a limited form. Instead of advocating for no state like anarchists, minarchists instead advocate for what is commonly called a &amp;#39;night watchman state&amp;#39; or a state that we reduce to the size that maximizes liberty. The general consensus is the smaller the better. I would argue that taxes are necessary for such a night watchman state. Voluntary donations would be disastrous and counter productive. Thus taxation is needed, regardless of its undesirably icky moral foundation. Its simply the lesser of  two evils&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As tot he free market having &amp;#39;failed&amp;#39;, im really not sure what you refer to. I agree that free markets can &amp;#39;fail&amp;#39; in the sense of the rule of law, which is why I support a night-watchman state, but I doubt we mean the same. I would think ( If I may be so bold) That most of the &amp;#39;failings&amp;#39; you refer to are not really instances of the free market per se, but rather government interventions under a free market, like in the Reagan era or Thatcher era. These neoliberal economists aren&amp;#39;t really free marketeers in the pure sense ( Although I suppose the argument can be made for the chicagoians being free marketeers ( Chicagoites? Chicagese?))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then notice you mention that education and health care are &amp;#39;rights&amp;#39;. Forgive me if I use tired old arguments here, but why are they rights? Were they always rights? If not when did they become rights, and did medieval peasants and cavemen under a chief have those rights? Because if not, it stands to reason that &amp;#39;rights&amp;#39; can be added to- and, then unfortunately, it then stands to reason that they can be taken away. Not only that, but these &amp;#39;positive rights&amp;#39; (As I believe they are called)  leads to numerous other problems as well, philosophically, practically, and morally. If you have a right to an education, do you have the right to demand education from the state? From any teacher that you like? What if he/she refuses? Should he be coerced into teaching you as part of your &amp;#39;right&amp;#39;? The same with doctors, as it relates to healthcare. Does your right for healthcare trump the doctors rights to  pursuit of happiness, his property rights, his ethical, religious, moral,his you-name-it rights? This in essence is the problem with positive rights, those rights which require somebody to give you something else. They always infringe on somebody else&amp;#39;s liberty. This is absolutely antithetical to the libertarian position and the holy grail of libertarianism, the non aggression principle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree, hesitantly, on the idea that if we can lift others up, we should. Obviously you aren&amp;#39;t writing a philosophy book or a manifesto here, but the absolute poses problems. Should you, in every circumstance, help others? What if it hurts other people? Is it ok to &amp;#39;help&amp;#39; 5 people but in the process hurt 4? What if they don&amp;#39;t want the help? Is it ok to force others to help other people? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you paving analogy is flawed in several regards. Firstly is your idea that everyone would just pave in fort of their own house. While I am not a proponent of privatizing the road system, I don&amp;#39;t believe it would turn out that way whatsoever. People organize themselves far better than any top authority can organize them. This is core theme of Hayek&amp;#39;s writings and of the famous I, Pencil essay by Leonard Read. Inf act people tend to do specifically what you are advocating for, pool their resources on their own, voluntarily, to achieve something that they all benefit from. Secondly, government funded programs are not cheaper. When its not your money, you don&amp;#39;t care how much it costs. You don&amp;#39;t have competition. You don&amp;#39;t have incentives. You just buy and buy and spend and spend. Thirdly and finally you say everyone will &amp;#39;chip in&amp;#39;. But taxation isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;chipping in&amp;#39;. If it was, then it would be voluntary. But it simply isn&amp;#39;t. You&amp;#39;re forced to pay it. If you don&amp;#39;t eventually, a government agent will come for you and if you resist that you will get shot.
