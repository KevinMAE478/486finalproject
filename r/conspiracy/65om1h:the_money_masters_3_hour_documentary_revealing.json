Thus they must be experts in fraud detection, and likewise you can't just 'remove' bankers. Now Fractional Reserve is evaluating what WILL be. So where as a gold rock is worth $100, if made into rings they would be worth $1,000 (say). Without fractional reserve you can only get a loan of $100 vs $1,000.

This has been critical in international and secret society trade. The Knights Hospilar were all about lock box finance. Today this is best represented by Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he mentions with Tally sticks, the critical component of money is &amp;#39;can it be counterfeit&amp;#39;. Dollars today, for example, will be quickly removed as printers &amp;amp; copiers increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding &amp;#39;how much money&amp;#39;, it essentially just GDP. As production &amp;amp; population increase, you increase the money supply. This is roughly 5% a year on average, or maybe 10% during an enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On &amp;#39;fractional reserves&amp;#39;, they are not &amp;#39;necessarily&amp;#39; evil. The question is always about how &amp;amp; who evaluates. However, fractional reserves essentially amplifies corruption potential &amp;amp; reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let me explain a bit of banking. One job of the banker is to evaluate the worth of objects. Thus they must be experts in fraud detection, and likewise you can&amp;#39;t just &amp;#39;remove&amp;#39; bankers. Now Fractional Reserve is evaluating what WILL be. So where as a gold rock is worth $100, if made into rings they would be worth $1,000 (say). Without fractional reserve you can only get a loan of $100 vs $1,000. Thus, without corruption, it does actually stimulate the economy.
