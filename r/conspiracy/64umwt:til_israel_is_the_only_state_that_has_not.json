As far as the shifting numbers of Auschwitz, I can tell you that I remember learning about 4 million being killed there, that's what I was taught in school. I couldn't quite tell you what books I'd read, but I remember it distinctly. But you don't have to take my word for it, there's pictures:\n\nhttps://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/auschwitz_b4nafter_1989.jpg\n\nThat show that until '98, there was a plaque there that claimed 4 million victims, and the current plaque that is there to this day claims 1.5 in total (mainly jews). If you go to wikipedia, it has an article about the changing number and today it's supposedly ~1.1 million although other non-nazi sources claim as low as 500 thousand.\n\nSo I wondered if that photo of the first plaque was doctored, and unfortunately I couldn't find any evidence that it *was* doctored, there was no one that debunks that claim. In fact, it's directly admitted that the plaques changed in this jewish source:\n\nhttp://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/holocaust-denial/\n\n&gt;Another argument stems from the change to a commemorative plaque at Auschwitz. Until 1994, the plaque read \u201cFour million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.\u201d In 1991, that plaque was replaced with a new one that listed only one and a half million victims, \u201ca majority of them Jews.\u201d\n\nThat article goes on to address counter-arguments that I find extremely weak strawman-arguments, but I'm not trying to push propaganda so I'd suggest you read their counterarguments and come to your own conclusions about them.\n\nWhat I would recommend is this video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-rhGMCYWqKI\n\nI was convinced the holocaust was a hoax prior to that video coming out, but it's the easiest to digest semi-comprehensive holocaust debunking video I've seen. Fair warning- it's an extreme religious nut. But he's not a nazi or white supremacist or a racist at all. And if you independently verify the claims made in this video, I'm sure you'll find they stand up to investigation.\n\nSo technically, a holocaust doubter is someone who argues 1 of 3 main claims: that 6 million jews were killed, that gas chambers were used, and that it was an intentional extermination/genocide. A denier argues all 3. I do believe all 3 to be false. I don't believe that the Nazis were the heroes of ww2 or that they were innocent. I do believe what was done to Jews was atrocious and that many of them died- even that many of them died at concentration camps. I don't think it's as black or white as either side often tries to paint it. \n\nBut on the grounds that I doubt all the details of the official story, I'm a holocaust denier because that term is propaganda in and of itself.

The reason we know about concentration camps having theater plays, musical bands, etc. is *because* of survivors.\n\nBut now lets get into the murky waters where most people will get triggered. \n\nFirst we have to define \"holocaust survivor\" and when we do, we'll find something interesting. There are different organizations that use the term holocaust survivor, but in all of them there is a running theme. According to the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum:\n\n&gt;The Museum honors as survivors any persons, Jewish or non-Jewish, who were displaced, persecuted, or discriminated against due to the racial, religious, ethnic, social, and political policies of the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945. In addition to former inmates of concentration camps, ghettos, and prisons, this definition includes, among others, people who were refugees or were in hiding.\n\nSeems reasonable, but that last part is where things get murky. Technically a \"holocaust survivor\" needn't be someone who was ever even at a concentration camp. That means a Jewish person who left Europe for America in 1940 is technically a holocaust survivor. Even if they never came in contact with the Nazi regime. And that's not me saying that, that's groups that keep track of holocaust survivors who count this.\n\nWhy that matters: Holocaust survivors get reparation money. Even those people who fall into the category I mentioned. People who never set foot in a concentration camp get paid reparations. I'm not suggesting they weren't in any way affected, but I am suggesting that a great deal of \"holocaust survivors\" don't actually have a first hand account of what went on in the camps. What they *do* have is financial incentive to tell their story, and in many cases that story is as simple as they left their home. Maybe they were in hiding, maybe they had to flee in the dark of the night. I'm not saying this isn't tragic, but I am saying that the \"countless testimonies\" that we're told about often do absolutely nothing to suggest that there was mass extermination going on within the camps. They simply portray people who were forced into refuge- tragic, but not supporting the holocaust narrative.\n\nPeople who were in the camps. The vast majority of people who were in the camps tell a sad tale, but most of them don't actually have first hand accounts of psychopathic human experiments and gas ovens. Many of them tell about how they were *warned* of such things, but fewer than you'd think actually claim to bear witness to such atrocities. Often they talk about how things were very hard- and they were- but they had small pleasures- like sports teams, meager *payment* for their labors, with which they could buy snacks, smokes, etc. from a commissary. \n\nFinally we have to address the claims that there were genocidal practices. This is simple, but also very touchy. They're lying. The fact is, I haven't even addressed the scientific evidence that such things as the gas ovens aren't physically capable of burning the amount of people that is claimed. These facts alone would show that those who makes these claim are full of shit. You can mathematically prove that they're lying. But in many cases, these people have even admitted to lying. Seriously, it's amazing how many people lied about the atrocities. Dr. Josef Mengele according to some accounts, somehow managed to personally oversee every new Jew that entered Auschwitz while personally performing medical experiments and murders. These accounts are spread by people like this:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/holocaust-survivor-lied-joseph-hirt-auschwitz\n\n&gt;For years, Hirt gave public speeches about his experiences in the second world war, including his Jewish family\u2019s flight from Poland to Belgrade. But he also told people that he was arrested by the Nazis, sent to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, and met Mengele, the SS physician who tortured prisoners of the concentration camp. Hirt claimed to have escaped under an electric fence at the camp.\n\n&gt;He added an extraordinary prologue and epilogue to the story, saying that he saw Adolf Hitler turn his back on Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and that he met Eleanor Roosevelt and Owens after his arrival in the United States.\n\nOr this lady:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AavzatcCUEU\n\nShe makes the claim that when she was a 2 or 3 year old girl, Nazis put a 12 inch nail in her skull, and that she was hung from a wall with a necklace made out of knives put around her neck. \n\nFrankly, it's a laughable proposition. She wouldn't have survived. But people accept this story as gospel truth, and it's not critically examined. Why? Because it's good propaganda. \n\nAnd why do some people go overboard in telling their stories? Because there's a lot of money in book sales, reparations, etc. There is money to be made. Just look at Spielberg; he made a fortune pushing fictionalized history that tug at the heartstrings and reaffirmed American moral superiority. \n\nI want to be super clear. I'm not suggesting that the vast majority of holocaust survivors are lying. I *am* suggesting that the vast majority of holocaust testimonies do not provide first hand accounts of the so-called \"genocide\" and the ones that do *are* lying.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where things get very tricky because so far, nothing I&amp;#39;ve said is particularly emotionally... controversial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that the things I&amp;#39;ve outlined ARE testimony of holocaust survivors.

And that&amp;#39;s not me saying that, that&amp;#39;s groups that keep track of holocaust survivors who count this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why that matters: Holocaust survivors get reparation money. Even those people who fall into the category I mentioned. People who never set foot in a concentration camp get paid reparations. I&amp;#39;m not suggesting they weren&amp;#39;t in any way affected, but I am suggesting that a great deal of &amp;quot;holocaust survivors&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t actually have a first hand account of what went on in the camps. What they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have is financial incentive to tell their story, and in many cases that story is as simple as they left their home. Maybe they were in hiding, maybe they had to flee in the dark of the night. I&amp;#39;m not saying this isn&amp;#39;t tragic, but I am saying that the &amp;quot;countless testimonies&amp;quot; that we&amp;#39;re told about often do absolutely nothing to suggest that there was mass extermination going on within the camps. They simply portray people who were forced into refuge- tragic, but not supporting the holocaust narrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who were in the camps. The vast majority of people who were in the camps tell a sad tale, but most of them don&amp;#39;t actually have first hand accounts of psychopathic human experiments and gas ovens. Many of them tell about how they were &lt;em&gt;warned&lt;/em&gt; of such things, but fewer than you&amp;#39;d think actually claim to bear witness to such atrocities. Often they talk about how things were very hard- and they were- but they had small pleasures- like sports teams, meager &lt;em&gt;payment&lt;/em&gt; for their labors, with which they could buy snacks, smokes, etc. from a commissary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally we have to address the claims that there were genocidal practices. This is simple, but also very touchy. They&amp;#39;re lying. The fact is, I haven&amp;#39;t even addressed the scientific evidence that such things as the gas ovens aren&amp;#39;t physically capable of burning the amount of people that is claimed. These facts alone would show that those who makes these claim are full of shit. You can mathematically prove that they&amp;#39;re lying. But in many cases, these people have even admitted to lying. Seriously, it&amp;#39;s amazing how many people lied about the atrocities. Dr. Josef Mengele according to some accounts, somehow managed to personally oversee every new Jew that entered Auschwitz while personally performing medical experiments and murders. These accounts are spread by people like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/holocaust-survivor-lied-joseph-hirt-auschwitz\"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/holocaust-survivor-lied-joseph-hirt-auschwitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For years, Hirt gave public speeches about his experiences in the second world war, including his Jewish family\u2019s flight from Poland to Belgrade. But he also told people that he was arrested by the Nazis, sent to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, and met Mengele, the SS physician who tortured prisoners of the concentration camp. Hirt claimed to have escaped under an electric fence at the camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He added an extraordinary prologue and epilogue to the story, saying that he saw Adolf Hitler turn his back on Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and that he met Eleanor Roosevelt and Owens after his arrival in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or this lady:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AavzatcCUEU\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AavzatcCUEU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She makes the claim that when she was a 2 or 3 year old girl, Nazis put a 12 inch nail in her skull, and that she was hung from a wall with a necklace made out of knives put around her neck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it&amp;#39;s a laughable proposition. She wouldn&amp;#39;t have survived. But people accept this story as gospel truth, and it&amp;#39;s not critically examined. Why? Because it&amp;#39;s good propaganda. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why do some people go overboard in telling their stories? Because there&amp;#39;s a lot of money in book sales, reparations, etc. There is money to be made. Just look at Spielberg; he made a fortune pushing fictionalized history that tug at the heartstrings and reaffirmed American moral superiority. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be super clear. I&amp;#39;m not suggesting that the vast majority of holocaust survivors are lying. I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; suggesting that the vast majority of holocaust testimonies do not provide first hand accounts of the so-called &amp;quot;genocide&amp;quot; and the ones that do &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg6i60n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057730.0, "created_utc": 1492028930.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fu9y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PoorlyRoundedSquare", "parent_id": "t1_dg66pbd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What of the testimonies of Holocaust survivors?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What of the testimonies of Holocaust survivors?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg6fu9y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055354.0, "created_utc": 1492026554.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg66pbd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fatcyst2020", "parent_id": "t1_dg5shxd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "By the definition of wikipedia, no- the holocaust did not happen.
