And I recognize my hypocrisy in that the main reasons I believe in larger conspiracies are because of the ones that are already confirmed facts.. I know not everything in this plane is as it seems but it really just seems absurd to me.

You are on the right path for sure.  I found out about this information about 3 years ago and I of course thought it sounded pretty crazy at first.  Then you ask yourself \"ok why do I believe in a 1000 mph spinning globe earth?\".  Then it gets pretty trippy when you realize that it basically boils down to faith in NASA images and a globe in the classroom since childhood. \n\n I thought I was going to easily prove a globe at first but then realized it should be MUCH easier to prove a spinning globe if we really lived on one.  You then realize that the main \"proofs\" are ships going \"over the horizon\" (but with modern zoom cameras we can zoom the ships fully back into view proving they are just out of our optical view and not hidden by earths bulge.) and the other \"proof\" is a 2,300 year old experiment where a guy allegedly measured two shadows 500 miles apart at the same time.  The problem with the Eratosthenes experiment is that he had ASSUME that the sun was millions of miles away to make it work on a sphere.  If the sun was smaller and much closer (like it has been measured and shown to be) you would get the same results on a flat earth. \n\n Basically they reverse engineered the math to fit a theoretical globe model, that is why just because the math works doesn't mean it is reality (and why the math has been drastically altered since the Copernicus days ).  Einstein even admitted that the math will work out correctly for a geocentric model just as it will for a heliocentric model.\n\nIt's a huge subject and I've rambled enough, but I just wanted to comment that by questioning the globe and looking for proof instead of blindly trusting authority figures you are on the right path as far as truth goes.\n\nIf you really just think about it your intuition will tell you that we are not spinning 1000mph while moving 67K mph around the sun, it's actually pretty laughable once you come to the realization.

You are on the right path for sure.  I found out about this information about 3 years ago and I of course thought it sounded pretty crazy at first.  Then you ask yourself &amp;quot;ok why do I believe in a 1000 mph spinning globe earth?&amp;quot;.  Then it gets pretty trippy when you realize that it basically boils down to faith in NASA images and a globe in the classroom since childhood. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I was going to easily prove a globe at first but then realized it should be MUCH easier to prove a spinning globe if we really lived on one.  You then realize that the main &amp;quot;proofs&amp;quot; are ships going &amp;quot;over the horizon&amp;quot; (but with modern zoom cameras we can zoom the ships fully back into view proving they are just out of our optical view and not hidden by earths bulge.) and the other &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; is a 2,300 year old experiment where a guy allegedly measured two shadows 500 miles apart at the same time.  The problem with the Eratosthenes experiment is that he had ASSUME that the sun was millions of miles away to make it work on a sphere.  If the sun was smaller and much closer (like it has been measured and shown to be) you would get the same results on a flat earth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically they reverse engineered the math to fit a theoretical globe model, that is why just because the math works doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is reality (and why the math has been drastically altered since the Copernicus days ).  Einstein even admitted that the math will work out correctly for a geocentric model just as it will for a heliocentric model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a huge subject and I&amp;#39;ve rambled enough, but I just wanted to comment that by questioning the globe and looking for proof instead of blindly trusting authority figures you are on the right path as far as truth goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you really just think about it your intuition will tell you that we are not spinning 1000mph while moving 67K mph around the sun, it&amp;#39;s actually pretty laughable once you come to the realization.  Take care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dga3xmf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249788.0, "created_utc": 1492220988.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65elms", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65elms", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgamrjb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dlandis13", "parent_id": "t1_dgadm50", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wait, what?
