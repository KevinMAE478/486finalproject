Is this a legitimate concern if al-nusra is on the ground? this is a question i have, but granted this is a question that's very influenced by my consumption of RT.\n\n&gt; \"We are certain that the opposition could not have fabricated all of the videos and other reporting of chemical attacks. Doing so would have required a highly organized campaign to deceive multiple media outlets and human rights organizations while evading detection.\"\n\nThis seems like a straw man ... who is saying this?\n\n&gt; \"Moscow has since claimed that the release of chemicals was caused by a regime airstrike on a terrorist ammunition depot in the eastern suburbs of Khan Shaykhun. However, a Syrian military source told Russian state media on April 4 that regime forces had not carried out any airstrike in Khan Shaykhun, contradicting Russia's claim. An open source video also shows where we believe the chemical munition landed - not on a facility filled with weapons, but in the middle of a street in the northern section of Khang Shaykhun. Commercial satellite imagery of that site from April 6, after the allegation, shows a crater in the road that corresponds to the open source video.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\nFirst they say Moscow said it was a terrorist ammo depot.\nThen they say Syria told Russian media no airstrike in Khan Shakyun.\n\nisn't the ENTIRE premise of the US article that the regime was bombing khan shaykhun? so how exactly is moscow contradicted? because a military source said so on TV? which military source was it, what intelligence did they have? surely someone saying something on TV doesn't disprove a story that both US and Russia agree on, no?\n\nThis is not getting to the question of the evidence for the crater being the site of the bomb.

We cannot publicly release all available intelligence on this attack due to the need to protect sources and methods, but the following includes an unclassified summary of the US intelligence community&amp;#39;s analysis of the attack.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SIGNALS &amp;amp; GEOSPATIAL: SOUNDS GOOD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;LAB ANALYSIS: this wouldn&amp;#39;t prove anything if someone else carried out the attack or if the attack were unintentional&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF CREDIBLE OPEN SOURCE REPORTING: is it possible that al-nusra and ISIS are publicizing images? much of the commentary I&amp;#39;ve posted has cast doubt on &amp;quot;open source reporting,&amp;quot; essentially arguing that our whole news stream is coming from sources who are ideologically committed to one side or the other.

However, a Syrian military source told Russian state media on April 4 that regime forces had not carried out any airstrike in Khan Shaykhun, contradicting Russia&amp;#39;s claim.
