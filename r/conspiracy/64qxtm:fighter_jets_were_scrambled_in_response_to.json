Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron has details in the first of a four-part series.\n\nPart 1: http://youtu.be/5fm0_7jVqcE\n\nTonight, in the second of four reports on spying by Israelis in the U.S., we learn about an Israeli-based private communications company, for whom a half-dozen of those 60 detained suspects worked. American investigators fear information generated by this firm may have fallen into the wrong hands and had the effect of impeded the Sept. 11 terror inquiry. Here's Carl Cameron's second report.\n\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhAEjSQghj8\n\nLast time we reported on an Israeli-based company called Amdocs Ltd. that generates the computerized records and billing data for nearly every phone call made in America. As Carl Cameron reported, U.S. investigators digging into the 9/11 terrorist attacks fear that suspects may have been tipped off to what they were doing by information leaking out of Amdocs. In tonight's report, we learn that the concern about phone security extends to another company, founded in Israel, that provides the technology that the U.S. government uses for electronic eavesdropping. Here is Carl Cameron's third report.\n\nPart 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwze5owq4w\n\nThis week, senior correspondent Carl Cameron has reported on a longstanding government espionage investigation. Federal officials this year have arrested or detained nearly 200 Israeli citizens suspected of belonging to an \"organized intelligence-gathering operation.\" The Bush administration has deported most of those arrested after Sept. 11, although some are in custody under the new anti-terrorism law. Cameron also investigates the possibility that an Israeli firm generated billing data that could be used for intelligence purpose, and describes concerns that the federal government's own wiretapping system may be vulnerable. Tonight, in part four of the series, we'll learn about the probable roots of the probe: a drug case that went bad four years ago in L.A.\n\nPart 4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwckJoP7-wg\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; When arrested, the Israelis - dubbed the \"High-Fivers\" by the FBI - were found to have airline tickets with immediate travel dates for destinations world-wide, and tie-ins to 9/11.
