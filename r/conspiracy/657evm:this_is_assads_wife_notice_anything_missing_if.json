However, as I said, there's very little that feminism can bring to the table nowadays. Gamergate - isn't a real thing, was just a hashtag with loads of assholes on it, as well decent human beings speaking out against bullshit. Hence the fight against Gamergate was made up. Misogyny is very real, but in most cases people are labelled incorrectly. Hence I can't help but be skeptical when somebody is called one. Feminist literature is not reliable my opinion, because one comes with a very specific set of objectives when writing an academic piece, which hinders one's ability to distance from bias. Hence a lot of it (not saying everything) is either flawed in terms of approach, selective and not entirely academic. The biggest flawed example is gender pay gap: all studies that prove its existence are done incorrectly in terms of statistics by comparing uncomparable samples, as well as not accounting for various factors such as working hours, job commitment etc. Toxic masculinity is also not real, it's just people being assholes - always has existed and always will.

However, as I said, there&amp;#39;s very little that feminism can bring to the table nowadays. Gamergate - isn&amp;#39;t a real thing, was just a hashtag with loads of assholes on it, as well decent human beings speaking out against bullshit. Hence the fight against Gamergate was made up. Misogyny is very real, but in most cases people are labelled incorrectly. Hence I can&amp;#39;t help but be skeptical when somebody is called one.
