I've done quite a bit of acting myself and it's obvious to me when someone is acting, poorly, which he is here. \n\nIf this guy is being investigated, he's not about to confess to everything on camera.

Their faces would be blurred and their voices modulated.\n\nSpeaking of the hat, why is an Indian crime lord living in the jungle wearing a Venezuelan hat?\n\nSpeaking of the voice, and also the facial hair, this is obviously a young kid. And small, and weak. He's the sort of dude who would be *raped* in prison. No one is going to follow that guy into a human trafficking ring. He couldn't defend himself in a fight and no hardened criminal is going to respect him as a leader. He's soft, it's obvious. Which- actors are soft.\n\nAlso notice his teeth? They're pretty straight and white for someone who lives in the jungle. He's no doubt straight outta Bollywood. His facial features are actually fairly neotonous and symmetrical so you know he's an actor. Full lips and a nice little cleft in his chin. I'm not saying criminals aren't attractive, I'm saying he has classic actor features and his appearance is far too clean cut for someone living out in the jungle.\n\nThe music? It's dramatic. It's totally disrespectful and inappropriate if this sort of thing *was* real, but the point of the music is to add tension and emotion to the scene. \n\nAlso notice the Indian woman- she's completely nonchalant about this. And she doesn't seem to be in any fear over the fact that she's in the camp of a man who apparently steals girls like herself and sells them into sex slavery. \n\nThen it's just... Ross Kemp. \"I'm done here, I'd kill him.\" This is just a laughable reaction. It's laughable and if you know anything about Ross Kemp his whole thing is going around the world putting himself in \"dangerous\" situation and trying to come across as tough.
