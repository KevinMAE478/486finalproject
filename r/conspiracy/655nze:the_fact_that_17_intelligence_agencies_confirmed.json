Alexander\u2019s keynote speech at the 2012 DEF CON. Alexander had stated that \u201cOur job is foreign intelligence\u201d and that \u201cthose who would want to weave the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people, is absolutely false.... From my perspective, this is absolute nonsense.\u201d Wyden then asked Clapper, \u201cDoes the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Wyden asked \u201cIt does not?\u201d and Clapper said, \u201cNot wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\u201d[30]\n\n&gt; When Edward Snowden was asked during his January 26, 2014, TV interview in Moscow what the decisive moment was or why he blew the whistle, he replied: \u201cSort of the breaking point was seeing the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. ... Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back.\u201d[31]\n\n&gt; On June 5, 2013, The Guardian published the first of the global surveillance documents leaked by Edward Snowden, including a top secret court order showing that the NSA had collected phone records from over 120 million Verizon subscribers.[32] The following day, Clapper admitted the NSA collects telephony metadata on millions of Americans\u2019 telephone calls.[33] This metadata information included originating and terminating telephone number, telephone calling card number, International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, time, and duration of phone calls, but did not include the name, address, or financial information of any subscriber\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsmo0hUWJ08\n\nAND, the reality is that Clapper is a lawyer, so he would not have lied to congress if it was illegal.  So we can either assume there was somethign about his language that made it NOT a lie, or it is legal for him to lie under oath to congress.

Alexander\u2019s keynote speech at the 2012 DEF CON. Alexander had stated that \u201cOur job is foreign intelligence\u201d and that \u201cthose who would want to weave the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people, is absolutely false.... From my perspective, this is absolute nonsense.\u201d Wyden then asked Clapper, \u201cDoes the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Wyden asked \u201cIt does not?\u201d and Clapper said, \u201cNot wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\u201d[30]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Edward Snowden was asked during his January 26, 2014, TV interview in Moscow what the decisive moment was or why he blew the whistle, he replied: \u201cSort of the breaking point was seeing the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. ... Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back.\u201d[31]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On June 5, 2013, The Guardian published the first of the global surveillance documents leaked by Edward Snowden, including a top secret court order showing that the NSA had collected phone records from over 120 million Verizon subscribers.[32] The following day, Clapper admitted the NSA collects telephony metadata on millions of Americans\u2019 telephone calls.[33] This metadata information included originating and terminating telephone number, telephone calling card number, International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, time, and duration of phone calls, but did not include the name, address, or financial information of any subscriber&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsmo0hUWJ08\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsmo0hUWJ08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND, the reality is that Clapper is a lawyer, so he would not have lied to congress if it was illegal.  So we can either assume there was somethign about his language that made it NOT a lie, or it is legal for him to lie under oath to congress.  Either way something is rotten in denmark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXDDsn5blA\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXDDsn5blA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg7ncy3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123856.0, "created_utc": 1492095056.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655nze", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7xat1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GlobalHell", "parent_id": "t3_655nze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Considering that the fbi never applied a forensic investigation on the server.
