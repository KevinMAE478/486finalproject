The linked document says:\n\n&gt;Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, **except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.**\n\n&gt;Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at [this shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet from Wikileaks](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417) where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that \"One of the first things **Hillary** did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook...\" This has been edited to say \"the Clintons\" instead of \"Hillary\" because the linked 46-page document doesn't even mention Hillary's name. And besides, \"the Clintons took over the scene?\" The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the \"orphans\" and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.\n\n&gt;So what happened to Silby?\n\n&gt;&gt;Despite Silsby\u2019s stated intent to take the children over the border to an\nunauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as\nTorres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal\nassociation charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the\nadditional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3\nmonths and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence\nwas based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue\u2014whether\nSilsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings\nor grey adoption markets\u2014was not addressed or resolved.\n\n&gt;&gt;Rather than turning on Silsby\u2019s actions, the decision in her case appeared\nto turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained\nthat his decision was based on the Haitian parents\u2019 testimony that they had\n\u201c[given] their kids away voluntarily.\u201d Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge\nPuello stated that the missionaries \u201cwillingly accepted kids they knew were\nnot orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.\u201d Another\ntrial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that \u201c[t]he\nparents\u2019 testimony means no law was broken and \u2018we can\u2019t talk any more\nabout trafficking of human beings.\u2019\u201d\n\n&gt;More bombshells about the people who were \"trafficking in Haitian orphans,\" from the *same document.* Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:\n\n&gt;&gt;The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help.\nIt turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.\n\n&gt;Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an [ICE News Release](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal) to put it all into context:\n\n&gt;&gt;In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. **Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of \"Puello Consulting\" in the Dominican Republic.**\n\n&gt;&gt;Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. **However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the \"alleged\" lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.**\n\n&gt;&gt;An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.\n\n&gt;To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.\n\n&gt;So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it's not even funny.\n\n&gt;And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this [this email](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741) \"where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children\" but *it's just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization.* Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gyceg/pizzagate_has_not_been_disproven_nor_publicly/dawdueh\n    ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lol, Silsby was one of my first debunking posts on this sub.

The pressing issue\u2014whether\nSilsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings\nor grey adoption markets\u2014was not addressed or resolved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than turning on Silsby\u2019s actions, the decision in her case appeared\nto turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained\nthat his decision was based on the Haitian parents\u2019 testimony that they had\n\u201c[given] their kids away voluntarily.\u201d Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge\nPuello stated that the missionaries \u201cwillingly accepted kids they knew were\nnot orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.\u201d Another\ntrial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that \u201c[t]he\nparents\u2019 testimony means no law was broken and \u2018we can\u2019t talk any more\nabout trafficking of human beings.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More bombshells about the people who were &amp;quot;trafficking in Haitian orphans,&amp;quot; from the &lt;em&gt;same document.&lt;/em&gt; Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help.\nIt turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an &lt;a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal\"&gt;ICE News Release&lt;/a&gt; to put it all into context:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. &lt;strong&gt;Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of &amp;quot;Puello Consulting&amp;quot; in the Dominican Republic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. &lt;strong&gt;However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the &amp;quot;alleged&amp;quot; lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it&amp;#39;s not even funny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this &lt;a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741\"&gt;this email&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children&amp;quot; but &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#39;s just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization.&lt;/em&gt; Nothing more, nothing less. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gyceg/pizzagate_has_not_been_disproven_nor_publicly/dawdueh\"&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gyceg/pizzagate_has_not_been_disproven_nor_publicly/dawdueh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dg6b2t9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492050449.0, "created_utc": 1492021649.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y8f2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y8f2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y8f2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y8f2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y8f2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6qnbq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rmwe", "parent_id": "t1_dg6of5f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "From your first source:\n\n&gt; former President Bill Clinton accepted an expanded role as special envoy for Haiti, on behalf of the United Nations, \n\n&gt;In the course of a month, **President Clinton** brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.48\n\nThis is not Hillary Clinton, this is Bill.
