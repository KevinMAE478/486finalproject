It seriously is just bullshit, some are just letters that are claimed to be a gender.

I kind of thought it would start a revolution of \"Alright, we know the problem, let's fix it!\" - instead it was like a small acknowledgement.

I wanted Trump to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.)  I want every SJW eliminated off the face of the earth, if that&amp;#39;s not possible, kill us all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.)  I hated niggers (This was during the time when the riots were happening, and they were just doing stupid shit like beating white people).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the election, I knew 5 things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.)  Trump should have never been president, but lesser of the evils and all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.)  I let others doing bad things towards people who share my traits, work me up into a bit of a racist.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.)  SJW&amp;#39;s are mentally ill.  (More happened with them, and I specifically searched for issues I had no interest in to hear their arguments, to see if they sounded more logical when I wasn&amp;#39;t opposed to what they were saying - they did not seem more logical, they seemed mentally unstable, and the only reason I couldn&amp;#39;t see it before is because they threatened freedom of speech/expression/etc and I was focused on how insane their arguments were - as if I could show an insane person the fallacy of an argument)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4.)  We should probably still be killing SJW&amp;#39;s, or putting them in a group together or something - away from society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5.)  I don&amp;#39;t hate niggers.  I hate idiots doing idiotic things that hurt innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a wild ride and I am still pissed off.  While I still lean right, after being pushed away from what I called home (being a true liberal, as in - you can say what you want, we are all equal - no color favorites, nothing wrong with lesbians, etc.).  After I was pushed away by the SJW &amp;#39;tranny train&amp;#39; that tries to change facts about gender, claims I&amp;#39;m things I&amp;#39;m not, I do lean right, and I do hate the SJW&amp;#39;s who are doing some real crazy shit - like getting a law passed where landlords have to call them by their selected gender that has a list of over 60 or some shit.    It seriously is just bullshit, some are just letters that are claimed to be a gender.   Luckily, I have backpedaled as I did with blacks, and instead of hating all trannies, I hate the SJW ones who are telling the world to cater to their imagination.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, I got some wins - most of this sub I think got a few wins in - things we&amp;#39;ve been called insane for, are suddenly proven true, and then the masses say &amp;#39;oh, we knew that already&amp;#39;...(RIPS HAIR OUT) - still, despite this, I was still happy that at least the information got out, that&amp;#39;s a lot more than I could have hoped for.   I kind of thought it would start a revolution of &amp;quot;Alright, we know the problem, let&amp;#39;s fix it!&amp;quot; - instead it was like a small acknowledgement.     Still, we got some wins in - and then you know, you go back to /new and see 1 poster shitposting 10 or 11 times, and think &amp;#39;well, time to sort through the bullshit again and find a droplet of truth&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dga0lig", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245246.0, "created_utc": 1492216446.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ck66", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0rwj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nomandate", "parent_id": "t1_dg9kbh5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bravo!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bravo!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "name": "t1_dga0rwj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245481.0, "created_utc": 1492216681.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ck66", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgacraj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Isz82", "parent_id": "t1_dg9kbh5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/conspiracy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; We have different states for a reason.
