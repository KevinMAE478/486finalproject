Do you think it's referring to the dude and his baby daughter both \"men who love underage boys\"? Do you honestly believe *that's* more likely? It doesn't even make any sense.\n\n* The \"kill room\" is a fucking walk-in freezer. Jesus. I bet any time someone sees an empty one someone makes this lame joke.\n\n* The baby doll is just a stupid joke. I don't even see how that implies anyone is a pedophile?\n\n* The handkerchief? Even if it *was* part of a code, there's nothing about pedophilia in the codes. Are we to believe that gays are pedophiles now?\n\n* The pizza reference? What the fuck is \"suspicious\" about that. He offered to bring some pizza. John declined. Are you that fucking sick to think that's a reference to pedophilia?\n\n* It's been shown time and time again that Breitbart was referring to those retarded (and deliberately misrepresented) ACORN tapes. It had nothing to do with PG.\n\nLike I said earlier, this is nothing but imagined innuendo. It's why anyone with half a brain can see that this theory is bullshit.\n\nI'm checking out of this conversation.
