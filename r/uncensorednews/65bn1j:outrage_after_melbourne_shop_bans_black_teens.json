In the latter half of the 20th century those social measures came to be referred to as &amp;quot;discrimination&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been that way since Man first walked upright.  A threat response that is coded into the DNA of all animals.  Survival begins and ends with violence.  No amount of denial, preaching, shaming, bargaining, pleading, or wishful thinking will overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the United States, blacks (regardless of where they were born, or whether they are US citizens) comprise approximately 13.5% of the population, and males between the ages of 15 and 45 approximately 3.5%.  More than half of the USA&amp;#39;s violent crime is committed by that 3.5%.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the disproportionate violent crime committed by that group returned to the national average, the behavior displayed by the rest of society towards it---unequal treatment, suspicion, hostility, and so forth---would drop the the same level as for any other group of people living in America who can be identified at a glance or with a word:  Chinese, Koreans, Sikhs, Poles, Jews, Irish, Germans, Swedes, Italians, Norwegians, Amish, Mennonites, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how humans work.       &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That simple, obvious truth isn&amp;#39;t politically popular, though---too many people have found a way to make their living off lighting fires and fanning flames who don&amp;#39;t want the situation to improve or be solved---so it goes unaddressed, generation after generation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those profiteers and social manipulators have been so successful that the behavior of the group they exploit---the disproportionate violence that not only must be addressed, but must be addressed &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt;---isn&amp;#39;t even discussable.  In fact, increasingly, its existence can&amp;#39;t even be acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "uncensorednews", "name": "t1_dg9ttdw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236209.0, "created_utc": 1492207409.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yck5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bn1j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg96rc0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "miatribe", "parent_id": "t3_65bn1j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/uncensorednews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Poison the items that they are stealing. \nThey won't be able to provide proof of purchase to claim they got them from him.
