Didnt you read that part?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a local, I grew up around white people and American culture; and Mexicans and Mexican culture.  When we went to Houston, it was awesome--there were Chinese restaurants run by actual Chinese people, Indian people running Indian buffets, a woman speaking Korean on the phone, African dudes from Africa, brown people that weren&amp;#39;t texas-mexican.  People underestimate how much of a museum of the world&amp;#39;s cultures that port city is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want white people making steak and BBQ, or Mexicans making fajitas, go anywhere else in Texas and it&amp;#39;s awesome.  Houston has some unusual stuff and people in it.  Sounds like good TV to me and I dont care to ensure my TV shows are demographically sensitive in either direction(have or don&amp;#39;t have)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "uncensorednews", "name": "t1_dgav746", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492304045.0, "created_utc": 1492275245.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgasam1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ragnarokrobo", "parent_id": "t1_dgao902", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/uncensorednews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Guess everyone gets to melt in the pot except white people.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess everyone gets to melt in the pot except white people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "uncensorednews", "name": "t1_dgasam1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492299977.0, "created_utc": 1492271177.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yck5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hva5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yck5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hva5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yck5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hva5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yck5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hva5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcvg0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "3kindsofsalt", "parent_id": "t1_dgawt1u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/uncensorednews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fine by me.
