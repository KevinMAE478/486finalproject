Generally though, us Christians stay out of all the political skirmishes and leave it to the Hindus and Muslims to battle it out. I do know that a majority of the Christians vote for the Congress (in most states) which is the opposition to the Hindu nationalist BJP that tends to do things like ban beef and make yoga mandatory in schools. \n\nAlso, being a minority in India sometimes has advantages as well.

As I mentioned in my previous post, I had a relatively privileged life so I haven&amp;#39;t been at any disadvantage. But there are Christians who are persecuted in other parts of India. I&amp;#39;m from the south but I&amp;#39;ve heard of incidents in the north where extreme right wing Hindus beat up carol singers and things like that. Also, Hindus don&amp;#39;t like Christian missionaries because they convert a lot of people. Most of these converts are from very poor backgrounds and are offered education, money and provisions if they convert, which is why they do it and not because they&amp;#39;ve found God. Generally though, us Christians stay out of all the political skirmishes and leave it to the Hindus and Muslims to battle it out. I do know that a majority of the Christians vote for the Congress (in most states) which is the opposition to the Hindu nationalist BJP that tends to do things like ban beef and make yoga mandatory in schools. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, being a minority in India sometimes has advantages as well. There is some amount of extra support provided by the government to improve their status. An example would be scholarships for students in low income minority families. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "uncensorednews", "name": "t1_dgbuavz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492358983.0, "created_utc": 1492330183.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbt934", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lord_Orme", "parent_id": "t1_dgbs4wi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/uncensorednews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for taking the time to give such a detailed reply!
