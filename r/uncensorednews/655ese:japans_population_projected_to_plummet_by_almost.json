They'll rue the day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUxPENcUS9w)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand they&amp;#39;ll tell you the world is ending due to overpopulation, on the other they&amp;#39;ll tell you drastic reduction in population size is terrible and the end of the world, and that&amp;#39;s why you need people from MENA to miscegenate with to keep your population within the bounds of constant tax inflow to government coffers. AKA &amp;quot;Pay our pensions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know the real reason they want population numbers to remain large? International finance and central banks. Money. Sheer capitalistic greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my understanding these national drops in fertility rates are the natural progression of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\"&gt;advanced societies. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What worries TPTB is that they will have less debt slaves to maintain their central banking and international finance buddies wealth as well as their own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are constantly told that raising a family is too expensive in the &amp;quot;current year&amp;quot; while simultaneously allowing for migrant families to do nothing but procreate and receive welfare for their &amp;quot;troubles&amp;quot;. Effectively having the people that should be having children, pay for the people who should not. That is dysgenics at work. Breeding the dumbest most servile population possible, and telling you it is tolerance and understanding to allow all this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why? It&amp;#39;s because homogeneous nations are hard to control and they are not easily cowed by some form of guilt tripping or another. Multicultural nations are not nations at all and break down all forms of cohesion. From community to relationship. All aiding them in their agenda of the dysgenic creation of a servile, docile, materialistic, base race of people that are easy to manipulate and control. That hold no culture or beliefs other than what product they should proselytize for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might read this comment and think I&amp;#39;m some deranged lunatic, but the fact is, is that you can see it happening, you know this to be true as much as I do, but you just don&amp;#39;t want to admit it to yourself because you think nobody would be this....evil. I can assure you, they are, and they do it because they get gratification from it, because they hate the European people above all else. The one people who could actually challenge them. The one people, that remain a threat to them and their dominance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUxPENcUS9w\"&gt;Our fire still burns.
