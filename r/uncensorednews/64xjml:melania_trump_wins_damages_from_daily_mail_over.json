In order to be able to respond in a timely manner, we have prepared a response which deals with the various concerns raised by complainants.\n\nOn receipt of a complaint, IPSO\u2019s Executive staff reviews it to ensure that it falls within our remit, and represents a possible breach of the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice. The Executive has now completed an assessment of the complaints under the terms of the Code and has concluded that the complaints received do not raise a possible breach of the Code.\n\nMany complainants said that the article was misleading, in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy), because it misrepresented the video posted by J\u00f6rg Sprave onto YouTube. It was widely complained that the article suggested that the aim of the video posted by Mr Sprave was to demonstrate how to kill someone wearing a stab proof vest and to train terrorists, when he was demonstrating that a vest bought on Amazon, which claimed to be stab resistant, was ineffective and of poor quality. Many complainants noted the differences between the vests, namely that the vest bought on Amazon was made out of aluminium and was worth around \u00a360, whereas stab proof vests worn by the police force are worth around \u00a3800.\n\nThe article reported that Mr Sprave posted a video on YouTube entitled \u201cHow to pierce a stab proof vest\u201d, in which he \u201cplunged\u201d a knife through a vest which had been described as protective body armour, and included Mr Sprave\u2019s position regarding the video. The newspaper compared this vest to one similar to the vest worn by PC Palmer when he was fatally stabbed during the Westminster Bridge attack. The article reported that the video had been viewed nearly 250,000 times, from which Google and other companies would have generated thousands of pounds in advertising revenue. The article also reported comments made by the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, and Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, whereby they condemned the video, and comments posted online by viewers of the video. The article went on to report Mr Sprave\u2019s comments that \u201cthese vests should not be described as stab proof\u2026I just test things and make videos to review all kinds of things\u2026if they change police equipment because I have shown it is vulnerable then I may be saving some lives\u201d, making clear the intended purpose of the video. The newspaper described the video as \u201csickening\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d.\n\nWe should explain that under the terms of Clause 1, the press is free to editorialise and campaign, provided that publications take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information. The article reported that in the video, Mr Sprave demonstrated how to penetrate a stab proof vest, which was \u201clike\u201d the vest worn by PC Palmer. The newspaper was entitled to then draw the conclusion that the video could be interpreted or used as a guideline to penetrate protective body armour, by jihadis. The article reported that there had been warning that \u201cUK jihadis use such material for training\u201d. We did not consider that this was a suggestion that Mr Sprave is personally connected to the training of jihadi soldiers, that he films and posts these videos for the purpose of jihadi training, or that the video was used to train Khalid Masood for the murder of PC Palmer. The omission of the fact that the video was a review of a vest brought on Amazon did not render article significantly misleading, particularly where Mr Sprave\u2019s position on testing was included. As such, we did not consider that the article misrepresented the video, or that the article was significantly misleading on this point. We did not establish a possible breach of Clause 1.\n\nA large number of complainants also expressed concern that the article unfairly portrayed Mr Sprave and noted the impact that the publication of the article might have on his personal life and livelihood. These concerns were raised under Clause 3 (Harassment), Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock), Clause 9 (Reporting of crime), Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge), Clause 12 (Discrimination) and Clause 13 (Financial journalism). I should explain that IPSO is able to consider complaints from an individual who has been personally and directly affected by the alleged breach of the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice; complaints from a representative group affected by an alleged breach where there is a substantial public interest; and complaints from third parties about accuracy. These concerns related directly to Mr Sprave, and as complainants are not acting on his behalf, with his knowledge and consent, we are not able to consider these concerns further.\n\nSome complainants also expressed concern about legal matters, such as libel. I should explain that such concerns do not fall within IPSO\u2019s remit. We should make clear that IPSO only considers concerns framed under the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice, and cannot offer advice on criminal offences or any other legal matters.\n\nYou are entitled to request that the Executive\u2019s decision to reject your complaint be reviewed by IPSO\u2019s Complaints Committee. To do so you will need to write to us within seven days, setting out the reasons why you believe the decision should be reviewed. Please note that we are unable to accept requests for review made more than seven days following the date of this email.\n\nWe would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider the points you have raised, and have shared this correspondence with the newspaper to make it aware of your concerns.\n\nBest wishes,", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they got away with it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Tl;Dr The Daily Mail was found not to have breached editorial conduct/ethics.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Letter from the IPSO Re: Dailymail vs. Jorg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir/Madam,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I write further to our earlier email regarding your complaint about an article headlined \u201cGOOGLE BLOOD MONEY\u201d, published in print and online by The Mail on Sunday on 2 April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) has received a number of complaints about this article.

Huge spikes in the NASDAQ average index and the DOW average index starting November 8th. (This will count for Obama unfortunately, but we know where the real credit belongs.)\n\n 3. He has placed sanctions on Iran after they tested ballistic missiles\n\n 4. He has met with/talked to over 30 foreign leaders.\n\n 5.
