I've been down this road far too many times good sir, the data just isn't there to support this claim. There's plenty of data out there to look to to prove that there has been no \"massive spike\" in crime. AT WORST, there has been a minor increase in petty crime, such as theft of phones. However, by and large the stats show that migrants commit less crime than their donor countries. \n\nThis is a trend regarding refugees and crime that has been true for decades by the way, and it's not just unique to Syria either. It's more of a human nature thing. Most refugees know it behooves them NOT to be criminals when they're also refugees, because that could result in getting deported back to sarin gas and/or getting drowned in cages/whatever they are fleeing for. \n\nIt's kind of hard to believe people actually believe this this crime spike narrative, and aren't just saying it as a thin veneer to cover up blatant racism and xenophobia.
