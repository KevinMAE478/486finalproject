The fursuit parades and dance events are a little goofier to look at than people doing the same in Final Fantasy outfits (even if the difference between a Mithra or Miqo'te and a partial fursuit isn't that big), but it's along the same lines and a lot of folk aren't really going for them.  Even for con-goers, less than half have anything as complex as a belt tail, and even at conventions known for their parades only a small portion actually join in.\n\nEvents can range from dance or skit competitions to card tournaments, or even stranger (I think Furfest had a fursuit hockey event?).  Some of the more physical ones tend to be fursuit-only, since there's absolutely no contest between a fursuited bowler and someone who can use their thumbs freely, but folk playing in a Smash Brothers tournament usually won't.  Speakers are sometimes folk from inside the fandom giving advice, or well-known persons doing Q&amp;As or how-they-do-it stuff.

Larger cons can be selected to host the Ursa Major Awards, which isn't a *huge* deal but gets a lot of attention.\n\nA lot of it's economic.  You've got artists, animators, writers, sculptors, et all in the marketplace, and the con doesn't just allow furries to buy the stuff without depending on shipping, but also brings lesser-known experts to their attention.  Some of this is adult art or comics, but contrary to what folk would expect it's not the sole focus: most cons restrict it to varying levels, and most of the material that trades hands tends to be more general audience or PG-13 level, and some very well-known artists like Rick Griffin don't do anything more explicit than kissing.  Fursuits get the most attention, [not without reason](http://kaiborgstudios.tumblr.com/post/129811691984/ascii-abraxas-owned-by-prismaticsky), but books, accessories, tokens, tons of other stuff.
