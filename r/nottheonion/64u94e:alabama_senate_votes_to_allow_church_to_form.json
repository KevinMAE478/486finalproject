It's pretty easy to figure out - there's nothing to do in those areas and, at least where I lived, the anti-alcohol and drug education and other programs were rather terrible...  Probably because it is a very religious area, so it is only allowed to be \"just say no\".

The only way I think it could add up is if there is a school associated with the church and they are counting every class, every day as an event, which is absurd.  \n\nIn my experience, only really large events have police for actual security - for example, when the universities where I have lived have had large events like homecoming, st. patrick's celebrations, etc. there will typically be police presence simply because of the crowd size.  Usually people just get in trouble for minor things, like being really drunk and drinking in public...but those are usually people who are really being belligerent and causing trouble - the police tend to be pretty lenient on those nights.  There aren't really too many serious incidents.  Otherwise, sometimes the police will come if there is a need to direct traffic, like with parades, or the department might send representatives to a community event in order to support the community.\n\n&gt;I think cops at a school are a terrible idea and if Columbine is any example, they won't know what to do anyway. \n\nPretty much.
