Pay depends on what your rank is, but if he was getting paid $60,000 a year, he could essentially pocket all of it since he&amp;#39;s getting extra money for housing and food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you want to get into even more details, whenever he&amp;#39;s deployed he&amp;#39;s getting paid even more for all sorts of different pays; hazardous duty pay, combat pays, etc etc. the list can go on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the guy is making bookoo bucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: it&amp;#39;s been about 5 years since I&amp;#39;ve been out of the navy, and I was getting paid around $2,000 a month. I was able to save about $1,800 a month because all I was paying for was a cell phone and internet bill and would spend frugally. Now that I have a job in the civilian world, I make around.... $2,000 a month. I have a mortgage, phone bill, internet bill, electric bill, water bill and sewer bill that eats up about $1,200 of that $2,000 each month. I still have to buy food with what&amp;#39;s left over and then decide how much I should save or splurge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nottheonion", "name": "t1_dg9c09g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492214962.0, "created_utc": 1492186162.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnts", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chvw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg997ci", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 247, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheBlackUnicorn", "parent_id": "t1_dg9936e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nottheonion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The military's socialist paradise.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military&amp;#39;s socialist paradise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nottheonion", "name": "t1_dg997ci", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492211694.0, "created_utc": 1492182894.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 247}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnts", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chvw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnts", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chvw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnts", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chvw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnts", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chvw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9biav", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "beywesley", "parent_id": "t1_dg9b1dw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nottheonion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "More so when they go to SQT prior to deployment.
