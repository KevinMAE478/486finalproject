The only time you're allowed to save up money for money's sake is in order to summon the merchant, in order to protect him - see below.\n* Any excess stuff you have - old equipment, tools, furniture, etc. - must be sold off to your NPCs and then the money must be trashed.\n* All equipment, and all armor of higher level than copper/tin, must be hidden by a plain-clothing outfit in order to remain humble.\n\n**The oath of protection:**\n\n* Give all NPCs a home as soon as possible.

This means both keeping monsters away from your townsfolk, and ensuring that any defenses you build will not harm traveling merchants.

Get rid of heavy armor and use smaller weapons and you can be a cleric (basically paladin in a dress).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; I so wish Terraria had more of these RPG elements to it. It&amp;#39;s such a perfect game for them...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Terraria", "name": "t1_dg6io9g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492058261.0, "created_utc": 1492029461.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sg5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rqbu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4q1jk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Barhandar", "parent_id": "t3_64rqbu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Terraria", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's not a paladin, that's a crusader king.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not a paladin, that&amp;#39;s a crusader king.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Terraria", "name": "t1_dg4q1jk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491965608.0, "created_utc": 1491936808.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
