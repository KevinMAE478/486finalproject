bigger dps. \n\n****Summoner**** have lowest armor but not highest attack. \n\n****There aren't any xp,just you can get armor set bonuses,and accessories that help for some class****,in pre-hardmode there are only few armor for class,in hardmode,after you kill boss in hell,there will be a lot more armors that give unique set bonuses for classes. \nIf you play mixed you use all weapons that you like and take armor which bonus you like most. \n\nThere is 3 modes for character,2 modes for world and 2 in game progress.\n\n For character there is- softcore,when you die you drop only money,there is mediumcore - when you die you drop some items,and there is hardcore -your character will delete if you die but its available only on pc. \n\nFor world there is 2 modes- normal and expert,but expert is available only on pc if i remember right,and on android it is not available,in expert bosses are harder,they have more hp,more damage,unique moves but they drop more money and give you cool special items from item bag. \n\nGame progress is in two parts- ****pre-hardmode and hardmode****,pre-hardmode is so long until you kill boss in hell,when you kill it world will be in hardmode instantly.\n\n ****You can get more HP by using life crystal and life fruit****, life crystals can be found Underground and upgrades your hp up to 400,life fruits can be obtained only when you entered hardmode,in underground jungle.\n\n ****For tactics in early game - if you will play mixed or mage****,go to dungeon,its everytime in snow biome side,destroy all books that you find,and they can drop you waterbolt,its very good magic weapon that can be found early in game and is good even in early hardmode,just don't go too deep until you kill Skeletron,if your world didn't drop it,go and farm in other worlds,when you start game you will have only 1 blue star,1 blue star is 20 mana,mana is used for magic and summoning weapons,you can get more mana by getting it from armor set bonus and by using mana crystal that can be crafted from 5 yellow - fallen stars,that falls at night and disappears at morning,so don't drop them at day.\n\n ****Skeletron is fourth boss so don't try to kill it early.**** \n\nFor ****melee**** go and loot chests because you can get spear or bumerang(bumerangs are not throwing)and try to get better armor than others if they are going to play with mage or ranged,you can get better armor by digging ore,but actually don't dig copper/tin because its totally useless. \n\nFor ****ranged**** - he needs to get bow,it's possible by crafting or by buying from merchant,merchant will arrive if you will have free room and if all your money in inventory combined is more than 50 silver,if he don't sell- close shop and restart until he sell it.", "edited":

But eventually, melee weapons start firing projectiles just like magic and ranged, though theirs are (usually) on cooldowns to compensate. I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner, but it might be all you can do early-game.\n* Ranged is anything that requires physical ammunition, like bows and firearms; the only exception I can think of off the top of my head is a harpoon you can get in the late stages of early-game. There are different types of ammunition; so as you could guess, the damage of both the weapon and the ammo are factored into the damage of every shot. Ranger is nice, but best saved for the late stages of early-game, if not mid-game.\n * One thing to note: thrown weapons deal might ranged damage in your version of Terraria, as opposed to being their own damage type in the PC version.\n* Magic is any weapon that requires Mana to shoot a projectile. Mana can either regenerate on its own, or be instantly replenished by a Mana Potion at the cost of a temporary damage down that scales back up over time. I'd recommend this for a beginner, given that they can become quite powerful.\n* Summon is the least fleshed out of the four classes, given that there aren't even two dozen summoning weapons. You essentially use Mana to create a minion who attacks for you, so it's fairly straightforward.
