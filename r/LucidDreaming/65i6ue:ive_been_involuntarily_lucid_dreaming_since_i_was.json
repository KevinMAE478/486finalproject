I am super excited to answer your questions! Some questions were harder to get the exact context so I'll paraphrase them and renumber them as they make sense to me. (pls dont hate my ocd)\n1. other factors effecting dreams besides alcohol? Not that I am aware of. I do not drink coffee, the only other thing \nI can think of is length of sleep usually directly correlates to the duration (for example I once slept for 20 hours and dreamed for 3 days and 2 nights).\n2. Do I remember being non lucid? Due to the nature of how I let my dreams run their course, I forget and \nremember from time to time, but there is always an underlying suspicion I am forgetting something, not to mention I remember it all like it was yesterday.\n3. Tips to make dreams go lucid: I read somewhere to push your thumb through your palm and really expect it to work, do this daily and it will be a habit. Eventually you will dream and think to do this and when it does, if you still expect it to, it will work. Thats the only external tip that worked for me. But how I personally learned was through my vision and my logical deduction of evey scenario ever. I pretty much dream more than I wake so it's easy for me to instantly understand my body is invisible unless I want to see it (if that makes sense).\n4. Can you lose lucidity when you force a reality check? Easily you can get sidetracked with events if you play the observer too much.\n5. How do you deal with the instant overstimulation of total control once you realize you are lucid dreaming? Honestly it's to forget you have so much power. I dealt with this a lot and it's best to start with small things and dont let your imagination go until you can do small things consistantly without feeling like you are starting to wake up.\n6. Can I do a WILD? I have before although it's kinda intense feeling, like you fell through your bed and you are leaving your body and the world behind and I feel every second so I just prefer to sleep and let it happen naturally.\n7. Can you learn life skills dreaming? I 100% believe so. Yet I havent found a way to do so myself. I kinda helped my guitar hand placement and throwing and catching skills but honestly nothing outside of that and I would love to find a way.\n8. What are the godlike stuff I speak of? Pretty much anything I can think of. I want to fly? I'm on a beautiful coastline at midnight with owl wings gliding gently. I want to go fast? I'm bare foot snowboarding down the sickest mountain. I want a person from my past to talk to me? Pop there she is! I WANT THAT NIGHTMARE OUT OF MY SIGHT! Bam I am elsewhere. Pretty much if I alter one state of the dream without any reason other than I'd prefer a different setting or character presented before, its cool but if I do it twice in a dream nothing happens and a nightmare starts, OR the current nightmare gets worse.\n9. If sensations work like they do in this world, how can I possibly know it is a dream? My imagination is crazy, and I feel as though since I have spent so much time dreaming I could imagine everything possible in this world to happen, and then some. Almost every dream is pretty insane in some way and since I was a kid made it my life goal to not feel pain or be scared of anything so I instantly know something is up when I start to worry that bad things CAN happen. Like one time my best friend at the time stabbed me in the face multiple times with a huge needle mid conversation out of nowhere. I was shocked at first woke up but after the second stab I realized I was dreaming but he got me at least 7 times. Also I CANT STAND NEEDLES. But yeah sometimes I ask myself the same question, if i feel pain, sadness and all other forms of stimulation, and spend more time there than here, how do I know that is not real life? And that the waking world is the real dream?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome reply! I am super excited to answer your questions!

Eventually you will dream and think to do this and when it does, if you still expect it to, it will work. Thats the only external tip that worked for me. But how I personally learned was through my vision and my logical deduction of evey scenario ever. I pretty much dream more than I wake so it&amp;#39;s easy for me to instantly understand my body is invisible unless I want to see it (if that makes sense).\n4. Can you lose lucidity when you force a reality check? Easily you can get sidetracked with events if you play the observer too much.\n5. How do you deal with the instant overstimulation of total control once you realize you are lucid dreaming? Honestly it&amp;#39;s to forget you have so much power. I dealt with this a lot and it&amp;#39;s best to start with small things and dont let your imagination go until you can do small things consistantly without feeling like you are starting to wake up.\n6. Can I do a WILD? I have before although it&amp;#39;s kinda intense feeling, like you fell through your bed and you are leaving your body and the world behind and I feel every second so I just prefer to sleep and let it happen naturally.\n7. Can you learn life skills dreaming? I 100% believe so. Yet I havent found a way to do so myself. I kinda helped my guitar hand placement and throwing and catching skills but honestly nothing outside of that and I would love to find a way.\n8. What are the godlike stuff I speak of? Pretty much anything I can think of. I want to fly? I&amp;#39;m on a beautiful coastline at midnight with owl wings gliding gently. I want to go fast? I&amp;#39;m bare foot snowboarding down the sickest mountain. I want a person from my past to talk to me? Pop there she is! I WANT THAT NIGHTMARE OUT OF MY SIGHT! Bam I am elsewhere. Pretty much if I alter one state of the dream without any reason other than I&amp;#39;d prefer a different setting or character presented before, its cool but if I do it twice in a dream nothing happens and a nightmare starts, OR the current nightmare gets worse.\n9. If sensations work like they do in this world, how can I possibly know it is a dream? My imagination is crazy, and I feel as though since I have spent so much time dreaming I could imagine everything possible in this world to happen, and then some. Almost every dream is pretty insane in some way and since I was a kid made it my life goal to not feel pain or be scared of anything so I instantly know something is up when I start to worry that bad things CAN happen. Like one time my best friend at the time stabbed me in the face multiple times with a huge needle mid conversation out of nowhere. I was shocked at first woke up but after the second stab I realized I was dreaming but he got me at least 7 times. Also I CANT STAND NEEDLES. But yeah sometimes I ask myself the same question, if i feel pain, sadness and all other forms of stimulation, and spend more time there than here, how do I know that is not real life? And that the waking world is the real dream?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LucidDreaming", "name": "t1_dgapljr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296063.0, "created_utc": 1492267263.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgajxgr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pluush", "parent_id": "t3_65i6ue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LucidDreaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also, I have a lot of question for your AMA\n1 - do you have factors that can affect your dream other than alcohol? e.g. coffee makes it longer or stuff?\n2 - have you ever been non-lucid as far as you can remember? any tips on how to make the dreams go lucid? can you lose lucidity when you do it on purpose? because I've always gotten too excited and got out of the dream or lose all my excitement and lucidity along with it.\n3 - can you do a wake-induced lucid dream? or it is always straight after you go to sleep (wild)?\n4 - you told me about learning something. can you learn some life skills in your dreams and use them straight after in real life? take drawing (hand movement and control), for example?\n5 - what are those godlike stuffs you're talking about? can you just create one godlike stuff (move yourself to somewhere nice and comfy or just create a new world) and not do more godlike stuffs after so you avoid the nightmares?\n6 - if sensations work like normal, how did you know that it was a dream? afaik you need a really good dream control to know that...\n\nThanks for posting!

If you can learn and understand this projection, and how everything in reality is only as scary as our subconcious mind makes it out to be, you may realize that everything it not as daunting as it once seemed. Here read the 3rd and 4th quote down: &lt;a href=\"http://openmindspace.org/AlanWatts\"&gt;http://openmindspace.org/AlanWatts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another note: It seems you are trying to escape this dream world to live a more normal life. But that more normal life doesnt exist. We will always have probelms on top of problems and the problem we currently have will always be, to us, the worst possible problem that we could have. You have this opportunity to explore any of your problems at a subconcious level. Avoiding these will not solve anything, but you have the opportunity to explore them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck to you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LucidDreaming", "name": "t1_dgb7o5j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321019.0, "created_utc": 1492292219.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0f4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i6ue", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0f4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i6ue", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc081o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Brainforrest", "parent_id": "t1_dgbfhap", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LucidDreaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In earlier posts I stated I use it semi-regularly to counteract severe stomach pains caused from severe depression.
