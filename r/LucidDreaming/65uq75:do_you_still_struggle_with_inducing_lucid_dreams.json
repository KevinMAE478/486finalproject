Maybe it has something to do with having ADD, but most times when I'm high, especially if I choose to be extra aware, it seems to enhance it.  So why doesn't it help your awareness when dreaming?  I know it has to do with the fact that it suppresses rem sleep, but still.  Seems like you'd be able to utilize the awareness enhancement for LDing.  It would be fantastic if smoking a doob before bed actually helped have crazier and more vivid dreams.\n\nI will say that there have been nights when I literally smoked right before getting into bed and had some good LDs later in the night.

I'll just use this opportunity to let you know that your [Advanced Lucid Dreaming: part 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zahodQ2mHy8) is my favorite lucid dreaming video ever (it's the one where you talk about meditation, state of mind and that whole \"techniques are tools, you get lucid yourself\" thing (paraphrasing)). I re-watch it every once in a while and it helps me get in a more productive state of mind, so thanks for that! Anyway:\n\n(1) Going to bed early or, maybe more importantly, at the same time every night (around 23:00 seems to be a good time). Meditation (I've realized that even one minute or two of meditation before bed greatly increases my dream recall (and very likely my chances to get lucid as well). Clear mind set, as in free from stress and anxiety or any other mental distractions. Motivation. This can come from reading or watching lucid dreaming related things or even having cool dreams the night(s) before (whether they are lucid or not). If I can access this \"pure, visceral desire\" where I'm almost shaking with excitement and expectation to have a lucid dream, it really helps focus my mind and increase my chances (though I find it really hard to get myself pumped up to that state). WBTB. Waking up 5-8 hours after I've gone to bed, getting up and doing something for about 15 minutes really helps.\n\n(2) Going to bed too late (especially when I'm exhausted). I think if I go to bed because I'm too tired instead of it just being time for bed it really has a negative effect on my dreams. Then again, maybe the whole underlying something (anxiety?) that keeps me up later is what makes it hard in the first place. Distractions, this can be general day to day anxiety and stress or just having watched an amazing movie that day. If I go to bed and can't stop thinking about a certain thing, that usually hampers my chances. General lack of motivation and interest, I've been lucid dreaming for almost 10 years now and I don't feel like I've made half the progress I wish I had. I guess after all this time it's finally starting to make me lose some hope, at least in terms of putting in the effort I used to.\n\nEDIT: I just checked the Facebook link and realized you already did the video about this, so nevermind!
