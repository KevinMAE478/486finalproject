I like this method because it&amp;#39;s like hide and seek and it usually ends up being quite a surprise when they turn up, which is fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, any method at all will work, but it is dependent upon your belief/confidence. You have to know that it will work. If you tell yourself that it won&amp;#39;t work, then it won&amp;#39;t. Thoughts dictate events in the dream. This is why if you&amp;#39;re lucid in a dream and something is occurring, if you make a guess at what will happen next it tends to turn out that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend building confidence with control. Try smaller tasks first and work your way up to summoning people. Try turning things into other things first, then creating or making things disappear, then once you know that what you want to happen will happen in dreams, try creating people again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LucidDreaming", "name": "t1_dgbpnvf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347820.0, "created_utc": 1492319020.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0f4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65karv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4owp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gloqqy", "parent_id": "t3_65karv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LucidDreaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Imagine that they are sleeping in your bed and walk into your room while shouting the name of the person", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that they are sleeping in your bed and walk into your room while shouting the name of the person&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LucidDreaming", "name": "t1_dgc4owp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384328.0, "created_utc": 1492355528.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0f4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65karv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcd5p4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arki_Idiosyncratic", "parent_id": "t3_65karv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LucidDreaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tell a dc that you are meeting up with summoned dc at a place like a cafe.
