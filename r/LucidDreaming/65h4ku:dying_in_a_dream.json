Out of angst, I decided to run to the trunk and steal a silenced rifle with a scope. I proceeded to run really far into the forest behind the HS and wait for the cops to expose themselves so I could kill them. (Again I don&amp;#39;t know why)\nI ended up killing both cops in two shots and somehow everyone knew it was me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I killed them, I was on the run because there was a mob of people coming after me. I ended up at my cabin on the dock when I was trapped and everyone was marching for me and I had no choice but to dive into the murky water at night. I swam to the bottom and under my dock only to realize I had the ability to breath underwater and see perfectly. Those looking for me could not do either. Although me being in the water for a while did stall them, it did not stop them from diving in and looking for me and shooting into the water blindly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enraged I decided to kill those who were trying to kill me by dragging them into the deep water and drowning them. Eventually I killed someone who had a pistol and I took the pistol. I kept killing these people over and over and furthering my sadness of being a hated cast out of society. Eventually there was a dark figure in the water where I could not recognize who it was. They had a gun pointed at me and before they fired they said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;quot; and proceeded to shoot at me. Out of defense I shot the figure 3 times and killed them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the figure to see who it was only to figure out it was my mother. I became hysteric. I walked out of the water onto the beach carrying my mother only to see my dad was standing there calm and alone. I walked up to him and said &amp;quot;dad I killed mom&amp;quot; and I was crying so hard. My dad never said a word as I laid my mother at his feet. I pulled out the pistol and put it too my mouth and shot. The gun blew a hole in my head yet it did not kill me. I pulled the trigger 7-8 more times emptying the clip into my own head and I did not die. I asked my dad &amp;quot;why can&amp;#39;t I die?&amp;quot; And he looked at me and smiled and said &amp;quot;you are not a man, you don&amp;#39;t have the courage to kill your self&amp;quot; and at that moment I woke up crying and was so confused..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt as if my dream was my mind teasing me.
