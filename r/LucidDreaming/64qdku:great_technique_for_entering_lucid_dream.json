But the reason for the post is I have found a new technique not mentioned here that I have performed now 3 times and all three have resulted in LDs. Recently my girlfriend has been wanting to fall asleep with music playing, but not your typical music but &amp;quot;sleep music&amp;quot;. You know the kind that sounds like &amp;quot;waves in the ocean&amp;quot; or something similar. Well every time we do this it has resulted in a LD. Idk why this is but I would have to assume it puts you into a R.E.M. State. Just wanted to mention this technique because it has been successful for me and I hope it works for you guys too.
