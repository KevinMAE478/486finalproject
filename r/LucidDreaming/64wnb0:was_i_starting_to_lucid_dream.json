About 15-30 minutes later i felt these sort of &amp;quot;waves&amp;quot; i guess you could call them, go through my whole body really quickly and almost randomly, starting with my feet then to my head. I also started to see shapes forming and shifting from a pacman with a super high resolution smile to a flat image of a white sandy beach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sandy beach looked so real i thought i just had my eyes open looking at a pillow to my side but i opened my eyes and the pillow was blue and i was really confused so i closed my eyes again to just try to sleep and the waves feeling started happening and i started to pay closer attention to it and it went away and i woke up a couple hours later. Was i close to lucid dreaming? Ive heard that your body feels weird when you try to induce a lucid dream through the WILD technique. Problem being ive never in my life had a lucid dream and ive never tried to do WILD before :/ any help is appreaciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Earlier in the day i ended up taking a nap because i didnt sleep well during the night and i was up early doing some errands.
