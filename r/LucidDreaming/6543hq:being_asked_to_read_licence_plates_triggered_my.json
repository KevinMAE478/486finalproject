I was able to better remember the bizarre succession of dreams I was having. One of the first of these went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The setting was a plain in the vicinity of a castle, which was built on top of a dam at the edge of a lake. I think that I reached this remote place by steam train (hydroelectric Hogwarts?) although the grassy parking area in which most of the dream took place would imply other transport connections. I was standing amongst the cars with a group of people, most of whom seemed to be around my age, with some kind of instructor in a helmet and jacket. He looked like a climbing or rafting instructor, to give some examples. This was my first thought, although he began to explain something to us and then asked me to read the number plates (licence plates for you Americans) on some of the nearest cars. Damn, I thought we were gonna abseil the dam or some shit like that. Anyway, I proceeded to read the letters and numbers on the plate of the first car. Easy enough, and I turned back to the instructor. I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly what the exchange was here but I think he told me to reread it because I made a mistake. Anyway, I ended up rereading it as asked and it was different. At first it had only changed a little (the font, I think) but on a third look the letters and numbers were not the same as before. By this point my mind had made the connection between what I was being asked to do and the text-changing reality check. I didn&amp;#39;t hold the dream for long but I was able to tell the instructor that I&amp;#39;d figured things out before it faded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought that was a pretty interesting thing to be asked by a dream character - for some background, I was a frequent lucid dreamer for about a year-long period two years ago but they have since become more rare - and pretty much all my previous reality checks were through self-doubt of the surroundings and inconsistencies rather than being talked into doing it. I&amp;#39;m also wondering if the brief (but positive) change in my sleeping pattern had anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: was dreaming about being asked to read licence plates on cars, was asked to re-read one and the change in the text informed me that it was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So last night I went to sleep early in order to sleep off a headache and I ended up waking several times in the night for short periods of time, which is unusual for me nowadays.
