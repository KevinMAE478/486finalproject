It was very vivid with much detail, so I will put this as simple as possible. I dreamt that I was working in a large brick building that had about 8-10 floors. I had an office where I would do paperwork and everything to me seemed familiar to me in the dream. One day some friends come over and they notice that one of my eyes is droopy. I'm embarrassed of this and I try asking one of my coworkers if they knew what may cause that. He isn't exactly sure, but he had a friend who was a doctor that may have an idea. I meet up with this doctor later that day. He does some inspection, but at one point he makes a face. I ask him what's wrong, but he just pulls my friend aside and whispers in his ear. Moments later, the doctor gives me a test where he asks me to answer random questions and do strange actions. I do this, and he asks me to come back for the following few days. These days pass as if they were real, and every afternoon I go see this doctor to preform more of these tests. After about a week, my eye is still not better. I go to this doctor, as usual, but when I arrive, there are other doctors. I question him, but he just asks me to do the test. I get it over with, but their faces concern me. They have faces of shock. In the end, I was doing things that weren't what he was asking me. I start crying after being told this. Apparently, I had a rare condition that would have me losing my touch with reality until one day I just wouldn't wake up. I couldn't believe it. I was taken to an institution so maybe a cure could be found. These doctors were willing to put in the time to find something that could help me out. Days passed by and I just got more and more embarrassed of myself. My friends and family had a hard time dealing with me. I couldn't keep up with what they were saying. All I really knew was that they still cared for me. That, of course, was something I could feel. After some time, my eyes could barely focus and my body was weakening. I went to the doctor and he said that him and his fellow doctors may have found a cure. However, there was no way of knowing if it actually worked. After much paperwork, we came to an agreement that I would test the medication without legal risks to the doctors. After a few days, I was brought into this large room. A few reporters were there, along with the doctors, my friends, and my family. The doctor recommended to me by my coworker stood on a podium. He said that I would be given this medication to see if I could be cured of this condition. He added that once given the medication, my body would have to fight the condition and that I would either improve drastically or succumb to it. What I was required to do was preform three small tasks to show whether I was gaining back my sense of reality or not. After this, one of the other doctors came up to me and prepared me for the shot. He gave me a good luck and injected the shot. Almost immediately, I started to get blurred vision. The room started spinning and I remember someone rushing to put me into a wheelchair. My three tasks were simple. I had to go to the end of the room and read a book out loud. Afterwards, I had to write a simple sentence on a chalkboard. Finally, I had to make my way to the other side of the room and open the door. Anyways, after slumping into the wheelchair, I enter another dream. That's right. Into the dream of my dream. This this dream, I am normal. I can walk. I have no problem. There is no one in the room except for the book, the chalkboard, and the door. I realise then that this is just my condition taking me away from the reality. As I walk towards the book, a wall forms in front of it. This was the condition fighting back against my mind. I walk around the wall and enter a maze like thing. Meanwhile, I can still hear the people in real life cheering me on. Somehow, in real life, I was doing something right. So I continue the maze, and when I reach the book, it's no longer a book. It's an apple. Why the hell was it an apple? As I wonder what happened, I feel the disappointment of the people in real life. My doubt in this dream was causing my real body to fail reading the book. I decide to take action. I eat the apple. Simple as that. I hear the clapping. In real life, I had read the book. Now that this was done, I leave the maze and head towards the chalkboard. The chalkboard becomes a wall, this time with vines and leaves. There is a hole in this wall. I feel compelled to reach in it. As I approach it, my brother comes from behind. He asks me what I am doing. As I try to explain, he just becomes frustrated. I then realise that I involved myself with him, but that he is only part of this dream. He wasn't real. I'm saddened finding this out, but I build courage and tell him that I have to reach into the hole in the wall. He becomes angrily confused and demands a reason. I tell him with a heavy heart that I have to see if the cure is working for me in my real life, cause everything that was happening at that moment wasn't real. His face changes from angry to completely confused. He looks at the floor, at his hands. I grab his shoulder and tell him that everything will be alright. At this, I turn around and reach towards the wall. Suddenly, the vines turn into snakes. I'm frightened, but quickly remember that it's all a dream. I put my hand in the hole in the wall. Another round of applause. This one, however, I hear much more faintly. I start to think that maybe I am falling deeper into the dream, into my condition. Either way, I still have one more task left. If all I do is open the door in real life, I will be able to prove that the medication did in fact have some effect, and that maybe people in the future won't have to struggle with it like I was. As I head toward the door, suddenly, my mom walks in. Again, I find myself confused. She walks up to me and sweetly asks me if I ate. I look down and reply that I didn't. She then asks if I would like her to cook me something. I look at her, at her eyes. I start to cry. I look back down to the ground and I hear her start crying as well. She asks me what was the matter. That's when I told her. I had to tell her that she was only apart of the dream as well. I had to tell her that she as well was only a distraction given to me by my real life condition. I then look up. I hug her. She is confused and just looking at me trying to comprehend the whole situation. I am angry that my condition used my mom against me. She then tells me that whether it's a dream or not, she will always love me. At this, I hear a huge roar outside the windows. It's a tsunami. I realise that this is how my condition was going to kill me. I failed. While still hugging my mom, who doesn't seem to notice to incoming wave, I just hold her head to my chest. I tell her that everything will be fine and that even if she was dream, I still loved her the same. Seconds later, the waves crash in. I feel the ceiling fall over me. Everything goes black. I am back to my real self. I am in the wheelchair, and I see everyone surrounding me. I'm dead, only inches away from opening the door. The doctors are distraught. The reports writing in their little notepads. My friends and family around my dead body crying. After witnessing this scene, my vision seems to lift into the air, through the ceiling, into the clouds. I finally wake up, in my actual, real life. I realise that the whole, entire thing was a dream. I have dry tears over my eyes. I lay up and cry as if the whole thing were real.\n\nNow if you read up to here, kudos to you. I know this faintly relates to this post, but it's the fact that I had to tell someone in a dream that they weren't real that most impacted me. To conclude, I thank you if you read the entire thing (cause it's a lot) and I hope one day my dreams do make sense to me. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a dream once similar to this. It was very vivid with much detail, so I will put this as simple as possible. I dreamt that I was working in a large brick building that had about 8-10 floors. I had an office where I would do paperwork and everything to me seemed familiar to me in the dream. One day some friends come over and they notice that one of my eyes is droopy. I&amp;#39;m embarrassed of this and I try asking one of my coworkers if they knew what may cause that. He isn&amp;#39;t exactly sure, but he had a friend who was a doctor that may have an idea. I meet up with this doctor later that day. He does some inspection, but at one point he makes a face. I ask him what&amp;#39;s wrong, but he just pulls my friend aside and whispers in his ear. Moments later, the doctor gives me a test where he asks me to answer random questions and do strange actions. I do this, and he asks me to come back for the following few days. These days pass as if they were real, and every afternoon I go see this doctor to preform more of these tests. After about a week, my eye is still not better. I go to this doctor, as usual, but when I arrive, there are other doctors. I question him, but he just asks me to do the test. I get it over with, but their faces concern me. They have faces of shock. In the end, I was doing things that weren&amp;#39;t what he was asking me. I start crying after being told this.
