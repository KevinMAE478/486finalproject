How did they do it? I have no clue. Point is I &amp;#39;fell asleep&amp;#39; inside of my dream and was very well aware that I was &amp;#39;dreaming&amp;#39; as part of the story I was in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, once I go under I take the first person perspective of one of the family we&amp;#39;re investigating, and he&amp;#39;s talking to his two brothers about this riddle that their deceased father left behind. They&amp;#39;re trying to solve it, and even though I have the ability to take control of the man whose eyes I&amp;#39;m looking through, I&amp;#39;m just letting the memory play out until I get some valuable information. Long story short, one of the guys solves the riddle and I take control of the memory in order to lead them towards disclosing more information.
