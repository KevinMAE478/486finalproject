It&amp;#39;s me again! &amp;quot;What IS mentally willing something?&amp;quot; guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to get to the point, I wondered what visually imagining something happening while lucid would do. To clarify, place your hard on a nearby table and &lt;em&gt;visualize&lt;/em&gt; the surface freezing over because of it. Also, &lt;em&gt;visualize&lt;/em&gt; one of the objects on your table leaving the surface and floating. Try moving your head up as you do to &amp;quot;keep staring at&amp;quot; the object as it floats up! The key here is imagining it actually happening and letting a visual image of the event propagate up in your mind. You&amp;#39;re making the visualization a canvas for your imagination. I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Since all I &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; in my LDs is in the mind, what would happen if I did the exact same thing in there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried it the following night and just like that, &lt;strong&gt;BINGO!&lt;/strong&gt; Suddenly, I could grasp control of everything!
