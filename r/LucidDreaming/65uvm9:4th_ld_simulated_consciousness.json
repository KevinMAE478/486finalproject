BUT even that considered, many details still don&amp;#39;t astonish me exactly like in a normal dream: by example, I was in a room where the light was on. When I left the room and then went back inside, the light was off and the window was open: this detail has not even crossed my mind (I mean even just a little). And there are, unfortunately, a lot of small details like this one that I could enumerate. So I cannot but conclude that my waking memory, in ALL my LDs, is desperately incomplete. In the sense that it is almost only composed of my thoughts on lucid dreaming when I am awakened, with a superior critical sense that is limited to my dream plans in their general terms (which I anticipate in advance) -for example, I test my lucidity without caring much of the results. This is like my consciouness was simulated mechanically and in a certain precise way by my brain, so he can appeal to minimum ressources to produce a satisfising impression of lucidity. The principle in itself doesn&amp;#39;t bother me in fact, but here it is just too obvious. I said to myself that it is like I was a dream character of my own lucid dream, my lucidity -even if it&amp;#39;s real- is grossly scripted .
