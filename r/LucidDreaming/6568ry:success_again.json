It was spontaneous (normal dream, then I suddenly realized I was in a dream).\n\nLD practice is *all about* giving you that flash of awareness that you're dreaming.  It has *everything* to do with the practice.  LDs are never \"random\" unless you've never heard of them and/or you're not trying for them.    RCs are *not required* for lucid dreaming.   Increased awareness *is* required.   Awareness/memory/reflection (usually in combination) necessarily precedes RCs (if you even do the RC).\n\nAlmost nobody (non-naturals) can *control precisely 100% of the time* when they will have lucid dreams.   It's always a percentages game.   As one advances in ability, the base level percentage increases.     It can get high enough where if you form the intention to have an LD (and perhaps perform at least a short WBTB), you can be *almost* guaranteed a LD, but it's still not 100% all the time.   And it always takes at least some effort (again speaking of non-naturals).\n\np.s. congrats on the long LD!
