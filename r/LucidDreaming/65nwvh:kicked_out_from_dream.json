Ive only ever had one happen spontaneously a couple months back. Yesterday night I set my alarm for 4hours and when i awoke, i walked around for a bit, ate a banana and wrote down what would happen once i sleep. After about 30 mins I went back to bed and attempted the WILD technique since I was sleepy and believed it would work. After much resisting the urges I finally began to see colors and hear buzzing and felt my body lifting up. At this point i began to imagine the scenary i always imagine when trying to lucid dream: a giant open crazy field with a single tree in the middle. Next thing i knew i was lucid laying down in the grass of a open field. I was really excited and looked around to find the tree. The tree was infront of me not so far away by standing infront was this shadow of a girl with glowimg white eyes. Her hair was following in the wind and she was looking down. When she noticed me lookimg at her she said in a very soft and soothing voice &amp;quot;You shouldnt have come here&amp;quot; I felt no hostility in the voice, she soundes more concerned. Immediately after i felt myself get flung backwards and i awoke in my bed 5hrs later. What felt like 1min ended up being 5hrs of sleep. I dont know who she was since she was a shadow but I want to try again and find her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Recently i have been very intrigued with LDing and have been trying my best to achieve one.
