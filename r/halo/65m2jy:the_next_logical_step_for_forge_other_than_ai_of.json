This could be for buildings or terrain and kind of a step further than welding. I imagine it as being a permanent way to stick intersecting  pieces together where they actually become one piece. I believe this would help performance because the game doesn&amp;#39;t have to remember each different piece and render them separately. It would also help cut down on number of pieces used and allow you to add more. Maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong about this, I don&amp;#39;t really know that much about how these things work, but it&amp;#39;d be awesome if it could give us better performance and allow us to add more pieces. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dgc7qa1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388483.0, "created_utc": 1492359683.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m2jy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcfxai", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GivenToFly93", "parent_id": "t3_65m2jy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Here's what would separate forge from a PC editor.\n-object sculpting\n-object clipping\n\nIf you can use objects to manipulate the shape of other objects, and cut any polygons inside of other objects (phased pieces) we could then make our own pieces in engine, and dramatically improve performance.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what would separate forge from a PC editor.\n-object sculpting\n-object clipping&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can use objects to manipulate the shape of other objects, and cut any polygons inside of other objects (phased pieces) we could then make our own pieces in engine, and dramatically improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dgcfxai", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492399317.0, "created_utc": 1492370517.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m2jy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcl0e2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BootyPuff", "parent_id": "t3_65m2jy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also custom textures would be cool as shit.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also custom textures would be cool as shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dgcl0e2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492405933.0, "created_utc": 1492377133.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m2jy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m2jy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcr4pq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GadenKerensky", "parent_id": "t1_dgcp3lj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm pretty sure they have checkpoints.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they have checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dgcr4pq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492414169.0, "created_utc": 1492385369.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp3lj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fusoi", "parent_id": "t3_65m2jy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sounds good.
