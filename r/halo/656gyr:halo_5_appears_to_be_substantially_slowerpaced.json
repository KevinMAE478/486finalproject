For Halo 5, I worked backwards from the most recent HCS finals, because I wanted as many matches with the Energy Sword at top mid as possible, to more closely resemble the layout in Heretic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recorded the final score, the total number of kills, and the total runtime of the match itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end results are this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matches of MLG Team Slayer on Heretic are, on average, &lt;strong&gt;2 minutes and 36.05 seconds quicker&lt;/strong&gt; than HCS Team Slayer on Truth.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is despite the &lt;strong&gt;losing&lt;/strong&gt; team in Halo 3 having an average of 4.54 kills &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; per game than Halo 5.

Bungie&amp;#39;s approach to aim assist was a huge improvement in 2001, but the bar was low as fuck back then. Gamepads and input programming today, while far from perfect, have come a long way since them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in the 00&amp;#39;s I modded Halo 1 and Halo 2 to have absolutely zero bullet magnetism and vastly reduced reticle magnetism, and it played great. Sure, everyone missed a lot at first but, but then you get good and make your shots legitimately, like it&amp;#39;s supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to today, and there&amp;#39;s input algorithms out there which are accurate enough to beat mouse&amp;amp;keyboard players at Quake with zero aim assist:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zffq-1G_x_E\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zffq-1G_x_E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run of the mill input algorithms aren&amp;#39;t as good, but still adequate for games as slow as Halo. I really don&amp;#39;t believe aim assist is necessary any more, it&amp;#39;s merely become a crutch for developers to simply avoid refining their controls properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg7zyb0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137316.0, "created_utc": 1492108516.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7v4ze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GingerSpyglass", "parent_id": "t1_dg7toyg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Agreed.

If you are finishing the game sooner, that means you are getting into more gunfights more quickly that are resulting in the death of a player. That is fast.\n\nNo that's not exactly true. In H5 there is much more techniques to avoid getting killed, such as thrusting away, or sprinting away from a firefight. In H3 if you're in a heads-up firefight, there isn't much techniques to back out of a fight. Which means, you could have just just as much firefights or even more firefights in H5, but that won't mean games will quicker, since players can cheat death by using there spartan abilities. \n\n&gt; The thing with halo 5 is that other than the sprint-thrust-slide-jump combo, the game just feels faster, its not actually faster. That feeling of speed can be accomplished with a proper base movement speed, Field of View, Map size and effects on the edge of the screen. That is the only reasons i ever see why to keep sprint \"it makes the game faster \" (no it doesnt) and \"I feel like a spartan!!\" there are other ways to accomplish that without making the map design and game balancing problems more difficult on devs like sprint does.\n\nYou don't have to strawman me.

It shouldn't be analyzed by just time, but rather more specific variables such as firefights per minute, actions per minute (APM), etc... \n\nTo strictly blame map balancing on the reason why games take longer is silly. There are other things to also consider, such as spawn system, spartan abilities, weapon respawns, power-up reasons, weapon damage, these are all valid variables why games could take longer in H5, than H3.

Speed isn't about the average time between kills, it's more about the movement speed, ability to dodge and ability to close the distance between players. Speed by definition is distance per unit time, and if you use the spartans as scale for distance, the speed of the spartans in Halo 5 is faster - at least at max speed (not sure about the average speed).

Average distance travelled per minute would be the better metric for speed. \n\nIf you define pace as how intense the game feels, the average time between kills is a good metric, as it represent how often you engage in fights.

Older Halos have a more constant pace, while Halo 5 have more variation in terms of pace. The more unpredictable nature of the gun battles also makes them more intense and require more focus. This constant shift of pace and focus is probably why Halo 5 almost always feels so competitive. As a consequence you probably find it harder to relax while playing Halo 5.
