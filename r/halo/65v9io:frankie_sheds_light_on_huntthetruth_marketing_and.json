'Halo 5' was specifically said to be about the Chief's growth and development and his interaction with Blue Team, and how them crossing paths with Osiris would show \"two sides\" of [a story about family, duty, legacy, heroism, etc. that would build on all these other parts of the fiction](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/shacknews/assets/editorial/2015/07/sdcc-halo-5-transmedia-infographic.png). Yet, in spite of this game being promoted to fans with more character/story focused areas of interest, we didn't get anything like that...343i didn't advertise a game where the Chief (and pretty much everyone else too) treats Fred, Kelly, and Linda like dirt, where Osiris has nothing to do with Blue Team or really any personal stake in what is going on at large, or where all previous plot threads are swept aside in order to make room for an evil and abusive version of Cortana that takes over everything in cliche-AI-Rebellion #526. So if 343i really thinks that was the right story to tell, *then they damn well should have advertised it as such*.\n\nBut don't just take it from me, here's what was stated in official promotional materials for the game (there's more untrue things that were said in other things like convention panels, but I don't have access to transcripts of those at the moment):\n    \n&gt;* \u201cAnd what of Master Chief? Ross said Master Chief is still the star of the show, and the star of Halo 5, despite Locke\u2019s prominence.\u201d\n\n&gt;**LIE.** 3 Blue Team missions vs. 12 Osiris missions. Chief wasn't remotely the \"star\" of this game - he does nothing but make a complete jerk of himself (*\"We don't ask.\"*/*\"What the hell are you doing here?\"*), and aid the villain's plans by being a complete tool yet again (seriously, this is like the 3rd time the Chief has been tricked into a trap by an AI). Locke meanwhile is most definitely the focus in all things, and largely spends his time dealing with third-party conflicts (Meridian, Sanghelios) and actually interacting with all the other characters *aside* from Blue Team (Osiris, Dr. Halsey, the Arbiter, Exuberant, etc.) in both a personal and professional manner.\n\n&gt;* \u201cHe\u2019s questioning many things he once firmly believed were true. He\u2019s questioning his past and his purpose, he\u2019s question who he is fighting for. For us this is a really interesting point. For the first time he\u2019s questioning everything he\u2019s done for the UNSC in the past.\u201d\n\n&gt;**LIE.** This is not a vague claim. Yet when does this idea of the Chief doubting his history with the UNSC *ever* pop up in the game? In fact in the first level he specifically tells the others on Blue Team *not to question* what ONI was doing on the Argent Moon. Not to mention that by the end of the game it turns out the UNSC was absolutely right to not want the Chief to go looking for Cortana because that not only allowed her to be fully unleashed from Genesis, but it also nearly got himself enslaved and his family killed. So if he had any doubts about them before, I don't see why he would now.\n\n&gt;* \u201c343 Industries has stated that Blue Team probably has more lines of dialogue in Halo 5 than they have in all the books, comics, and videos released to date, so it will give fans a better look into the personas of some of Halo\u2019s oldest warriors.\u201d\n\n&gt;**LIE.** This isn't a vague statement either. People have taken a count of the spoken lines in 'Halo 5', and suffice to say the members of Blue Team probably have more lines of dialogue (and likely more meaningful dialogue to boot) in *one book* than they have in *all* of 'Halo 5'.\n\n&gt;* \u201cWe got asked a lot about what happened to Cortana \u2013 what\u2019s her fate? Well, her fate is, obviously, very clear at the end of Halo 4.\"\n\n&gt;**LIE.** Because I'm pretty sure that the end of 'Halo 4' - and all the media that came after it - says Cortana DIED...NOT that she got sucked into the Domain *somehow* and *just-so-happened* to subvert a Forerunner Ancilla we've never heard of before in order to control it and then just up and decided that she was going to be the galaxy's supreme dictator because \"the greater good\".\n\n&gt;* \"It\u2019s more about the long-lasting impact she\u2019s had on him, and the whole universe, and that\u2019s kind of a metaphor for the effect she\u2019s had on fans now that she\u2019s gone as well.\"\n\n&gt;**LIE.** Cortana isn't gone, in fact it's the exact opposite seeing as how the entire story now revolves around her - and the only lasting impact she's going to have at this point is the millions dead and widespread damage/trauma she's caused in starting yet another pointless war.\n\n&gt;* \"There\u2019s more to the Chief\u2019s story, I think, that people are going to find in Halo 5 that deals with how he copes with loss, and how he deals with his memories, and what those memories help him contextualise.\u201d\n\n&gt;**LIE.** The Chief never copes with loss or deals with any memories in 'Halo 5'.

Not personally, as he doesn't even acknowledge them 99% of the time, and not in battle due to the fact they only have two cutscenes when they're in an actual combat situation together and nothing happens aside from them shooting their guns a few times before the threat disappears.\n\n&gt;* \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a human drama at the core of that and how these two teams relate to each other as they cross paths.\u201d\n\n&gt;**LIE.** And this one is particularly hilarious/ridiculous because out of the 3 times Blue Team and Osiris see each other, aside from Chief and Locke none of the Spartans speak or interact in any way.
