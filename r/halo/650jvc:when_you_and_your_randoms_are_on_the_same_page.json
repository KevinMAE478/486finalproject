I think it was 10-0 at one point? I fell off the map 5 times and couldn't get the jump on NavG as he [got used to my style](http://imgur.com/nP2pfzR.gifv).

I had some &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/xYoGbsW.gifv\"&gt;style specific&lt;/a&gt; moments, and a &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/dPxPNws.gifv\"&gt;gnarly knockdown across a jump.&lt;/a&gt;[&lt;a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/TsundereMoralDelicataOhMyDog\"&gt;his POV&lt;/a&gt;] NavG was &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/0rlvHjQ.gifv\"&gt;great at countering with sticky grenades&lt;/a&gt;, though, and was alot more mobile than I expected leading to &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/h2OXGmH.gifv\"&gt;downright embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; results lol. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure he was toying with me moreso than I, him - so I gotta give him the tie. That said, 11 of my 17 (65%) of my kills were using my spartan which I think proves my point about my style being viable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SECOND GAME (18-7 LOSS [&lt;a href=\"https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo-5-guardians/xbox-one/mode/custom/matches/9e84e984-8217-48af-8c73-689303d123e3/players/thatwasprimal?gameHistoryMatchIndex=0&amp;amp;gameHistoryGameModeFilter=All\"&gt;STATS&lt;/a&gt;])\nMan, I just couldn&amp;#39;t get started in this one lol. I think it was 10-0 at one point? I fell off the map 5 times and couldn&amp;#39;t get the jump on NavG as he &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/nP2pfzR.gifv\"&gt;got used to my style&lt;/a&gt;. There were clear instances where an improved accuracy &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/OPb5Md8.gifv\"&gt;would have saved me&lt;/a&gt;, and I did eventually &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/kXXYcuf.gifv\"&gt;find my groove&lt;/a&gt; to compete - allbeit late lol. 86% of my kills were with my spartan...although I think this game shows less the viability of my style. I did have a laugh at his attempt to ninja gone &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/WC7pzMv.gifv\"&gt;right off the edge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to go but here&amp;#39;s hoping it wasn&amp;#39;t the last game, &lt;a href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/404705030bab0555b4cc1fe6c78e067e/tumblr_nwhf4p0jb11tbbxjqo1_500.gif\"&gt;pleasure sparring with you Nav.&lt;/a&gt; Who&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg76189", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087983.0, "created_utc": 1492059183.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 61}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650jvc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650jvc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wkxx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "23564987956", "parent_id": "t1_dg6vzme", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1 deag ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 deag &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg6wkxx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074992.0, "created_utc": 1492046192.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6vzme", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheRealBigLou", "parent_id": "t1_dg6r9lq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I only saw 1 headshot, though.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only saw 1 headshot, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg6vzme", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074265.0, "created_utc": 1492045465.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6r9lq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 105, "report_reasons": null, "author": "23564987956", "parent_id": "t1_dg6j287", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "4 shots to get a headshot on a marine was frustrating to me, cool formation though ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 shots to get a headshot on a marine was frustrating to me, cool formation though &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg6r9lq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068517.0, "created_utc": 1492039717.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 105}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650jvc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76e76", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "azdre", "parent_id": "t1_dg6j287", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's the simple things that make Halo so great.
