Not sure why Halo 3 doesn&amp;#39;t deserve the same Anniversary treatment as CE and 2. Also sure would have been sweet to play in 4K as a Scorpio launch title, not to mention finally bringing the game to PC as a Play Anywhere title.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like a missed opportunity for the biggest Halo game ever, but I guess you guys have the metrics and all that such that the release wouldn&amp;#39;t justify the investment. I hope there&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; for Halo this fall with Scorpio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg8rmtu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173497.0, "created_utc": 1492144697.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652hw4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652hw4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg92v6l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kr0ni", "parent_id": "t1_dg8mrs7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "H3 Play Anywhere title would be the best course of action. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;H3 Play Anywhere title would be the best course of action. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg92v6l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492202512.0, "created_utc": 1492173712.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652hw4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9civ6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hiero_", "parent_id": "t1_dg8mrs7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Notice the way he worded his post. lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice the way he worded his post. lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg9civ6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215517.0, "created_utc": 1492186717.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8mrs7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheOutSpokenGamer", "parent_id": "t1_dg8l41g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is this a Halo 3 port to PC then?
