I think without resorting to autos they could place a light rifle there. I know there&amp;#39;s not a ton of open sightlines but what do you think about placing a beam rifle on Truth? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for gunfighter, I&amp;#39;m personally not good at it but I know that it has limited effective range which makes using it on these large maps very difficult. Either way I think since it&amp;#39;s a 6 shot kill that it should have a larger magazine. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind testing it as a secondary because I&amp;#39;m frankly interested in how the meta would develop around it. Maybe high-skill players would switch to it in close range over the regular magnum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg99h2p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212021.0, "created_utc": 1492183221.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65904c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg99z2i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IveGotaGoldChain", "parent_id": "t1_dg98j4k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I watched Formal play a little yesterday and it did seem like he was low on ammo a lot.

Obviously, a purely rock paper sissors situation would be terrible, but I don't think a \"fox only final destination\" style situation where everybody is using the exact same shit and the game settings and pickups are made so sterible just to justify it purely being a test of player skill under those specific conditions, because then it is just under those specific conditions, not the actual game itself. Like, shit, yeah, you can distill a game down to the most pure, barebones degree of exeuctional skill possible. but it ceases to be that game at that point. You *could* make a rule that from now all,in all street fighter tournaments,players are only allowed to use 1 of 3 characters that take the most skill and certain specials and tech is banned and all that, but at that point you really aren't even playing street fighter. \n\nAt that point, it's just bad balance. It's the players and the developers throwing their hands up and choosing to exclude part of the game just because they don't want to bother dealing with it. I can understand *resorting* to that if the base game is balanced so poorly it's necessary pending a fix, but to want it to be *designed* that way seems ridiculous to me. \n\nHonestly, I don't even think it's about wanting it to be just about skill. I think people just have a dumb bias and there's a fetishization with precision weapons.  I'm not saying that's the case with you in particular, but I think it is with some people. I think regardless of the potential other ways the game could be balanced or played that still rewards skill, because it's not the partiuclar combination of skills in the same way that the series has always had or people have wanted, they don't want to deal with it even if it might in the end result in something better. There's often accusations that SMogon, which is basically the people who run the competitive pokemon community, make bans based on preserviing their ideal of what competitive pokemon should be to the detriment of niche stratgieis or tactics, even when they leave overcentralizing moves and tactics unbanned and supported (such as stall), which I think one could argue has parralels with the Halo communities support of precision weapons despite how centralizing they are. \n\n==========\n\nThat out of the way, I really *don't* think automatics in Halo 5 are too strong, I think this is just the first time since CE (which is balanced so differnetly it's not even really relevant) that they simply *are* as strong. To be clear, i'm not saying it's prefect: I agree spraying and praying with the AR is much better then it should be (but I don't think the AR itself is too strong, and in fact, I wish accurate burst fire with it was even stronger), and I am in support of making the storm rifle and SMG basically full power weapons, as I said.\n\nI think part of the problem is that \"strong\" can mean so many different things. It can mean raw DPS within it's intended range, it can mean versatility, it can mean ease of use; or any combination of the 3. The shotgun is absurdly strong in it's intended range, but, when you take in account that it's intended range is such a small fraction of the actual possible ranges that engagements take place in, it's actually not *that* strong. Obviously, that's the point and idea for the shotgun, it's highly effective and easy to use in a specific range but it's basically useless outside of that, but my point here is to illustrate that you need to look at weapon effectiveness across all 3 of those facets, and in regards to automatics In halo 5, I really feel that they are only just approaching the strength precision weapons always had: the sheer versatility of precision weapons in the series has ALWAYS vastly outweighed the raw DPS and ease of use abilities automatics have in the ranges they are effective in (and, for the record, precision weapons have never taken that much more skill then autos either, and this is the primary reason why I don't think the autos in halo 5 are too strong outside of the AR rewarding spraying too much: it's piss easy to use the preicison guns outside of the magnum anyways):\n\nI suppose that this is a bias of mine, since there's no reason why automatics cannot be treated like the shotgun as niche weapons (and, indeed, I am fine with that being the case for the storm rifle and SMG, to a degree), but the sandbox DOES already have the shotgun and scattershot, so what purpose would it serve to have the automatics be the same thing? \n\nIt's only in Halo 5 that the autos are given a little more range to work with so that you can at least engage with them past a limited range, even if the precision weapons are still much better then them past close or close mid, and are strong enough to justify the precision weapons being so much more versatile.

Obviously, a purely rock paper sissors situation would be terrible, but I don&amp;#39;t think a &amp;quot;fox only final destination&amp;quot; style situation where everybody is using the exact same shit and the game settings and pickups are made so sterible just to justify it purely being a test of player skill under those specific conditions, because then it is just under those specific conditions, not the actual game itself. Like, shit, yeah, you can distill a game down to the most pure, barebones degree of exeuctional skill possible. but it ceases to be that game at that point. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make a rule that from now all,in all street fighter tournaments,players are only allowed to use 1 of 3 characters that take the most skill and certain specials and tech is banned and all that, but at that point you really aren&amp;#39;t even playing street fighter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, it&amp;#39;s just bad balance.

It's stupid in the first place that it's measured in a percentage instead of straight distance, but it's even stupider that the slider is apparently slightly bugged. \n\nIf you load the Slayer gametype and head to the radar settings, before you change anything the distance will read \"100%\".

This changes it to 56m. You then go \"Crap, something's wrong, I must have done the math wrong\" and lower it slightly to say, \"120%\". You test it in game and it reads (I think) 48m. At this point you're pretty confused. You give up and reset it to \"100%\" just to make sure it goes back to 18m when you do this, except *it doesn't*.\n\nApparently, \"100%\" on the slider is equal to 40m, but only AFTER you've changed it from the default. The \"100%\" it reads before you've changed it really means nothing. I could say it means \"default\", but I'm not sure if this bug is consistent in other gametypes that have radar ranges other than 18m as well.

If you changed it and want to set it back to 18m, well, you can't, because since \"100%\" = 40m, a 10% change is equivalent to a 4m change, and you can't subtract 4 from 40 any number of times to get exactly 18 (your closest choices are 20 or 16).\n\nThe bug needs to be fixed and the distance should be measured in meters instead of percent.\n\n**Edit**: In case you were also asking what \"Inner range\" means, the description for the setting reads \"change the motion sensor's inner, detailed radius to ...\".

I'm guessing the extension to the display was ~5m but I have no evidence, it's just a guess. I believe this feature carried over to Halo 5.

I do remember when I got the game and tested how many you needed to hit to die thinking that 4 was surprisingly low.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "halo", "name": "t1_dg997vz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492211712.0, "created_utc": 1492182912.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65904c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9jz2p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DankUsernameBro", "parent_id": "t1_dg96bgk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/halo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean the other 90+% of matchmaking has those garbage nades.
