Johnson back in the first part of the war. Back when we were losing. Or maybe Grey Team. I mean, I love Chief and all, but there's so much more to the halo universe than just what he was involved in. There are also so many untold stories, lives lost, planets glassed, entire human populations wiped out. The Halo franchise has unlimited untapped potential, and I feel like 343 has been performing below par in the story department lately. If they could get back to basics, back to the nitty-gritty, military feel that Halo once was, I feel like they could be back on top of the market once again. Halo has been about humanity. Our struggles. Our challenges. Our mortality. Our victories. In my opinion, Halo has somewhat gone astray from the human feel. And both Eric Nylund and Joseph Staten would be excellent candidates to bring that back.
