Typically, the software system will place data in some well-known and mutually agreed upon memory location(s), and &amp;quot;ring the doorbell&amp;quot; by writing to a different memory location. This different memory location is often called the doorbell region, and there may even be multiple doorbells serving different purposes in this region. It is this act of writing to the doorbell region of memory that &amp;quot;rings the bell&amp;quot; and notifies the hardware device that the data are ready and waiting. The hardware device would now know that the data are valid and can be acted upon. It would typically write the data to a hard disk drive, or send them over a network, or encrypt them, etc.\nThe term doorbell interrupt is usually a misnomer. It&amp;#39;s similar to an interrupt, because it causes some work to be done by the device; however, the doorbell region is sometimes implemented as a polled region, sometimes the doorbell region writes through to physical device registers, and sometimes the doorbell region is hardwired directly to physical device registers. When either writing through or directly to physical device registers, this may cause a real interrupt to occur at the device&amp;#39;s central processor unit (CPU), if it has one.\nDoorbell interrupts can be compared to Message Signaled Interrupts, as they have some similarities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is interesting.  Even more interesting because the line about the doorbell comes from Harry.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s a question that has new meaning if we consider &amp;quot;doorbell&amp;quot; in computing terms....WHY would Harry have &amp;quot;warned&amp;quot; the people standing in the hall about a broken doorbell, and HOW would he have warned them?  He supposedly just met these folks.  Harry&amp;#39;s follow-up line when the dinner guests are in his home is &amp;quot;Always nice to put a face with an employee badge number.&amp;quot;  Also a weird statement....why would Harry say that instead of the standard &amp;quot;putting a face with a name&amp;quot; bit, and why would Harry be looking at/referencing employee badge numbers?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Harry brings Gideon breakfast in bed in S1E9, it seems like a loving and logical gesture made by a partner.  We are later told/shown that Harry ended his marriage with Gideon, and we see on the FBI board that the divorce was completed less than 3 months after the breakfast scene, which was awfully fast.  Is it possible, then, that Harry was/is a pawn in the larger game being played on Mr. Robot, and was the breakfast in bed intended as a way to distract and delay Gideon and meet a certain time requirement?  Or is Harry one of the people running the game?\n  Who is Harry working for?
