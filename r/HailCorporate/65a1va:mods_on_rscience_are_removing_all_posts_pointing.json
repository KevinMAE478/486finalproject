Has absolutely nothing to do with the study, does not discuss the study, does not ask questions about it.  The connection is \"Thunderfoot has talked about water drawing tools before\".

As nothing he has done has anything to do with this study, it remains off topic, so, in accordance with our rules, it got nuked from orbit.\n\n/r/science has strict commenting rules in order to encourage quality discussion.
