Good work all round. :)\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with your post. Personally, though, I've ended up in some weird middle ground on this issue; on the one hand, I am supporting my family off my art (finally cleared $60K!), and I also have an arts degree.. but these two facts are pretty much unrelated. In fact, I'm pretty sure I would be doing better if I hadn't gone to University, because of the student loan. \n\nThis is because my degree was in audio production for film and theatre, not visual arts; but I've never really used those skills since. I tried getting into audio production for years, but it's a difficult but to crack; then I realised how much money I could make DJing, and just focused on that. (Which.. kind of counts, I guess?) On the other hand, I'd already sold over $2K worth of paintings by the time I finished high school, and continued to make money by selling canvases throughout Uni - and since that was my passion, I was happy spending hours in the library reading every art book I could find. \n\nWith disciplines that are almost entirely subjective - mostly fine arts - a lot of people shouldn't really need tuition from anyone to be able to produce quality work.
