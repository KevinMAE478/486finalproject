We get better deals this way and between us, there is always food in the house. Also it helps that I am a bloody good cook. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best advise I can give is to get a pressure cooker. I found mine at a local market. You can buy the toughest and cheapest cuts of meat and make amazing stews from it. 5 hours of cooking goes down to about an hour. For example, pork cheek is about $5 a kilo. Add some potatoes, onion and garlic, herbs and spices and some water or sauce (like soy) and let it cook down for about an hour and it&amp;#39;s a great meal on the cheap. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dgdh9sg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492464821.0, "created_utc": 1492436021.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nsty", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nsty", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nsty", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd03zy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guvbums", "parent_id": "t1_dgcefu5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;access a weeks worth of food up to three times a semester\n\nalso known as: spend food money on beer three times a semester... a pleasure for which I don't bemoan the poor buggers one bit.
