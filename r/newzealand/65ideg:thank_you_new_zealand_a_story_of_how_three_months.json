Left the US in January, and will be returning on Thursday(not staying for the whole visa).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In January of last year, I lost my brother to cancer after an 8 year battle. After losing him, I thought that I would never be able to have true happiness again. I thought that the joyous, adventurous, and fun loving person I was was forever gone. My world crumbled and I was a shell of my former self, and thought that I always would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months after, I knew I needed some sort of change in my life. I considered moving to a different state, somewhere where I could recharge and get a bit of a fresh start, but pushed the idea aside because I just didn&amp;#39;t have it in me. Another couple months down the road, I started considering it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I considered moving from the East coast to the West coast, because at this point I knew I needed something big. Something to shake up my world. Moving coast to coast seemed great, but it just didn&amp;#39;t feel like it would shake me to my core the way I needed to be shaken. I felt like it would just be same shit, different state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point a friend in Auckland who I had suggested I come to New Zealand. I had a &amp;quot;Haha that&amp;#39;d be fun&amp;quot; type reaction. That &amp;quot;Haha that&amp;#39;d be fun&amp;quot; turned into, &amp;quot;What could it hurt to look into this&amp;quot;, which turned into seriously considering it. Another couple months down the road and I was applying for my work holiday visa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to get a little scared as the date drew near. I had lived in the same city my whole life, minus while I was at college. But I knew I had to do something, and this was it. My brother was worldly and adventurous, and I knew he would be proud of me for putting in so much time and effort to try to shake up my world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue January, and I&amp;#39;m on a plane. It seemed surreal. I was going into a country where I knew all of one person, and would be starting totally fresh. It was a liberating feeling. A type I&amp;#39;d never had before in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After settling some, things started to take a wonderful turn. The feeling of being in such a wildly different place and starting from the ground up was amazing. I felt like I truly was able to make something beautiful out of this. I got a job in Auckland, traveled around the south island for two weeks, saw some beautiful stuff and met some phenomenal people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, here I am. After my time here, I learned what it&amp;#39;s like to feel happy and free again. That joy has returned, my sense of adventure is back. The happiness that I had lost had returned. I have now proven to myself that, even with one of the most important people in the world to me being gone, I still can have a good life. I still can have fun, even if he&amp;#39;s not here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to stay for the full year I was able to have on my visa. But there are many things back at home that I still treasure, such as family, friends I&amp;#39;ve known for years, and some other smaller things that add up. These were things that, prior to this, I thought I&amp;#39;d never be able to truly enjoy to the same degree. But my time in New Zealand gave me the tools it takes to enjoy life, which I feel like I can now apply to all aspects of my life, and truly be able to be a happy person again, for the first time in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be bittersweet to go home. I absolutely love New Zealand and it will always hold a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; special place in my heart. I truly had the time of my life here, and I believe it was the most important and significant thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I want to thank all of you Kiwis. Thank you for showing me that happiness still exists. Thank you for welcoming me with open arms.
