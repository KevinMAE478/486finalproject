Everything we do matters - this includes everything you don't do.\nI don't think I have ever had a real political discussion with anyone around my age group.

I think people are too busy or distracted to realize that the state of our reality is being shaped every second by our actions.\n\nMillennials i believe have the advantage of growing up in a world in which cultural norms are being rapidly redefined and where the ideas can spread via the internet like wildfire; and that it may be easier for a millennial to accept a 'left of field' concept or even be intentionally exposed ideas in the first place.  \n\nI'm playing devils advocate here. Who's to say we need to buy houses, or even rent a house from a landlord? I recognize the inherent need to have a roof over your head and have access to utilities and services but did anyone stop to think that the way we go about meeting this need is only one way to achieve it.  Did anyone stop to think whether individual ownership of car is necessary?  Did anyone think that the way our society runs is influenced by those who have a clear self serving agenda? In a free society, those in positions of power are held there only by the confidence of the individual; and i think we are living in a free country and that we collectively have far more power than we realize. The only think preventing this realization is the belief that the game is real and that we are all individual players, fighting each other in order to make it to the top. \n\n...And here's Tom with the weather!\n\n(Yes we really are distracted with weather at the moment.

It think this goes beyond the simple act of voting on election day. Everything we do matters - this includes everything you don&amp;#39;t do.\nI don&amp;#39;t think I have ever had a real political discussion with anyone around my age group. It&amp;#39;s just not something people want to even discuss. Politics goes way beyond the drama of politicians and it has it&amp;#39;s hands in almost every part of our lives. You could say that a person with no interest in politics whatsoever just doesn&amp;#39;t realize the implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people are tangled up in trying to manage or navigate their lives or career and in doing so they surrender a lot of personal decisions to others and are extremely prone to following the &amp;#39;narrative&amp;#39; or another person or group of people.  I think people are too busy or distracted to realize that the state of our reality is being shaped every second by our actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Millennials i believe have the advantage of growing up in a world in which cultural norms are being rapidly redefined and where the ideas can spread via the internet like wildfire; and that it may be easier for a millennial to accept a &amp;#39;left of field&amp;#39; concept or even be intentionally exposed ideas in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m playing devils advocate here. Who&amp;#39;s to say we need to buy houses, or even rent a house from a landlord? I recognize the inherent need to have a roof over your head and have access to utilities and services but did anyone stop to think that the way we go about meeting this need is only one way to achieve it.  Did anyone stop to think whether individual ownership of car is necessary?  Did anyone think that the way our society runs is influenced by those who have a clear self serving agenda? In a free society, those in positions of power are held there only by the confidence of the individual; and i think we are living in a free country and that we collectively have far more power than we realize. The only think preventing this realization is the belief that the game is real and that we are all individual players, fighting each other in order to make it to the top. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...And here&amp;#39;s Tom with the weather!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Yes we really are distracted with weather at the moment.
