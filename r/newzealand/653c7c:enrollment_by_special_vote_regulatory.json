This is a particular case of recent occurrence involving ministerial responsibility. As the member notes in her application, any application of impropriety relating to the conduct of public sector employees is a serious one. In light of the fundings of the report, the State Services Commission has referred the matter to the Serious Fraud Office to consider whether any of the activity is of a potentially criminal nature that requires further investigation. The matter is now with the Serious Fraud Office for investigation. The House is not prevented from debating matters that are under investigation, but it is not likely to assist the administration of justice to do so. While this matter may receive further attention from the House in the future, I do not consider it appropriate to set aside the business of the House today to debate a matter that has just become the subject of a criminal investigation and the application is therefore declined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The General Debate Was Held&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The general debate is held every week on Wednesday after Question Time.

This vote was marred by significant levels of voter intimidation, fraud and domination of the media by Vucic\u2019s Serbian Progressive Party. Large protests lead by students and the unions have garnered international attention but it remains to be seen whether the government will yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Armenia the new proportional voting system delivered a majority to the ruling Republican Party. On a turnout of 60% the RPA managed 49.17% of of the vote and 58 seats out of 105. The Organization for Security and Co Operation in Europe criticised the election by saying it had been tainted by vote-buying, and pressure on civil servants and employees of private companies.Transparency International, along with various other organizations confirmed cases of bribe distribution.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Elections&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea goes to the polls on May 9. This election was called early after the impeachment of Park Geun-hye. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park as acting president and decided not to run for his own term in office.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each party had its own internal procedure for selecting their candidate. The Democratic party had an open primary that saw more than two million people participate. The Liberty Korea Party (which was Park\u2019s former party and rebranded after the scandal) candidate was determined by a combination of opinion polls, conducted between March 30th to March 31st (50%), and the votes cast by the delegates at the party convention held in March 31st (50%). The Bareun Party candidate was determined by a combination of votes from an evaluation commission based on 4 debates, held in different region of the country (40%), votes from the party members (30%), and public opinion polls (30%).   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Voting is via First Past the Post in a single round of voting. Currently the Centre Left leaning Democratic Party, also known as the Minjoo Party, is leading with a margin of around 5% in polling. Moon Jae-in , who came second in the 2012 Presidential Election, seems favoured to win.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Policy wise he is in favor of repealing Korea&amp;#39;s national security laws, which has been accused by the Korean liberals as a tool of historically right-wing establishment of South Korea to restrict and oppress left-wing voices in Korean politics. He also promised to abolish the domestic wing of NIS (National Intelligence Service) in order to maintain their political neutrality, transferring domestic affairs to the police force. Moon also promised transparency on his presidency, moving the president residence from palatial and isolated Blue House to Gwanghwamun in downtown Seoul.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moon\u2019s main competition is Ahn Cheol-soo from the centrist People\u2019s Party. Ahn has stated that he considers Franklin D. Roosevelt to be a role model, and has referred to himself as the Bernie Sanders of Korea. He supports an increased capital gains tax, higher public welfare spending, and a cautious approach to free trade agreements.Ahn has also made appeals to conservatives, however, and has associated the People&amp;#39;s Party with &amp;quot;reformative&amp;quot; currents of Korean conservatism.In September 2012, Ahn visited the graves of Syngman Rhee, Park Chung-hee, and Kim Dae-jung. Park Chung-hee and Syngman Rhee are often praised by Korean conservatives, and Kim Dae-jung by liberals. Ahn stated at the time that it would be &amp;quot;hypocritical to paint half the people as enemies and at the same time call for &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Liberty Korea Party has dropped from 45% in polls this time last year to 8% since the scandal.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The president must be a South Korean citizen, at least 40 years old and has lived in South Korea for 5 years. Constitutionally the president serves for a five year term and is prohibited from seeking re election.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Turkey the campaign on the controversial constitutional amendments to grant the President more power concludes with a vote on April 16.  In total there are 18 amendments being voted on including a vote to raise the number of seats in Parliament, changing the parliamentary term to five years, having presidential and parliamentary elections at the same time every five years, making the president head of state and government and granting the president the power to make states.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elections in Turkey are known for fraud and corruption and with significant power at stake it is not surprising that both sides have been actively flouting election law. The police have been criticised for suppressing no voting protests and rallies aswell as arresting campaigners on charges such as \u2018insulting the president\u2019 or \u2018inciting hatred\u2019.&lt;br/&gt;\nCurrent polling is leaning towards the no vote but it remains close.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 23rd of April France holds the first round of its presidential election. 11 candidates from across the political spectrum are standing. The President of the French Republic is elected to a five-year term in a two-round election under Article 7 of the Constitution: if no candidate secures an absolute majority (i.e. including blank and void ballots) of votes in the first round, a second round is held two weeks later between the two candidates who received the most votes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently no candidate is polling higher than 28% making a run off inevitable. The two contenders favoured to enter the runoff are known eurosceptic and National Front candidate Marine Le Pen and En Marche! Candidate Emmanuel Macron.  In a straight two party contest it is thought Macron could win by a margin as great as 20%. However, Le Pen is banking on the shy voter effect and points to Brexit and Trump as reasons why the polls shouldn\u2019t be believed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact of the Day \u2013 Ada Wells&lt;/strong&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ada Wells worked tirelessly to achieve equality and economic independence for women. She is best remembered for her contribution to the women\u2019s suffrage campaign in the 1880s and \u201990s, and for becoming the first woman elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1917.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ada Wells (n\u00e9e Pike) was born in England in April 1863 and came to New Zealand with her parents at the age of 10. She was educated at Avonside School from 1874 and Christchurch West School from 1876. Between 1877 and 1881 she was employed at the latter school as a student teacher. In 1881 she won a university junior scholarship and attended Canterbury College, passing the first part of her BA in 1882. She was then briefly employed as an assistant teacher at Christchurch Girls\u2019 High School.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In January 1884 she married Harry Wells, an organist, with whom she would have four children. Her husband\u2019s \u2018volatile temper and continual drinking\u2019 often saw her forced to financially support the family by taking on teaching positions and private patients for massage and healing. This marital experience has been credited with strengthening her views on the importance of equality and economic independence for women.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wells became active in the women\u2019s suffrage campaign in the 1880s, a period during which \u2018the movement was generally condemned and ridiculed\u2019. While Kate Sheppard led the campaign, Wells made an invaluable contribution as a \u2018fervent, efficient organiser and campaigner\u2019. In 1892 she was involved in the foundation of the Canterbury Women\u2019s Institute (CWI). The CWI spearheaded the suffrage campaign in Canterbury, in a similar manner to the Women\u2019s Franchise Leagues formed in other parts of the country.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After women were granted the vote on 19 September 1893, Wells did not retire from public life. The CWI had always been \u2018forward looking\u2019, advocating a broader platform of women\u2019s rights beyond suffrage. Wells continued to serve the organisation as president, secretary or committee member until its demise in 1921. She was also involved in the foundation of the NCW on 13 April 1896, and was appointed as its first secretary.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1899 she won public office, becoming one of the first two women to be elected to the Ashburton and North Canterbury United Charitable Aid Board. She bettered this in 1917 when she was the first woman elected to the Christchurch City Council. By the time of her death in March 1933, Wells was acknowledged as one of New Zealand\u2019s foremost public women.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Previous Facts of the Day:&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3osc7e/restoration_of_democracy_to_university_councils/\"&gt;Speaker&amp;#39;s flat&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3sgtry/supermarket_code_of_conduct_protection_of_new/\"&gt;Urgency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3v7irx/prohibition_of_imports_made_by_slave_labour/\"&gt;Jernigham Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/48osky/mr_speaker_i_move_the_first_members_day_update_of/\"&gt;Sidney Holland and the Suicide Squad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4an80j/members_day_update_second_reading/\"&gt;1951 the last majority election&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4dojs8/abolition_of_charter_schools_drawn_from_the/\"&gt;The Business Committee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4hxfiq/retirement_village_residents_rates_rebates_drawn/\"&gt;New Zealand&amp;#39;s First Parliament in Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4l2mwy/andrew_littles_our_work_our_future_bill_drawn/\"&gt;1947 Greymouth beer boycott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4n4xja/members_day_update_the_veto_looms/\"&gt;So goes Hamilton so goes the nation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4qf4d2/members_day_update_vetoed/\"&gt;Australia and Compulsory Voting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4x59s6/foreign_ownership_of_land_register_safe_and/\"&gt;Housing the Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;,   &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4zfon6/companies_amendment_bill_drawn_from_ballot/\"&gt;Mabel Howard \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s First Female Cabinet Minsiter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/53w98x/private_international_law_choice_of_law_in_tort/\"&gt;Early Elections in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/58gaa4/members_day_update_19_october/\"&gt;New Zealand\u2019s First State House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5c4gqo/changing_media_interim_restriction_order/\"&gt;New Zealand&amp;#39;s Day with LBJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5fszrf/domestic_violence_victims_protection_affordable/\"&gt;The Great Strike of 1913&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5h3bca/allowing_higher_earners_to_contract_out_of/\"&gt;What Happens When The Prime Minister Resigns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5ybejj/teachers_code_of_ethics_arbitration_amendment_and/\"&gt;Premier Julius Vogel and the Railways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/60zj06/ombudsman_cost_recovery_equal_pay_through/\"&gt;New Zealand in Samoa&lt;/a&gt;

This is a particular case of recent occurrence involving ministerial responsibility. As the member notes in her application, any application of impropriety relating to the conduct of public sector employees is a serious one. In light of the fundings of the report, the State Services Commission has referred the matter to the Serious Fraud Office to consider whether any of the activity is of a potentially criminal nature that requires further investigation. The matter is now with the Serious Fraud Office for investigation. The House is not prevented from debating matters that are under investigation, but it is not likely to assist the administration of justice to do so. While this matter may receive further attention from the House in the future, I do not consider it appropriate to set aside the business of the House today to debate a matter that has just become the subject of a criminal investigation and the application is therefore declined.\n   \n  \n**The General Debate Was Held**  \n  \n  The general debate is held every week on Wednesday after Question Time.

This vote was marred by significant levels of voter intimidation, fraud and domination of the media by Vucic\u2019s Serbian Progressive Party. Large protests lead by students and the unions have garnered international attention but it remains to be seen whether the government will yield.\n  \n* In Armenia the new proportional voting system delivered a majority to the ruling Republican Party. On a turnout of 60% the RPA managed 49.17% of of the vote and 58 seats out of 105. The Organization for Security and Co Operation in Europe criticised the election by saying it had been tainted by vote-buying, and pressure on civil servants and employees of private companies.Transparency International, along with various other organizations confirmed cases of bribe distribution.  \n    \n**Upcoming Elections**  \n      \n*    South Korea goes to the polls on May 9. This election was called early after the impeachment of Park Geun-hye. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park as acting president and decided not to run for his own term in office.  \n   \n  Each party had its own internal procedure for selecting their candidate. The Democratic party had an open primary that saw more than two million people participate. The Liberty Korea Party (which was Park\u2019s former party and rebranded after the scandal) candidate was determined by a combination of opinion polls, conducted between March 30th to March 31st (50%), and the votes cast by the delegates at the party convention held in March 31st (50%). The Bareun Party candidate was determined by a combination of votes from an evaluation commission based on 4 debates, held in different region of the country (40%), votes from the party members (30%), and public opinion polls (30%).   \n  \n  Voting is via First Past the Post in a single round of voting. Currently the Centre Left leaning Democratic Party, also known as the Minjoo Party, is leading with a margin of around 5% in polling. Moon Jae-in , who came second in the 2012 Presidential Election, seems favoured to win.  \n    \n  Policy wise he is in favor of repealing Korea's national security laws, which has been accused by the Korean liberals as a tool of historically right-wing establishment of South Korea to restrict and oppress left-wing voices in Korean politics. He also promised to abolish the domestic wing of NIS (National Intelligence Service) in order to maintain their political neutrality, transferring domestic affairs to the police force. Moon also promised transparency on his presidency, moving the president residence from palatial and isolated Blue House to Gwanghwamun in downtown Seoul.   \n  \n  Moon\u2019s main competition is Ahn Cheol-soo from the centrist People\u2019s Party. Ahn has stated that he considers Franklin D. Roosevelt to be a role model, and has referred to himself as the Bernie Sanders of Korea. He supports an increased capital gains tax, higher public welfare spending, and a cautious approach to free trade agreements.Ahn has also made appeals to conservatives, however, and has associated the People's Party with \"reformative\" currents of Korean conservatism.In September 2012, Ahn visited the graves of Syngman Rhee, Park Chung-hee, and Kim Dae-jung. Park Chung-hee and Syngman Rhee are often praised by Korean conservatives, and Kim Dae-jung by liberals. Ahn stated at the time that it would be \"hypocritical to paint half the people as enemies and at the same time call for 'unity'\".  \n  \n  The Liberty Korea Party has dropped from 45% in polls this time last year to 8% since the scandal.   \n   \n  The president must be a South Korean citizen, at least 40 years old and has lived in South Korea for 5 years. Constitutionally the president serves for a five year term and is prohibited from seeking re election.   \n  \n*   In Turkey the campaign on the controversial constitutional amendments to grant the President more power concludes with a vote on April 16.  In total there are 18 amendments being voted on including a vote to raise the number of seats in Parliament, changing the parliamentary term to five years, having presidential and parliamentary elections at the same time every five years, making the president head of state and government and granting the president the power to make states.  \n  \n  Elections in Turkey are known for fraud and corruption and with significant power at stake it is not surprising that both sides have been actively flouting election law. The police have been criticised for suppressing no voting protests and rallies aswell as arresting campaigners on charges such as \u2018insulting the president\u2019 or \u2018inciting hatred\u2019.  \n   Current polling is leaning towards the no vote but it remains close.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n* On the 23rd of April France holds the first round of its presidential election. 11 candidates from across the political spectrum are standing. The President of the French Republic is elected to a five-year term in a two-round election under Article 7 of the Constitution: if no candidate secures an absolute majority (i.e. including blank and void ballots) of votes in the first round, a second round is held two weeks later between the two candidates who received the most votes.  \n  \n  Currently no candidate is polling higher than 28% making a run off inevitable. The two contenders favoured to enter the runoff are known eurosceptic and National Front candidate Marine Le Pen and En Marche! Candidate Emmanuel Macron.  In a straight two party contest it is thought Macron could win by a margin as great as 20%. However, Le Pen is banking on the shy voter effect and points to Brexit and Trump as reasons why the polls shouldn\u2019t be believed. \n     \n\n    \n-------  \n  \n**Fact of the Day \u2013 Ada Wells**      \n     \nAda Wells worked tirelessly to achieve equality and economic independence for women. She is best remembered for her contribution to the women\u2019s suffrage campaign in the 1880s and \u201990s, and for becoming the first woman elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1917.  \n  \n  Ada Wells (n\u00e9e Pike) was born in England in April 1863 and came to New Zealand with her parents at the age of 10. She was educated at Avonside School from 1874 and Christchurch West School from 1876. Between 1877 and 1881 she was employed at the latter school as a student teacher. In 1881 she won a university junior scholarship and attended Canterbury College, passing the first part of her BA in 1882. She was then briefly employed as an assistant teacher at Christchurch Girls\u2019 High School.  \n  \n  In January 1884 she married Harry Wells, an organist, with whom she would have four children. Her husband\u2019s \u2018volatile temper and continual drinking\u2019 often saw her forced to financially support the family by taking on teaching positions and private patients for massage and healing. This marital experience has been credited with strengthening her views on the importance of equality and economic independence for women.  \n  \n  Wells became active in the women\u2019s suffrage campaign in the 1880s, a period during which \u2018the movement was generally condemned and ridiculed\u2019. While Kate Sheppard led the campaign, Wells made an invaluable contribution as a \u2018fervent, efficient organiser and campaigner\u2019. In 1892 she was involved in the foundation of the Canterbury Women\u2019s Institute (CWI). The CWI spearheaded the suffrage campaign in Canterbury, in a similar manner to the Women\u2019s Franchise Leagues formed in other parts of the country.  \n  \n  After women were granted the vote on 19 September 1893, Wells did not retire from public life. The CWI had always been \u2018forward looking\u2019, advocating a broader platform of women\u2019s rights beyond suffrage. Wells continued to serve the organisation as president, secretary or committee member until its demise in 1921. She was also involved in the foundation of the NCW on 13 April 1896, and was appointed as its first secretary.  \n  \n  In 1899 she won public office, becoming one of the first two women to be elected to the Ashburton and North Canterbury United Charitable Aid Board. She bettered this in 1917 when she was the first woman elected to the Christchurch City Council.
