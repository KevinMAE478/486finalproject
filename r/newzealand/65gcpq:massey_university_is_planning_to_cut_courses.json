Of the 697 course offerings aligned with the College of Sciences in 2016, 368 course offerings fell below this benchmark, and 105 of these had no enrolments at all.&amp;quot; 368 courses got less than 20 students, and 105 had no students at all. Do you understand how expensive those courses are to set up and run? If they can&amp;#39;t get 20 students to enrol - or even a single student in some cases - they should be cut. Trimming out the fat of empty courses streamlines a degree and reallocates resources to where they&amp;#39;re actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dgakw21", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492287042.0, "created_utc": 1492258242.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgako03", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pebblezcrwd", "parent_id": "t1_dgacow0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As mentioned in a reply above, they are making money, they just want to cut costs to earn more money ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in a reply above, they are making money, they just want to cut costs to earn more money &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dgako03", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492286483.0, "created_utc": 1492257683.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgacow0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thecosmicradiation", "parent_id": "t3_65gcpq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah sorry but... this happens all the time.
