This isn&amp;#39;t evidence of some conspiracy, it&amp;#39;s how culture develops. Remember that explicit statement in my last post about how Christmas today is still celebrated on December 25th, but has many new traditions that didn&amp;#39;t exist in the past? Remember how the last point of my post was that the evolution of Easter in England and Northern Germany is actually an interesting process that can help us better understand the world? Well this is one of the things it can help us better understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, what the fuck does this have to do with whether or not Easter has precedence within Abrahamic theology, or was stolen form Pagans to force conversion? You&amp;#39;re literally bringing up something, at best, tangentially related, because somebody told another atheist they were wrong and you can&amp;#39;t handle that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m not a Christian. Why do atheists such as yourself automatically assume anybody capable of criticizing your bullshit half understanding of religion must be religious?

Passover is a Jewish holiday celebrating the release of Jewish people from slavery in Egypt. It was celebrated, during the time of the Jerusalem Temple to coincide with the first harvest of Barley, the first grain ready for harvest in Spring in Israel. In the biblical story of Passover, in order to free the Israelites from the Egyptians, God delivered ten plagues on the people of Egypt, the last was the death of the first born son of every Egyptian. The Israelites were instructed to smear the blood of a freshly sacrificed lamb over the doors of the homes, and their babies would be saved.\n\nHow does this relate to Christianity Well, Passover and Easter are at the same time (although Passover goes for longer). This year Passover runs from the 10th of April until the 18th of April, while Easter Holy Week runs from the 9th of April until the 15th of April, with Easter occurring on the 16th of April. But coincidental dates and names are not the only relationship between these two festivals.\n\nGood Friday commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus, and Easter is the commemoration of his resurrection. Jesus is sometimes referred to as the Lamb of God, this is because Jesus sacrificed himself, so as to spare the souls of the rest of humanity. Jesus, in allowing himself to be crucified, allowed himself to be sacrificed, like the lambs of Passover, so that humanity could be saved/spared. So, the myth of Easter and the ideological precedence for it was well-established within the tradition of Abrahamic religions long before Christianity ever arrived in England.\n\nWhat annoys me most about your comment is not that it is factually wrong. In order for you to believe what you do, you have to totally remove Christianity from its historic context, you have to take on a totally anglocentric view, not only ignoring Christianity's origins in the Middle East, and its development and formalization in the Mediterranean, but also its history everywhere in Europe except the modern day United Kingdom and north Germany. You've clearly made no attempt to understand Christianity from the perspective of Christians.\n\nWhat you have instead done, is construct a belief totally divorced from any historic, linguistic, or sociological context in order to exercise a sense of superiority. What you are doing is the most insidious sort of historic analysis. One that is more interested in half truths that make other people look bad, than is interested in understanding the world.\n\nThe thing is, the development of Easter in England is an interesting event in history. Pagans and Christians both had spring celebrations to commemorate the first harvest, and when Christianity arrived in some Pagan areas they kept the names of their old holidays while adopting new traditions. This analysis can help us understand the way we still refer to December 25th as Christmas, even though we celebrate it very differently to the way it was historically celebrated. Like Easter, the name has remained, but the traditions have changed. This is an interesting facet of human society and I'm sure has many other examples across the globe.\n\nYou should feel bad for your comment.
