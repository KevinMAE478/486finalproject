A capital gains tax and taxes on dividends and coporate profits result in double-counting for tax purposes -- you hold a stock in XYZ Corp which is worth $100 per share. XYZ makes a profit of $100 per share, so it (ie, you) gets taxed at 28% and your shares are worth $172.

It does make for some problems, though. For one, it means if house prices have gone up, you can't swap for another house of equal value. Once you sell you pay a tax, and you suddenly have to downsize. (Or, more likely, retirees looking to downsize to take some cash out don't end up getting any cash out.) That causes even more friction in a housing market that already has problems with old fogies taking up too much space :-).\n\nNow, what's the real reason for wanting to tax capital gains anyway? Obviously it's not to raise revenue because the budget is in surplus. The charitable interpretation is that a CGT would be intended to make housing more affordable by damping speculation. (The uncharitable interpretation is that it would help to make rich people less rich.)\n\nSpeculation drives up purchase prices, but if those houses are rented out it drives *down* the price of rent. If they're not rented out then we should increase rates, if they are then the high cost of housing is caused somewhere else, and should be addressed somewhere else.\n\nAnd that somewhere else is obviously supply and demand. Argue for less immigration if that's your thing. It's not mine. Argue for more building, reduced restrictions on intensification if that's your thing.

XYZ makes a profit of $100 per share, so it (ie, you) gets taxed at 28% and your shares are worth $172. In NZ that&amp;#39;s the end of it, but in your suggested world if you sold your share you&amp;#39;d also get taxed another 30-odd percent on the gains, ending up with roughly $150 -- that&amp;#39;s a total tax take of about 50%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this reason (among others) economists tend to say, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t levy a corporate tax, just tax capital gains and dividends.&amp;quot; NZ has taken the opposite tack, and ended up with a relatively sane taxation scheme compared to other countries who tax everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, private houses are a different story, obviously -- they don&amp;#39;t make profits, so there&amp;#39;s no worry about double-taxation. It does make for some problems, though. For one, it means if house prices have gone up, you can&amp;#39;t swap for another house of equal value. Once you sell you pay a tax, and you suddenly have to downsize. (Or, more likely, retirees looking to downsize to take some cash out don&amp;#39;t end up getting any cash out.) That causes even more friction in a housing market that already has problems with old fogies taking up too much space :-).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s the real reason for wanting to tax capital gains anyway? Obviously it&amp;#39;s not to raise revenue because the budget is in surplus. The charitable interpretation is that a CGT would be intended to make housing more affordable by damping speculation. (The uncharitable interpretation is that it would help to make rich people less rich.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speculation drives up purchase prices, but if those houses are rented out it drives &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; the price of rent. If they&amp;#39;re not rented out then we should increase rates, if they are then the high cost of housing is caused somewhere else, and should be addressed somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that somewhere else is obviously supply and demand. Argue for less immigration if that&amp;#39;s your thing. It&amp;#39;s not mine. Argue for more building, reduced restrictions on intensification if that&amp;#39;s your thing. But a CGT to match income and corporate tax is a false symmetry, a &amp;quot;foolish consistency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dgdj0es", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467394.0, "created_utc": 1492438594.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd22yl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "qwerty145454", "parent_id": "t1_dgcwu19", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If the situations are comparable at all, ours is much worse than the United States, as we have no CGT at all. \n\nIn the states people structure their income as capital gains to take advantage of a lower tax rate, in New Zealand people structure their income as capital gains to take advantage of literally no tax at all.\n\nThe simplest solution by far is to have a capital gains tax and peg it to the corporate rate, the highest PAYE rate and the trust rate.
