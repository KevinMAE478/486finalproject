Yes, we could drop our standard of living somewhat to put money aside and stop claiming the maximum, but we made this decision knowing that; a) I&amp;#39;m all-but guaranteed a job at the end of my degree, b) working part-time is less likely to impact my studies than living spartan would, and c) the loan is likely to remain interest-free under either Labour or National.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I &amp;quot;whinge about costs&amp;quot; even while living more comfortably than some of peers is because better student support would mean I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to choose between working part-time or living in self-imposed austerity, so I could dedicate more time and effort towards actually doing well in my degree, graduating and contributing to the society that subsidised and loaned my money for my education. If the Government is covering the costs of students attending tertiary education, does it not make sense that they should aim to get the highest return on their investment possible? A student that is well financially supported throughout their education is going to come out the other side better educated, with a better outlook and a greater likelihood that they will feel obligated to return their debt to society rather than legging it out of the country at the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dg6s0dq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492069422.0, "created_utc": 1492040622.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg67ip3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fickandfullofshit", "parent_id": "t1_dg5qax9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How is that possible?
