Because the caring industry is predominately woman this meant that the wages were initially set lower than their male counterparts. This has continued to be the case over the years and so now we have this discrepancy.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Job=Caregiver/Hourly_Rate\"&gt;http://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Job=Caregiver/Hourly_Rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take an example, IHC. It was established in 1949 to provide care for people with disabilities in the community. At this time woman were regarded as &amp;#39;secondary workers&amp;#39; and so were not paid equal amounts. &lt;a href=\"http://www.striking-women.org/module/women-and-work/post-world-war-ii-1946-1970#The%20Growth%20of%20the%20Women&amp;#x27;s%20Work%20Movement\"&gt;http://www.striking-women.org/module/women-and-work/post-world-war-ii-1946-1970#The%20Growth%20of%20the%20Women&amp;#39;s%20Work%20Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From here the system has just grown around it, but these professions are still paid as &amp;#39;Secondary workers&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real questions comes down to do you want to pay the person who looks after the vulnerable minimum wages? Do you think that the job caregivers do is low skill? This is not market driven as the wages are set by the funding given from the government. We have a public system of support for vulnerable people.
