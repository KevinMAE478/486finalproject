KFC is in my opinion a better place. Saw 2 of the 4 shift managers sleeping on the job regularly, and another stealing money from the cancer box to pay for a taxi home when it rained. Left because uni, as well as being made to work double shifts 3 days in a row meaning I only got 3 hours sleep a night because of other commitments. The north shore in Auckland has had about 10 managers resign so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dg9vr7g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492238807.0, "created_utc": 1492210007.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bs6s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2r5k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fansworth", "parent_id": "t1_dg9uf61", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "nah man, in Auckland at least, BK is really bad, all 3 of their CBD stores are always dirty with sticky floors, fulled with homeless stealing the free drinks and rarely air-conditioned.\n\nthe KFC's how ever are much better maintained.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;nah man, in Auckland at least, BK is really bad, all 3 of their CBD stores are always dirty with sticky floors, fulled with homeless stealing the free drinks and rarely air-conditioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the KFC&amp;#39;s how ever are much better maintained.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dga2r5k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492248166.0, "created_utc": 1492219366.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bs6s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagx3r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rerouteremain", "parent_id": "t1_dg9uf61", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fair call!
