Considering that they have\nbeen looking at a large number of factors (sex, socioeconomic status,\nbreastfeeding, and birth weight (as well as educational attainment for\nadult IQ outcomes) this should be a pretty large sample, but was it? I don&amp;#39;t have access to the article but \nshe doesn&amp;#39;t mention this crucial information either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Their peer reviewed conclusion specifically states that: &amp;quot; These\nfindings do not support the assertion that fluoride in the context\nof community water fluoridation programs is neurotoxic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very weak conclusion really. Replace the dots in &amp;quot;These findings\ndo not support the assertion that ...&amp;quot; with just about anything and\nyou&amp;#39;ll still be correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Professional scientific researchers follow a scientific method which\nallows them to explain occurrences using a logical, consistent,\nsystematic method of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming that she knows the technical meaning of &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot;, there is no\nlogic in science. Logic is only used in axiomatic methods (geometry,\nabstract maths, ...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, science doesn\u2019t work that way.  We scientists don\u2019t\nbecome embarrassed if we are found wrong \u2013 we love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not quite true. Scientists can develop personal interest and\nliking in some (particularly their own) theories. As they can feel\nproud of their findings, they can mildly feel bad if they are proved\nwrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The theory is then subjected to critique by other experts in the\nfield and only if approved by them is it allowed to be published in\na peer reviewed journal for others to read and learn from. We can be\nwrong for sure, but it\u2019s very difficult to publish wrong data\nwithout it being picked up. It\u2019s almost impossible for hundreds of\nscientists to publish the same wrong data \u2013 it\u2019s actually our job as\npeer reviewers of other people\u2019s science to pick holes in research,\ntrying to prove that it is wrong before allowing it to be published.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the catch though. In these types of science (as opposed to say physics) often the (raw) data\ncannot be released to the reviewers due to privacy reasons (and usually as one of\nthe conditions in the ethics approval of the research). So if there has\nbeen any error in processing the data or the statistical inferences,\nthe reviewers are not able to pick it up. Although even if the data\nwas released, the reviewers do not have much interest to do such things as\nthey are not paid for these tasks and they prefer to publish something of their own and get\ncredit for it rather than checking someone else&amp;#39;s work. This is very\nunfortunate indeed and it&amp;#39;s partly because of the way universities and\ngovernments measure researchers&amp;#39; contributions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By way of comparison Current Science has an impact factor of 0.83.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is right that the linked blog post refers to a dodgy-looking\narticle/journal but resorting to &amp;quot;impact factors&amp;quot; to make a point is\nplain &amp;quot;unscientific&amp;quot;. Since impact factors became a measure of\ncredibility (or impact) of journals for some people, they have been\nhighly manipulated. Chief editors of journals do all sorts of fuckery\nto inflate these measures to show how good their journal is (or rather how successful they&amp;#39;ve been.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The decision on fluoride consumption should be left to\nindividuals.
