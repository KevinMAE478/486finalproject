Later the Turks advanced with fixed bayonets to within two hundred yards of our line, but heavy cross-fire broke the attack, the Turks retiring to a position five hundred yards from the New Zealanders, where they maintained a vigorous machine-gun and rifle fire till dusk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dg6p9a4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492066018.0, "created_utc": 1492037218.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wstr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg71tho", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PM_4_DATING_ADVICE", "parent_id": "t1_dg5max9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "RemindMe! 7 days", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;RemindMe! 7 days&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "newzealand", "name": "t1_dg71tho", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492081608.0, "created_utc": 1492052808.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5max9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "czmhdk", "parent_id": "t3_64wstr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/newzealand", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Here is some more information about the camera and who owned it.\nOn the leather case were engravings that said\n\n* 11/2309\n* R.
