If your 76 cant shoot stationary targets in your grav without his ultimate, you have big problems. Grav and earthshatter kind of do the same thing, so using them both is a bit of a waste. Genji can usually chain dashes through your grav just as effectively without ult. Winston does just as much dmg with his ticklecannon as his ult, so theres no reason to use primal rage in grav.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgdkoz3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469626.0, "created_utc": 1492440826.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65umh9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdillo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TauNeutrinoOW", "parent_id": "t3_65umh9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Building energy is important.
