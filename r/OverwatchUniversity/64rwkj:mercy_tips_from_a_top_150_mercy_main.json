Having placed almost only mercy since season 1 I have a crazy amount of hours on her, so I thought I&amp;#39;d write a guide from my perspective on how to improve as a mercy player. If nobody reads, totally cool! I shall enjoy writing the post nonetheless :) There will be what I feel are more advanced points, and simple points, but if you take it all together it should help whatever rank you&amp;#39;re at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Experience - this season - 4.5k cr&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://postimg.cc/image/sn80k9rz1/\"&gt;https://postimg.cc/image/sn80k9rz1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://postimg.cc/image/62ulhd5st/?_ga=1.265709391.1762047757.1491336298\"&gt;https://postimg.cc/image/62ulhd5st/?_ga=1.265709391.1762047757.1491336298&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have 2nd account in the top 500, and 3rd that is 30 off it as of right now. All of them mercy only, with just a little lucio sometimes. Account names - prodz Play only on European servers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little things&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Work with your ana - If you have your ult ready, and there is just splash poke damage, check if your ana has her ult. If not, don&amp;#39;t heal splash damage but let your ana build her ult. You have your ult ready and you healing poke damage is wasting potential for ana to build her ult. At the same time, if you&amp;#39;re on voice and you notice ana with ult, and you without, ask her to let you just heal up the tanks a bit so you can build your ult quicker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When roadhogs hit a hook, instantly damage buff - just helps to finish off the kill with more certainty. As the gate opens, damage buff your reinhardts fire strike so he gains ult quicker. Then when he gets ready for his 2nd firestrike damage buff that one too. Or if not your rein then your zarya/pharah/symetra. Anything to get your teammates ults going quicker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always be aware what setup the opposing team is running as it&amp;#39;s going to determine how aggressive or passive we choose to play. No dive comp? Then we can stay further in with our team more agressively. They have a winston and a genji? Maybe we need to take high ground with soldier in the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more confident and experienced you are as a mercy the more aggressive you can play, as you know it won&amp;#39;t risk you dying with your ult. The less experienced you are as a mercy you should play less aggressively with more emphasis on living and getting a good revive off, taking less risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a widowmaker - look after her :) With damage buff widows are insane, and they will need your support when constantly harassed. They are also good for escaping to high ground when you&amp;#39;re in trouble, so I suggest to stay in there range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Positioning &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally I like to stay with the main damage dealer with damage buff and let ana do the main healing. Always in the back of your mind be aware that the opposing team know you have revive, and so want to get you in an ult to prevent this. So you&amp;#39;re keeping a safe distance away from your own team, at all times. It&amp;#39;s almost your highest priority to get your revive off, so if anybody moves out of position (thankfully this is less at the high ranks) it is not your job to risk your life to protect them. Maybe ana can shoot some heals, but we will not be risking our position to save someone in a bad spot, as nothing is more important than getting our revive off. You value your life more than anyone elses on the team while you have ult ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So keep the beam as far away from the player as you can. As they move forward, you move forward. As they move back, you move back. This way you&amp;#39;re reducing the risk of being caught in an enemy rein or zarya ult by keeping maximum distance from your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Damage buff&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is so crucial. I personally don&amp;#39;t think mercy&amp;#39;s are damage buffing enough. Generally we&amp;#39;re going to have an ana on our team who will be main healing, so I tend to stay with our main dps and give them crazy amounts of damage buff. You should be getting at least 20 offensive assists a game if it&amp;#39;s an average length. Stick with your soldier/pharah/mcree with damage buff. We will do poke healing when needed, but we want to be helping our main dps get picks - ana is the main healer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we have a pharah we&amp;#39;re going to stay almost exclusively with her with damage buff, while popping down occasionally to help with a teammate who is low. We&amp;#39;re not the main healer, ana is. We don&amp;#39;t want to be healing up a tanks full health bar, ana can deal with this, so if a tank drops very very low, we will top up to around 40-50% then return to damage buffing pharah. But if a 200 hp teammate is low we can top them to full then return to damage buffing pharah or soldier. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, sometimes we&amp;#39;re going to need to do insane amounts of healing, and we will. But if ana is handling it fine, and especially if we have our ult, we just want to be exclusively damage buffing our core dps, from a safe spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime you notice soldier has ulted, unless its an emergency I will generally stop everything and pocket him. Make sure he gets value from it and doesnt have to shy away. Moment you hear it, instant damage buff and keep him topped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being aware of your team, and enemy teams ults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just have it in your mind. When did their genji last use ult? We don&amp;#39;t want to be hiding with our res when there is no need for us to be, because enemy team has no ult that can scare us. If genji has his ult ready, and we can see they are ready for a push with it, we want to be trying to hide and find a safe spot to get a our res. But lets say we notice genji whiffed his ult 30 seconds ago and we see them coming. Maybe this time we don&amp;#39;t need to hide, but with some caution we push further out and maybe join our soldier with damage buff. Then a minute later we feel he might have his ult this time, and they are about to push, we fall back into a safer hide spot as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get the res is so important, so so important. But we also can&amp;#39;t just sit and hide the whole game. By being aware of when the offense players on enemy team used their ults, we can know when its safe to push out and help our team, and when to fall back and hide to get a res, all the time being reasonably safe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#39;re going in for a push, and we don&amp;#39;t have revive ready, check what ults your teammates have. If zarya and genjii have ults, but everyone on your team is dropping, this way we know who to prioritise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to revive one person! I love the big res&amp;#39;s, we all do! But its okay to revive one person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario - you&amp;#39;re on gibraltar 1st point attack, 20 seconds to go, and your genjii is picked off, and you have 2 people half way there way from spawn. Do we revive him? Who on our team has ult? Does genji have ult? We look and and only we and genji have ult. Do we revive him? Its a no brainer that we do, there is no way we can get this point with 20 seconds left without the genji ult. Here its a good idea to solo res. But make sure when you revive it&amp;#39;s for a reason as we don&amp;#39;t want to be wasteful with our ult. Sometimes a 1 man revive is enough to keep the momentum going to keep pushing forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario - you have the point on koth 40%-0 and its a bit of a brawl and you are 2-3 down on players in the fight. Winston has died, but he has ult. Maybe we can revive him here not only as a chance to hold the point by defeating them, but if 2 of us die winston has his ult to stall the point for a good 10-15% more. Maybe it&amp;#39;s a worthwhile trade. The point is just to be aware of why you&amp;#39;re reviving someone and that it&amp;#39;s more than okay to revive one teammate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hiding for res &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we now know to be aware of when to hide for res and when not to hide for res as we are keeping an eye on enemy teams dps ults. Hide early, and don&amp;#39;t use your beam to reveal position. They are looking for you! Don&amp;#39;t give them anything. If you poke heal you may as well not hide in the first place as you have instantly revealed where you are. Without revealing your spot, try to have a player in range to leap to if you are seen. This way you may have a shot at surviving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If people die scattered, so you can only get 2 people, but the whole of the enemy team are alive, dont panic res! You reviving and being there as 3 is useless. Instead accept that people did not die in the places you needed, so you save revive for the next fight, but try not to panic revive two people if its a lost cause anyway. Always have a reason behind your res.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s probably lots more but that was fun to write so I&amp;#39;ll call it here. I hope more people become mercy mains and it loses it&amp;#39;s bad reputation. After the buff to her ult she is a brilliant support hero and has so much potential and is super fun to play. Practice practice practice and enjoy the games :) Thanks for reading if you did and hope you got something from it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey everyone!

The point you have reached in the game matters the most, if you really need the extra ult charge then shoot the enemy tanks (preferably a roadhog) while avoiding death, this way your ult will charge around 20-25% if you consistently hit shots in less than 10 seconds which in most cases will grant you the res you need to clutch save a points s stall until you kill their team and win the game (woohoo! Go you!). The one your going to want to stick with the most of the game is healing staff, the healing side of the staff heals enough health to, in perspective, completely neutralize an enemy Winston's attack damage, also this will grant you res in (with straight healing) roughly a minute or less. The damage buff is what you should go with if you currently control the point or are  trying to give some teammate and edge over the opponents damage to win the fight, getting offensive and defensive assists (when you damage buff a teammate who eliminates someone)  tends to be what you are going for if you want ult charge in this situation. In conclusion though the healing is what you want to stick with if teammates need healing. \n\nEdit: forgot to say that OP is the true top 500 player here and is definitely going to be able to help you better with the other questions, I just took the last two and went a little more in-depth on them ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I will go ahead and answer the Edit portion of your questions and let OP do the main ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022is it better to damage buff large....? \nIn most cases it really depends on who is being consistent, if let&amp;#39;s say you have a widow who is just not having a good day then stick with the soldier(or whoever it is).
