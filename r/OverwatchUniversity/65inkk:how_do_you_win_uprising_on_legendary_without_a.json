Depends on how you wanna approach it though eg cheap strat or just normal tactics. The cheap way would be to ignore the 1st or-14n and take out the bastion on the right. Take out all the 200hp bots and shield guys on your way to the 2nd bastion on the left. Then take him out and go take out the bastion on the very far back left. Afterwards, take out the last bastion on the far right. This works because the bastions spawn when you get to the gate, and the 2nd-4th or-14ns and the ulting bastions don't spawn until after you take out the 1st or-14n. I've read about this on a recent ow thread and tried it out just earlier.\n\nRemember that there's a time limit though and every second counts. The normal tactics would be to first ignore the bastion on the right. Take out the 1st or-14n. Call out your targets as well as when your shield is going to break &amp; when you're going to charge or shatter especially since ulting bastions aimlock and 1hko. Take out the bastion on the right. Clean up all the 200hp bots and the shield guys as you meet them. Then take out the 2nd or-14n and then the bastion on the left. Tell torb to snipe that bastion with his left click from afar and tracer can just blink to it and get in a certain position where she can hit the crit box while not being in view of the bastion so it won't turn around. Prepare for the ulting bastion behind. That ulting bastion will continuously spawn throughout the game. Tracer can do the same thing she did to the 2nd stationary bastion to the bastion on the far left (e.g. blink behind it and get free headshots without it turning around at her). The last few bots would be the last 2 or-14ns and the bastion on the far right as well as the ulting bastion (again) and the shield / squishy guys. I recommend cleaning up the 200hp guys first and then the shield bots. Remember to call out targets. And torb shouldn't be afraid to molten core without a turret set up or even with full health because molten core increases his rate of fire for 12 seconds I believe. Focus one or-14n at a time. Burst dmg/focus fire is key. Remember that if you take dmg as reinhardt, tracer, or torbjorn, that mercy will have to heal you rather than dmg boosting. Match ends when all or-14ns are down so you can ignore the bastion on the far right and the ulting bastion if you're within seconds of finishing the match. Another useful thing you can do is have rein charge the or-14n into the cubby with the two doors or towards the far left. Be careful of charging the or-14n towards the back where you came from because the ulting bastion will probably be there.
