Wall rides can be just as effective on the ground. As you get more comfortable, you'll naturally make the transition to soloing pharah. In your games, use wall rides to get a quick direction change and a free speed boost. You just have to tap the wall real fast. Once you get used to that, learn to quickly switch to speed boost before you tap a wall, then switch back. So long as you are in the air, you will keep your momentum. Finally, You can close a huge gap, and/or completely leap over an entire enemy team by amping, switching to speed boost, wall tapping, then switching back to heal. This is great if you need to save a flanker's butt who's behind enemy lines.\n\nUltimately, with wall rides it comes down to experience. You have to put the time in to learn them. My favorite practice spot is Anubis. It's killer fun bouncing around the final objective area. It's also got smooth, clean walls all the way from one end of the map to the other. The stage is another good place to practice. Add this to your daily warm up.\n\nThe other thing you should be practicing is how to get to every elevated point in the map. I pick one map a day, start at one end. As you slowly walk from one end to the other, look for perches and elevated flanks and figure out how to get up there. Try to find multiple ways to get up there, and be able to do it in 5 seconds. Inside the garage on Watchpoint Gibraltar is a lot of fun. Try to get on top of the space ship from every door in 5 seconds. Those pesky snipers never saw it coming.\n\nFinally, don't get frustrated or burnt out. You don't need to spend hours grinding on empty maps. Just a little time here and there. If you find a spot that you're hung up on, skip it. But be aware of it when you play on that map later.

Wall rides can be just as effective on the ground. As you get more comfortable, you&amp;#39;ll naturally make the transition to soloing pharah. In your games, use wall rides to get a quick direction change and a free speed boost. You just have to tap the wall real fast. Once you get used to that, learn to quickly switch to speed boost before you tap a wall, then switch back. So long as you are in the air, you will keep your momentum.
