If you haven\u2019t seen the Matrix video, I recommend watching that before this because you all are Matrix slaves \uf04a and you should learn how to use that first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we are going to discuss the do\u2019s and dont\u2019s of ulting with D.Va. Disclaimer, I am going to show a ton of D.Va ults in this video across all levels of play and maps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use your ult standing still, you can shoot it away from you, and* you can nose dive to stop your mech from shooting farther away. I always use the nose dive to stack with my teammate\u2019s ultimates and for positioning the ultimate accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should rarely ever have to \u201cfree throw\u201d your ultimate. Most times it\u2019s better for you to do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;hold it until you can stack with one of your teammates ultimates&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;save it for an enemy push so that you can push them back&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;use it to bring yourself back into the fight&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;use it as a stall tactic &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you know you can wipe a team because of their current positioning, then you should use the ultimate how you see fit, whether that\u2019s by throwing it or just dropping it down. But, you always take the risk of wasting it. D.Va\u2019s ult is one of the best point clearers in the game, if not the best, so think before you ult.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You should only shoot D.Va\u2019s ult straight up into the air when you are standing on top of some objective. There is a right and wrong way to do this. The right way is to boost up about half way and then use the ultimate. Do not use it as soon as you boost or you won\u2019t kill anything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that your when you throw your mech, it actually has knockback and deals damage. That can be useful in situations where the enemy team is bunched up in hallways or in a friendly ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your mech is ready to be called, don\u2019t hesitate. Pilot D.Va is fun, but is the lesser of the two D.Vas as far as usability is concerned. Remember your mech calldown deals damage and causes knockback in a small AOE around your calldown. I have some tips for how to play Pilot D.Va well too, but that\u2019s for another video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is necessary for me to reiterate the importance of stacking with your teammates. Good communication is key. For example, if you and your Rein both have ult, tell your Rein that you are going to ult behind the enemy Rein. The enemy Rein will have to turn to block the D.Va ult. When the enemy Rein turns, your Rein can shatter, thus effectively stacking. Anas will also commonly boost you. Make sure to tell your Ana a few seconds before you&amp;#39;re planning on ulting so that Ana does not waste her boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s it for this video!
