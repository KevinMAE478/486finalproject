I'm at 1900 SR (gunning for that gold) so obviously not a pro lucio, but I've had a lot of fun with the new changes and feel like my impact has actually increased a bit since the patch. Some of this has already been said here but I just wanted to chime in on where I think we can take advantage of the changes, even at these lower ranks.\n\nOverall I think the way to be really impactful with lucio now is to be super mobile and aggressive- now more than ever. One really helpful phrase I've heard describing this playstyle (I think I heard it first from Freedo on Your Overwatch) is that lucio can \"shape the battlefield.\" This breaks up into two main categories: weaving in and out of the position(s) of your teammates to taxi and heal them, and crowd controlling enemies by booping them out of position. \n\nBoth of these components get maximum value by using your speed boost to constantly fly around the battlefield- speed to your tanks and amp heals, speed to an enemy rein and boop him into the air, speed to your tracer coming from the backline and heal her, race to the ulting enemy reaper to knock him away from your team, etc.\n\nAs you can see from this example pattern I described, the theme here is to constantly move around to the various fights happening around the map. It can still be hard to have game changing impact as lucio in a team fight, but what you can do is interfere in as many of these mini brawls as possible. By using that speed to be in so many places in so little time, your small amounts of impact across the map will add up by constantly making your team's positioning a little better and your enemy's positioning a little worse.\n\nI already touched on how I think he can be healing, but wanted to elaborate a bit. Yes the auras are smaller, but you can make up for it via the buffed heals if you keep putting yourself next to the teammates who need you most. As others here have mentioned, I almost think of him as closer to an active single/dual-target healer now as opposed to a passive AoE healer. The biggest difference is that now more responsibility is on you as the lucio player to wallride/speed those more focused heals, but by doing that the value is still there.\n\nTo summarize, I think lucio can have the same (or even more) impact relative to before- you just have to play him more aggressively and constantly be zipping around the battlefield. Obviously it can help if your team sticks together closer, but his kit has the potential to close those gaps and create tons of small plays that add up to a powerful positional advantage.\n\nI hope this helps a little but obviously I'm still learning (and am only silver) so I'm excited to see everything others are posting about how to play new lucio as well.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was going to make a new post about this specific topic- lucio at lower ranks- but since you already started this here I&amp;#39;ll add my two cents!

As others here have mentioned, I almost think of him as closer to an active single/dual-target healer now as opposed to a passive AoE healer. The biggest difference is that now more responsibility is on you as the lucio player to wallride/speed those more focused heals, but by doing that the value is still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I think lucio can have the same (or even more) impact relative to before- you just have to play him more aggressively and constantly be zipping around the battlefield. Obviously it can help if your team sticks together closer, but his kit has the potential to close those gaps and create tons of small plays that add up to a powerful positional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps a little but obviously I&amp;#39;m still learning (and am only silver) so I&amp;#39;m excited to see everything others are posting about how to play new lucio as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg9c8uk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215218.0, "created_utc": 1492186418.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfpj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfpj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfpj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfpj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cfpj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tc3f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "imatworksoshhh", "parent_id": "t1_dg9mnl8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, I agree with picking someone else if you want to play passive.
