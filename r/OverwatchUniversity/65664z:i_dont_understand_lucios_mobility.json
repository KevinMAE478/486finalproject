You can easily get to the high ground but that&amp;#39;s more for style points and surprise drop boops now, used to be players would stay up there and scout for their team but you can&amp;#39;t apply buffs from the high ground effectively anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg87hbc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492145581.0, "created_utc": 1492116781.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65664z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg88krt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iamyourlager", "parent_id": "t3_65664z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Think horizontal (straight forward and back, left and right on different walls) instead of vertical (climbing up).\n\nEspecially KOTH maps, flying wall to wall protects you, gives you quick access to far away teammates, and your revamped damage gives you further protection and actual dive possibilities.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think horizontal (straight forward and back, left and right on different walls) instead of vertical (climbing up).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially KOTH maps, flying wall to wall protects you, gives you quick access to far away teammates, and your revamped damage gives you further protection and actual dive possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg88krt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146856.0, "created_utc": 1492118056.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65664z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65664z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65664z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65664z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8h0h0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Klathmon", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ugre", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, it's a 90% reduction in area...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s a 90% reduction in area...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg8h0h0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492157893.0, "created_utc": 1492129093.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ugre", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zomboromcom", "parent_id": "t1_dg7u0ag", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ok, thanks.
