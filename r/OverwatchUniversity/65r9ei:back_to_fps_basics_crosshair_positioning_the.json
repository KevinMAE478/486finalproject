Calvin for example is always at around 8 meters on any of those hero's when fighting, this is because they don't have to adjust like they would at 2 meters. A lot of players that use flankers fall into this \"if I'm right in their face I'll hit more bullets\" mindset. This is a huge fallpoint in many flankers gameplay, here's why: when you are fighting at near melee range any movement coming from your target becomes a much larger mouse movement than it would be if you were at 10 ish meters. Not only does this controlled spacing mean you can aim easier but it also gives you more special awareness, as you don't have a whole character model taking up 60% of your screen, and against hero's with shorter range it gives you more kiting room. As a rein main I will 2-3 shot any squishy that gets in my face. This becomes a lot harder at ~10m because they're much too far for me to commit to a melee and it would be useless for me to chase them down.
