Be creative :)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Who should do this: If you&amp;#39;re comfortable with your character (know how to play your role, positioning, etc.) but aren&amp;#39;t too sure about how to play with some other characters.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Who shouldn&amp;#39;t do this: I&amp;#39;ve found this practice really difficult for main tanks, and not particularly necessary for healers (mainly because you do this anyway but with your whole team instead of one person).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it seems like you&amp;#39;re throwing your match, but you could potentially learn a lot about your character and how it synergizes with another. As you get good at syncing with one charcater, you can expand to two and so on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back Story: I was playing with Pharah pushing the payload on Dorado and noticed that our Mei was placing random ice walls, so I was like &amp;quot;wtf?&amp;quot;. Later on at that chokepoint before you enter the building, there&amp;#39;s this really tall building opposite that entrance. Not impossible to get above, but this random mei just ice walls and gave me a little extra height so I can comfortably get over that building, plus have extra boost left over to get behind their lines and barrage. After the match she said she was stalking me to try and learn how to synergyze/play with Pharah a little better. The random ice walls? platforms for me to land on so I can keep my aerial advantage instead of landing on ground level. It just blew my mind, especially had I realized what she was doing AND if the ice walls were more strategically placed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Added caveat: I&amp;#39;ve noticed that this has focused my attention on myself. If we have a terrible player, lose a fight, I die, or the person I&amp;#39;m following dies, I think about what I could have done better/how could I have better synced with a particular player. For example, on Temple on attack, we had a Widowmisser. It was a little frustrating since this player was probably making 30% scoped accuracy, but I don&amp;#39;t flame people for practicing. Anyways, on point B, the Widow was hanging out back scoping down the main corridor, missing most of their shots, but occasionally hitting something. So my team moved through the left passage, genji and I moved up the right corridor. Once our DPS/Tanks were applying pressure from that small room on the left the healers popped out from the right, and Genji and I flanked. So even though the Widow was a terrible shot, she zoned and separated the other team fairly effectively, and our team responded. Consequently, we ended up pinching everybody back towards the middle and our Widow was more effective. Characters like Torb, Bastion, Junkrat can also effectively zone. So I adjust accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other examples that my friend has done for me (he&amp;#39;s a phenomenal flexer)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Symmetra: Use 1-2 turrets where I&amp;#39;m healing in case a Tracer or Genji comes after me (especially since the turrets slow them down a bit)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pharah: respond to the person harrassing back row (especially if they&amp;#39;re trying to shut down your widow)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Genji dash &amp;amp; deflect the shot after roadhog hooks me&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DPS: wait to attack/ult until they spot me as Sombra behind enemy Rein. This helps to divert focus off me, and if I hack their Rein&amp;#39;s shield away, the whole push usually falls apart.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thanks for reading.
