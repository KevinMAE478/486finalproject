Your positivity in chat is good and helpful. In general, you seem to have a decent idea how the game is played and your grouping is good. The biggest things I think you need to work on are crosshair placement and positioning - you need to be taking and holding high ground more often between fights, and moving less during fights. Sometimes you'll go for a wide route while your team is engaged, and remove yourself from the fight for 10 seconds. \n\n\n1. Your crosshair positioning needs work. Always be looking where enemy heads are most likely to be. Look at ~:17, when you step around the corner - your crosshair is in a spot you already know there are no enemies, and it takes a moment to flick up to the mercy. You also look a little too low in general - the ground is rarely important. Look around a foot (in game) higher, and practice leading with your crosshair around corners.  \n\n2. Your first couple ults look bad - getting the mercy with your first ult was basically luck, and based on your position + the enemy position they all could have hidden easily (and mostly do, save for the mercy that whole hog gives you). The second ult was after the fight was over and made Ana waste hers (which was her fault). Your ult is super high value and can win fights by itself - some of your uses throughout are good, but they're inconsistent. \n\n3. You should be placing the heal station more often. Dying with it up is awkward - even if it's too late to save yourself, it can assist teammates and gets you ult. :57-1:03 you could have placed it (I would have hit it in midair as soon as Winston knocked me across the point, but the better spot may be behind the D.va when she was matrixing.)\n\n4. Don\u2019t hang out on point after retake, get on advantageous ground. You spend 2:03-2:19 doing literally nothing but some more odd crosshair stuff, you could have gotten on the stairs by the high ground on your side and gotten free damage on the hog/mercy. \n\n5. Although your teammate's kinda an ass, he\u2019s right, get on the point. Even if you die instantly, it literally can't be worse than what happened here, and sometimes the enemies magically cannot kill 1 person. \n\n6. Your ult around 5:00 is perfect - from a flank, getting high value targets, deciding a fight in progress.\n\n7. You can stop shooting d.va mechs once they're exploding - there is a timing to hit her with the rockets right as it pops, but you put ~15 shots into it unnecessarily.\n\n8. Your aim is good but inconsistent. Sometimes you burst, but you should be doing it more often, especially at 15+ meters. Focus on shooting intentionally - your aim is good when you're using it, but sometimes you seem to just get in the \"habit\" of holding left mouse, and you're firing shots that have no chance of hitting. Better to pause and reacquire your target.\n\n9. 5:33-5:40 you are basically invulnerable (lucio and zenyatta both ult) but you spend the entire time circumnavigating the point. Why? You back off when winston dives because you're wounded, but then once the support ults come out you could have reengaged. You basically make your own team down a man for the whole meat of that fight. \n\n10. I see you go to ult at 6:15, and thankfully you die before the cast. Ulting while alone is a mistake 99% of the time. \n\n11. At 6:45 you could have put your heal station behind bastion, healing yourself up and maybe saving him. He's not playing well here, but you have to work with what you've got. \n\n12. Your ult right after is asking for trouble - you're already down a man, their soldier is already utling... Better to dry push and try to make something work after.\n\n13. When you're all grouping up for the next push, you look sorta lost; 7:13-7:39 you do nothing during a really critical time. You can at least be poking and trying to build your next ult, or flanking the right side onto the high ground ledge overlooking the point. You then run from a winston (60 dps is not a huge threat, you're way too afraid of winston in general) into a d.va ult, which is just poor game sense or spatial reasoning. \n\n14. 8:57-9:10, where are you going? Why do you concede the high ground to one enemy and leave your zenyatta/junkrat? A discorded winston, while you're in your heal station, is a super simple kill, and the winston put himself in a 1v3.\n\n15. Getting bursted down at 9:46 is rough luck, but you're playing this ledge a little too far up. Ideally you shouldn't be seeing any of the ground in front of the choke - just the bodies of the enemies in the choke. Additionally, you're strafing backwards and forwards, which doesn't seriously change the profile you present to the enemies - try strafing left and right instead. These two together would likely have saved you. \n\n16. As soon as you step around the corner at 10:27 you're a dead man. Don't do things like that.\n\n17. 11:33-11:43 you have a solid 10 seconds to place your heal station and do not. You should have disengaged during this time anyways, but you can use your cooldowns more aggressively. \n\n\nIn general, you just need to contribute more during fights (be in a good spot before the fight, and try not to spend time moving during the fight) and be more consistent in your aim (lead with your crosshair, shoot targets you can actually hit, and don't shoot if your crosshair isn't over anything).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only watched the soldier game.

Pick targets for discord a little better. I noticed a couple times that you would target the dva with her defense matrix up over the pharah or another squishy. One of the great things about the discord orb is that it can force someone to play more defensively or risk getting killed, so in general it is better to focus the orb on exposed DPS first. Obviously this depends heavily on the situation and you'll need to adapt, but it's good to keep in mind\n\n\n2. Work on your aim. You seemed to have trouble tracking targets which will hurt you in the long run. Another thing that I saw was that you would shoot a few orbs out before discording which is a habit that will only negatively affect you later as well. I didn't see you make use of zens right click, which is insanely good at putting the hurt down on tanks and shields. Try fighting some Lucios of ranging difficulty in a custom game to improve your aim. \n\n\n3. Manage your healing better. It can be tempting to just leave your heals on a tank and try to go full DPS, but that is bad for both the team and yourself. Your healing can be a massive boon to characters like genji and pharah and can quickly top up lower health characters. You will never be able to outheal the damage that a tank is sustaining in a fight, but the boost it gives to a DPS player could make or break a battle. \n\n\n4. Communicate more with your team. Zen is in one of the best positions to shotcall since he is generally far enough from the fight to have a good sense of who needs to go where and he will be the first to know about a flanker. If you are not confident enough to shotcall, you can still help people focus priority targets by calling out discords. I will concede that I have never played in bronze, so I don't know how toxic it is, but if you find some talkative people who aren't too bad maybe consider adding them so you can play together. Even just a 3 stack can be very reliable if there is at least one person who can play every role well.\n\n\nAll that being said, you seem to be a decent Zen for your rank.
