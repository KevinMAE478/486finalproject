The first is when you're flanking, and are fully committed to one specific target that you want to take out. Usually its one of your counters or a healer. This is when you want to quickly blast your way and get a jump on the target, you'll usually manage to sneak a direct hit before they manage to lock on to you. After that, you should ideally be in very close range. This will make it easier for you to hit them, and for them to hit you, but at that range Pharah out DPSes any of her counters/healers. Its very easy to take down Soldier from that range because you only need two/three hits somewhere close enough to him to kill him. Needless to say, don't do this against Reaper, Roadhog, Junkrat, etc.. Also, if you have a pocket Mercy, this play style becomes very easy to execute. McCree could be problematic if he's exceptionally good, but you should be able to throw him off with your concussive.\n\nThe other way is to shoot from a long distance. You usually do this when defending a choke or when you're looking for an early pick during poking phase. Your main goal here is to build ult charge and possibly weaken enemies for your other DPS to take down. Just spam the area and try predicting where the enemy runs to. Its usually behind cover, or if its Soldier its usually towards their healing pod. \n\nUnless your goal is to just spam a choke point defensively, make sure you take calculated shots. Take your time and aim, you'll slowly get better at aiming faster. This is especially true when fighting Pharahs. Abuse your vertical movement to dodge their shots and just take your time hitting them. If you get hit, its better to run away than die. If you hit them once and you're at full health, consider baiting a shot then quickly closing up so its impossible to miss a shot. Even if you're damaged by your own rocket, its easier to secure a kill that way.
