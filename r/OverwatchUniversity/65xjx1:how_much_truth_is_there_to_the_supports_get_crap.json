I have gotten 17-19 4 times on support, typically in games where my team have simply not required that much healing. The lowest I&amp;#39;ve gotten for a win as DPS is 22. My highest gains were from Mercy 33, Sombra 29, Zenyatta 28. Another interesting thing, kinda annoying, is a 8 game win streak which netted me 19/19/20/28/22/22/23/24. That felt really really bad....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a closing summary. My numbers do NOT support an overall lower SR gained from playing support, however, may be skewed due to &amp;quot;smurfing&amp;quot; as a support main. Further data from my main would be an interesting addition to this discussion. What I do see is a larger gap between the lowest SR gains, and the highest gains - and that this may be part of players frustrations. I think the support and game-sense minded players are left behind slightly from the performance metrics used in determining SR gains and losses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I welcome anybody else&amp;#39;s data and I might make a post on this towards the end of the season when I have more data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgeov0k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492517989.0, "created_utc": 1492489189.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xjx1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgephmj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Aperture314159", "parent_id": "t3_65xjx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I climbed 91 SR today going 7-6 as Mercy.\n\nMake of that what you will.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I climbed 91 SR today going 7-6 as Mercy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgephmj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492518965.0, "created_utc": 1492490165.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xjx1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dger5nc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "imonfiyar", "parent_id": "t3_65xjx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Anecdotal: i did notice in season 2 that i lose about 35 - 40 SR and gained 30 - 35 SR but it was across all heroes instead of just supports. it was frustrating to see your SR dip when you are drawing on W/L.\n\nI haven't felt quite the same impact in current season playing as support or dps\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal: i did notice in season 2 that i lose about 35 - 40 SR and gained 30 - 35 SR but it was across all heroes instead of just supports. it was frustrating to see your SR dip when you are drawing on W/L.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t felt quite the same impact in current season playing as support or dps&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dger5nc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492521750.0, "created_utc": 1492492950.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xjx1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeua2z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IronBrutzler", "parent_id": "t3_65xjx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The problem is even if it is not true it is now in the head of the people. \n\nThats the reasons why you see less support players (at least on Console) then in Season 3. \n\nI think the only way to fix this is a statement from Blizz.
