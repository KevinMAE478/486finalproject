You cannot control your teammates. All you can do is play around them. You have no right to whine about any of their picks because that's what you signed up for by picking solo queue.\n\nSo I often play solo-queue. In Platinum you'll see these guys who absolutely want to play DPS. The recent issues of Support gaining less SR doesn't help. No one wants to play Tank as playing Reinhardt is difficult, and you can't play Orisa if the enemy has a Reinhardt. The meta literally revolves around Reinhardt and people try to main tank with other tanks such as D.Va or Orisa but they fail. **Always.**\n\nYou'll often see 4-5 DPS (or Symmetra if on Defense since Symmetra is in every single game on Defense now) and an Off-Tank (or Roadhog because people think Roadhog is an acceptable fucking off-tank) which leaves me the option to either play Reinhardt or Support the team. \n\nBoth of these options just piss people off as we'll see people tilt by asking for a Main Tank if we don't have one, or people will just spam \"We need a healer!\" in the chat non-stop until one of the DPS characters finally switches due to people tilting at them. \n\nNo joke, literally two days ago I was solo-queueing and we had a team composition of Reaper, McCree, Junkrat, Roadhog, and Soldier: 76, **we were getting shit on by Pharmercy when I was the Reinhardt for the team**, and the McCree threatens to throw the game if someone doesn't switch to Support. Guess what? He started to throw until the Junkrat finally switched from people screaming over the headsets.\n\nI main Support and Tanks solely because absolutely fucking no one else will. At best now we get Orisa or D.Va as off-tanks and maybe a Lucio or Mercy as a healer, but they are almost never together and the recent news about healers having less SR gains have made some support mains stop playing healer altogether. When our Soldier: 76 or Sombra gets a card for ***healing*** in our games, you know something is wrong.\n\nIf you think Solo-Queue is anything other than a fuckfest and that you can keep the team composition from falling apart half of the time in the mid and lower ranks, you are objectively wrong.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Complaining about team comp when you&amp;#39;re in solo queue is a little absurd, honestly. You cannot control your teammates. All you can do is play around them. You have no right to whine about any of their picks because that&amp;#39;s what you signed up for by picking solo queue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I often play solo-queue. In Platinum you&amp;#39;ll see these guys who absolutely want to play DPS. The recent issues of Support gaining less SR doesn&amp;#39;t help. No one wants to play Tank as playing Reinhardt is difficult, and you can&amp;#39;t play Orisa if the enemy has a Reinhardt. The meta literally revolves around Reinhardt and people try to main tank with other tanks such as D.Va or Orisa but they fail. &lt;strong&gt;Always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll often see 4-5 DPS (or Symmetra if on Defense since Symmetra is in every single game on Defense now) and an Off-Tank (or Roadhog because people think Roadhog is an acceptable fucking off-tank) which leaves me the option to either play Reinhardt or Support the team. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these options just piss people off as we&amp;#39;ll see people tilt by asking for a Main Tank if we don&amp;#39;t have one, or people will just spam &amp;quot;We need a healer!&amp;quot; in the chat non-stop until one of the DPS characters finally switches due to people tilting at them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No joke, literally two days ago I was solo-queueing and we had a team composition of Reaper, McCree, Junkrat, Roadhog, and Soldier: 76, &lt;strong&gt;we were getting shit on by Pharmercy when I was the Reinhardt for the team&lt;/strong&gt;, and the McCree threatens to throw the game if someone doesn&amp;#39;t switch to Support. Guess what? He started to throw until the Junkrat finally switched from people screaming over the headsets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I main Support and Tanks solely because absolutely fucking no one else will. At best now we get Orisa or D.Va as off-tanks and maybe a Lucio or Mercy as a healer, but they are almost never together and the recent news about healers having less SR gains have made some support mains stop playing healer altogether. When our Soldier: 76 or Sombra gets a card for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;healing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in our games, you know something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think Solo-Queue is anything other than a fuckfest and that you can keep the team composition from falling apart half of the time in the mid and lower ranks, you are objectively wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgckazo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404987.0, "created_utc": 1492376187.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pwe9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgd3k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jjsliderr", "parent_id": "t3_65pwe9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Man I just play what I'm good at fuck everyone else.
