It's probably worthwhile to have pulse bomb for it bc it's awkwardly placed up on high ground I'm not sure everyone can access. \n\nTorb during his molten core has a ton of damage and health so he can really burst down either the bastion or the ORISA, so you could have rein and tracer swing and pulse bomb it down while Mercy peeks from afar and send torb in to alt fire the ORISAs on the ground like a madman.

I can definitely see that being a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;d probably do is focus it during your molten core, have rein shatter as much as he can on the bottom level and take that bastion out as quickly as possible. I&amp;#39;d keep Mercy as safe as you can by bastion 2 or 3 on that diagram where your turret would most likely be set up. Mercy can peek and pistol that bastion from a distance if you&amp;#39;re all on it and you&amp;#39;ll have a short CC window from shatter and the torb turret should keep the ORISA units occupied. It&amp;#39;s probably worthwhile to have pulse bomb for it bc it&amp;#39;s awkwardly placed up on high ground I&amp;#39;m not sure everyone can access. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Torb during his molten core has a ton of damage and health so he can really burst down either the bastion or the ORISA, so you could have rein and tracer swing and pulse bomb it down while Mercy peeks from afar and send torb in to alt fire the ORISAs on the ground like a madman. The bastion AI isn&amp;#39;t the greatest so a lot of the elites can work like tank and spanks in wow, rein can often draw a lot of focus from units if he is swinging on them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I think happened in one of my runs was we killed the tank bastion roughly from sentry  position 2.

Your team should focus them before the Troopers and Eradicators because they're the only bot that damages the payload (except detonators). \n\n* Charge bastions TOWARDS the payload. Bastions will only go into turret mode when they're in one spot. If you bring them as far as possible from that spot, they'll stay in recon mode to walk all the way back over. When in the final room, charge the bastions off their little ledges and they'll have to walk all the way around to get where they were. \n\n* Charging Eradicators immediately drops their shield. A good strategy during payload defense is to just charge the Eradicators and let the Torbjorn/Tracer finish them off  \n\n* To kill detonators, wait until they get to the payload and being to explode. The second you see it shake and turn orange, charge it away. You'll take like 100 damage, but it's better than wasting your ult on it. \n\n* Just like any other shield, Orisa shields and Eradicator shields block your ult, but not your firestrike. \n\n* If someone dies, try to shield an ally while they're reviving them. \n\nTorbjorn: \n\nIMO the best spots to set your turrets are:\n\nPoint 1: The middle of the point\n\nPoint 2: The high balcony behind the statue (the one with the outdoor stairs)\n\nPoint 3: On the high point on the side (there are boxes in the back of the cathedral you can climb up)\n\nPayload: On the high ledges behind the payload.\n\nNotice how they're almost never actually on the point. That way, the bots have to choose to either attack the payload or attack your turret. \n\nMercy: \n\n* Damage boost, damage boost, damage boost! Only boost Torbjorn when he ults, otherwise boost Tracer/Reinhardt. \n\n* Don't solo ult ever unless the dead ally is really hard to get to and their death timer is almost up. An example, say, your tracer dies and reinhardt and torbjorn are both low, it's best to just hide, let them die, and then rez all 3. \n\n* Don't be afraid to whip out your pistol if your team is forgetting a prime target (ie they're not killing the slicers, or they need help killing bastions)\n\nTracer: \n\n* Only Pulse Bomb Bastions/Tanks/Orisas \n\n* Never ever ever engage a bastion by yourself. Especially at the higher levels. \n\n* STAY WITH YOUR TEAM\n\n* I know you're really getting into it, but please stay with your team. If you died in the middle of the courtyard because you got overzealous, it's going to be very difficult for your team to revive you. This is especially true in by the cathedral/mondatta statue points. If you go outside and your team is all inside, there's a good chance you'll die. Just let the bots come to you. It's not based on how many bots you kill, it's based on time spent on the point. \n\nAll-around tips: \n\n* You should be focusing in this order (during payload phase): \nTanks/Bastions&gt;Detonators&gt;Slicers&gt;Eradicators&gt;Troopers. Eradicators and Troopers do end up doing a lot of damage if there's a lot of them, but ideally you should be keeping their numbers low anyway.\n\n* Right after the 3 points, you're instructed to get on the payload. If you don't Troopers will spawn every few seconds. Use this opportunity to build ult charge. Your team should never go into payload phase without ults. \n\n* A good route to go after the payload is: Orisa 1, Bastion on the right, then into the little building, Orisa 2, across into the other alcove, the 2 bastions on the side, then get the other 2 orisas, killing Tanks as they spawn. \n\n* Different elite bot spawns are denoted by sounds. A cathedral bell sound indicates an Eradicator spawn, a BWAAAUMM sound means a detonator spawn, a bastion voice line (bweep bweep bweep bweeeeeep) means a tank has spawned. \n\n* When the payload timer reaches 0, all remaining bots instantly die. So if you still have that bastion and detonator combo alive with less than 5 seconds, just protect the payload and hold out.

You can earthshatter them when they get back to their spot for maximum cc duration.\n\n* Charge Eradicators when you can, but  don't if you can't (i.e. when it'd put you out of position).\n\n* When someone goes down, shield their corpse for an easy revive. Sometimes you'll have to wait for a squadmate to come with you before going to grab them - don't wear your barrier down unnecessarily\n\n* Use Earthshatter: 2nd wave of omnics at second hack point, when they come from behind. 2nd Bastion at payload defence. Last rush at payload defence. Bastion tanks, Bastions at payload push and power plant. You can get more but these are most important in my experience\n\n* Pull aggro from Bastion tanks, always. You are the only thing between them and your mates getting oneshot. Only put your barrier down to charge them, and get close before doing so - they can hit you mid-charge and knock you away.\n\n* Take breaks in power plant to recharge your barrier (after letting squadmates know). There's good cover on the right of the first stretch once you kill the Bastion there. Easy to rotate to the far right corner, where you can shoot the 2nd Orisa while being covered from the 2nd Bastion turret. Easy to peek the second Bastion turret from here, and then take his place.\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn:\n\n* There's not much need to get cute with your turrets. Put it on the objective where it sees as many entrances as possible and Reinhardt can shield it / you can fix it without being out of position\n\n* At second hack point, put turret on the right where it also sees the payload area and the small room where omnics can spawn\n\n* Armor pack priority: Tracer &gt; Mercy &gt; Torb &gt; Rein. Get lots of scrap and throw armor where people actually pick them up\n\n* Molten core is always handy past the first wave of 2nd hack point, but I already covered the hardest rushes with Rein. Also good to have when someone goes down\n\n* Use alt-fire on Eradicator shields\n\n* Use alt-fire + forge hammer on Slicers, quicker than 3-shotting them and and costs the same ammo.\n\n* You have the best long-range weapon, focus on Bastion turrets\n\n* Protect your turret, if it goes down, dump another one out ASAP. A turret is the team's best asset. At the very least it will catch a few bullets for you.\n\nTracer\n\n* Stay in LOS of the turret and Mercy. Robots are already dumb and there's no real need to flank or \"surprise\" them\n\n* Get behind Eradicators and shoot the orange glowing backback. This will break their shield, and is often an easier method than a rein charge.\n\n* Blinks will confuse (basically hard CC) nearby omnics for about a second, so blink a lot. If you do it near teammates, they get the protection too, all the more reason to stay with them.\n\n* Your pulse bomb is top-tier against bastions, after 3rd hack point you should be saving it for them.\n\nMercy\n\n* Keep people alive and ask your Tracer to come to you if she's going deep all the time, rather than chasing her around\n\n* Tracer is your default heal/damage boost recipient, Torb a close second, especially when he's molten coring\n\n* However, Rein is the most important to keep alive, and it's worth damage-boosting him when he's doing cleave damage. It's just that he needs the healing less often. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be paying extremely close attention to him.\n\n* Build res and then don't waste it. Rein shield or even molten core is better to deal with a single downed person in most cases\n\n* Use pistol on bastion turrets when possible. It's the only other long-range gun besides the rivet gun (And I guess fire-strike).
