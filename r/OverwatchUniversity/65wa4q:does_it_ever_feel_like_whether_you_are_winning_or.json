Even if the close games are rare, if you just consistently tip the balance whenever you get the chance to do so, you will do fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can feel frustrating though, especially when you can&amp;#39;t easily tell when you are making a real difference. That&amp;#39;s one of the many reasons why playing solo queue with the intention to climb is not a good idea IMO.
