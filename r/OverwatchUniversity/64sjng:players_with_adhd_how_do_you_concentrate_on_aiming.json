I'm a McCree main with severe ADHD (my psychologist said I tested in the 99th percentile for attentiveness). My hands shake pretty much constantly from it, and even heavily medicated I struggle to pay attention. Here's what I've learned about Overwatch, ADHD, and aim:\n\n**Twitch aiming is your friend.**\n\nTracking requires you to maintain focus on your target for the entirety of the process, while keeping your hand steady. When you twitch aim, however, you only need to keep an eye on the target and then use muscle memory (which you'll need to develop) to flick to it and hit it. [Taimou's aim training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VysgMqzU3Qk&amp;t=77s) helped me a lot, along with [This one on general flick aiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-V-yz-h4Q) and [This one specific to McCree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gosylYPQR6M). \n\n**Play at a low sensitivity**\n\nThis might require you to invest in a new mouse and/or mousepad, but it's worth it. Having a lower sensitivity literally makes your targets bigger, giving you more room for error. You can use [this tool](https://jscalc.io/calc/IeBnNvGDKUIIPRmR) to calibrate your sensitivity in terms of cm/360, then match that figure roughly to the width of your mousepad. That's typically a good place to start, and you can go lower or higher to your own taste from there. \n\nHaving a lower sensitivity also makes it so that most small shaking or twitching of your hands is harmless, since you have so much more room to work with that the motions aren't nearly so severe.\n\n**Keep your mouse moving**\n\nI find that if I'm consciously moving my arm, I don't twitch as much. Eventually I learned to be constantly looking around and to aim via twitch aim, the combination of which will effectively put your mouse in constant motion. As a bonus, you'll be more aware of your surroundings. \n\n**Learn to move and aim at the same time**\n\nIf you're standing still when you learn to aim, you'll only be able to aim standing still. Standing still is just about the worst thing you can do in Overwatch. Moving targets are harder to hit, and moving targets that are *shooting* at you are even *harder* to hit. Be that kind of target.\n\n**Practice every time you play**\n\nEven if it's just for a few minutes. Twitch aiming is all about muscle memory, which you need to develop through repetition. The linked videos will elaborate on this, but it's important to work on your aim on a consistent basis if you want to improve it.\n\n**Your ADHD is an advantage in this regard: you're used to jumping between thoughts and tasks with reckless abandon. This can suck in real life sometimes, but it's *fantastic* for a game as hectic as Overwatch.**\n\nGood luck!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there!
