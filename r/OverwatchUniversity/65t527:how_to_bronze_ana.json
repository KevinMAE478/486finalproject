For that reason, I find her very enjoyable to play, because you get twice the aim practice that you would on say, Widowmaker.  (Though you don&amp;#39;t need to hit headshots with Ana!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really have to practice hip-fire, grenade and sleep dart aim.  None of those are trivial, and while I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with my scoped aim, I need more work with the other three.  The cooldowns are balanced for pros, so there is no room for error.  Reload times are long too and you simply can&amp;#39;t afford to miss.  Grenade-wise, you really want to get your own healing from your team&amp;#39;s other support rather than smashing it on your feet, and save the grenade to heal 3 tanks while also anti-healing the enemy.  You have to save the sleep dart to sleep the nano-visor&amp;#39;d enemy, their bastion that&amp;#39;s wrecking your team, or that flanking Genji.  And you absolutely must not miss, because 12 seconds is an eternity in this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, you can get away with quite a bit of slop and still be better than the other Ana:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gfycat.com/VacantDimpledHogget\"&gt;https://gfycat.com/VacantDimpledHogget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what my accuracy was there, but it wasn&amp;#39;t pretty.

I find that my nanoboosts maybe only get 1 or 2 assists... on a good day.
