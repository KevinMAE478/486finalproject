This video will be about Genjis dash.\n\nNow, this is not a new player guide so I'm going to assume you know what the dash does and how it works.\n\nWhen it comes to the usage of dash, Ill label it as either offensive or defensive, engaging or disengaging so they are distinct and from now on associated with that purpose.\n\nAn offensive dash is when you dash in to get a kill, reset your dash and either continue or disengage. It's often that genji players get themselves into bad situations by dashing into a fight which they can't win and, as a consequence, not get a reset to escape.\n\nThese scenarios typically are: \n\n-  Dashing into a group and trying to kill someone in front of their entire team\n \n     Ideally, you want to avoid any situation in which you are outnumbered. You should be as opportunistic as possible and secure easy finishing blows with your dash or dash melee combo, depending on the HP of your target. \n\n-  Dashing into a target who has their healer's attention\n\n     Typically happens when an enemy is low hp and being healed, and the Genji player dashes in to try and get the kill anyway. You are not going to kill a target who is being pocketed by a healer unless you instakill them with triple headshots and dash, which you just used to engage them with. More often than not it'll result in you not being able to outdamage the healing, having no way to back off and dying, as you'll essentially be trying to 2v1 which is a common but very bad mistake.\n\n-  Dashing without accounting for their or their target's cooldowns\n\n\nThere are abilities which must be dealt with when engaging. The most glaring ones are;\n\n  - Soldier sitting on biotic field and having helix rocket\n\n  - McCree having his flashbang\n\n  - Ana having grenade and sleep dart\n\n  - Roadhog having hook, this case is more of an AOE threat, so while you may not go after him, you must still respect the range.\n\n\nFor all of these, a successful engagement against or near these characters relies on you having your deflect up.\n\nMoving on, here are some common examples in which players get themselves killed because they didn't use dash defensively\n\n   - After they have used up deflect unsuccessfully during a 1v1 in which they can't win without it and not dashing out.\n\n   - After getting a kill and being greedy by trying to go for more and blowing their dash in a situation in which they can't realistically win in.\n\n   - After failing to kill their target fast enough while near the enemy team, making it that much easier to be focused and killed, yet still not disengaging.\n\n\nUltimately, incorporate the following criteria before you dash\n\nIs it a 1v1?\n\nIf so, can you win it?\n\nIf you screw up, do you have an escape route, something to climb, healing or a bubble?\n\nTaking these under consideration will help you understand when you should engage or disengage.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Guide", "id": "64vp31", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 146, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Qwark28", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64vp31", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.OverwatchUniversity", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/1s-aaBc_Jj0TRdCbF4TVm_FTYOvLM9hAazAuR_A84_4.jpg?s=64194d4b5cb8a5ca8e2ccfeb2e25a5ce", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/1s-aaBc_Jj0TRdCbF4TVm_FTYOvLM9hAazAuR_A84_4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=5c3dc7412dddeda3ee0b7513d8b76415", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/1s-aaBc_Jj0TRdCbF4TVm_FTYOvLM9hAazAuR_A84_4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=46d3e4c2d933a0a47c2b9f4c5fc12d93", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/1s-aaBc_Jj0TRdCbF4TVm_FTYOvLM9hAazAuR_A84_4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=f442d0f0eb41b3ef23e2ec1d7a8038b2", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "qnO8nQhDRxdkcy23mpoELC8-7ScZdvQQKzCjyir4Rqw"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "gd", "author_flair_css_class": "professor", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/64vp31/common_mistakes_genji_players_make_with_their_dash/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995409.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/64vp31/common_mistakes_genji_players_make_with_their_dash/", "author_flair_text": "Professor", "quarantine": false, "title": "Common mistakes GENJI players make with their dash", "created_utc": 1491966609.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 35, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 146}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vp31", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vp31", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5npne", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SSNNOO", "parent_id": "t1_dg5n0t5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "or when they have nanoboost for their ulti", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;or when they have nanoboost for their ulti&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg5npne", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492016661.0, "created_utc": 1491987861.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vp31", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vp31", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vp31", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vp31", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65uo3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FinchStrife", "parent_id": "t1_dg5pwvp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Distraction from a flanking or rear position often means you aren't going for kills explicitly though.

The best opportunities are in close quarter team engagements (I.e. Almost all KOTH fights). In the middle of the team fight you can just work your way around and behind the enemy deathball quickly and then dash from behind them into your own team and ideally behind a Rein shield. You can always get unlucky and get caught in the cross fire of something nasty mid-dash but in my experience it&amp;#39;s a safe enough play to make and well worth the risk anyway given how much charge it gets you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg8mskj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492165895.0, "created_utc": 1492137095.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg607qb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tres300", "parent_id": "t3_64vp31", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you have any comments for using a dash in order to gain ult charge?
