My practice is 2 hours long most of the time and it does not look like my warmup. I don&amp;#39;t understand why you were referring to Ana but brought up Mac and now the whole conversation is incorrect, and we will probably both continue to be upset because of that. I completely disagree with using infinite ammo and will never agree with it. You also do not need to explain what stutter stepping is to me, I&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a long time. Almost every single time I take a shot as Mac or Ana, I am adad spamming in a pattern and rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please do not take my warmup as my practice. I do what I do in that video because I know for a fact that it warms MY tendons up, and I understand it probably does not apply to most. The intention of sending you the video was for the example of stutter stepping with my keyboard overlay, but it seems you already have a grasp on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg8amoc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492149389.0, "created_utc": 1492120589.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8a6it", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shimizu_r", "parent_id": "t1_dg87xk1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i think you misunderstood me, my practice/warm up is focused towards repositioning aim and tracking for sequential shots. **my personal objective is projectile healing consistency with ana(hipfire), not practice against ana bots.**\n\nas for the consistency aspect with infinite ammo, it is focused on the build up of muscle memory in your left hand + response of tapping the mouse when you switch the momentum and your character actually stops for a moment enabling you to take the shot the same way you can hit while standing still.\n\n**it is the same concept used for big problems, you break it down and work on it from small parts, improving the base of the mechanics, not the mixed training you displayed in the video.**\n\nand sorry. at least go to arcade to practice.
