One player might be attacking the enemy supports, because he / she feels it's the right thing to do at that particular moment... but he / she fails to realize, that there is a 50 HP Reinhardt behind them, who should die first. If another player calls Reinhardt out as the focus target, he can be targeted and downed much easier... than a 200 HP enemy Lucio, who is wall-riding around.\n\nAt the same time, someone might get picked off by an enemy Pharah. He / she at that point knows the position and the ultimate charge of the enemy Pharah and can provide vital information to the team: \"Pharah on top - she has ult\"... Any good player will immediately know that they might be facing an upcoming barrage from above. \n\n**What impact does poor communication have on gameplay?**\n\nCommunication provides an additional layer of awareness, which can win team fights or save a lot of time (by not dying and having to wait for the respawn and run back to the fight).\n\nAs I said above: If no one calls out a low HP target or the position or the ultimate charge of an enemy hero... the chance to lose team fights or time increases rapidly. \n\n**What are some key things you need to communicate with others, in order to be successful in the game?**\n\nAre we strictly talking Overwatch here? Or multiplayer games in general?\n\nIt's important to note, that people are different. Some might fall victim to tunnel visioning faster than others.\nI've been through a couple of different ranks in Overwatch and what I've noticed in lower ranks is that many players start shooting at tanks, while completely ignoring the supports. And I can even understand them: Tanks are big targets, which you will hit for sure and you will feel like you're doing work... But at the same time you're doing it, because in the heat of the battle there is a lot of information, which needs to be processed... It can be overwhelming.\nAnd these players need to be told who to focus... And the focus targets can vary. Supports are not always the priority. An out of position tank, who already took a lot of damage can eventually be nuked down, if he is focused by few players at once. The enemy supports aren't going to heal through that. \n\nOther players fail to realize how important positioning is... They overextend. They run alone into 5-6 opponents and die.\n\nA scary amount of players fails to realize, that once you kill someone from the enemy team, you've turned the fight into a 6v5. You have the numbers advantage at that point... That's less damage you take, less crowd control you need to deal with or less healing for the enemy team. You need to take advantage of that as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are a skilled player and you know, what's right at any scenario... Then you need to communicate that with others. You need to be a leader and hope that others will follow. \n\n**Does vocabulary effect gameplay?**\n\nDepends on which vocabulary we're talking about. Are we talking about flaming / insulting others? If so, then yeah for sure. \n\nThere is this thing called the \"backfire effect\", which makes it so that when someone is confronted with an idea or thought that goes against their own perception... Their opinion doesn't change, but it actually becomes stronger.\nSo if you have a Hanjo on your team, who is throwing the game... Insulting him and forcefully asking him to swap, will (in many cases) make that player stick with Hanjo until all is lost.\nYou either need to be quiet about that and let the Hanjo realize on his / own, that he / she is doing bad... Or you need to manipulate them into doing the right thing: \"Hanzo, I'm sure you're doing a lot of work, but we could really, really need a hitscan to deal with the enemy Pharah...\" \n\n**What makes a perfect \u201cMeta\u201d for you?**\n\nI'm probably alone with this opinion, but in my opinion something like a \"meta\" doesn't exist. \nMeta is this idea of a figuratively living and breathing, ever shifting change when it comes to the flavour of the month.\n\nFor example the \"tripple tank meta\", which went away a couple of weeks ago. Did it go away, because people figured out a counter to it? Or did it go away, because it got nerfed into the ground and it wasn't as effective as before? It's the latter.\n\nWhat we go through are not metas, but actually just post-nerf-times.\nWas there ever a McCree meta, where people figured out a comp, where McCree worked really well, until that playstyle got countered? Nope, McCree got nerfed and then people stopped playing him.\n\nAs an example: In an actual \"meta environment\" you would have people playing Dive Comp, because it's easy to play and effective and then others would start playing another comp, which totally counters Dive Comp... and that would force Dive Comp players to adapt again... and so on, and so on. But that's not what's happening or will probably ever be happening. What we will see instead is Blizzard nerfing key Dive Comp heroes, ruin that playstyle and in process other playstyles would emerge. But as I said: that has nothing to do with the concept of a meta. \n\n**Why are some heroes looked down upon, compared to others?**\n\nBecause not all heroes are equally good. There is without the shadow of a doubt better all around picks. Not just from the kit of the heroes, but also from their consistency.\nI for example hate Hanjo. It makes me sick to have that hero on my team, no matter how good the player is. Why? Because Hanjo is an incredibly inconsistent hero. If you miss your shots as Hanjo, you aren't doing anything for your team. Now if you played Soldier instead, you would be hitting more shots. You would most likely get more value out of your ultimate. You would depend less on heals and hence your support teammates, would be free to heal other teammates more or be able to focus more on their positioning and survivability.\n\nOn top of the fact, that a hero like Hanjo is straight up less consistent than many others... He takes away one slot on the team. So if I'm a DPS main for example... and I instalock my best hero... which is Soldier or Tracer or whoever... We then get another DPS main with a good pick and then a Hanjo, who won't switch? That player forces me to switch off DPS and pick tank or support, because it's more likely that I will have more impact as a tank / support than as the third DPS or for hells sake even the fourth DPS. \nAnd if that Hanjo continues missing his shots and thriving in his 30% win rate... That adds additional negativity, because he is effectively throwing the game. The chance to win that game lies at 30%, because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\n**Are there things about Overwatch that you\u2019ve had to explain to an outsider viewing the game? Can you give an example if you have one? No worries if not.**\n\nI love Overwatch. The reason why I love Overwatch is, because it reminds me of the two best eras I had in gaming... It was when I first started playing Counter-Strike and when I first started playing World of Warcraft.\n\nI loved Counter-Strike, because I could clearly see my improvements in aiming, reaction times and map knowledge. And I loved World of Warcraft, because I was blown away by all the new imput. For example when I saw the first flying mount, I was blown away. Or when I saw a Rogue stealth and disappear in front of me my jaw dropped.\nDuring the Overwatch reveal trailer you could see the audience go nuts, when Tracer used recall or Hanzo climbed up a wall.\n\nWhen you view a game like Overwatch and you see Junkrat shooting his grenades or Torbj\u00f6rn building a turret... It's an entirely different experience than when you play the game yourself and get confronted with the need to get better at the game, learn the maps... and see all the new stuff in the game. And especially when you see how different skill levels affect the same heroes. A hero like Genji has two projectiles and three abilities, but there are dimensions worth of skill difference between a high skilled Genji and a mediocre one.\n\nAnd all of that is just so appealing. \n", "edited": 1492365598.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role does communication play in Overwatch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; play a very important role, because it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; allow a team to focus on one thing.\nUsually, when you play with a bunch of randoms (and especially for the first time) ideas and thoughts are all over the place.

Often in Competitive on PS4 there's not much communication, but even one person saying something and everyone using the Quick Chat options can help.\n\n**What impact does poor communication have on gameplay?**\n\nA lack of/poor communication basically leaves a match up to how well your team's characters sync with one another and the players' skill. From my experience it isn't really a make or break thing; think of it as someone not getting the pickles they wanted on their burger. However I imagine at higher ranks it becomes a lot more detrimental.\n\n**What are some key things you need to communicate with others, in order to be successful in the game?**\n\nKnowing when certain characters have ult can really help to build combos. When playing a Tank I like to know when my Healers are in danger or caught out of position so I can help. If I'm playing with Zarya as Reinhardt I like to know when she has her bubble off cooldown so I can try to get something started.\n\n**Does vocabulary effect gameplay?**\n\nKind of hard to say for me personally, but I think most people understand my callouts. I think using terms that are at least close or heavily relate to the actual name of things should be fine.\n\n**What makes a perfect \u201cMeta\u201d for you?**\n\nPersonally I like 2/2/2. I really can't give a solid reason as to why; it just feels like everyone has a chance to shine and prove their mettle.\n\n**Why are some heroes looked down upon, compared to others?**\n\nHigh skill floors and ceilings, skills that feel \"cheap\" (take away from the fun of the game), adherence to the \"meta\" or what the pros are using.\n\nYou'll come back into play one day, Torbjorn. :(\n\n**Are there things about Overwatch that you\u2019ve had to explain to an outsider viewing the game? Can you give an example if you have one? No worries if not.**\n\nBesides for why I suck at the game? How heavily the game depends on teamwork. A good amount of my friends that picked up the game came from CoD which is more individual focus at the average level.

However I imagine at higher ranks it becomes a lot more detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some key things you need to communicate with others, in order to be successful in the game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing when certain characters have ult can really help to build combos. When playing a Tank I like to know when my Healers are in danger or caught out of position so I can help. If I&amp;#39;m playing with Zarya as Reinhardt I like to know when she has her bubble off cooldown so I can try to get something started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does vocabulary effect gameplay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of hard to say for me personally, but I think most people understand my callouts. I think using terms that are at least close or heavily relate to the actual name of things should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes a perfect \u201cMeta\u201d for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I like 2/2/2. I really can&amp;#39;t give a solid reason as to why; it just feels like everyone has a chance to shine and prove their mettle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are some heroes looked down upon, compared to others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;High skill floors and ceilings, skills that feel &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; (take away from the fun of the game), adherence to the &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot; or what the pros are using.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll come back into play one day, Torbjorn. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there things about Overwatch that you\u2019ve had to explain to an outsider viewing the game? Can you give an example if you have one? No worries if not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides for why I suck at the game? How heavily the game depends on teamwork. A good amount of my friends that picked up the game came from CoD which is more individual focus at the average level. One in particular would fume whenever he died but continued to rush in recklessly figuring Tracer didn&amp;#39;t need anyone&amp;#39;s assistance to get kills. I tried to explain that having the rest of the team draw most of the attention before you do Tracer stuff helps, but he just kinda gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgbyzyb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492374028.0, "created_utc": 1492345228.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7z6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4wx2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Flats3", "parent_id": "t3_65n7z6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1.
