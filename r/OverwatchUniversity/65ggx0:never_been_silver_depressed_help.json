If you swipe your mouse from left to right 100% across your mousepad it should turn your character between 180-360\u00b0. No farther, no less. You want to be able to do a 180, but you don't ever need to spin more than 360, and this will make it so you can essentially use half of your mousepad for turning.\n\n* Incorporate strafing into your movement more. You should never be holding down only W or only S. Always incorporate some lateral movement. Don't stand in 1 spot. Always be a difficult target.\n\n* Aim for the head. Take your time with your shots. Keep your crosshair at head level.\n\n* Lower your video settings to low to squeeze out as much FPS as you can. You should be over 60 FPS at all times. The higher the better. I stay between 100-200, most pro players and streamers I see are between 150-300 if they have high end gear. You don't need THAT high end hardware to be better than Bronze and I wouldn't recommend you go out and spend a bunch of money on your PC unless you have the money to spare, because hardware alone will not get you to GM... but it doesn't hurt. People CAN do well with 25 FPS, but it will hold you back and cause you to die/miss shots that you would normally hit.\n\n* Learn all of the heroes in the game. You don't have to be an expert at them but you should at least understand their fundamentals. What their abilities do, the limitations of their abilities, how long the cooldowns are, etc etc. \n\n* USE YOUR ABILITIES WISELY.. Don't just use cooldowns as soon as they're up. Don't Wraith form as Reaper just because you have it. Don't Rocket with Soldier unless it's to finish a kill. Don't Ice-block as Mei just because.. Don't charge with Reinhardt just because. Don't fly to another hero with Mercy just because you can. All of your actions should have a purpose. Roadhog hooked you? Jam on your LShift as Reaper/Mei to iceblock/wraith, and have an escape route planned.\n\n* Positioning. I know everyone says this and a lot of people don't actually understand it. Positioning is more than high ground. It's positioning yourself in a way to increase your effectiveness while decreasing enemy effectiveness. Use cover. Don't stand out in the open. Don't overextend into the enemy team (IE - don't become surrounded or put yourself in a place where your team can't help you.) \n\n* Don't fight fights that you can't win. Period. You aren't superman. Winning a 2v1 or 3v1 is rare. The 3 players have to royally screw up, for you to win. Assume they won't screw up.\n\n* Group up with your team. You may say \"My team just runs in without me!\".. Okay, so wait for them at spawn, once they spawn, walk in with them.\n\n* PRACTICE. Practice in 3v3's. Practice in QP. Practice in 1v1's. Practice vs bots in Custom games. Make the time you spend in the game USEFUL. I always roll my eyes at people in quick-play who pick Symmetra. Nothing against her as a hero, but playing Symmetra will not improve your aim. Practice heroes that take actual skill. Playing as Mercy/Lucio/Reinhardt/Winston/Symmetra will NOT improve your aim.\n\n* Find a mentor. A higher level player (Preferably above diamond) that can review your VODS, QP with you, 3v3 with you, and overall give you advice and help to answer questions and keep your head in the game. Not to carry you... but to give you valid criticism. I say above diamond because there are a lot of players out there who, while decent at the game themselves, don't understand the \"right\" and \"wrong\" way to play. \n\nThere is a Discord community I am a part of that helps Bronze players. We have \"professors\" that are between 3000-4000 SR. I'm 3800 myself. We have events such as training and tournaments and we get the bronze players to queue together for comp and we review their vods and try to help them out.\n\nIf you're interested in this, unfortunately you have to meet a few criteria\n\n1. Be on PC.\n2. Be in NA\n3. Be in the West/Central time zones (for ping reasons)\n4. Be over 18.\n5. Get decent FPS and have a functional system. We can't help you as well if you can't record vods or if you get 11 FPS. There's not much we can tell you other than \"Wow your FPS killed you there, get a better PC.\"\n\nSend me a direct message if fit that criteria and want to join us.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been helping a lot of bronze players lately and I can sum up most of their problems in a few key points&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity.

We have &amp;quot;professors&amp;quot; that are between 3000-4000 SR. I&amp;#39;m 3800 myself. We have events such as training and tournaments and we get the bronze players to queue together for comp and we review their vods and try to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in this, unfortunately you have to meet a few criteria&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be on PC.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be in NA&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be in the West/Central time zones (for ping reasons)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be over 18.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get decent FPS and have a functional system. We can&amp;#39;t help you as well if you can&amp;#39;t record vods or if you get 11 FPS. There&amp;#39;s not much we can tell you other than &amp;quot;Wow your FPS killed you there, get a better PC.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Send me a direct message if fit that criteria and want to join us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgablnv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261920.0, "created_utc": 1492233120.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ggx0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ggx0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ggx0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgacw6j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fallenswarm", "parent_id": "t1_dga8wcf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree on point #2.

I placed and maintained gold in S2, placed silver and climbed to gold in S3, and placed bronze this season and I'm almost back into gold again. So since I have a little bit of experience clawing my way out of bronze this season maybe I can offer some sort of helpful advice, but keep in mind I'm just a gold level player. \n\n- Make sure you are using the correct sensitivity for you. Set aside about an hour and follow the instructions in [this video](https://youtu.be/GRFWLJazYYo). This will give you a mouse sensitivity that feels natural to you without warming up. \n\n- Speaking of warming up...You should warm up before you play a comp game. Go into the practice range and practice hitting headshots by flicking. Don't just hold your crosshairs static over the bots head and fire but aim away and flick to the head and shoot, then aim away again, and flick back and shoot. Also don't just stand still, you won't be standing still in a real game so don't practice standing still. I recommend McCree for this but any hit scan hero will work. \n\n- Speaking of headshots...when I first started playing I didn't really think about what I was doing and I would just \"pray and spray\" without really aiming to do anything but land shots. After consciously forcing myself to focus on head shots my damage output was greatly increased which also increased my elims which lead to more favorable team fights for my team. \n\n- As others have said make sure you auto join team chat and make sure you use team chat. In bronze you might be the only person talking but it doesn't mean you teammates aren't listening. You can still call out the reaper that's on your healer or the pharah who is trying to flank to ulti your team, sometimes your team will focus and take care of those types of problems, and other times they won't but even one game where your team focuses is one more than they would have if you hadn't said something. This is the easiest way to win more games at low levels. When the voice chat is dead you are most likely going to lose because the other team probably has at least one person willing to make some call outs. \n\n- What hero should you play? Well there's the tried and true play what you're best at but in bronze that leads to teams like 4 flankers who all think they can solo carry and run off by themselves, 1 zen who doesn't know he has a healing orb, and 1 rein who thinks every team needs a rein even though none of the DPS will stand behind his shield. So my suggestion is put in the time to do your best with 3 heroes, 1 DPS, 1 off tank, and 1 healer. Eventually work your way up to being comfortable with 6 heroes 2 of each category so you can be more flexible and switch heroes mid game to counter the other team. \n\n- My personal suggestions for heroes that are best suited to get you out of bronze are (in no particular order): Soldier 76 - can heal himself, can output tremendous damage if you can consistently Land shots on target, and has a very easy to use \u00falt that charges quickly and can be used 6-7 times per round easily; Pharah - if you can get comfortable with the flight mechanics you can absolutely destroy enemy teams from the flank, an unchecked Pharah in bronze can swing team fights with ease; Mei - ice wall can divide the enemy team in choke points making it easier for your team to deal with fewer enemies at once, ice block can heal yourself, and her ult can get solo team kills in the right situations; Dva - highly mobile and able to move in quick to take out a squishy support and fly away to heal up, defense matrix eats almost everything and once you know what to look out for you can stop ults from Pharah, Reaper, Soldier, Zarya, Hanzo, and McCree while also being useful to protect teammates from things like rockets and fire strikes, Dva also essentially has two lives since she ejects when her mech is destroyed which really adds to her sustain; Zarya - there a few things more frightening in overwatch than a high charge Zarya since her damage output is tremendous, one of the best ults in the game and easiest to combo with teammates, protective barrier and high amount of shields add to sustain; Roadhog - can regularly heal himself for half of his max hp, able to easily punish enemies who are out of position as well as creating situations in which enemies are out of position with his hook, his weapon is great at melting enemy shields;  Mercy - easy to play just left click and heal, mobile as long as teammates stay where you can see them, Rez can win games by itself as long as people die on the point; Zenyatta - while not capable of solo healing his heals are good enough if you have a mercy or Ana, ult is capable of saving your entire team, discord orb is obviously the reason to play zen and if you don't want to call out targets just do your best to put it on any enemy who is taking damage. \n\n- Really try your best to not tilt. If I lose two games in a row I will either quit for the night or switch over to arcade where there's no pressure and play something like mystery heroes where variance has just as much impact on the round as skill.  After I'm calmed down I'll get back into comp with better focus. \n\nWell this got really long but I hope there is something of use to you in all of that. Best of luck with your climb. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the frustration over ranking. I placed and maintained gold in S2, placed silver and climbed to gold in S3, and placed bronze this season and I&amp;#39;m almost back into gold again. So since I have a little bit of experience clawing my way out of bronze this season maybe I can offer some sort of helpful advice, but keep in mind I&amp;#39;m just a gold level player. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are using the correct sensitivity for you. Set aside about an hour and follow the instructions in &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/GRFWLJazYYo\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. This will give you a mouse sensitivity that feels natural to you without warming up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of warming up...You should warm up before you play a comp game. Go into the practice range and practice hitting headshots by flicking. Don&amp;#39;t just hold your crosshairs static over the bots head and fire but aim away and flick to the head and shoot, then aim away again, and flick back and shoot. Also don&amp;#39;t just stand still, you won&amp;#39;t be standing still in a real game so don&amp;#39;t practice standing still. I recommend McCree for this but any hit scan hero will work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of headshots...when I first started playing I didn&amp;#39;t really think about what I was doing and I would just &amp;quot;pray and spray&amp;quot; without really aiming to do anything but land shots. After consciously forcing myself to focus on head shots my damage output was greatly increased which also increased my elims which lead to more favorable team fights for my team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As others have said make sure you auto join team chat and make sure you use team chat. In bronze you might be the only person talking but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you teammates aren&amp;#39;t listening. You can still call out the reaper that&amp;#39;s on your healer or the pharah who is trying to flank to ulti your team, sometimes your team will focus and take care of those types of problems, and other times they won&amp;#39;t but even one game where your team focuses is one more than they would have if you hadn&amp;#39;t said something. This is the easiest way to win more games at low levels. When the voice chat is dead you are most likely going to lose because the other team probably has at least one person willing to make some call outs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What hero should you play? Well there&amp;#39;s the tried and true play what you&amp;#39;re best at but in bronze that leads to teams like 4 flankers who all think they can solo carry and run off by themselves, 1 zen who doesn&amp;#39;t know he has a healing orb, and 1 rein who thinks every team needs a rein even though none of the DPS will stand behind his shield.
