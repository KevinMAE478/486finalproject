This is bad because the enemy will also get a nice view of your turret and can easily deal with it with several characters (Ana, Widow, Hanzo, Pharrah, Soldier, Mei, Orissa, Lucio all can deal with a turret from behind cover or outside of its range). \n  Instead, Toblerones should be setting up their turrets in places that will either support your backline when a flanker dives (Winstons, less so) or that will cause the enemy to divide their attention. It&amp;#39;s also really important to switch the turret around constantly or the enemy will simply adapt to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second issue is a bit harder to fix. Since the turret is very likely giving you a bunch of assists, it&amp;#39;s easy to think that you&amp;#39;re doing work with Torb, when in reality it&amp;#39;s not a great help to your team. Make sure to switch characters early when the dwarf doesn&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgdddv2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492457099.0, "created_utc": 1492428299.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tz8r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdj96t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RazzPitazz", "parent_id": "t3_65tz8r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No character is a troll pick until they suck with that character.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No character is a troll pick until they suck with that character.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgdj96t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467734.0, "created_utc": 1492438934.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tz8r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tz8r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tz8r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dget190", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DtonTheAwesome", "parent_id": "t1_dgech4y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "True.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;True.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dget190", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492525736.0, "created_utc": 1492496936.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgech4y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "falconfetus8", "parent_id": "t1_dgd998x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That won't stop your team from throwing as soon as you pick them.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#39;t stop your team from throwing as soon as you pick them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dgech4y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492502159.0, "created_utc": 1492473359.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd998x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DtonTheAwesome", "parent_id": "t3_65tz8r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you're good then it isn't a troll pick.

Heroes that will jump in and distract the enemy team long enough for you to place a level 2 turret down. If you can get a nice turret down that has great sight lines to the enemy team you can punish them for not focusing you. Molten core and it's pretty easy to dive. \n\nHe is great on Defense for both the \"deathball\" and \"dive.\" Winston can do work on Torb only if he doesnt have a level 2 turret up. A Torb can easily defend himself against a Winston solo.\n\nAs for the other flankers Genji and Tracer can be thrown off their game with a good turret placement.\n\n**The biggest obstacle to overcome** is to calm your team when they think you are \"throwing\" or trolling. You have to get them to trust the Torb pick and tell them that you will switch if it isn't working. In my case I do not switch since I am keeping this account literally Torb only. Which is beginning to help the troll calls because they will look me up and see I only play Torb and realize that with a 65% win rate something has to be going right.\n\nEdit: I hope to reach GM this week and I will be constructing a guide/personal theory on Torb. My end game is to reach top 500 as Torb only.

Heroes that will jump in and distract the enemy team long enough for you to place a level 2 turret down. If you can get a nice turret down that has great sight lines to the enemy team you can punish them for not focusing you. Molten core and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to dive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is great on Defense for both the &amp;quot;deathball&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dive.&amp;quot; Winston can do work on Torb only if he doesnt have a level 2 turret up. A Torb can easily defend himself against a Winston solo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the other flankers Genji and Tracer can be thrown off their game with a good turret placement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest obstacle to overcome&lt;/strong&gt; is to calm your team when they think you are &amp;quot;throwing&amp;quot; or trolling. You have to get them to trust the Torb pick and tell them that you will switch if it isn&amp;#39;t working. In my case I do not switch since I am keeping this account literally Torb only.
