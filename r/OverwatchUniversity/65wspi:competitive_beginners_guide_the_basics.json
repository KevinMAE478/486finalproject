This is going to be really basic for anyone that has already started competitive, so this first part is really only for anyone that is new to the game in general. The video can be found here (but I will summarize below): &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/d76iMHcgIh8\"&gt;https://youtu.be/d76iMHcgIh8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing your graphics settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be some varying opinions on this but the simple answer is that you want to maximize the FPS you get while making sure it is consistent. Working in fullscreen or borderless window is good while turning off vsync and triple buffering. Vsync will add input lag which isn&amp;#39;t good in an FPS like Overwatch. In general, you should be lean toward using the low settings. I think it is important to get this setup and try out a few games to make sure the game is smooth and comfortable to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing your mouse and keyboard controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of room to talk about preferred keys for different abilities and luckily Overwatch provides tons of customization options. You should take the time to consider what scheme is best for you and that you are comfortable clicking any of your buttons without looking at the keyboard. Also, make sure to consider some hot keys for a few of the group call outs like the button for ultimate status and need healing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training area to mess with your abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t already done so, it is very valuable to spend time with your favorite heroes testing their limits in the training area. This is the best distraction free place for messing with your character. You can see the range of your abilities and try killing the bots quickly as a warm up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quick play is the closest analogue to competitive even if teams are less coordinated. If you haven&amp;#39;t reached level 25 yet, make sure you put a good amount of time into quick play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the arcarde (3v3)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The arcade always has fun stuff to try out, but I would highly recommend a good chunk of time into 3v3. It is a great way to learn hero counters and chemistry with random teammates. You can quickly learn favorable compositions and how to pay attention to the whole battlefield. Also, dueling is easier to work on with a limited amount of opposition instead of the chaos of 6v6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team chat and block/reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like sometimes this concept gets glossed over but communication is important in a team game. At lower levels, you can work with some of the in-game commands for communicating, but there is a lot more fun to be had by being in team chat and working together better. If you have a mic, it can really help out a ton. However you should not expect 100% of people to be friendly. Generally I have a good experience, but if you run into negative behaviors or trolls, there are options for getting rid of this communication. You can easily go into the party menu (default key is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) and mute chat. You can also mute the voice of players individually. This will allow you to hear other players while only muting the offending player. If a player continues to harass you or create a negative experience, there are new reporting tools that allow you to be specific about the problem, so use it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR If you consider each of the categories above, you will be in good shape for your first competitive game. There is still a ton more to talk about, but hopefully this guide would be the first step for a complete beginner. If you have any questions please feel free to let me know and me (or hopefully someone else on this reddit) will be happy to assist.
