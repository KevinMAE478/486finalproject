BUT your tiny aura range means you'll be doing nothing for your team if you lose them to snatch a kill. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Trading heals/speed on your team to play a 2nd rate Tracer/Genji is a bad decision.

But that is not the priority.\n\n-Following from that point, just whizzing around on walls away from your team. Kiting a Genji half way round the map is fun but doesn't really help.\n\nDo's:\n\n-Stick with your team a bit more, the extra healing is super useful and your Ult will build much faster\n\n-Use your wall ride to speed between teammates if you're spread out, then switch to healing like a health pack mortar\n\n-Use wall ride to contest the point to stall; you're pretty unkillable now\n\n-Save amp it up heals for tanks / when you're grouped together - it's actually really valuable now\n\n-Make sure you communicate when you're going to speed boost the team to initiate, you need to be grouped up together for it to work. It is no longer a 1 button win.\n\n\nOverall thoughts: Essentially more impact since the healing, booping and DPS are improved, but essentially makes Lucio less viable as he is forced into the action more and the small aura-ranges make team work essential to guarantee value.

Even more than Reinhardt I feel like I need side mirrors because I&amp;#39;m spending way too much time spinning around and checking where my teammates are and if they&amp;#39;re in range before I amp up. Improved mobility is great but I rarely get to use it because if opponents pop ults and I&amp;#39;m not stacked with my team they&amp;#39;re fucked and I&amp;#39;m to blame for playing JSR instead of countering with speed or sound barrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said though, it&amp;#39;s still too early to tell and I may just need to adjust and spend some extensive time practicing and getting used to new mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dg5j52s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492004346.0, "created_utc": 1491975546.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u6op", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5t77i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "unluckycandy", "parent_id": "t3_64u6op", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He will be harder to play for you because his range is small.
