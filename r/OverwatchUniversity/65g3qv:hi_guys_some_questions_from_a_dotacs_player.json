If people are giving you an exceptionally hard time just switch to Mccree for that game or just mute them. Focus on doing your job and doing it well it's all you can do, don't take blame and don't give blame.\n\n3) Sit back and snipe. Unless you're the only one that can contest. It's your tanks job to contest mainly, you want to keep distant from enemies whenever possible.\n\n4) You should always avoid dying until it means giving up the point. You being on a kill streak means nothing you shouldn't really pay attention to you being on fire or your kill streak that does nothing it's just makes you feel good. But your job is to protect the objective wether you need to get on to contest or you get kills off the point while your tanks and other dps contest, you need to protect the point.\n\n5) The ticker moves faster the more people that are on it until the 3rd person. The 4th person doesn't make the ticker move any faster (this is why you will hear people say \"keep 3 on cart\"). If anyone on the other team is on the point the ticker will not move. That's what contesting is. You get percent when you have teammates on the objective and the enemy doesn't.\n\n6) This is complex and you just need to know what the counters to all the heroes are. Look up guides for this on YouTube. I will say though just cause you have a counter doesn't mean you need to switch if it's not successfully countering you. For example a widow, soldier, and mccree counter pharah but you shouldn't switch just cause the enemy has a soldier but if they have several counters you should probably switch. Likewise you shouldn't switch off genji if they only have a monkey but if they have monkey mei zarya and symmetra you definitely should. \n\n7) Generally everyone in the offense and defense categories are DPS and tanks are tanks supports are heals. There are exceptions like sym doesn't heal obviously so you'll need a mercy or Ana. Another important concept to understand is there are off tanks and main tanks. Main tanks are rein and Winston (idk about Orisa yet) and you build your team around them. You dive with the Winston or you stand behind reins shield. Off tanks secure kills, block damage (matrix, bubbles), get people off high ground (dva), ult well (zarya grav). They're a bit of a different class than main tanks. At least one of your DPS should be a hitscan in the case of a Pharah. Skyline has a great video on roles that explains way more thoroughly.\n\n8) Watch VODS, browse this sub, watch pro players stream, etc. Honestly look at your deaths and losses and assess what you did wrong. Anytime you die ask yourself what you can do to avoid dying next time (poor positioning, predictable movement, didn't pay attention to cool downs and got hooked, slept, flashed, etc, took a bad fight, honestly just missed shots in a favorable matchup). Other than that I would most highly recommend skylines YouTube channel. But watch VODS and be honest with yourself.\n\n9,10) Honestly the answer to these is more time in the game and watching educational YouTube videos such as Skyline or MindFuzz. But play more.\n\nLastly, I know you think your strength is in hitscan aim because of your previous experience, but don't be afraid to play projectiles and tanks just cause they aren't like that. They are fun and you learn a lot playing heroes that aren't widow and mccree. Zarya and Roadhog are tanks but they are basically DPS in many ways (doing DPS comes second to something like giving good bubbles), but a high charged zarya does a ton of damage. Don't be afraid to experiment with heroes that don't necessarily play to your strengths right now, otherwise you can play Ana and zarya for heals and tanks, both require great aim and have super high game impact potential (the same if not more than a DPS does).\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The meta is actually a little undefined at the moment but I would say if it&amp;#39;s anything it&amp;#39;s 2-2-2 (2 DPS 2 Tank 2 Healers).

They are fun and you learn a lot playing heroes that aren&amp;#39;t widow and mccree. Zarya and Roadhog are tanks but they are basically DPS in many ways (doing DPS comes second to something like giving good bubbles), but a high charged zarya does a ton of damage. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to experiment with heroes that don&amp;#39;t necessarily play to your strengths right now, otherwise you can play Ana and zarya for heals and tanks, both require great aim and have super high game impact potential (the same if not more than a DPS does).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dga2x4q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492248399.0, "created_utc": 1492219599.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g3qv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2gvt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LuminescentMoon", "parent_id": "t3_65g3qv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "People don't like teammates playing widow because if you can't consistently and frequently lands shots, you'll have 0 presence in the game.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#39;t like teammates playing widow because if you can&amp;#39;t consistently and frequently lands shots, you&amp;#39;ll have 0 presence in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OverwatchUniversity", "name": "t1_dga2gvt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247772.0, "created_utc": 1492218972.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ejpe", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g3qv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga7oql", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rap_my_post_pls", "parent_id": "t3_65g3qv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OverwatchUniversity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Others have answered your questions pretty well, but I'd like to add that you should try out every role to get a better understanding of the game.

Sometimes you have to bite the bullet.\n\nIf you have a killstreak it doesn't matter if you die or not. Well, let me rephrase that. Dying is usually bad.

You going to tell them \"fuck off, I only play X\"? Or are you going to concede to their higher skill rating, and pick the best hero for your team? \n\nThat's just one reason why it's good to have a deep hero pool which consists of several different DPS/Tanks/Healers. Sometimes it's just best to fill.\n\nIf you are very good at aiming and need supports to learn I would recommend Zen and Ana. Ana is almost always good (especially the tankier your team is.), and Zen is good on defense on 2CP and good with Dive comps.
