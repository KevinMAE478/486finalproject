I would say, a lot of the times we lose a fight, it's because I died and couldn't provide primary healing to my teammates. One idea of good positioning is when you are on Numbani Defense for the first point - if you're healing by the bridge area, your ability to survive is a lot higher. If you're near the front lines, you will die a lot faster. Being more far behind in general as Ana allows you to survive better, because the enemy has to go all the way through your enemies to get to you. That said, \"staying back\" isn't universal, as in some maps, you staying back means flankers can get to you easier, like in Pit of Ilios - Roadhogs/Tracers can delete you easily. \n\nSo I would say, depending on your class, learn the optimal positions of where you should be that increases your chance of survival.
