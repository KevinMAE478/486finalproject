Last season you would see a lot of people saying &amp;quot;the meta doesn&amp;#39;t matter&amp;quot; or something to that effect. This season, there&amp;#39;s a lot less of that due to a much less rigid meta. But there is still a meta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is - &lt;strong&gt;the meta does matter&lt;/strong&gt; and it always will. What the pros are playing doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily apply to you but what your opponents are playing in Bronze, Gold, Masters or Top 500 &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; apply. The meta isn&amp;#39;t a list of S tier heroes. It&amp;#39;s using out-of-game knowledge to affect in-game decisions. So you see a lot of Junkrat mains in Platinum? Guess what - that&amp;#39;s the meta. There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Mercy mains in Masters and GM right now... guess what - that&amp;#39;s meta too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing what the meta is in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; rank gives you a huge advantage over the opponent. You don&amp;#39;t have control over what your opponents do. You don&amp;#39;t even have control over what your teammates do. But understanding what people are picking and what strategies they are running help you make decisions to better your chances of winning. Are you victim to Meis walling off your team constantly on 2CP maps? You can use that to your advantage with a good understanding of metagaming. Pharmercy a problem? Facing and dealing with that is also in the realm of metagaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The meta isn&amp;#39;t even a list of pick rates in certain tiers. What matters is your individual games. For example - running Ana and Mercy together leaves both healers relatively ult starved and leaves your team with no speed boost. Most pro teams would never do this (as is exemplified by the near 100% pick rate of Lucio) yet you see it in matchmaking games all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The video isn&amp;#39;t a guide on to how to play the &amp;quot;metagame&amp;quot; - it&amp;#39;s a discussion of what metagaming is and how it affects matchmaking.
