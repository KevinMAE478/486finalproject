The Roadhog I had been working with was really the only decent one but he didn&amp;#39;t seem to see what I was seeing, and for some reason started piling on validation to the Mercy for being sole healer during the last round.  Probably because he was getting epic heals on Roadhog and that doesn&amp;#39;t usually happen.   So we lost, everyone determined that I sucked, the Mercy got epic recs on a card for 24% damage taken when she was sole healer meaning it should&amp;#39;ve been at least 37% or more  (I don&amp;#39;t even know how she got a card...?) and I was just like, what a shitty match, block block block block block.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not even indicative of a bronze match, that was just a team whose behavioral issues got in the way off winning.  That happens, usually it&amp;#39;s with younger people but occasionally with adults.

I kind of feel like my aim is good for my rank, and my positioning is good for my rank. I do get caught, but not as much as some of my teammates. I try to coordinate with my team and call out important information. But I still don't understand how to transition from \"we're stuck at the choke\" to \"we're taking the point\". It's just something that seems to happen somewhat randomly. Maybe we win the shield fight. Maybe we get some lucky picks. Maybe somebody lands a clutch ult. But a lot of the time, it just seems to sort of... happen.\n\nSimilarly, my team gets completely wrecked in some matches and I don't necessarily understand what we needed to do. I see a lot of advice here to \"just play the hero you're best at\", but I'm not sure that's the best advice. I've sometimes find that switching to a hero that I don't play very much is the thing we need to turn the tables. When the enemy team is shield heavy, a sudden Bastion can really turn the tides. When the enemy team is surrounding you, a few ice walls can really help to direct the battle.
