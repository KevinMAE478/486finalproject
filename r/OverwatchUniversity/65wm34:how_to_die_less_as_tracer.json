As you see x hero rotate towards you, you can blink either through them or to the left or right to exit their LoS and continue dealing damage without taking as much damage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick -&amp;gt; Get out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With tracer&amp;#39;s extremely limited health pool, it is important that if you&amp;#39;re going for a solo kill you have a plan on how to immediately disengage at a moments notice. You&amp;#39;re very likely nearly out of blinks and/or recall, making it not only much more difficult to secure kills, but also much more difficult to survive. Wait the 6 seconds (&lt;strong&gt;Never start a fight without at least two blinks&lt;/strong&gt;) and then reengage if you believe you can get a good pick. If you want to &amp;quot;stay in the fight&amp;quot; while your blinks are recharging, you can use that time to begin moving towards a different position to poke from during your next engagement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observe -&amp;gt; Execute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Notice the enemy team is diving on your friendly neighborhood Rein, leaving the ana or Mercy exposed in the back? See a desperate S76 out of position moving to grab a healthpack? Notice a roadhog with his back turned focusing one of your teammates? As Tracer you must be constantly observing the flow of combat to spot enemy positioning which you can exploit, without a high degree of game-sense it will be extremely difficult to perform well. If this is something you feel you need practicing on, try playing a support for a bit.
