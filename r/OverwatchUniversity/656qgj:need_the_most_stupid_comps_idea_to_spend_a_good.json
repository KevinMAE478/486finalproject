Here's my analysis of the comp:\n\n**Core of the comp; these are always there:**\n\n* Mercy - Your primary healer who also damage boosts Symmetra. Avoid going battle Mercy because damage boosted Symmetra is much more effective\n\n* Lucio - Stays primarily on speed boost but healing is much more useful now with the rework. Make sure you're spamming shots constantly.\n\n* Symmetra - One of two primary DPS. Kill things with auto aim, speed boost, and damage boost\n\n**Recommended 4th and 5th members of the comp:**\n\n* Zenyatta - Discord + Symmetra = death everywhere. Zen is your other primary DPS\n\n* Zarya - Bubbles pair very well with an overly aggressive Symmetra. Zarya is your secondary DPS, but has a crucial role in protecting your squishy team from massive burst damage\n\n**Possible options for 6th member:**\n\n* Ana - Use Ana just so you can say you have a full five support comp, and also because nano-Symmetra is fucking terrifying. Her nade and sleep dart are very good, but sleep is difficult to leverage with Symmetra's turrets and nade isn't super necessary if you're diving the healers first. Additionally, the damage nerf has significantly hurt her in this lineup.\n\n* Junkrat - Bombs all over the ground mean that close combat with this comp is going to end badly for the other team. Also, the buff to his self damage has made him incredibly lethal in this fast deathball\n\n* Reaper - Excellent in close quarters combat, and has very good self sustain. Also good for countering Winston.\n\n* Pharah - Pharah/Mercy + Symmetra is a little much for most teams to handle well\n\n* Mei - It really sucks to be frozen by Mei so that Symmetra can slow you down and melt you. Also, if the thought of being trapped by an ice wall with a Mei and Symmetra doesn't scare you ... well, nothing will.\n\n* Torbjorn - Need more cheese or anti-flanker stuff? Don't forget that armor + shield gen = additional 150 health, and that shields take damage before armor, so the armor is not likely to get chipped down.\n\n* Soldier: 76 - Good, reliable damage and can provide healing for his team (essentially acts as an additional half healer)\n\n* Dva - Used to counter any snipers or Pharahs the other team might pull on you\n\n**Strategy**\n\nThis comp relies on overwhelming the other team with the sheer shock of a four/five support comp in addition to the mobility and small hitboxes the team provides. Priority targets are DPS, healers, and anyone else silly enough to have landed in the middle of your team (usually a bad Rein charge or bad Winston jump).\n\nThis comp is also a decent anti-dive comp because Symmetra is an anti-flanker. The large amount of healing all over the place makes it hard for Genji/Tracer/Winston to burn through things, especially with Zarya and the discord orb.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nObviously, this comp is squishy. It is hard countered by snipers (Hanzo/Widow), which is when you run Dva as your 6th member. It is soft countered by burst damage such as Junkrat and Pharah, which is why Zarya is a recommended member. It is also soft countered by cleave damage such as Winston, which is why Reaper is a possible 6th member. If the enemy team wises up and uses both Widow and Winston, run Zen/Reaper/Dva; use Zen and Reaper to eliminate Winston immediately while Dva's sole job is to disrupt Widow long enough so your team can overrun the rest of them.\n\n**Ult usage**\n\nThis comp lacks strong offensive ults and relies very heavily on Symmetra, Zen, and Zarya to kill everything first. Avoid pairing Graviton Surge with any ults (as these will be your only offensive ults). Graviton Surge is best implemented after burning the Dva, which allows you to use full charge Zarya alt-fire and full charge Symmetra alt-fire to burn through the entire team in about two seconds flat.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf you do choose to run this strategy, please post vods. I want to see how the high level folks react. If you need more clarification on this, please ask me. If anyone in OWUL is reading this - good luck countering us anyways. We know how to counter our counters and we will end you anyways.\n\nEdits made for formatting and small things I forgot to add initially.", "edited": 1492162602.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRATEGY: OVERLY SUPPORTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the captain of the Overly Supportive team in OWUL, where we have gained some attention (both praise and flame) by consistently running a four/five support comp.
