I see a lot of people saying that 100/100 isn\u2019t enough, and Tracer mains saying they play with 30/20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IN MY OPINION, you should play with Dual-Zone and use something between 50 to 70 sensitivity. My actual settings are 63/63/100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to be fast at aiming and shooting. And why horizontal and vertical sensitivity is the same? I\u2019ve been testing, and I got potato aim with Pharah\u2019s because I have 65/55 or something. That 10 difference was super confusing while aiming at and will result in inconsistency. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reticle &amp;amp; Color&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people recommend the Green Dot. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s confusing, you can lose it a lot of times while in fast fights. Short-crosshairs are the best ones, the smaller yet easier ones to aim and see. For heroes like Zarya, Hanzo, Symmetra leave the default reticles. Excluding some exceptions, I don\u2019t use Bloom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your color should be Green, Cyan or Purple. Why? Because they\u2019re a lot different from the game colors in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading a lot I&amp;#39;ve found that your aiming comes with time, without pressure. There&amp;#39;s no shame in being a silver or a gold. Grand Masters were where you are now. Wrong is trying to be better than you actually are.

This can take some days until you find the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After, my suggestion is to do &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt; a Custom Game versus Ana Bots (Headshots only) in a King of The Hill map at your choice. Set it to Skirmish and take your time. Do it 15-20 minutes every day, before playing in QP or Competitive. And why this? Because Anas can&amp;#39;t headshot you, and you only can kill them with headshots. After 2 weeks you&amp;#39;ll see that you start aiming at people&amp;#39;s heads without even thinking. Perfection comes with time. Here comes an &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc5s3in80Ss\"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another way you should practice for 10-20 minutes every day is to practice on Practice Range &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; Aim Assist. Yesterday I played without Aim Assist for 30 minutes with Hanzo, and then I went to Quick Play and forgot to turn my Aim Assist on. Well, during the game I was shooting almost like I regularly did and started stressing out &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s happening? why I&amp;#39;m I worst?&amp;quot; and then I realized I was playing Hanzo without Aim Assist (I&amp;#39;m not a pro with precise heroes) and actually killing a lot. When I turned on my Aim Assist on the next game I was a god. I completely controlled the game, no roadhog, other Hanzo, McCree could counter me.
