Shipping was faster than expected - I used Taobao's consolidated shipping because I bought some other stuff at the same time. Delivery to the Taobao warehouse in Dongguan was 3 days, after paying the consolidated shipping charge then the time to delivery in my country (New Zealand) another 6 days after that.\n\n*Note: I notice the seller is now soliciting direct orders through Paypal. I did not order using this method and since it is outside Taobao, YMMV.*\n\nFor now I have no in-switch backlight LEDs because the pre-soldered SMD underglow LEDs already provide enough backlight for me as they reflect off the aluminum case and shine back up through the clear housings of the Zealio switches. The photo doesn't capture this effect well, it's more diffuse IRL, and the color temperature is deliberately a gentle warm white light for better sleep hygiene. I did buy some 3mm warm white LEDs ready to try underswitch as well as some 3mm SMD LEDs to try to mount on the underside but I'll experiment with them another day, for now this is fine.\n\nProgramming was done with the [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), it was not hard to figure out because there are [already several example keymaps for the XD60 in the QMK repo.](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/xd60) and these are easy to modify to whatever mapping you want. [This keycode testing site](http://en.key-test.ru/) was helpful to clarify which PCB holes correspond to which keys in the default keymap, and therefore which positions in the keymap itself.\n\n**Layout**\n\nObviously fitting an arrow cluster on the 60% layout there has to be a layout compromise in R4 somewhere, and you have two choices with this board. One is a 2u r-shift and 1u l-shift, the other is retaining the standard 2.25 r-shift and common 1.75 l-shift but displacing the important slash/questionmark key. Since I don't use r-ctrl or r-alt at all I replaced them with the two displaced keys slash and grave instead. Either way, the r-shift will be not only smaller, but slightly further left than usual which takes some getting used to.\n\nSpecifically if you are thinking about the 2u l-shift and 1u r-shift layout, not only will you need to order the 2u l-shift plate, consider that you will also need to find a set of keycaps that provides a 2u shift key. This is not a problem if you don't mind blank keycaps, but it was hard for me to find any set I like that includes a 2u shift key even in the typical extended set, and a 1u shift key you will definitely need a planck set as well. Either you will have to use a blank or substitute another 2u key, but I didn't get into this hobby to have to compromise on keycaps.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the interest in the recent XD60 GB some of you might be interested in this little thing I assembled last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;R4.5 78g &lt;a href=\"https://zealpc.net/\"&gt;Zealio&lt;/a&gt; switches&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-sublimated-keycap-sets/\"&gt;DSA dye-sub&lt;/a&gt; keycaps (GKK/RCB)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Custom cable by &lt;a href=\"/u/90N1NE\"&gt;/u/90N1NE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clear PCB-mount Cherry clone stabilizers &lt;a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mechanical-keyboard-cherry-mx-switch-pcb-mounted-cherry-stabilizer-clear-transparent-case-6-25u-modifier-key/32699402674.html\"&gt;from AliExpress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ordered the kit from &lt;a href=\"https://world.taobao.com/item/537485105086.htm\"&gt;Taobao&lt;/a&gt; (package 4) and also the &lt;a href=\"https://world.taobao.com/item/540806912112.htm\"&gt;silver plate&lt;/a&gt; (for this layout I needed the 2.25 l-shift). Shipping was faster than expected - I used Taobao&amp;#39;s consolidated shipping because I bought some other stuff at the same time. Delivery to the Taobao warehouse in Dongguan was 3 days, after paying the consolidated shipping charge then the time to delivery in my country (New Zealand) another 6 days after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I notice the seller is now soliciting direct orders through Paypal. I did not order using this method and since it is outside Taobao, YMMV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now I have no in-switch backlight LEDs because the pre-soldered SMD underglow LEDs already provide enough backlight for me as they reflect off the aluminum case and shine back up through the clear housings of the Zealio switches. The photo doesn&amp;#39;t capture this effect well, it&amp;#39;s more diffuse IRL, and the color temperature is deliberately a gentle warm white light for better sleep hygiene. I did buy some 3mm warm white LEDs ready to try underswitch as well as some 3mm SMD LEDs to try to mount on the underside but I&amp;#39;ll experiment with them another day, for now this is fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Programming was done with the &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware\"&gt;QMK firmware&lt;/a&gt;, it was not hard to figure out because there are &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/xd60\"&gt;already several example keymaps for the XD60 in the QMK repo.&lt;/a&gt; and these are easy to modify to whatever mapping you want. &lt;a href=\"http://en.key-test.ru/\"&gt;This keycode testing site&lt;/a&gt; was helpful to clarify which PCB holes correspond to which keys in the default keymap, and therefore which positions in the keymap itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously fitting an arrow cluster on the 60% layout there has to be a layout compromise in R4 somewhere, and you have two choices with this board. One is a 2u r-shift and 1u l-shift, the other is retaining the standard 2.25 r-shift and common 1.75 l-shift but displacing the important slash/questionmark key. Since I don&amp;#39;t use r-ctrl or r-alt at all I replaced them with the two displaced keys slash and grave instead. Either way, the r-shift will be not only smaller, but slightly further left than usual which takes some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically if you are thinking about the 2u l-shift and 1u r-shift layout, not only will you need to order the 2u l-shift plate, consider that you will also need to find a set of keycaps that provides a 2u shift key. This is not a problem if you don&amp;#39;t mind blank keycaps, but it was hard for me to find any set I like that includes a 2u shift key even in the typical extended set, and a 1u shift key you will definitely need a planck set as well. Either you will have to use a blank or substitute another 2u key, but I didn&amp;#39;t get into this hobby to have to compromise on keycaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MechanicalKeyboards", "name": "t1_dgapw38", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296502.0, "created_utc": 1492267702.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ugo7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65je2j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgawi3t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "7-nanometers", "parent_id": "t3_65je2j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MechanicalKeyboards", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Big and centered legends are so nice.
