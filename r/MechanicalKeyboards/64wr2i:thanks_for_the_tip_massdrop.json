I was an amazon-guy and i started to use Aliexpress recently because there are not mk things on amazon, did many orders already.  All my orders arrived sooner or later, i had only 2 orders with a problem:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;one that was not coming, they refunded me and the order arrived later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;seller sent wrong keycaps of the same color, this happened now and he will refund me or send a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterall i&amp;#39;m pretty happy with Aliexpress. Note for who is not using it, most of the sellers answer pretty fast to your questions and they can do custom orders for you, i even bought taobao things from aliexpress sellers.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In particular,  Vincent who sells mk things, &lt;a href=\"https://aliexpress.com/item/Wholesales-GH60-Anodizing-Aluminum-Case-for-60-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Compatible-Poker2-Pok3r-Faceu-60/32540926035.html\"&gt;60% example here&lt;/a&gt;, he is  a good seller, I bought XDA and cherry MX clear from him and I got the best price with a ironically fast shipping (considering that it is from China).    Also he always answer to you no matter what you asked.  KBDFans who sells the same case on MD,  has communication problems sometimes, but after all he is a good seller too.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MechanicalKeyboards", "name": "t1_dg5yuql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037600.0, "created_utc": 1492008800.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ugo7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wr2i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ugo7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wr2i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5tlhv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thunderbuttons", "parent_id": "t1_dg5saoq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MechanicalKeyboards", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I bought the same keyset from Massdrop a few months later and it came in ~~3 weeks.~~ okay eight.
