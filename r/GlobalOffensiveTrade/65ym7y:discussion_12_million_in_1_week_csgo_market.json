Of course adding steam money to a account without the person actually paying steam any money will make steam no money. I'm saying that they only make money when people decide to give steam real money to get steam money in return. This means that the act of selling and buying on the community market doesnt directly make them money, it's there to give people a reason to give real money to them so u can spend steam money on the market. If they made 12 million just off of steam taxes, that means there must've made a lot more than 12 million in real money. If the 12 million is only 15% of every transaction, then the other 85% must still be in circulation and for that 85% (obviously is bigger than 12 million) to be there. People must have put in that amount in real money to get that steam money in return. Basically steam only makes money when people give them real money and that must be a large amount if they collected 12 million just off of csgo transaction, not to mention other taxes they must've collected from other games and actual games they sell everyday. Lot of incentives for people to shower steam with real money eh?\n\nEdit: thought the 12 million was just from taxes alone. I'm an idiot.

Of course adding steam money to a account without the person actually paying steam any money will make steam no money. I&amp;#39;m saying that they only make money when people decide to give steam real money to get steam money in return. This means that the act of selling and buying on the community market doesnt directly make them money, it&amp;#39;s there to give people a reason to give real money to them so u can spend steam money on the market. If they made 12 million just off of steam taxes, that means there must&amp;#39;ve made a lot more than 12 million in real money. If the 12 million is only 15% of every transaction, then the other 85% must still be in circulation and for that 85% (obviously is bigger than 12 million) to be there. People must have put in that amount in real money to get that steam money in return.
