High tickrate will cause low spec PC lag, so we set it to 64-tick for more players to play. Also, our server is **128-tick compatible and will upgrade once the time is right, and will upgrade together with all other country (valve server)**\n\n3 question about how long can they play with the activation code is, it is life-time, and can participate to all **future public beta testing**\n\n4 im new to CSGO, does testing (using the activation code) needs money? \n\n&gt; no, the activation code is completely free. and you dont have to buy new CSGO to play in international server (valve server).\n\n5 does China CSGO **need to buy key** to open box?
