Yet I never see it mentioned so I guess it isn\u2019t well known or successful in english speaking countries (not so surprising when I see how they butchered the trailer). \nIt\u2019s the tale of Xavier, a student driven but kinda indecisive about what, he ends up going for an Erasmus in Barcelone. (for the non-europeans : Erasmus is an exchange student program between EU states)\nThe film was a success and two other came after it : \u00ab Russian Dolls \u00bb (2005)  and \u00ab Chinese Puzzle \u00bb (2013)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the trilogy follows Xavier\u2019s struggles through life, it\u2019s supposed to be a rom-com but it feels more about youth and growing up at large rather than specially love. The strong points are the great atmosphere, solid characters and character development. It\u2019s close to the Before trilogy with an ensemble cast around one main character. Dialogue rambles less and tries less to go deep to remain more entertaining. The comparaison holds specially since it also leaves breathing room of a few years between each film for characters to evolve before you reunite with them. As for the technical parts, the montage is the strong point of the director and it\u2019s pretty original in the three films, it adds a nice touch. I would compare it to Jeunet\u2019s montage at times (Am\u00e9lie, Delicatessen). It also uses a narrator in the same way Fight Club does, with the main character commenting on his struggles and sharing his opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spoilers ahead, if you haven\u2019t seen it, I think it\u2019s on Netflix, I recommend it specially if you\u2019re a 20-something&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the first movie encapsulates a dream of a multicultural Europe. As they all come to Barcelona for a semester, they are awakened to a broader world, one where an Italian, a German, a Dane, an English, a French, a Spanish have to live together despite being very different. The result is messy, rooms are messy, the fridge is organized chaos, but it\u2019s a mess you\u2019re attracted to. It\u2019s a mess that makes them all better people by the end of the film, what they took away from the semester isn\u2019t an academic knowledge rather than an opened mind. But this melting pot is also difficult, some can\u2019t stand disorder, others wish the first ones would let it go a bit more. And the whole melting pot is only possible because they let go of their prejudice against other nationalities, as shown with the character of William, whose immaturity doesn\u2019t respect it. Europe is after all young and millenials are the first generation to feel they have a european identity on top of their national identity&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The film directly touches directly on identity among a bigger whole in the discussion about catalan identity. The conclusion that identity adds up and makes you richer also apply to the other characters whose new-found european identity adds up to their nationality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following two movies build on multiculturalism to shape an adventurous spirit in all characters, they are not afraid to flicker from a country to another. That is true for Xavier but also for Isabelle, Wendy, William, even Martine. The struggles of the following two movies are a bit different, it\u2019s not about broadening your horizons anymore but more about the struggles of settling, now that they learned how big the world was, how do they satisfy themselves with where they are? Wherever you end up, there must be a better place somewhere. This indecisiveness is often something millennials are criticized for in the workplace. It\u2019s true for work when Xavier immediately drops the job he finally got but also translates to their love life. Isabelle also has the same struggles in her love life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole trilogy is a lot more mature about growing up than your typical teenage rom-com and I think it\u2019s more than worth a watch.
