Certainly no more so than any other site. We just segregate fields of interest so that people with different tastes don't interact as much. Secondly, I might not care for most of the Marvel films, but people have very valid reasons for enjoying them a great deal. On the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, the movies may be terrible, but they're some of the most emotionally sincere blockbusters I've seen, almost never resorting to cheap, cynical deconstruction. They may be empty-headed, but they aren't as culturally toxic as some other box office gold films. If I had to choose a franchise to have those numbers, I'd pick the F&amp;F films.\n\nAppreciation of art has not diminished: the majority of people have never cared about art. What has happened is the democratisation of art, so that those who don't care about it and think that it is synonymous with entertainment are able to vote with their wallets with just as much influence as those who care.\n\nThat said, I really enjoy Taika Waititi's films, so I will actually watch the new Thor. If that makes me unappreciative of originality or somehow less discerning in my tastes, I fail to see how. I'm not a fan of the Disney machine, but it is giving a few lesser-known directors a chance to become known to mainstream audiences, which, even if the studio movies are poor, is a good thing and deserves the support of those of us who know the difference. Drawing a line between us and \"general consumers\" will only serve to widen the gap between what we experience. It may require the film-literate to re-evaluate what we regard as \"true film\" to shift the priorities of the mainstream away from wallets and towards genuine vision.\n\nSorry if this is rambling or rude.

Certainly no more so than any other site. We just segregate fields of interest so that people with different tastes don&amp;#39;t interact as much. Secondly, I might not care for most of the Marvel films, but people have very valid reasons for enjoying them a great deal. On the Fast &amp;amp; Furious franchise, the movies may be terrible, but they&amp;#39;re some of the most emotionally sincere blockbusters I&amp;#39;ve seen, almost never resorting to cheap, cynical deconstruction. They may be empty-headed, but they aren&amp;#39;t as culturally toxic as some other box office gold films. If I had to choose a franchise to have those numbers, I&amp;#39;d pick the F&amp;amp;F films.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Appreciation of art has not diminished: the majority of people have never cared about art. What has happened is the democratisation of art, so that those who don&amp;#39;t care about it and think that it is synonymous with entertainment are able to vote with their wallets with just as much influence as those who care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I really enjoy Taika Waititi&amp;#39;s films, so I will actually watch the new Thor. If that makes me unappreciative of originality or somehow less discerning in my tastes, I fail to see how. I&amp;#39;m not a fan of the Disney machine, but it is giving a few lesser-known directors a chance to become known to mainstream audiences, which, even if the studio movies are poor, is a good thing and deserves the support of those of us who know the difference.
