I'm too lazy to describe anything or get some screen captures, but he's a master of unending, one-after-the-other subtly striking, visually interesting shots. The fatalist vision of the resistance\u2014explicitly never glamorous, stressful, meandering, formless, no big picture, no reward (except a low-key medal ceremony)\u2014is reinforced by a bleak color palette. Didn't connect with this as much as others, but I see no and have absolutely zero reasons to quarrel with its status as an essential masterpiece.\n\n**No Rating**\n\n***\n\n**Dressed to Kill** (1980) *directed by Brian De Palma*\n\nAs with *Blow Out*, the simple visual look of *Dressed to Kill* is quite striking. The faded beige tones and warm pastels with frequent soft-focus and mist/fog is the polar opposite of the sheeny, sleek darkness of the 1981 conspiracy-thriller, but equally compelling and cohesive. \n\nThe unabashed melodramatics are the same, though, as is the so-so visual direction\u2014excepting the excellent, extended Angie Dickinson\u2013led prologue, where a sexual reawakening of an unsatisfied, neglected housewife plays out, most notably via a cat-and-mouse game in a museum with an imposing stranger. The multitudinous POV shots lend a pleasing rhythmic purposefulness to the direction, and allow the formal pieces of the film to slide into place and impose their distinctive style. \n\nOnce the prologue is suddenly ended, however, things deteriorate rapidly. While it impressive how the movie has been economically linked together firmly in asides, the story lacks the mystery and thus drive of *Blow Out*, and the direction loses the POV shots and thus purpose of the beginning; the rest is a slog. Moreover, it gets unbelievably sleazy and scummy. The gross transphobia and linkage of sexual desire and death is bad enough, and infiltrates the rest of the film so that the blatant cribbing of Hitchcock (*Psycho* above all) no longer feels like homage (as in the prologue) but \"grotesque Hitchcock parody,\" the condemning of the audience of voyeurs feels less sly than just juvenile, and so on.

As with [*Hard Boiled*](https://letterboxd.com/catty_mills/film/hard-boiled), the intensely dreamy style of constantly altered perspectives, dissolves, freeze frames, slow motion, soft-focus, suffusive neon lighting, and an overpowering score wears me down and makes tracking the narrative progress a struggle. Compared to the latter film, the action scenes of *The Killer* are less insane and, to my eye, well-executed (with the notable exception of the brilliant extended Mexican standoff in Jenny's apartment), but the fiber is stronger. The ending of Ah Jong's and Jennie's desperate, wretched, futile crawling is horrifying, and paired with the prior destruction of the church in the shootout makes a genuinely firm statement about the professions and violence of the film.\n\n**No Rating**", "edited": 1492356141.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/catty_mills/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Letterboxd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Army of Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; (1969) &lt;em&gt;directed by Jean-Pierre Melville&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Melville can direct and compose the fuck out of a movie. I&amp;#39;m too lazy to describe anything or get some screen captures, but he&amp;#39;s a master of unending, one-after-the-other subtly striking, visually interesting shots. The fatalist vision of the resistance\u2014explicitly never glamorous, stressful, meandering, formless, no big picture, no reward (except a low-key medal ceremony)\u2014is reinforced by a bleak color palette. Didn&amp;#39;t connect with this as much as others, but I see no and have absolutely zero reasons to quarrel with its status as an essential masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dressed to Kill&lt;/strong&gt; (1980) &lt;em&gt;directed by Brian De Palma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;em&gt;Blow Out&lt;/em&gt;, the simple visual look of &lt;em&gt;Dressed to Kill&lt;/em&gt; is quite striking. The faded beige tones and warm pastels with frequent soft-focus and mist/fog is the polar opposite of the sheeny, sleek darkness of the 1981 conspiracy-thriller, but equally compelling and cohesive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The unabashed melodramatics are the same, though, as is the so-so visual direction\u2014excepting the excellent, extended Angie Dickinson\u2013led prologue, where a sexual reawakening of an unsatisfied, neglected housewife plays out, most notably via a cat-and-mouse game in a museum with an imposing stranger. The multitudinous POV shots lend a pleasing rhythmic purposefulness to the direction, and allow the formal pieces of the film to slide into place and impose their distinctive style. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the prologue is suddenly ended, however, things deteriorate rapidly. While it impressive how the movie has been economically linked together firmly in asides, the story lacks the mystery and thus drive of &lt;em&gt;Blow Out&lt;/em&gt;, and the direction loses the POV shots and thus purpose of the beginning; the rest is a slog. Moreover, it gets unbelievably sleazy and scummy. The gross transphobia and linkage of sexual desire and death is bad enough, and infiltrates the rest of the film so that the blatant cribbing of Hitchcock (&lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt; above all) no longer feels like homage (as in the prologue) but &amp;quot;grotesque Hitchcock parody,&amp;quot; the condemning of the audience of voyeurs feels less sly than just juvenile, and so on.

It\u2019s like a chronological *Godfather Part 2*, tracing the path of a family\u2019s revenge over 3 generations. *Gangs of Wasseypur* is one of the best things to come out of Bollywood in my mind. It subverts the usual expectations of that style of cinema, and comes out with something that is not over the top, but instead, quite grounded. Something that despite the fact that it has something like 23 original songs, it never feels like cheesy random musical numbers. It\u2019s a gritty, intense crime thriller that keeps your attention through all 5 hours. With that said, there should have been more of a focus on the changes in the rival family as well, because their development seems static throughout. Also, some key moments were SO cheesy. AKA dubstep death scene. Ruined the entire ending for me. Otherwise, very good movie.\n\n**Land of Mine** directed by Martin Pieter Zandvliet (2016) \u2605\u2605\u26051/2\n\nOne of the most intense films of last year. Nothing makes every muscle in my body go tense in quite the same way as watching children disarm mines for two hours. But in between those scenes of bombs being disarmed is a very compelling ensemble coming of age story. These POWs are children. They were Germans conscripted in the last few months of the war, young boys who never hurt anyone, who are barely into their teenage years, and who are vilified by everyone just because of their nationality. So we see their story as the general in charge of them begins to feel sympathy for their situation. And then of course we bite our nails as these characters we care about put their lives on the line, and often, lose them.\n\n*rewatch* - **Jurassic Park** directed by Steven Spielberg (1993) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGlad I revisited this because I finally understand why it\u2019s considered a classic. I LOVED it on this watch, much more than I did on a first go. Beyond the dinos being fucking unreal, this is just a collection of very interesting characters and well thought out situations. It\u2019s one of the best examples of plot, and the \u201ctherefore and but\u201d story structure. There is no plot convenience here, things happen in a logical progression, using the \u201cchaos\u201d theory that Jeff Goldblum loves talking about. Small things earlier in the movie cause big things later on. And the imagination that this film has in setting up situations that are so tense is so satisfying. Of course some of the characters are trying to get the power grid back up at the same time that other characters have to cross an electric fence to get to safety. *Jurassic Park* is so well thought out, and even if you removed the amazing special effects, would still be one of Spielberg\u2019s best.\n\n**T2 Trainspotting** directed by Danny Boyle (2017) \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe *Trainspotting* sequel may not be as good as the original, but it\u2019s so much better than a sequel this unnecessary ever should be. Danny Boyle\u2019s style is still there, and it isn\u2019t more \u201cmature\u201d or anything. This film is just as energetic and frantic as the original. It uses the same characters years after they\u2019ve abandoned their heroin habits, and as they\u2019ve found new destructive paths. They may not be on the \u201cskag\u201d anymore, but life isn\u2019t easy still. This film is much less fun than the original but it is much deeper I think. It explores themes of nostalgia and growing old, themes of friendships and grudges and forgiveness. I also loved the use of Spud in this movie. He turned into my favorite character easily. What a lovable guy. This movie does have some flaws, and it\u2019s definitely not as much fun as its predecessor, but it has a TON going for it, and is one of the best sequels that never needed to exist.\n\n*rewatch* - **My Neighbor Totoro** directed by Hayao Miyazaki (1988) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSomething like the 9th time I\u2019ve seen this, and first time since like 2011 or something. I smiled all the way through it. It\u2019s still just as enchanting as it was when I was a child. Such a beautiful movie, so full of joy and magic. I finally also understand the metaphor of the dust bunnies or \u201csoot sprites\u201d. That the reason they exist is that the house was falling apart, and these sprites will leave if a house is full of love, because the house is no longer left to rot. The fact that the neglect of the house is personified as spirits is so neat because that\u2019s exactly what kids would do. No movie *feels* like childhood in quite the same way as *My Neighbor Totoro*.\n\n**What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?** directed by Robert Aldrich (1962) \u2605\u2605\u26051/2\n\nThis movie is fucked up. Proto-*Misery*. Stephen King owes a lot to this film. A wheelchair bound victim trapped in a house by a psycho. That\u2019s terrifying. The idea behind this is just so disturbing. Being in a wheelchair, at the top of a staircase, while someone dictates your every move. No phone. No food unless they see fit to bring it. Bette Davis &amp; Joan Crawford both give incredible performances in this film. Davis being absolutely terrifying, and Crawford being so vulnerable. Only real problem with the movie is that it feels kind of uncinematic at times. Almost like it would be suited even more for stage. I don\u2019t know why that is, but the way its written feels kind of static at times. Still a very effective thriller, and a scary horror film.\n\n*rewatch* - **Shutter Island** directed by Martin Scorsese (2010) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nI\u2019m glad I rewatched this because I only thought it was good on first watch. Now I think it\u2019s one of my favorite detective movies of this decade. Scorsese outdid himself with this macabre thriller. One with twists and turns that keep you thinking the entire time. Even when I knew what was coming, the movie makes you doubt that. The journey is so effective here. Also I love watching Scorsese movies especially for the lack of adherence to continuity. He uses the best takes no matter what, it doesn\u2019t matter if someone\u2019s hand is up in one and down in the next, these flaws add to the unease at hand. Some are completely intentional, some are just Thelma Schoonmaker\u2019s masterful editing that happens to put continuity in last place in terms of importance. This film is gorgeous, the journey it takes you on is powerful, DiCaprio\u2019s performance is godly, and this is among my favorite Scorsese films now. Also the use of Max Richter\u2019s \u201cOn the Nature of Daylight\u201d throughout is such a powerful choice. I went and listened to an entire Max Richter album after the film ended.

Of course some of the characters are trying to get the power grid back up at the same time that other characters have to cross an electric fence to get to safety. &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; is so well thought out, and even if you removed the amazing special effects, would still be one of Spielberg\u2019s best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T2 Trainspotting&lt;/strong&gt; directed by Danny Boyle (2017) \u2605\u2605\u2605&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/em&gt; sequel may not be as good as the original, but it\u2019s so much better than a sequel this unnecessary ever should be. Danny Boyle\u2019s style is still there, and it isn\u2019t more \u201cmature\u201d or anything. This film is just as energetic and frantic as the original. It uses the same characters years after they\u2019ve abandoned their heroin habits, and as they\u2019ve found new destructive paths. They may not be on the \u201cskag\u201d anymore, but life isn\u2019t easy still. This film is much less fun than the original but it is much deeper I think. It explores themes of nostalgia and growing old, themes of friendships and grudges and forgiveness. I also loved the use of Spud in this movie. He turned into my favorite character easily. What a lovable guy. This movie does have some flaws, and it\u2019s definitely not as much fun as its predecessor, but it has a TON going for it, and is one of the best sequels that never needed to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;rewatch&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/strong&gt; directed by Hayao Miyazaki (1988) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something like the 9th time I\u2019ve seen this, and first time since like 2011 or something. I smiled all the way through it. It\u2019s still just as enchanting as it was when I was a child. Such a beautiful movie, so full of joy and magic. I finally also understand the metaphor of the dust bunnies or \u201csoot sprites\u201d. That the reason they exist is that the house was falling apart, and these sprites will leave if a house is full of love, because the house is no longer left to rot. The fact that the neglect of the house is personified as spirits is so neat because that\u2019s exactly what kids would do. No movie &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like childhood in quite the same way as &lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&lt;/strong&gt; directed by Robert Aldrich (1962) \u2605\u2605\u26051/2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This movie is fucked up. Proto-&lt;em&gt;Misery&lt;/em&gt;. Stephen King owes a lot to this film. A wheelchair bound victim trapped in a house by a psycho. That\u2019s terrifying. The idea behind this is just so disturbing. Being in a wheelchair, at the top of a staircase, while someone dictates your every move. No phone. No food unless they see fit to bring it. Bette Davis &amp;amp; Joan Crawford both give incredible performances in this film. Davis being absolutely terrifying, and Crawford being so vulnerable. Only real problem with the movie is that it feels kind of uncinematic at times. Almost like it would be suited even more for stage. I don\u2019t know why that is, but the way its written feels kind of static at times. Still a very effective thriller, and a scary horror film.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;rewatch&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/strong&gt; directed by Martin Scorsese (2010) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m glad I rewatched this because I only thought it was good on first watch. Now I think it\u2019s one of my favorite detective movies of this decade. Scorsese outdid himself with this macabre thriller. One with twists and turns that keep you thinking the entire time. Even when I knew what was coming, the movie makes you doubt that. The journey is so effective here. Also I love watching Scorsese movies especially for the lack of adherence to continuity. He uses the best takes no matter what, it doesn\u2019t matter if someone\u2019s hand is up in one and down in the next, these flaws add to the unease at hand. Some are completely intentional, some are just Thelma Schoonmaker\u2019s masterful editing that happens to put continuity in last place in terms of importance. This film is gorgeous, the journey it takes you on is powerful, DiCaprio\u2019s performance is godly, and this is among my favorite Scorsese films now. Also the use of Max Richter\u2019s \u201cOn the Nature of Daylight\u201d throughout is such a powerful choice. I went and listened to an entire Max Richter album after the film ended. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueFilm", "name": "t1_dgc9e58", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390649.0, "created_utc": 1492361849.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8o9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgca60d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lordsauron420", "parent_id": "t3_65p8o9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueFilm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "***Gone Girl***\n\nDirected by David Fincher\n\nSPOILERS ALERT\n\nThis is an incredible movie.

I didn't like it, felt like a chore to finish. It's one of Lynch's worst efforts, in my opinion. The story was rushed, I feel like there was a lot more to tell. Too many characters and not enough time to get to know them. And it definitely isn't a type of movie that you would expect Lynch to make. I guess he tried experimenting with a bigger, epic movie, but didn't quite make it. I give this Sci-Fi movie a **6/10**.\n\n**Blue Velvet (1986)** - Lynch redeemed himself with this one. It's a smaller movie, with a twisted story, told in a unique way with very, uh, interesting characters. It's an absurd movie, bordering on black comedy and a crime thriller. There is no real way to describe it, it's essential Lynch. The performances were great, Kyle MacLachlan was especially great, he really can carry a movie and he made a name for himself. **9/10**\n\n**No Country for Old Men (2007)** - The other great 2007 movie.

Well, you might get Javier Bardem trying to hunt you down without mercy. This movie is full of amazing performances and very questionable characters. It's a raw and deeply disturbing movie on a fundamental level with the ruthless (unnecessary) killings and the ensuing mayhem. And it's all because of money. This movie has some of the best dialogue I've seen. It is a masterpiece, but it still doesn't deserve a 10 from me, which is reserver for ultimate favorites, a**9/10**.\n\n**A Most Violent Year (2014)** - An ambitious businessman tries to protect his business in one of the most violent New York years. He refuses to do it the tough way, by fighting back. He tries to do it the peaceful way. It takes a toll on his personal life, as his wife just doesn't want to take it anymore. She is played by Jessica Chastain, who does an amazing job again. This movie has all the elements of a crime movie, yet it isn't a crime movie, it's a movie about trying to survive in a crime stricken city. **8/10**\n\n**Demolition (2015)** - What a movie, I loved it. It's a story about a banker that looses his wife in a car accident and is struggling to cope. He soon starts to open up to a customer service rep and befriends her (Naomi Watts) and her troubled son. At this point, I have to say that Naomi was criminally underused in this movie. She also just kind of disappeared at one part. The middle part of the movie was really fun, it had a completely different atmosphere than the start, but then, out of the blue, reminded me that it is not a happy movie, it's one about trying to get over a traumatic experience. The only complaint I have is, that the movie is too short, the relationship between Jake's character and that of Naomi was just not explored enough, it basically changed his life. I give it a **9/10**.\n\n**Wild at Heart (1990)** - Road trip movie, David Lynch style. Nicolas Cage being himself, just trying to be Elvis Presley, while Laura Dern wasn't anything extraordinary either. It's just a fun little movie, with some great soundtrack. **8/10**\n\n**Lost Highway (1997)** - A dreamlike, bizarre movie about a guy that (I think) kills his wife and gets jailed. He is then heavily drugged and experiences hallucinations. Well, it's hard to describe this one and I don't really have anything to say. **8/10**\n\n**The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011)** - A rewatch and one of my favorite Fincher movies. Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are great, while the supporting cast did their jobs good to. The atmosphere and the overall feeling is very Fincher-like. A remake of the Swedish (also great) movie. A great detective story, takes its time to develop characters before putting them in the same scene and get them to work together. And the movie doesn't end with the discovery of the criminal. It goes farther, the scenes after really focus on the girl with the tattoo and we see her transform. This movie draws parallels with Zodiac, another great Fincher detective story. **9/10**   \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dune (1984)&lt;/strong&gt; - Don&amp;#39;t really have much to say about this one. I didn&amp;#39;t like it, felt like a chore to finish. It&amp;#39;s one of Lynch&amp;#39;s worst efforts, in my opinion. The story was rushed, I feel like there was a lot more to tell. Too many characters and not enough time to get to know them. And it definitely isn&amp;#39;t a type of movie that you would expect Lynch to make. I guess he tried experimenting with a bigger, epic movie, but didn&amp;#39;t quite make it. I give this Sci-Fi movie a &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Velvet (1986)&lt;/strong&gt; - Lynch redeemed himself with this one. It&amp;#39;s a smaller movie, with a twisted story, told in a unique way with very, uh, interesting characters. It&amp;#39;s an absurd movie, bordering on black comedy and a crime thriller. There is no real way to describe it, it&amp;#39;s essential Lynch.

This was an actual story about economic anxiety, small town violence and ostracism, and the best depiction of paranoid schizophrenia I've seen in film. The physical presence of Chastain as his wife is scene taking. The dream sequences scared the shit out of me. Especially the simple quiet ones. The ending was kind of unnecessary but I understand why it would be there. Really good film. On par or a little bit under Prisoners. \n\n8/10\n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople 2016\n\nI busted out laughing at the eulogy scene. Taika gave himself the best lines but his story is so touching. Ricky Baker is perfect. The lines! The camaraderie. The way they pull the bolts out of rifles and keep tossing them. I was thinking today about how some lines oozed movie dialogue instead of natural speech: \"I'm like the Terminator\" but the simpleness of just showing what nurturing is in terms of a hot water bottle or a silly song is touching.

You killed a kid brutally on camera, congratulations it doesn't mean anything if you don't have a story. This film was such a mess I refused to finish it.

There was some real talent in this film it was just overlapped by a shit story. Macross Plus is better in every respect. \n\n5/10\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock 1975\n\nLegitimately terrifying. So unsettling. I love disappearance stories so this film is perfect for me. Peter Weir is an incredibly capable director. He makes almost any story worth watching. The hypnotic rhythm of this film, the heavy one sided love between one of the girls. The way Weir shows how it affects everyone. It's done in the perfect way. That rock in the story is a perfect example of making something so seemingly benign foreboding and evil. Like a maw waiting to eat you whole.

Meet the movie released the same year as Star Wars and stare into the face of what mainstream cinema was like back then. There are only a few scenes that are worth watching. They throw this snarky backtalking editor to Elliot Gould and all of his scenes are gold.

Tom Wilkinson could bring an anthropomorphic booger to life with his acting ability. A film about weakness, demasculine frailty, and stripping. What's not to love? \n\n8/10\n\nOutbreak 1995\n\nThe best disease movie I've seen yet. I thought it would be good because Hoffman's in it but it's Wolfgang Petersen who pulls it off. The cast is almost perfect. Cuba Gooding Jr plays himself of course. So does Hoffman but\u2026it's Hoffman we're talking about not Snow Dogs man. Sutherland is great, Morgan Freeman is awesome, Russo I can take or leave. Spacey is good. Parts of the film feel contrived.

The cinematography and blocking in this film is breathtaking. The story is the most incoherent and babbling bunch of loosely tied together strings I could ask for.

It was good, especially for a thriller these days. The ending is tacked on of course but most everything shown pays off. Die Hard/McGyver-esque in it's ingenuity. I loved John Gallagher as Emmett. Goodman is alright. People love him because he overacts. He always plays the same person in every film except Lebowski and then the only difference is he's Jewish.

The cinematography and blocking in this film is breathtaking. The story is the most incoherent and babbling bunch of loosely tied together strings I could ask for. Not Battle of Britain level but getting there. The siege scene must have cost a fortune to shoot. Better done than Glory but that film had an actual progression. The costumes, hair, setting. Everything works EXCEPT the story. Which is a shame. I doubt The New World is any better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4/10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Cloverfield Lane 2015&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched the beginning and end to this film in the theater but never all the way through. It was good, especially for a thriller these days. The ending is tacked on of course but most everything shown pays off. Die Hard/McGyver-esque in it&amp;#39;s ingenuity. I loved John Gallagher as Emmett. Goodman is alright. People love him because he overacts. He always plays the same person in every film except Lebowski and then the only difference is he&amp;#39;s Jewish. Winstead and Emmett are the real stars. Anybody could have done Goodman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7/10&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueFilm", "name": "t1_dgcxuth", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423169.0, "created_utc": 1492394369.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcxtlr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Whenthenighthascome", "parent_id": "t3_65p8o9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueFilm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Been watching loads of films to whittle my IMDB watchlist down.

I can't tell if the script (by local writers) is any good or not but it seemed like something interesting was going on under the dismal direction.

It's an R-rated Tyler Perry movie. The movie deals with romantic issues in a blunt but interesting way, but the character is very unappealing and doesn't deserve a good man.

Even though it's based on real court proceedings, there's a logic missing to much of the story. Characters lie for no reason, and obvious first steps like blood tests are saved until the end.

The movie struggles to keep things visual (the photographs help) but the two journalists are charismatic and their adventures are amusing. The fact that it all happened nearly 50 years ago makes it irrelevant on one hand but sweetly nostalgic on the other.

He perfectly captures that feeling of being alone in a big empty house through some awesome camerawork and lighting. It's appropriately bloody and eschews jump scares for moody atmosphere, something missing from the majority of modern horror flicks. The cast all do their jobs admirably, but I especially enjoyed Tom Noonan's performance as the creepy housekeeper guy. Love the look of the 16mm film and love the use of 80's music. Recommended for anyone that enjoys nice encapsulated horror stories heavy on tense ambience. \n\n**Possession (1981) - 4.5/5**\n\nI went into this looking for some atmospheric horror and good god did I get what I wanted. It draws sharp contrast with the above film because while both are technically atmospheric horror films, this movie sets itself apart by being far more ambitious by attempting to create ambience for the purpose of understanding a certain state of feeling unique to someone going through a horrid break-up with someone near and dear (which is precisely what director and writer Andrzej Zulawski was experiencing at the time). The film is dripping with tension and while there are moments of levity (particularly from Heinz Bennent's Heinrich character) it never lets up. I had the unmistakable feeling throughout that I was watching a true masterpiece. Isabelle Adjani gives a spectacular performance as the crazed wife. It's a performance that took a lot of guts to fully commit to and she pulled it off sensationally. Zulawski conjures up some insanely surreal imagery that really puts you into the mental space of someone going through disastrous relationship dementia. The only reason I didn't give it the full 5/5 is that it is going to take repeated viewings to fully grasp all of the hidden meanings and symbols, so I'll probably upgrade the rating after another watch.  Lots of disturbing and thought provoking images contained in this film and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in surreal horror.\n\n**Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) - 4/5**\n\nThis is Park Chan-Wook's second movie, following his hit film J.S.A Joint Security Area (2000) and his first to truly showcase his unique style and choice of material. This is a very violent and moody movie, but the violence isn't without purpose. Park's objective was to show how the spirit of vengeance can transform someone into a monstrous souls and his choices to film the violence from overhead or at a distance do a lot to make his characters look like twisted, otherworldly beings. The film is a bit messy, however, and the plotting can be confusing. Quite a bit of the story is told wordlessly and if you don't have a good feel for the locations and characters it can be difficult to keep up. This film did a lot to solidify Park as one of my favorite working directors and I can't wait to move onto Oldboy and Lady Vengeance next.\n\n**Cache [Hidden] (2005) - 5/5**\n\nThis movie is excellent. I was only familiar with Michael Haneke through his popular film Funny Games, which I found condescending and unnecessary. This film can be construed similarly but I found it highly refreshing. I had not seen Daniel Auteuil in anything before but he is fantastic as the overly tough and emotionally unavailable Georges. He perfectly exudes that feeling of masculine repression of guilt that I feel like anyone can identify with. The fact that the whole work is an allegory for European treatment of immigrants/refugees brings the film to the next level and is why it is especially relevant today. The ending shot is perfect and wraps the story up neatly and sheds some optimism on a film that seems to be extremely pessimistic through the majority of the runtime. Highly recommended.\n\n**Nightwatch (1997) - 2/5**\n\nThis one's a mixed bag. It had some cool sequences early on, with Ewan McGregor wandering around the creepy mortuary. Director Ole Bornedal did some pretty neat stuff with camera movements and the first thirty minutes or so are heavy on atmosphere. But the movie totally failed when it came to a cohesive story that made sense. The plot in this movie is like cheddar cheese. And it's just plain dumb. It might be serviceable as a \"check-your-brain-at-the-door\" horror flick, but it just left me feeling angry and unsatisfied. Would still recommend just for the cool setting and moodiness, but don't expect too much from the paper thin story. By the way, if anybody else has seen anything else by Bornedal that contains the creepy atmosphere he was able to create but minus the dumb plot, please recommend. \n\n*Disclaimer: star ratings are based on personal enjoyment of the movie, nothing to do with how well the film was made or what rating it might deserve as a work of art.\n\n", "edited": 1492376488.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House of the Devil (2009) - 5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching this again makes me heartsick that Ti West has yet to do anything nearly as entertaining or atmospheric as this awesome horror throwback.

This film did a lot to solidify Park as one of my favorite working directors and I can&amp;#39;t wait to move onto Oldboy and Lady Vengeance next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cache [Hidden] (2005) - 5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This movie is excellent. I was only familiar with Michael Haneke through his popular film Funny Games, which I found condescending and unnecessary. This film can be construed similarly but I found it highly refreshing. I had not seen Daniel Auteuil in anything before but he is fantastic as the overly tough and emotionally unavailable Georges. He perfectly exudes that feeling of masculine repression of guilt that I feel like anyone can identify with. The fact that the whole work is an allegory for European treatment of immigrants/refugees brings the film to the next level and is why it is especially relevant today. The ending shot is perfect and wraps the story up neatly and sheds some optimism on a film that seems to be extremely pessimistic through the majority of the runtime. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nightwatch (1997) - 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one&amp;#39;s a mixed bag. It had some cool sequences early on, with Ewan McGregor wandering around the creepy mortuary. Director Ole Bornedal did some pretty neat stuff with camera movements and the first thirty minutes or so are heavy on atmosphere. But the movie totally failed when it came to a cohesive story that made sense. The plot in this movie is like cheddar cheese. And it&amp;#39;s just plain dumb. It might be serviceable as a &amp;quot;check-your-brain-at-the-door&amp;quot; horror flick, but it just left me feeling angry and unsatisfied. Would still recommend just for the cool setting and moodiness, but don&amp;#39;t expect too much from the paper thin story. By the way, if anybody else has seen anything else by Bornedal that contains the creepy atmosphere he was able to create but minus the dumb plot, please recommend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Disclaimer: star ratings are based on personal enjoyment of the movie, nothing to do with how well the film was made or what rating it might deserve as a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueFilm", "name": "t1_dgcilqm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492402792.0, "created_utc": 1492373992.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8o9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8o9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p8o9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcqjou", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dustin_slothman", "parent_id": "t1_dgcpko9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueFilm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah you're totally right; [they added a couple nice CGI shots of the city](https://youtu.be/FmWjPoqEhzg?t=8m9s).

I did break my own rule this week and watched two films made after 1990, but they were social watches so I'm okay with it. I was heavy on Scorsese this week.\n\n**Goodfellas** (1990) (rewatch) - I feel like I finally understood why I love this film so much on this watch. I always found myself lost in the spectacle of Henry Hill's life on my previous watches, and of course the character development was always the highlight for me. But this time I noticed just how *real* the characters feel in this film. I mean obviously it's based on a true story, but I feel like I know the characters after a couple hours. The dialogue is on par with Pulp Fiction with how real it feels. I feel like I'll be able to watch *Goodfellas* a thousand times and still enjoy it.\n\n**Raging Bull** (1980) - Well...after all that praise I just gave Goodfellas for its character development, Raging Bull's blows it out of the water. This feels like a film that I might never watch again because of how painful it was to watch Jake self destruct from start to finish. It really was a masterpiece in character development, and the editing was obviously incredible as well. The last fight with Sugar Ray was one of the most brutal scenes I've seen in film. Absolutely tragic, but so incredibly well done.\n\n**Mean Streets** (1973) - I barely paid attention the first time I saw it so I don't consider this a rewatch. I felt like I was going to be disappointed by this one until I made it to the end. Once again, Scorsese absolutely kills it with the characters. It seemed all jumbled and directionless while I was watching, and then I got it. Harvey Keitel's character was lost in his battle between moral convictions and mafia ambitions. De Niro was amazing as Johnny and is coming close to becoming my favorite actor. This was probably the rawest Scorsese film that I've seen, and I really enjoyed the rawness. \n\n**Silence** (2016) - I read the book in one of my classes so the film intrigued me, especially since it was directed by Scorsese. It's odd...I think I expected it to be more \"Scorseseish\" than it was. I enjoyed the film and thought everything was well done, but the characters weren't as strong as in all the classic Scorsese flicks. But it was filled with strong performances, beautiful cinematography, and a compelling story. I should probably be a little less hard on it, but I guess I just expected a bit more from Scorsese. 8/10\n\n**Dr. Strangelove** (1964) - I've *almost* seen all of Kubrick's stuff now. This one was really, really good. I haven't seen enough Sellers, but he was excellent. It was weird and quirky and just a wonderful comedy making light of the events of the cold war. One of few films where I laughed in pretty much every scene. I now understand all the praise it gets.\n\n**Dr. Strange** (2016) - I honestly didn't mean to watch the two Dr. films in the same week. It was a Marvel superhero film. It almost felt like Iron Man redux with a less interesting protagonist. I think I just need to stop watching Marvel films because I don't find them particularly compelling. I would compare it to a James Cameron film: pretty much airtight, but shallow and less important than it thinks it is. But apparently everyone disagrees with me so I'll try to keep my opinions to myself. 6.5/10\n\n**Psycho** (1960) - The master of suspense kills it once again. Watching a film like *Psycho* makes it very clear to me why I hate most modern horror films so much: the complete lack of minimalism. Hitchcock, Leone, Kubrick, etc. are so good at putting *only* what needs to be in their films in their films. A few directors, like Scorsese, can pull off excess and generally do so by making it relevant to the overarching theme, but for the most part I far prefer directors who only stick to what's important, or at least use excess in a clever fashion (A Clockwork Orange comes to mind). But Psycho was a wonderful exercise in restraint and suspense. Just wonderful. I also understand why Hitchcock called it a comedy because the over-the-top music and screams really were pretty funny. It's pretty sad that a comedy is scarier than most serious horror films, but it also shows how talented Hitchcock truly was.\n\n**A Fistful of Dollars** (1964) - I can't get enough of Sergio's spaghetti westerns. While clearly low-budget, overdubbed, and more raw and less polished, *A Fistful of Dollars* was a wonderful start to Leone's streak of classics. Clint was at his best here. Like *Mean Streets*, it was a raw and humble film that logically precedes the classics we know and love.

Fun, funny, charming, sad and great; I laughed and cried along with the characters and felt so compelled by everybody on screen. Every person is so quintessentially themself, like Wendy's younger brother, the young tool that he is.

It was a completely fun, rad sci-fi movie to go watch in cinema. It&amp;#39;s not the next  &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, but it was so watchable and I was totally in and on board for the story.

I'm quite glad for its inspiration, but I'm afraid that it just didn't appeal to me. Maybe it's the difference in a 1970s viewer versus myself, or maybe it's all the horror movies I've seen, but I simply didn't find it scary. It seemed like its priorities were moreso to shock than to scare. Additionally, I didn't care at all for Ellen Burstyn's performance. That said, not a bad movie by any means - I actually thought it was a rather decent film about faith conceptually, at the least. **5/10**\n\n**The Eyes of My Mother:** This one was rather disappointing. The Exorcist made me feel something, at least. This? Nothing. It was simply a film. I wish I had more substantive thoughts to share on it, but I really didn't feel much of anything at all. It's well enough acted, well shot...just didn't do anything for me at all. **5/10**\n\n**Coraline (rewatch):** I'm glad to see that this was as pleasant as I remembered it when I saw it as a younger age. The strongest of Laika's productions, it's a marvelously designed work in regards to art, and the story has charm to it. That said, Fanning's voice work was subpar in my opinion, and I can't say my feelings for the piece go anything beyond a surface level. Additionally, large amounts of the paranormal factors well unjustifiably unexplained, at least in proper detail. Oh well. Still plenty of enjoyment to be had for this one. **7/10**\n\n**Toy Story:** I haven't seen this movie since I was barely a child, so I feel comfortable counting this as a first-time watch. It is absolutely, positively marvelous. The animation is nothing short of spectacular. I cannot imagine the immense work that went into designing all of the toys, and their incredibly dynamic facial and bodily reactions. The voice work is fantastic, the pacing is without any apparent flaw of substance, and it provides a piece of art that doesn't restrict itself to certain age groups. My only real criticism, aside from a few less enjoyable jokes, is that - and I am aware how petty this may sound - I hate Newman's voice. I hate it and loathe it fiercely. There were a few emotional moments which, for me, were greatly diminished because of my irritation's towards that man's singing voice. Otherwise, his score is great. A very strong **9/10** to this one. \n\n**Green Room:** Another modern horror/thriller that I simply failed to see the hype for. I think it starts off well, for sure - the energy keeps rising until the first breakdown of the green room's door, and up until then, I was enjoying it. After that? Completely standard fare. Personally, I thought all the movie had going for it was that feeling of suspense - the costuming, casting, acting, score, and cinemetography felt \"alright\" at best, and sometimes outright bad. As soon as things settled, it was just an hour or so of disappointment. **5/10**\n\n**Ratatouille (rewatch):** From a design standpoint, I think this is the best work Pixar's ever put out. Every bit of the music, animation, art design, it's all just so absolutely, positively wonderful. The voice acting is great as well - I'm not normally a fan of Patton Oswalt, but he absolutely delivered a great performance as Remy, as did the other cast members. Unfortunately, the writing here has some issues - the third act is absolutely boring until the climactic speech at the end, and there are some plot points that raise an eyebrow. However, this is still probably my third favorite piece from Pixar, and definitely evidence that Brad Bird's name on a work makes it a high priority watch. **8/10**\n\n**The Incredibles:** I only have vague, hazy movies of ever having seen this movie to begin with, so again, I feel comfortable counting it as a rewatch. I'm not going to call it perfect, because I don't care for that word on a personal level. But it is just...absolutely marvelous. Everything about it. I adored this film from start to finish. I really and truly couldn't levy anything but the most minor complaints against this film, and it probably rivals The End of Evangelion for my personal favorite animated film. **10/10**\n\n**The Nightmare Before Christmas (rewatch):** It's an enjoyably designed enjoyable story. I don't have much to say on it myself, as others have put it far better. I do love the design, and I particularly love the soundtrack - I struggle to think of anything Elfman's done better, and Jack's Lament is a constant listen for me. Like Coraline, the writing itself is enjoyable only up to a skin-deep level, but it's definitely a good piece that can be appreciated by many. **7/10**\n\n**American Beauty:** I enjoyed this more than I had expected to. The roles are all performed well, particularly by Spacey, its shot consistently well, and the design definitely has some high marks. The concept of the true self really rang through by the end of the film, and even if the film is overly on the nose at points, its definitely something I'd recommend to others. A strong **7/10**\n\n**Black Swan:** On paper, this had the makings to be an instant favorite for me. In execution...not so much. The camera felt like it was being operated by an individual who'd recently bought a mobile trampoline - it wasn't disorienting as much as it was simply irritating. I didn't at all care for the score, and the effects were subpar to boot. It's a real shame - I'm a big fan of Perfect Blue and Whiplash, which cover themes found in Black Swan, and Portman and Kunis alike turned in some great performances - but I really would struggle to recommend this film, and am puzzled myself how it merited a best picture nomination. **5/10**\n\n**The Lobster:** I just watched this one today, and it was...different. It took a risk, and I do respect that. The performances are good, and the deadpan comedy is for the most part pleasant. I do agree, like many others, that the third act of the film pales in comparison to the rest - particularly the segments in the hotel - but I can definitely say that I enjoyed the work, and if nothing else could recommend it for being something more \"different.\" **6/10**\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rating system: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1/2 = F, 3 = D, 4 = D+, etc&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Exorcist:&lt;/strong&gt; An incredibly acclaimed horror classic that probably inspired a very great deal of horror movies since.
