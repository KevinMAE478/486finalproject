Every single website links to Soderberghs website. On the internet archive I only found the link to the vimeo page where the video should be. But that got removed. I also looked on torrent websites without success. I&amp;#39;m sure that someone still has this film on their hdd, but you&amp;#39;ll have to find that person.
