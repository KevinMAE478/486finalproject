I&amp;#39;m excited as always although a bit surprised to see Baumbach in the official selection. I&amp;#39;m also a bit bummed to not see Zama on that list but I guess they&amp;#39;re aiming for Venice? Unfortunately that means it&amp;#39;ll be quite a while before it comes to cinemas near me, probably not until spring 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loveless is the one I&amp;#39;m the most excited for, Zyvagintsev hit the ball out of the park with both The Return and Leviathan (Elena is good too) and I&amp;#39;m confident he can do it again. Unfortunately, neither Haneke nor Hong Sang-Soo is that interesting to me and Baumbach&amp;#39;s two most recent were complete duds. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueFilm", "name": "t1_dg9jv9k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492224001.0, "created_utc": 1492195201.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65coju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65coju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szp0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65coju", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9y95m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrainTheStain", "parent_id": "t1_dg9rdky", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueFilm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fair or not, I'm more of a \"Was I entertained?
