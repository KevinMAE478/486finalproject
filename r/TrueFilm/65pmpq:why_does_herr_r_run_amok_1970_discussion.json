This is the case from the very start: the film opens with R. and his co-workers leaving for the day.

In scenes with R.&amp;#39;s wife or parents or friends, it is often the other characters who do the talking: in one extended scene in which R.&amp;#39;s parents visit, R. is silent the entire time, a passive observer, incapable, it seems, of being able to interact with the world around him. The film&amp;#39;s style -- the unforgiving camera, which lingers just a little too long; the harsh, grainy colouring; the drab, empty set designs, from the cold interior of the Raabs&amp;#39; house to the snowy setting of pre-Christmas Munich -- all of it adds to the sense of alienation we realise our main character is experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this film is not just a condemnation of the alienating structures of bourgeois life. It is also a condemnation of the people who allow themselves to subsist within it.

But these, in the end, are also his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think of the style of this film, its message? Did you find it as mesmerizing as I did, or was it painful to watch?
