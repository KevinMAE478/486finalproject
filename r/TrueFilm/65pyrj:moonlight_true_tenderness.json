But what does it mean? Well, Chiron\u2019s most true and revealing moments happen at night, in the moonlight. Those scenes are the beach scene and end sequence, which both take place at night. This helps us understand the meaning of moonlight and blue. In the moonlight, in the night, people drop their tough facade and show their true, tender selves. They become &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;.

It shows three sides of himself, at three stages in life: as Little, vulnerable in blue light; as Black, tough in grey light; and Chiron in the middle in red light. Children are mainly \u2019unspoiled\u2019 by society\u2019s norms, thus Little is blue. Chiron as a teenager is struggling to fit in, trying to bridge the gap between who he is and who he is expected to be. As an adult, Black is playing the role of a tough gangster, though that\u2019s not who he is on the inside. Chiron\u2019s insecure adolescence and the rough environment made him lose track of himself and fall into a role.
