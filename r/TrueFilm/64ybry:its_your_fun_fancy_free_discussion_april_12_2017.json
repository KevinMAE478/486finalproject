While I'm not the biggest horror fan, I do tend to like well made horror a lot and those suggestions sound all very interesting. I definitely have to check out Russian cinema as well.\n\nSince you gave such a thought out suggestions I'd like to return the favor. *Yi Yi* by Edward Yang is one of my favorite films ever, it's also a slice of life and while it's 3 hours long it never felt like it dragged on. In fact Yang made a 3 hour film feel like a 2 hour one and it's simply captivating. I also recommend any other of his films, especiall *A Brighter Summer Day* but beware that one is 4 hours long.\n\n*The Great Beauty* by Sorrentino.

I was big on DBZ and Jackie Chan too while growing up so I was surprised not liking Kung Fu Hustle but I&amp;#39;ll give it another try. Thanks for suggesting Ozu, I haven&amp;#39;t seen any of his films yet so your write up gave me motivation to finally watch them. While I&amp;#39;m not the biggest horror fan, I do tend to like well made horror a lot and those suggestions sound all very interesting. I definitely have to check out Russian cinema as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you gave such a thought out suggestions I&amp;#39;d like to return the favor. &lt;em&gt;Yi Yi&lt;/em&gt; by Edward Yang is one of my favorite films ever, it&amp;#39;s also a slice of life and while it&amp;#39;s 3 hours long it never felt like it dragged on.

I'm no Kung Fu expert, but was always a Jackie Chan fan to some extent and grew up on DBZ. Kung Fu Hustle at the end felt like a great combat anime. Introducing characters with crazy powers and a seedy gang trying to destroy the town, only for you to find out that some of the ho-hum people in the town actually studied cool Kung Fu techniques too. \n\nI'd rather watch Kung Fu Hustle than The Matrix. I feel like where one takes itself too seriously, the other is having fun with the epic story they are telling instead of having everyone speak in a serious monotone about how this fight is more important than anything that has ever happened in human history. \n\nI think Kung Fu Hustle was probably my first favorite non English film. \n\nIt's not my favorite now, as I really think Seventh Seal is fantastic as is Persona. While both black and white and seeming New Wave, I feel like they are more interesting than many of the New Wave directors. \n\nDo you like Slice of Life films? Sometimes the pace isn't super fast, but because it's so relatable and grounded I think Yasujir\u014d Ozu's filmography is pretty fun to watch. His movies don't feel long, because most aren't. Though most are B&amp;W films, so that might turn some off. Last year for my 366 movies in 366 days I watched ;\n\n**Good Morning - 1959/94 minutes color movie** The one I would recommend as a starter. An interesting film looking at a  post war Japan on an upswing and the change television/tech would make to their culture in the coming 1960's. \n\nIf you want something heavier, I also watched \n\n**'The Only Son...'(1936 82 minutes B&amp;W) and  'There was a Father'(1942 94 minutes B&amp;W)** Both are heartbreaking stories about the Parent/child relationship, one being mother/son and the other being father/son. I can honestly say The Only Son... is probably one of the few movies that almost had me in tears last year. \n\nAll three of those movies surprised me, not that I'd say they are better than Kurosawa. However, they are very different types of film. While Kurosawa's stories are something most people will never go through. A Crime stories(High and Low), and Samurai stories(Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, ect.), while Ozu's stories are all much more grounded in life drama.  \n\nFeel like I'm being really Otaku with all my suggestions and I'll continue that trend. \n\nIf you haven't seen the classic japanese *horror* \n\n**House (Color 1977 88 minutes)** it's a must watch. The pace is fine, but really more for the crazy effects and strange japanese folklore horror. You might feel like it's dragging at the start, but once it takes off it doesn't really slow down until the credits roll.\n\n**Daimajin (color 1966 86 minutes)** A kaiju had sex with a samurai film. I watched the first and second in the trilogy. It's pretty fun, but just like Godzilla it's really all about the last 20 minutes. If you like samurai films, it'll scratch that itch without watching the 3 hour Seven Samurai. \n\n**Lady Snowblood (96 minutes Color 1973)** Based on a manga of the same name and being the film series that Kill Bill is heavily influenced by. The first film is a great piece of cinema, probably one of the best revenge films out there. She is cursed by her mother as she is giving birth to be a 'demon' whose purpose is to get revenge of the men who killed her father, older brother and raped her mother to conceive her. From there we follow this woman as she seeks revenge on them. It's really well done and you can understand why a cinephile like Quentin Tarantino wanted to ape it so much. \n\nAll three are great 'genre' films and because of that I feel like they are really palatable without having much preparation or having to pay attention like a hawk for worry of missing and important dramatic moment/scene/words.\n\nSorry, felt like I could suggest more and I don't get many opportunities to gush about foreign film. I've watched plenty of others, but I feel like much of European films can feel dry and long. Didn't mean to list only Japanese/Chinese films but it turned out that way. I dabbled in Tarkovsky and Russian Cinema last year with both Letter Never Sent and Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood. Though Tarkovsky isn't known for his short affairs. His most noted movies being +3 hours long(Solaris and Andrei Rublev) .\n", "edited": 1492036143.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ehhh, I could see not being into Kung Fu hustle if you don&amp;#39;t have a love for that Genre.
