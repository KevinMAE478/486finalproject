Lets actually contribute here. I am going to tell you a few anecdotes and share some knowledge from dropping out of Tufts... not proud, that will prove you that you are wrong. You obviously have not owned very many cats. Either that or they were all raised wrong, were in a bad environment, or were assholes/stupid that were not well selected at whatever stage in it's life you got it. By that I mean, there are lots of ways to tell if a cat is smart or well socially adjusted. \n\nMy stupid sister at point went to a shelter to adopt a cat and didn't even fucking PICK HER UP or play with her outside her cage where she was trapped! Basic shit there, like is it even litter trained properly? so guess what? When she got home she we figure out she was FERAL and would just hide and shit everywhere if you tried to pick here up and she never adjusted to the move and attacked our kittens. We eventually had to give her back because of the havoc and the difficulty of even taking her to the vet. It honestly put my dad off cats forever, he fucking HATES them now, so I can honestly understand the sentiment. However, most cats raised correctly from kitten hood and are of smart breeding, will ABSOLUTELY know when they are wrong, they just don't give a fuck. \n\nBUT some cats even care if they have formed a deep emotional bond with you if you live alone with them or just another cat. They are isolated socially so they bond with a human and 1 other cat rather than 20 different cats and humans. My [Ragdoll cat](http://i.imgur.com/0AATBwO.jpg) is one of such breeds. Some others examples include Maine Coons, Norwegian forest cats, even derp ass Persians with their stupid face. Just to exemplify, my rag is terrified if I get angry at him and he learns. He does not try to jump on my desk unless I beckon him, plays fucking fetch, follows hand signals, knows simple commands like come, understands tones of voice, is a great soft snuggle ball, and will even goddamn go to the litter box if I ask him nicely and place him in front of it.\n\nLearn more about animals before you judge, they all have different attributes that are attractive and cat's are highly evolved hunters and survivors, barely on the edge of feral.They were brought to domestication just because we attracted small rodents in the early stages of agricultural development in society and even then not over basically the entire planet like dogs would. Dogs on the other hand are likely to have been domesticated and bred specifically for utility or fancy for thousands, if not 10s of thousands of years. Just to give some otherexamples, lizards are intelligent and pretty much the lowest maintenance pet one can own. Rabbits are similar and can even live outside. On the other side of the spectrum you got parrots which need a insane amount of attention they are so smart and most people do not understand what they are getting themselves into when they get one. Cat's are low maintenance however. They can survive in the wild on their own pretty easily just from instinct usually and therefore can really put a dent in large area small animal problems like rats in farms etc. and generally left to their own devices. Also the reason their piss smells so bad is it is used to mark territory strongly as well as a byproduct of extremely efficient kidney's, a cat can drink salt water and hydrate. I can still leave them alone for a 3 day weekend with a big dish of water and dry food heaping dry food and it won't A. destroy my shit on an even larger scale than a cat can B. piss and shit over everything or C. or just starve! Dogs on the flipside are quite maintenance intense. Requiring more food and attention than most.\n\nTheir personalities can be just as endearing as any other but their communication is just a lot more subtle, and mostly based in body language. A erect tail tipped to one side is \" What's up, nice to see you!\" . flopping back and forth in the raised that position is a slightly more affectionate greeting, probably accompanied with them, typically wanting something like food. Closing one eye or both, like a blink or a wink, slowly is often known as a \"kiss\" a show of trust and love. Cat's hate to close their eyes, it is time of weakness. Just how like most animals hate showing their soft underbelly, revealing it is a sign of trust.\n\nDog's on the other hand are eager to please, easy to train, can be much more utilitarian, and who's social structure and cues are a lot more obvious. That is is great though, I fucking love dogs! They are man's best friend, of course they are so popular. They match human extroverted tendencies perfectly. Just as many of them are dumb as rocks or assholes as cats to. As in some can't even learn commands, and ones not trained at all can even be a danger to the public. A stupid/asshole cat however does exactly what you describe.

Big surprise right?", "edited": 1492149325.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obligatory IDGAF if anyone reads this being so buried, and I don&amp;#39;t want to be rude to the OP here slapping his inbox with a text wall, but I spent way more time typing this than I thought I would so fuck it why waste effort right? Lets actually contribute here. I am going to tell you a few anecdotes and share some knowledge from dropping out of Tufts... not proud, that will prove you that you are wrong. You obviously have not owned very many cats. Either that or they were all raised wrong, were in a bad environment, or were assholes/stupid that were not well selected at whatever stage in it&amp;#39;s life you got it. By that I mean, there are lots of ways to tell if a cat is smart or well socially adjusted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stupid sister at point went to a shelter to adopt a cat and didn&amp;#39;t even fucking PICK HER UP or play with her outside her cage where she was trapped! Basic shit there, like is it even litter trained properly? so guess what? When she got home she we figure out she was FERAL and would just hide and shit everywhere if you tried to pick here up and she never adjusted to the move and attacked our kittens. We eventually had to give her back because of the havoc and the difficulty of even taking her to the vet. It honestly put my dad off cats forever, he fucking HATES them now, so I can honestly understand the sentiment. However, most cats raised correctly from kitten hood and are of smart breeding, will ABSOLUTELY know when they are wrong, they just don&amp;#39;t give a fuck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT some cats even care if they have formed a deep emotional bond with you if you live alone with them or just another cat. They are isolated socially so they bond with a human and 1 other cat rather than 20 different cats and humans. My &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0AATBwO.jpg\"&gt;Ragdoll cat&lt;/a&gt; is one of such breeds. Some others examples include Maine Coons, Norwegian forest cats, even derp ass Persians with their stupid face. Just to exemplify, my rag is terrified if I get angry at him and he learns. He does not try to jump on my desk unless I beckon him, plays fucking fetch, follows hand signals, knows simple commands like come, understands tones of voice, is a great soft snuggle ball, and will even goddamn go to the litter box if I ask him nicely and place him in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn more about animals before you judge, they all have different attributes that are attractive and cat&amp;#39;s are highly evolved hunters and survivors, barely on the edge of feral.They were brought to domestication just because we attracted small rodents in the early stages of agricultural development in society and even then not over basically the entire planet like dogs would. Dogs on the other hand are likely to have been domesticated and bred specifically for utility or fancy for thousands, if not 10s of thousands of years. Just to give some otherexamples, lizards are intelligent and pretty much the lowest maintenance pet one can own. Rabbits are similar and can even live outside. On the other side of the spectrum you got parrots which need a insane amount of attention they are so smart and most people do not understand what they are getting themselves into when they get one. Cat&amp;#39;s are low maintenance however. They can survive in the wild on their own pretty easily just from instinct usually and therefore can really put a dent in large area small animal problems like rats in farms etc. and generally left to their own devices. Also the reason their piss smells so bad is it is used to mark territory strongly as well as a byproduct of extremely efficient kidney&amp;#39;s, a cat can drink salt water and hydrate. I can still leave them alone for a 3 day weekend with a big dish of water and dry food heaping dry food and it won&amp;#39;t A. destroy my shit on an even larger scale than a cat can B. piss and shit over everything or C. or just starve!
