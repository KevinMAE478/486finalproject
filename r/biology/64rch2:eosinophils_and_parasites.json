First comment removed for being too short to be helpful. What you are looking for is something called ADCC, Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. \nIn short, a parasite is covered by IgE antibodies that are specific for an epitope,part of a protein that can stimulate antibody production, presented on its' surface. \nThis allows eosinophils to bind to the \"tail\" end of the antibody. The result is a parasite covered with antibodies and subsequently eosinophils. Think Gulliver from Gullivers travels. \nWhat follows is the death of a thousand cuts as the eosinophils release chemicals which cause the membrane to rupture. \n\nFirst image shows the process: http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/Courses/bio225/chap17/Slide16.JPG\n\nSecond is a gif of the process in action: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2957265/When-white-blood-cells-ATTACK-Amazing-video-captures-moment-immune-takes-parasitic-worm.html", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok.
