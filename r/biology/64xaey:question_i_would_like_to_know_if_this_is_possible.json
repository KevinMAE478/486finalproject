Let me explain:\n\n- Reforestation-projects are sometimes detrimental to an existing ecosystem, because non-wooded areas are important as well. Nothing but woods everywhere would not make for a stable ecosystem. So you need to find the right geographical spots to grow healthy woodland. \n\n- The types of plants you start out with matter - a lot. Not every plant / tree can fulfill the same functions, with regards to providing a habitat and nutrients, as well as requirement of nutrients and symbioses with other organisms, and so on. The woods that you might know may not even provide a good template, because many of the world's woods are basically entirely man-made, which leads to a vast reduction in the local count of species, a need for maintenance, and so on.\n\n- Additionally, an isolated group of trees without good access to be settled by animals (from other regions) likely won't be all too stable either, requiring maintenance. An ecosystem is only reliably healthy if many parts fit together in harmony. Invasive species within your area might matter a lot, be it plants or animals or fungi. \n\n- The list goes on.

Depending on your budget you could pursue multiple paths. E.g. simply buying a large patch of wilderness / ocean in order to preserve it goes a long way, or focusing on pushing renewable energy (like sponsoring deployment of solar cells, or investing in technology to store energy from renewables, or so on).\n\nI wish you all the best with your plans!\n\nEdit 2: I just saw that you say \"CO2 to Oxygen scale\".
