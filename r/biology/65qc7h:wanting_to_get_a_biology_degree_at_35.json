There are jobs that pay well and are family-compatible but you really first have to think about what you actually want to do with your degree before anyone can tell you what kind of work awaits you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "biology", "name": "t1_dgccdbi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492394561.0, "created_utc": 1492365761.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qc7h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qc7h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qc7h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qc7h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeihk6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zooloretti", "parent_id": "t1_dgcn0qi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/biology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same story as Gecko. \n\nFor me, the concern is if you want to stay in biology as opposed to some sort of professional field completing a biology phd with youngish children would be very hard.
