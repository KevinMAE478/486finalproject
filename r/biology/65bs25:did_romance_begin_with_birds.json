that of mammals. Our brains have emphasized different areas of development, and as a result, we think in different ways. \n\nSo for example, mammals have a highly folded neocortex, which is associated with what (people who look from a human perspective like to call) \"higher\" functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and in some mammals, language. Birds, however, have an emphasis on the hiyperstraitum. This region is associated with what we call \"Stereotypic\" behaviors, think of it like habitual action ie sitting on their eggs, reacting to a color one way, etc almost out of a unconcious urge. \n\nThese are just the two groups, and that says nothing of others that have come before. But given that both groups have these incredibly different brain anatomies and differing thought processes *behind* their behaviors as a result, it's really hard to compare them. Birds and mammals may both have \"romance\", but the two romances are entirely different and should be treated as such.\n\nFor the sake of comparing apples to oranges, it would have likely been an early bird-like reptile or reptile-like bird. These romance displays are a type of sexual selection associated with monogamy. We see this more in groups with a high cost of living, where shared parental duties would be necessary to raise the young. This is the case in birds moreso than reptiles, as birds have higher energetic demands (not just for flying, but also for regulating their body temperature).
