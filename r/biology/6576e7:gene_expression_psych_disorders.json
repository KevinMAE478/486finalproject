I&amp;#39;m studying what I believe (and I&amp;#39;ve found statistics to show) is a much higher predisposition for development of serious mood disorders, like PTSD, in children who have a significant influence of trauma in their upbringing (children of refugees and immigrants, a population i&amp;#39;ve identified with supporting statistics to also have higher predispositions to- and incidences of- serious mood disorder development). The link I&amp;#39;m trying to establish is a biological basis for the predisposition, outside of known social determinants and contributors to such disorders -- which i&amp;#39;ve also identified in a study that has similar sample collection means to the population of interest; with biological assays performed to show such a suggested indication of the things we think are linked to being &amp;quot;stressed&amp;quot; or what one might have physically going on whilst suffering from PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To refer back to your post, I think that the altered gene expression in these children, during development under such a stress-plagued environment, allows for an increased &amp;quot;diathesis&amp;quot; portion of a diathesis-stress model. Which I think, also, may be explained with the increased biological levels of what we think is related to stress in such children, at a baseline level later in adult life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any of that sound like its working with what you&amp;#39;re talking about?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "biology", "name": "t1_dg80g8t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137855.0, "created_utc": 1492109055.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
