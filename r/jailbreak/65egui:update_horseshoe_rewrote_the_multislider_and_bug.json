I also legitimately purchase tweaks too, but wanted to point out that from personal experience, you are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is one tweak in particular(recently) from a dev that WAS a legitimate developer who released a tweak for snapchat that would steal your information. So it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s from a legitimate source or not, the chance is always there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I like to try before I buy in most cases, and without having purchased and refunded items spamming up my cc, it has not once caused me harm. Please get your facts right and stop spreading false information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd - I&amp;#39;ve said it before, and I&amp;#39;ll say it again. There is a reason piracy exits. I won&amp;#39;t jump through any hoops, and for people that can&amp;#39;t access paypal, and if cydia doesn&amp;#39;t provide a legitimate way for users to purchase tweaks, then they will do what they have to do to get it. Yeah your best course of action would be to contact the developer, but it&amp;#39;s a fact of life, that if you don&amp;#39;t provide access to all, and ease of use, that piracy will continue to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down vote estimated for my comments -63&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "name": "t1_dg9zjbq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492243838.0, "created_utc": 1492215038.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 72}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r8c5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65egui", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r8c5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65egui", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga71y1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "K0GAi", "parent_id": "t1_dga6dw9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jailbreak", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My answers aren't formulated in such a way they would only apply to the person I am replying \u2014which, I believe it wasn't you, in this case\u2014 rather I'm addressing it to the entire community to read.
