Was about to make a post about this asking for help but I feel like you would be able to figure it out in minutes lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the cause of attempting to launch the [[Anywhere!]] App. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I used it when I first jailbroke iOS 10 and it worked but I deleted it since and installed it again yesterday and now it does this. I&amp;#39;m confused as to why it crashes ReportCrash. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crash log&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pastebin.com/n5BjtrQN\"&gt;https://pastebin.com/n5BjtrQN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syslog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pastebin.com/befJ9HZW\"&gt;https://pastebin.com/befJ9HZW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The syslog has a pretty obvious error but I don&amp;#39;t know how to find the cause based off of it. It crashes even with all tweaks disabled. And btw, it does this without crashreporter, I installed crashreporter to try and find the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "name": "t1_dge7qj8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496013.0, "created_utc": 1492467213.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r8c5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yj2q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r8c5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yj2q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8x9r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mr_foxxxx", "parent_id": "t1_dge7xa7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jailbreak", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Opennotifier10", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opennotifier10&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "name": "t1_dge8x9r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497543.0, "created_utc": 1492468743.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge7xa7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "h3110HK", "parent_id": "t3_65yj2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jailbreak", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you mind sharing what's the tweak that you use to show apps with notifications on your top right status bar? u/Ziph0n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you mind sharing what&amp;#39;s the tweak that you use to show apps with notifications on your top right status bar? &lt;a href=\"/u/Ziph0n\"&gt;u/Ziph0n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "name": "t1_dge7xa7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496249.0, "created_utc": 1492467449.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r8c5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yj2q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8v4l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "genrichh93", "parent_id": "t3_65yj2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jailbreak", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry in advance for my grammar.\n\nFinally I understand what the crashlog is trying to tell but unfortunately in my case this article couldn't help me.\n\nThe example log from the article only showed one thread and one dlyb but mine shows up 6 threads and dozens of dlybs for each thread but none of them has a \"+\" to tell what's causing the crash.\n\nFor me deezer is crashing every 10 to 30 minutes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry in advance for my grammar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I understand what the crashlog is trying to tell but unfortunately in my case this article couldn&amp;#39;t help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The example log from the article only showed one thread and one dlyb but mine shows up 6 threads and dozens of dlybs for each thread but none of them has a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; to tell what&amp;#39;s causing the crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me deezer is crashing every 10 to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "name": "t1_dge8v4l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497466.0, "created_utc": 1492468666.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r8c5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yj2q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgehbll", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "qwerty-po", "parent_id": "t3_65yj2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jailbreak", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Any way to figure out crashes that don't report to crash reporter?
