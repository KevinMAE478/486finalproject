Let's get together and talk this out.\" like the hippy and folk movement did, Punk said, \"\"Get the fuck up and change this shit! I'm sick of sitting around! If we have to we'll burn the whole goddamn thing down and rebuild from the ashes!\"\n\nIf you haven't already, listen to some old Exploited songs like \"Don't Pay The Poll Tax\" and \"Let's Start a War\". Great examples of hardcore punk with a message, not this pop shit they call punk today.\nFun fact: in Let's Start a War the chorus goes, \"Let's start a war said Maggie one day\" over and over. I never gave it much though, just figured it was about violence and Maggie was some badass girlfriend or something. Then I got older and realized they were talking about Margaret Thatcher and I went down a big IRA, Falkland Islands, etc. rabbit hole. So it turns out I learned much more about her than i would have without that song.\n\nAnyway, I think Punk definitely did something that nothing else had.

You know how Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan had weird, not so great voices? The melodies were pretty basic, but the words are what got people. The prtest songs and the poetry spoke to a generation. Do that but more angry and frustrated and you have Punk Rock. Instead of saying, &amp;quot;Hey guys. Let&amp;#39;s get together and talk this out.&amp;quot; like the hippy and folk movement did, Punk said, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Get the fuck up and change this shit! I&amp;#39;m sick of sitting around! If we have to we&amp;#39;ll burn the whole goddamn thing down and rebuild from the ashes!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t already, listen to some old Exploited songs like &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Pay The Poll Tax&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s Start a War&amp;quot;. Great examples of hardcore punk with a message, not this pop shit they call punk today.\nFun fact: in Let&amp;#39;s Start a War the chorus goes, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s start a war said Maggie one day&amp;quot; over and over. I never gave it much though, just figured it was about violence and Maggie was some badass girlfriend or something. Then I got older and realized they were talking about Margaret Thatcher and I went down a big IRA, Falkland Islands, etc. rabbit hole. So it turns out I learned much more about her than i would have without that song.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think Punk definitely did something that nothing else had. It was really just a new combination of pre-existing elements but that&amp;#39;s what all art is right?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "history", "name": "t1_dg7ultg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492131635.0, "created_utc": 1492102835.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655diw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8rbxl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "authoritrey", "parent_id": "t3_655diw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/history", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The DCHC scene had some pretty focused, very socially conscious bands and individuals within it.
