WWII vets had the &amp;quot;luxury&amp;quot; of returning to a country wherein the vast majority of men of fighting age had served in one capacity or another.  A guy who&amp;#39;d gone ashore at Omaha Beach on D-day, for example, was quite likely to live a few houses down the street from another guy who&amp;#39;d barely survived the nightmare of Guadalcanal, Tarawa or Anzio.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While their experiences were different in detail, they fundamentally understood one another as fellow citizens who had gone through the slaughterhouse trauma of combat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was less true of the men who fought in Korea, and even less true of the men who, like my old man, fought in Vietnam to return to a hostile public at home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are at all interested in such things, I highly recommend Karl Marlantes&amp;#39; excellent book, &amp;quot;What it&amp;#39;s Like to go to War.&amp;quot;     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also recommend Sebastian Junger&amp;#39;s recent book, &amp;quot;Tribe; On Homecoming and Belonging,&amp;quot; which is short and very readable and is based on his experience with PTSD after having covered conflict zones across the world and the Korengal Valley especially.
