So we have characters protected by plot armour fighting mooks with zero self-preservation in a confused melee.\n\nOthers have picked out bits and pieces and I'll try to present a coherent overall explanation of what we think combat looked like. It's what we *think* because frankly no primary sources state it because usually the sources were written by elites who fought for other elites who also fought so explaining the mechanics of a battle would seem superfluous. \n\nFirstly formations, few movies show any kind of formations and instead love to break into chaotic melees where the heroes can pull off acrobatic moves. In reality there is some kind of formation if two armies come into conflict - it may be a tight shieldwall, a loose tribal confederation, or an open formation of legionaries, but there has to be some semblance of a formation. You need to know your flank and rear is safe if you're going to fight otherwise you'll never risk getting stuck in. \n\nThe next big thing is fear. Onscreen heroes never have any real fear. But ancient/medieval combat was terrifying. There's no nice Geneva Conventions for surrendering soldiers, there's no antibiotics, no painkillers, no medvac, and in the ancient world no concept of a blissful heaven. A scratch can get infected and kill you just as much as spear in the gut. Most armies in the ancient world were nothing more than civic militias (with a few exceptions like the Spartans or Late Republican/Imperial Romans). You'll have armies that were raised for a specific campaign and then disbanded afterwards so each time you're fighting alongside new groupings of people - some who are veterans of many campaigns, some in their first. This new formation won't have great cohesion and will be somewhat fragile until it's had time to drill and develop some internal cohesion.\n\nThat means when you're standing in formation looking across the field at an enemy formation full of men wielding sharp pointy sticks who intend to *kill the living shit* out of you (even though they're likely as terrified as you are). Are you going to charge willy into half a dozen spear points? Fuck no. There's a few badasses who might but we'll get to them later. Combat is going to be a hesitant tentative affair as each side tries to jog into contact (not run because that will disrupt your formation) and depending on how committed the front rank is they may get to spearpoint or their courage will fail and the front rank will slow and the formation will shamble to a halt. Now in every army there's going to be a minority of people who have mastered their fear - they'll be the ones who will lead their force into actual combat - this might be the huscarls in the front line, it may be the centurions in a Roman cohort. They'll advance and drag the people next to them alongside in order to maintain the formation which in turn will drag the people next to them, etc...\n\nIn combat, most will probably be fighting defensively - concentrating on protecting themselves rather than getting a killing blow. They'll make weaker strikes and always try to protect as much of their body as possible. The 'fighters' they'll be actively trying to murder their opponents and taking aimed strikes for vulnerable spots and risking themselves to do it. The majority of casualties from combat will likely come from these guys. Now after several minutes both sides will begin to tire out and the two lines will shamble back to a safe distance where they're not within striking range (or javelin range) and catch their breath while leaders (both official or unofficial) will try to psych the formation up for another push into the blender. The armies will be calling to each other, yelling insult at the enemy, re-stoking their courage. The lightly wounded can be taken out of the line, slaves can bring up water. Then the cycle repeats.\n\nEventually one side either takes too many casualties or is simply pushed back that the rear ranks begin to panic (routs always start from the rear, it's why you station your second best men there) and slip away. That movement usually will trigger a panic in the remaining ranks and the formation will flee, trying desperately to get away. They'll throw away anything that might slow them down like weapons or shields. For the winning side, this releases them and they'll pursue and cut down the losers from behind at no loss - this is where the vast majority of the dead in a battle comes from, not the actual fighting but in the rout. If some from the routing formation keep their heads and retain their arms and manage to gather a small tight formation they may make it off the field intact - the winners would rather kill defenseless men rather than risk injury/death fighting men who clearly haven't routed. \n\nThis will never make it onto a big screen. It would take time and skill to direct the utter fear each man feels and tries to mask. People would complain that the fight choreography was shit because 'those guys aren't even trying'. If the 'good guys' to win a battle, stabbing people in the back as they run for their lives isn't terribly heroic.

Combat is going to be a hesitant tentative affair as each side tries to jog into contact (not run because that will disrupt your formation) and depending on how committed the front rank is they may get to spearpoint or their courage will fail and the front rank will slow and the formation will shamble to a halt. Now in every army there&amp;#39;s going to be a minority of people who have mastered their fear - they&amp;#39;ll be the ones who will lead their force into actual combat - this might be the huscarls in the front line, it may be the centurions in a Roman cohort. They&amp;#39;ll advance and drag the people next to them alongside in order to maintain the formation which in turn will drag the people next to them, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In combat, most will probably be fighting defensively - concentrating on protecting themselves rather than getting a killing blow. They&amp;#39;ll make weaker strikes and always try to protect as much of their body as possible. The &amp;#39;fighters&amp;#39; they&amp;#39;ll be actively trying to murder their opponents and taking aimed strikes for vulnerable spots and risking themselves to do it. The majority of casualties from combat will likely come from these guys. Now after several minutes both sides will begin to tire out and the two lines will shamble back to a safe distance where they&amp;#39;re not within striking range (or javelin range) and catch their breath while leaders (both official or unofficial) will try to psych the formation up for another push into the blender. The armies will be calling to each other, yelling insult at the enemy, re-stoking their courage. The lightly wounded can be taken out of the line, slaves can bring up water. Then the cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually one side either takes too many casualties or is simply pushed back that the rear ranks begin to panic (routs always start from the rear, it&amp;#39;s why you station your second best men there) and slip away. That movement usually will trigger a panic in the remaining ranks and the formation will flee, trying desperately to get away. They&amp;#39;ll throw away anything that might slow them down like weapons or shields. For the winning side, this releases them and they&amp;#39;ll pursue and cut down the losers from behind at no loss - this is where the vast majority of the dead in a battle comes from, not the actual fighting but in the rout. If some from the routing formation keep their heads and retain their arms and manage to gather a small tight formation they may make it off the field intact - the winners would rather kill defenseless men rather than risk injury/death fighting men who clearly haven&amp;#39;t routed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will never make it onto a big screen. It would take time and skill to direct the utter fear each man feels and tries to mask. People would complain that the fight choreography was shit because &amp;#39;those guys aren&amp;#39;t even trying&amp;#39;. If the &amp;#39;good guys&amp;#39; to win a battle, stabbing people in the back as they run for their lives isn&amp;#39;t terribly heroic. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "history", "name": "t1_dgb8qt7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492322508.0, "created_utc": 1492293708.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l1k9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb6opz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThylacineTiger", "parent_id": "t3_65l1k9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/history", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Some effort goes into making single combat look plausible; Rob Roy and Braveheart are good examples of that.
