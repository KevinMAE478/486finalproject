Animals that frequented Big Bone Lick included bison, both the ancient and the modern variety; primitive horses, giant mammoths and mastodons, the enormous stag-moose, and the ground sloth. The earliest peoples, from the Pre-Paleo Period (13,000 BC) down to the Late Woodland Period (AD 1000), found a seemingly endless supply of wild game to hunt in and around the mineral and salt springs and Big Bone Lick became a killing ground for thousands of years. Over the millennia, the bones gradually accumulated and were frequently covered by flooding sediments, preserving them for modern archaeologists and paleontologists to recover in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He noted that on July 5, 1773, Captain Thomas Bullitt surveyed \u201ca tract of very good land on Big Bone Creek.\u201d He met some Delaware Indians who told him that the \u201cbig bones just as he saw them now, had been there ever since his remembrance, as well as that of his oldest people.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://parks.ky.gov/parks/historicsites/big-bone-lick/history.aspx\"&gt;http://parks.ky.gov/parks/historicsites/big-bone-lick/history.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "history", "name": "t1_dgcxbma", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492422419.0, "created_utc": 1492393619.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p88t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc2exq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kctrem", "parent_id": "t3_65p88t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/history", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I could see a bit of both.
