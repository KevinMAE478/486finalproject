John Keegan, in *The Mask of Command*, divides the decision into three parts: in front always, in front sometimes, or in front rarely (or never).\n\nAlexander and Epaminondas of Thebes are two great examples of in front always commanders.  \n\nThese generals not only commanded from in front, but often from the most dangerous and exposed position in the line.  The battle-plan had to be made and agreed upon in advance and the general himself became a local commander when the battle started.  \n\nIt punched Epaminondas' ticket during his greatest victory and got Alexander seriously injured several times, and nearly killed several others.  On the other hand, the sub-section they commanded in battle usually fought better and the general did have some control over what was usually the most important sector of the battlefield.\n\nThe movement of the general to the back had everything to do with the concept of *reserves*, and how and when to deploy them. \n\nScipio Africanus is a good example of a general who, after demonstrating his personal courage enough to win the trust of his troops, stayed back to *direct* the course of battle through subsequent deployment.  Zama probably qualifies as one of the most important battles ever because two top-shelf generals, Scipio and Hannibal, commanded from the rear and directed the use of reserves, counterbalancing each others' moves until a subordinate, Massinissa, delivered the crushing blow for Scipio.\n\nAs armies got larger, it became more and more difficult for a general to keep a hand on all elements of the battle.  The Duke of Wellington at Waterloo had to stay *just outside* killing range (under \"Wellington's Tree\") in order to observe and direct the battle, often using a pocket telescope.  \n\nMany of Wellington's entourage were not as lucky as he and at least once he had to run away and command an infantry square to lie down so he could jump their line with his horse and hide from pursuing French cavalry.  The Duke played a thin hand of holding the line against a superior enemy force, parsimoniously deploying reserves all day, in the hopes that a Prussian army would reach the field in time to relieve him.  They did.\n\nFrederick the Great is another good example of a commander who stayed just close enough to see what was going on for himself.  Frederick was a master of *operativ*, the art of not only directing the deployment of reserves but also *their tactical movement* on the battlefield.  Frederick had to be close to the line to do it personally, but now modern American commanders practice the same thing, sometimes in realtime from another continent entirely.\n\nBy the American Civil War the commander had to stay mostly in the rear because of the disruption his incapacitation could cause.  Some commanders, like Jackson, wouldn't even share plans with subordinates.  Jackson (as a subordinate) and others who got too close to the line were in serious danger.  On at least one occasion, one commander (Sherman), spotted his adversary (Polk) on the battlefield and \"sniped\" him with artillery.\n\nRobert E. Lee is an interesting example of a commander who stayed in the rear not by choice but by necessity or by the insistence of others.  Once, at Chancellorsville, he felt compelled to act as his own Corps commander.  On two occasions in 1864, he was almost forcibly removed from danger by worried subordinates as he attempted to join in troop movements.  In 1865, he got loose for a while and directed a single artillery battery to buy time for his army to regroup.\n\nBy the 20th Century, the \"front\" was 30 or more miles deep and a high-level commander could not afford to leave a relatively safe nexus of electronic communications (as well as the time-honored runners carrying dispatches).   Being in overall command in the far rear was still no guarantee of safety; \"Strafer\" Gott never got to actually command the Eighth Army in North Africa because he was shot down on his way to the command post.  Adolf Hitler, who increasingly micromanaged the German forces until at one point he found himself placing individual antiaircraft guns, was almost done in by one of his own V1s when it failed on takeoff and exploded on top of his command bunker.\n\nThe same principles applied to naval commanders, by the way.  In World War II, fleet admirals had to move to special command cruisers because on one occasion the broadside of the commanding admiral's battleship knocked out its own communications and \"blinded\" the fleet.\n\nEven then, some commanders couldn't help--or couldn't resist--getting as close as they could.  George Patton's conspicuously clean Jeep was targeted by machine guns and artillery numerous times.  Erwin Rommel's command car was strafed and he was seriously injured in Normandy.  Leslie McNair was killed by the preparatory heavy carpet-bombing in Operation Cobra.  And Heinz Guderian had to run his command halftrack through enemy lines on at least one occasion.  But by then these incidents were the exception rather than the rule.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement of the general from the front to the rear was one of the more important developments in the history of warfare.  John Keegan, in &lt;em&gt;The Mask of Command&lt;/em&gt;, divides the decision into three parts: in front always, in front sometimes, or in front rarely (or never).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alexander and Epaminondas of Thebes are two great examples of in front always commanders.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These generals not only commanded from in front, but often from the most dangerous and exposed position in the line.  The battle-plan had to be made and agreed upon in advance and the general himself became a local commander when the battle started.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It punched Epaminondas&amp;#39; ticket during his greatest victory and got Alexander seriously injured several times, and nearly killed several others.  On the other hand, the sub-section they commanded in battle usually fought better and the general did have some control over what was usually the most important sector of the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement of the general to the back had everything to do with the concept of &lt;em&gt;reserves&lt;/em&gt;, and how and when to deploy them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scipio Africanus is a good example of a general who, after demonstrating his personal courage enough to win the trust of his troops, stayed back to &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; the course of battle through subsequent deployment.  Zama probably qualifies as one of the most important battles ever because two top-shelf generals, Scipio and Hannibal, commanded from the rear and directed the use of reserves, counterbalancing each others&amp;#39; moves until a subordinate, Massinissa, delivered the crushing blow for Scipio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As armies got larger, it became more and more difficult for a general to keep a hand on all elements of the battle.  The Duke of Wellington at Waterloo had to stay &lt;em&gt;just outside&lt;/em&gt; killing range (under &amp;quot;Wellington&amp;#39;s Tree&amp;quot;) in order to observe and direct the battle, often using a pocket telescope.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of Wellington&amp;#39;s entourage were not as lucky as he and at least once he had to run away and command an infantry square to lie down so he could jump their line with his horse and hide from pursuing French cavalry.  The Duke played a thin hand of holding the line against a superior enemy force, parsimoniously deploying reserves all day, in the hopes that a Prussian army would reach the field in time to relieve him.  They did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frederick the Great is another good example of a commander who stayed just close enough to see what was going on for himself.  Frederick was a master of &lt;em&gt;operativ&lt;/em&gt;, the art of not only directing the deployment of reserves but also &lt;em&gt;their tactical movement&lt;/em&gt; on the battlefield.  Frederick had to be close to the line to do it personally, but now modern American commanders practice the same thing, sometimes in realtime from another continent entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the American Civil War the commander had to stay mostly in the rear because of the disruption his incapacitation could cause.  Some commanders, like Jackson, wouldn&amp;#39;t even share plans with subordinates.  Jackson (as a subordinate) and others who got too close to the line were in serious danger.  On at least one occasion, one commander (Sherman), spotted his adversary (Polk) on the battlefield and &amp;quot;sniped&amp;quot; him with artillery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert E. Lee is an interesting example of a commander who stayed in the rear not by choice but by necessity or by the insistence of others.  Once, at Chancellorsville, he felt compelled to act as his own Corps commander.  On two occasions in 1864, he was almost forcibly removed from danger by worried subordinates as he attempted to join in troop movements.  In 1865, he got loose for a while and directed a single artillery battery to buy time for his army to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the 20th Century, the &amp;quot;front&amp;quot; was 30 or more miles deep and a high-level commander could not afford to leave a relatively safe nexus of electronic communications (as well as the time-honored runners carrying dispatches).   Being in overall command in the far rear was still no guarantee of safety; &amp;quot;Strafer&amp;quot; Gott never got to actually command the Eighth Army in North Africa because he was shot down on his way to the command post.  Adolf Hitler, who increasingly micromanaged the German forces until at one point he found himself placing individual antiaircraft guns, was almost done in by one of his own V1s when it failed on takeoff and exploded on top of his command bunker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same principles applied to naval commanders, by the way.  In World War II, fleet admirals had to move to special command cruisers because on one occasion the broadside of the commanding admiral&amp;#39;s battleship knocked out its own communications and &amp;quot;blinded&amp;quot; the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even then, some commanders couldn&amp;#39;t help--or couldn&amp;#39;t resist--getting as close as they could.  George Patton&amp;#39;s conspicuously clean Jeep was targeted by machine guns and artillery numerous times.  Erwin Rommel&amp;#39;s command car was strafed and he was seriously injured in Normandy.  Leslie McNair was killed by the preparatory heavy carpet-bombing in Operation Cobra.  And Heinz Guderian had to run his command halftrack through enemy lines on at least one occasion.

This type of leadership wasn&amp;#39;t always present in the past either I mean Alexander did not necessarily need to be at the literal front of the charge or leading the way on the walls of the enemy but he did it because it was part of his personality and the role he was playing, and it almost killed him numerous times. Other generals of the time would not be so risky and only lead personally when critical or necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "history", "name": "t1_dgckc55", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492405031.0, "created_utc": 1492376231.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j2o1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j2o1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j2o1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j2o1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgceiwz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "candelee", "parent_id": "t1_dgb18o8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/history", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you been reading?
