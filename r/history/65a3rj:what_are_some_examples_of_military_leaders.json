Its written in simple language and no sentence is wasted describing anything unnecessary, it's kinda like a Wikipedia article but way more informative. Also maps! \n\nOn the other hand if you want to start with Ancient India I'd suggest Romila Thapar's work in that category though again you could just avoid the boring Neolithic bits and skip to the Indus Valley Civ :) \n\nAnd so on. I'd recommend the Satish Chandra thing more even though it's about the middle period (don't worry, not difficult to follow from sudden starting point) because like I said it draws you into the story better and history's all about enjoying what you read.
