Her death certificate is dated 1852 and says she was 92 years old when she died. The Census and her family Bible say she was born May 20th, but her marriage certificate and death certificate say she was born May 12th. So when was she born?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A genealogy researcher would say, &amp;quot;May 20th, 1760. I trust the family Bible over the marriage certificate, which may have been filled out by the husband&amp;#39;s family. No source but the census taker says she was 38 when she was either 30 (by the family Bible) or 27 (by her marriage certificate), so we guess that he tried to write &amp;#39;30&amp;#39; and his &amp;#39;0&amp;#39; was mistaken for an &amp;#39;8&amp;#39;. Her husband lived one year longer than she did, so he likely filled out her death certificate and did so by her marriage certificate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of history that rests on statements like these, and it is very common for enough possibilities to exist to throw almost any part of it into doubt.

Any ancient source (especially something like the bible where it&amp;#39;s a compilation of sources that were heavily edited for various reasons) is generally taken with heavy skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding an inscription with Pilate&amp;#39;s name on it is kinda like reading Strabo&amp;#39;s Amanirenas story and later on finding out that there really was someone who cut off the head of an Augustus statue and buried it under an alter to victory. You think, &amp;quot;Huh, that part was actually true&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like all of ancient history is a massive puzzle and there are a ton of pieces from other puzzles thrown in the pile (myths, propaganda, usurper narratives, etc.). It&amp;#39;s amazing when you find a puzzle piece that you know with some certainty actually belongs to your puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "history", "name": "t1_dg9y5lj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241990.0, "created_utc": 1492213190.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d9v5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d9v5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d9v5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9y8xd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Caladbolg_Prometheus", "parent_id": "t1_dg9qh74", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/history", "controversiality": 0, "body": "At this rate of global warming and destruction of the environment, we might as well ask if they'll be anyone around to remember (this is a hyperbole)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this rate of global warming and destruction of the environment, we might as well ask if they&amp;#39;ll be anyone around to remember (this is a hyperbole)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "history", "name": "t1_dg9y8xd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492242111.0, "created_utc": 1492213311.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9qh74", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "schad501", "parent_id": "t1_dg9n79t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/history", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We'll see what's still around in 2000 years.
