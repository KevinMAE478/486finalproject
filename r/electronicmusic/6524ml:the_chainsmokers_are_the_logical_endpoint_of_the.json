There are bands that make parodies of being in a band, like Spinal Tap. That\u2019s a big influence.

When I hear that stuff, I\u2019m like, they just don\u2019t see what it really is. There are bands that make parodies of being in a band, like Spinal Tap. That\u2019s a big influence. They\u2019re making fun of a rock band, but they write lyrics that are better than real rock bands. And Tenacious D: They\u2019re funny, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re making fun of bands. Even Steel Panther, who are inspirations to us, they\u2019re kind of like doing a whole hair-metal thing, but these dudes are really talented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Chainsmokers are just egotistical clowns.

I started going to shows in 2011 so I was already a bit late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then the majority of people at shows were those who legitimately liked the artists and genres they were going to see. Over the years I saw a transition from people you could talk to about the artists and their songs to every show being packed with people who just wanted to dance shirtless while taking moll and wearing ridiculous clothes just because it was fun. I started to really notice when most of the people at festivals didn&amp;#39;t even know tho the fuck was even on stage at most of the ones I went to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it was largely inevitable but the type of people there made the experience a lot less fun than when I started going and was seeing artists like Avicii in smaller, more intimate venues. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "electronicmusic", "name": "t1_dg7djhy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492107397.0, "created_utc": 1492078597.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7aszh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 56, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brendanp8", "parent_id": "t1_dg7aaim", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/electronicmusic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So a casual fan isn't welcome at a live show?
