This feels like Arca at his most restrained, but the album finds its greatest moments of beauty often in the lack of maximalist sound, letting the occasional imperfections and scattering tones in his voice take the forefront. The album shows how much Arca has matured as an artist within the course of four years with his production combining both the alien archetypes that defined his *Xen* and *Mutant* albums, with a renewed humanistic theme of forlorn love and loss; it is a listen that will easily make it as a major album of the year contender.\n\n**Clark** also had a major new release overshadowed by this frenetic Friday of releases in a more deliberate focus of the techno themes that took the forefront of his self-titled work. *'Death Peak'* upon its first listens almost seems to abandon the monolithic sonics of its predecessor, instead opting for uptempo four-on-the-floor measures that are pierced by the hums of airy pads, the rush of synths that glitter and tune back and forth, and reverberated female chorus vocals that fill and loop within the blank space. While the first half of the album seems to carry more weight and cohesion, the second half does teeter a little bit towards favoring interludes and one-offs that seem scattered in approach; but at the same time, it is a solid return to Warp for Clark and has some singles that will fit well in to the rest of discography.\n\nSo, this was my first time listening to *'The Disintegration Loops I'* from **William Basinski**, an ambient-drone project that surfaced in lieu of the events following 9/11 that features tape loops deteriorating and fragmenting over time to create a form of self-destructive music. I'm unsure of whether it was some rough weeks in between while I listened to the album, the connotation and context of the work, or perhaps both, but this was one of the few albums that have made me cry while listening. I'm going to tackle the other three releases over the next couple of weeks as well.\n\nThe other albums I've listened to this week include:\n\n* **Ulver** - The Assasination of Julius Caesar\n* **Dopplereffekt** - Cellular Automata\n* **Frank Ocean** - Blond(e)\n* **Kassem Mosse** - Disclosure\n* **Arandel** - Aleae\n* **Autechre** - Quaristice\n* **Various Artists** - Sensate Silk\n* **Nicholas Britell** - Moonlight (Official Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n* **Julianna Barwick** - The Magic Place\n* **Grouper** - Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill\n* **Kelly Lee Owens** - Kelly Lee Owens (s/t)\n* **Serpentwithfeet** - blisters EP\n* **Ben Frost** - By The Throat\n\nUnlisted on Spotify: \n\n* Nier: Automata OST (check it out, it's pretty great)\n* Nier: Gestalt OST\n\nSingles of the week:\n\n* [**Actress** - Dancing In The Smoke](https://soundcloud.com/ninja-tune/actress_dancing-in-the-smoke)\n\n* [**Mr. Mitch** - VPN (ft.
