I put fire first because it is usually needed to purify water. You definitely want to be able to consistently make fire using methods that are renewable (this means making fire without a lighter or matches). Typical methods I use are magnification, parabolic lens, Ferro rod, and good old flint and steel. Friction fire is extremely difficult to reproduce consistently and usually ends up in frustration and lost calories. Knowing how to start a fire is one thing, but knowing how to build and sustain a fire is another, so definitely study this as well.\n\nFor water, just knowing how to identify good water sources and general water purification methods should be sufficient. It's always good to have a small, personal water filter (like a sawyer mini). \n\nFor shelter, know how to construct some basic structures like a lean-to and a wigwam. Collecting wood for the construction of shelter can be extremely tiring, so having a light-weight shelter in your go bag is indispensable. If you do have to build your own shelter, having the right tool for the job can make it less agonizing. I use a sven saw (folding saw) and I love it.\n\nFor food, research not just which plants are edible in your area, but also what time of year they should be eaten and how to identify them with 100% confidence (there are a lot of copy-cats that are often toxic). Maybe take a foraging class, I'll bet no matter where you are, you can find one in your area. It is an *invaluable* skill to have. You should know basic trapping techniques (how to identify game trails, set snares, etc) and knowing how to fish is a great skill to have. \n\nAlso, you should know how to tie at least a dozen knots by heart to the point where you can tie them in the dark (because you may have to).
