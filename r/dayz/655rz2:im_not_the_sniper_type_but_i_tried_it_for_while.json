This includes more than just bipods - it also covers using your surroundings as well, including trees, fences, walls, window frames, other players, certain stances, etc. To do this in the most efficient way possible (i.e. avoiding time spent on temporary improvised solutions that will end up being entirely replaced), this will require the new player controller to implement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ArmA 3 has many weapon resting options to balance out the sway like I listed above, and I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that if it could have been easily ported over to SA, it would have been done ages ago. If I were to guess, at the time when they made the decision to wait, odds are at least some of the issues are related to the older, ArmA 2-era models in Chernarus, and how the current player controller system in SA interacts with them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than the extreme option of nerfing sway across the board (which I&amp;#39;m not in favor of - while irritating, the current sway is not game breaking), the current sway mechanic can&amp;#39;t be effectively balanced until the the new controller and weapon resting is in place. At that point, the whole system can be reviewed, tweaked, and re-balanced, making a far better experience for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dg87ryl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492145909.0, "created_utc": 1492117109.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655rz2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655rz2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg82juc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "s1atan", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nhrl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sway is just bugged to the hell and you are in denial.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sway is just bugged to the hell and you are in denial.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dg82juc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140129.0, "created_utc": 1492111329.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655rz2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655rz2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655rz2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655rz2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85x5f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lrishjake", "parent_id": "t1_dg85fr4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol... his hair is rather.. lacking. :P", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lol... his hair is rather.. lacking. :P&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dg85x5f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143810.0, "created_utc": 1492115010.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85fr4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wolfgeist", "parent_id": "t1_dg81mwe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, I am actually much more handsome and have far thicker, more luxurious hair.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I am actually much more handsome and have far thicker, more luxurious hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dg85fr4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143287.0, "created_utc": 1492114487.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg81mwe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lrishjake", "parent_id": "t1_dg808hn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "* I secretly think you're Tope. :P", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I secretly think you&amp;#39;re Tope. :P&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dg81mwe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492139134.0, "created_utc": 1492110334.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg808hn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wolfgeist", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nhrl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep.
