I also do believe there have been some inherent issues with what is, and what is not viable for Early Access development phase, as this is something that was not tried a lot before, and most of it is pioneered (process-wise) as things evolve. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEarly Access is a dynamic environment that is quite different from the traditional closed door development. I\u2019m gonna get quite technical, so for those who do not feel like reading a wall of text, I had a presentation at White Nights Prague conference that takes on the subject of this Status Report contribution with less detail:\n\n\n[Lessons From Early Access Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZgMjWXuEpg)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThat said, I do stand by the decisions we made as a team, but also see major flaws in how one can present changes in games\u2019 underlying technology, where most of these changes are actually the base building blocks which, in time, will be able to provide a significant change of the overall player experience. \nAll these engine changes are, in the case of DayZ, developed with the aim to keep the game moddable at all levels, with expanded scope. The engine changes for DayZ include\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Renderer\n\n* Networking system\n\n* Controls\n\n* Script\n\n* Sounds\n\n* Physics\n\n* Tools\n\n* Server-Client architecture (in most systems!)\n\n* Consoles\n\n* Animations\n\n* All gameplay systems written inscript (to a certain degree)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe need to work on all that while we create data and iterate, while we\u2019re slowly trickling some systems into the live game (the public Experimental/Stable branches of DayZ) to test them. That creates a certain lack of visible progress as things are in motion and need time to settle down. These days, many of the base systems are in-game internally, and we are spending a significant amount of time removing a lot of old systems, while interconnecting the new ones.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's compare that vision we have for DayZ with the live game that\u2019s out there right now, just so that you have an idea of what it all means in practice. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLive game runs old physics system, where collisions are a giant hog on server performance. To replace that, you basically need to replace everything else, as many of these old systems were hard-coded to a large degree. You need to make an originally monolithic application into a modular one, where all these old systems are interconnected. You almost, almost start from scratch. And as small as it sounds, server performance can break anything. Most of the systems above have not been part of live game because of this dependencies in old structure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEvery issue in DayZ has a reason. Most of those issues that trouble you are known to us, and have a solution somewhere in all this work that we have done, and want to bring to you. Like the stairs killing you, which is a combination of many, many factors: Issues with data binarization, physics, collisions, server-client architecture and even script and player itself. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo fix a \u201csimple\u201d issue like that takes years of work because we really can\u2019t take on any more technical debt and \u201chack\u201d these fixes into the game to save the day. We play for the long haul, not for the short term gain. And as such, there lies the inherent issue of how to approach early access. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings take time, and you can\u2019t buy patience with a wall of text. You just can\u2019t. And I get that now, when we have to face the truth here, as all these things that we worked for are not in a state to make for a fun game. Yet. That point (where we will present a fun to play game) is BETA for us. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYes, we could probably, eventually set up a deployment to show each different technology change part by part (like we did with the renderer), but unless you have base the game loop present in a game, it\u2019s just a tech demo. Even if we have all the parts ready, these details (bug fixing, connecting pieces together\u2026) matter a lot.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019m going to use a simplified story of a decision making that happened around one simple upgrade. How player sounds should work in the future:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSound in games has a lot more to it than one would imagine at first. Besides the sound data itself (which has to be prepared in context of the technology, as in supporting its data structure, and also allows further data modifications by the underlying game technology that plays the final sound for the player) there is also the important part of letting the game know when it should play a sound. Let's call that an event.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou also need to edit all this in some way, to put events in gameplay that plays the sounds, and edit the sounds themselves, and don\u2019t forget the pipeline for building the game that puts all this in some structure. Events have to be called from script, animations, items, environment... There has to be some logic to it. You need tools to visualize the data, a script to play it, have logic that decides how and why\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMany of these systems were originally hard-coded - hard to tweak, hard to change. So the goal was (and is) to bring them in line with the rest of the DayZ vision, and to make the game modular, editable (visually, if possible) and expandable in the future. So we\u2019re talking about tons of disciplines that are affected, and you can\u2019t do one part of it and think the whole thing will still function. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you prepare the new technology to be compatible with rest of the new stuff, it is often impossible to keep things compatible. And more than often, you just need to move on and focus only on the new technology.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor example with player sounds, we\u2019re now in process of writing the sound event manager, and then we will need to connect the sounds into data structure, and define events that launch them for new animations of player moving. Meanwhile, we\u2019re also reworking all the textures to prepare the game to recognize surfaces better, or to recognize when a sound is played in interior/exterior. At the same time, we\u2019re implementing a way to edit the data in animation editor, in order to be able to set up these events visually, not just by playing a loop like in the old system. At the end of all this, there will be sounds playing when the foot of the player touches the ground. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt might sound silly at first, but all these things and changes can expand the scope heavily for us and the modders alike. Its not going to be easy, but as I said, we're not going anywhere.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*- Eugen Harton / Producer* ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest in playing this game for what it&amp;#39;s intended to be, I would highly recommend reading this part of the April 4th 2017 Status Report, written by Eugen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-4-april-2017\"&gt;https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-4-april-2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Dev Update/Eugen&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t usually contribute to Status Reports, but this time, I&amp;#39;d like to change that and touch upon a topic of DayZ development and Early Access development in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that a lot of you have concerns about DayZ development. I also do believe there have been some inherent issues with what is, and what is not viable for Early Access development phase, as this is something that was not tried a lot before, and most of it is pioneered (process-wise) as things evolve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early Access is a dynamic environment that is quite different from the traditional closed door development. I\u2019m gonna get quite technical, so for those who do not feel like reading a wall of text, I had a presentation at White Nights Prague conference that takes on the subject of this Status Report contribution with less detail:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZgMjWXuEpg\"&gt;Lessons From Early Access Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I do stand by the decisions we made as a team, but also see major flaws in how one can present changes in games\u2019 underlying technology, where most of these changes are actually the base building blocks which, in time, will be able to provide a significant change of the overall player experience. \nAll these engine changes are, in the case of DayZ, developed with the aim to keep the game moddable at all levels, with expanded scope. The engine changes for DayZ include&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renderer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Networking system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Script&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server-Client architecture (in most systems!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consoles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All gameplay systems written inscript (to a certain degree)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to work on all that while we create data and iterate, while we\u2019re slowly trickling some systems into the live game (the public Experimental/Stable branches of DayZ) to test them. That creates a certain lack of visible progress as things are in motion and need time to settle down. These days, many of the base systems are in-game internally, and we are spending a significant amount of time removing a lot of old systems, while interconnecting the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s compare that vision we have for DayZ with the live game that\u2019s out there right now, just so that you have an idea of what it all means in practice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Live game runs old physics system, where collisions are a giant hog on server performance. To replace that, you basically need to replace everything else, as many of these old systems were hard-coded to a large degree. You need to make an originally monolithic application into a modular one, where all these old systems are interconnected. You almost, almost start from scratch. And as small as it sounds, server performance can break anything.

I\u2019m gonna get quite technical, so for those who do not feel like reading a wall of text, I had a presentation at White Nights Prague conference that takes on the subject of this Status Report contribution with less detail:\n\n\n[Lessons From Early Access Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZgMjWXuEpg)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThat said, I do stand by the decisions we made as a team, but also see major flaws in how one can present changes in games\u2019 underlying technology, where most of these changes are actually the base building blocks which, in time, will be able to provide a significant change of the overall player experience. \nAll these engine changes are, in the case of DayZ, developed with the aim to keep the game moddable at all levels, with expanded scope. The engine changes for DayZ include\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Renderer\n\n* Networking system\n\n* Controls\n\n* Script\n\n* Sounds\n\n* Physics\n\n* Tools\n\n* Server-Client architecture (in most systems!)\n\n* Consoles\n\n* Animations\n\n* All gameplay systems written inscript (to a certain degree)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe need to work on all that while we create data and iterate, while we\u2019re slowly trickling some systems into the live game (the public Experimental/Stable branches of DayZ) to test them. That creates a certain lack of visible progress as things are in motion and need time to settle down. These days, many of the base systems are in-game internally, and we are spending a significant amount of time removing a lot of old systems, while interconnecting the new ones.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's compare that vision we have for DayZ with the live game that\u2019s out there right now, just so that you have an idea of what it all means in practice. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLive game runs old physics system, where collisions are a giant hog on server performance. To replace that, you basically need to replace everything else, as many of these old systems were hard-coded to a large degree. You need to make an originally monolithic application into a modular one, where all these old systems are interconnected. You almost, almost start from scratch. And as small as it sounds, server performance can break anything. Most of the systems above have not been part of live game because of this dependencies in old structure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEvery issue in DayZ has a reason. Most of those issues that trouble you are known to us, and have a solution somewhere in all this work that we have done, and want to bring to you. Like the stairs killing you, which is a combination of many, many factors: Issues with data binarization, physics, collisions, server-client architecture and even script and player itself. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo fix a \u201csimple\u201d issue like that takes years of work because we really can\u2019t take on any more technical debt and \u201chack\u201d these fixes into the game to save the day. We play for the long haul, not for the short term gain. And as such, there lies the inherent issue of how to approach early access. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings take time, and you can\u2019t buy patience with a wall of text. You just can\u2019t. And I get that now, when we have to face the truth here, as all these things that we worked for are not in a state to make for a fun game. Yet. That point (where we will present a fun to play game) is BETA for us. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYes, we could probably, eventually set up a deployment to show each different technology change part by part (like we did with the renderer), but unless you have base the game loop present in a game, it\u2019s just a tech demo. Even if we have all the parts ready, these details (bug fixing, connecting pieces together\u2026) matter a lot.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019m going to use a simplified story of a decision making that happened around one simple upgrade. How player sounds should work in the future:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSound in games has a lot more to it than one would imagine at first. Besides the sound data itself (which has to be prepared in context of the technology, as in supporting its data structure, and also allows further data modifications by the underlying game technology that plays the final sound for the player) there is also the important part of letting the game know when it should play a sound. Let's call that an event.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou also need to edit all this in some way, to put events in gameplay that plays the sounds, and edit the sounds themselves, and don\u2019t forget the pipeline for building the game that puts all this in some structure. Events have to be called from script, animations, items, environment... There has to be some logic to it. You need tools to visualize the data, a script to play it, have logic that decides how and why\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMany of these systems were originally hard-coded - hard to tweak, hard to change. So the goal was (and is) to bring them in line with the rest of the DayZ vision, and to make the game modular, editable (visually, if possible) and expandable in the future. So we\u2019re talking about tons of disciplines that are affected, and you can\u2019t do one part of it and think the whole thing will still function. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you prepare the new technology to be compatible with rest of the new stuff, it is often impossible to keep things compatible. And more than often, you just need to move on and focus only on the new technology.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor example with player sounds, we\u2019re now in process of writing the sound event manager, and then we will need to connect the sounds into data structure, and define events that launch them for new animations of player moving. Meanwhile, we\u2019re also reworking all the textures to prepare the game to recognize surfaces better, or to recognize when a sound is played in interior/exterior. At the same time, we\u2019re implementing a way to edit the data in animation editor, in order to be able to set up these events visually, not just by playing a loop like in the old system. At the end of all this, there will be sounds playing when the foot of the player touches the ground. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt might sound silly at first, but all these things and changes can expand the scope heavily for us and the modders alike. Its not going to be easy, but as I said, we're not going anywhere.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*- Eugen Harton / Producer* ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get to copy pasta this sooner than I thought I would. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-4-april-2017\"&gt;https://dayz.com/blog/status-report-4-april-2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Dev Update/Eugen&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t usually contribute to Status Reports, but this time, I&amp;#39;d like to change that and touch upon a topic of DayZ development and Early Access development in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that a lot of you have concerns about DayZ development.

You need tools to visualize the data, a script to play it, have logic that decides how and why\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of these systems were originally hard-coded - hard to tweak, hard to change. So the goal was (and is) to bring them in line with the rest of the DayZ vision, and to make the game modular, editable (visually, if possible) and expandable in the future. So we\u2019re talking about tons of disciplines that are affected, and you can\u2019t do one part of it and think the whole thing will still function. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you prepare the new technology to be compatible with rest of the new stuff, it is often impossible to keep things compatible. And more than often, you just need to move on and focus only on the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example with player sounds, we\u2019re now in process of writing the sound event manager, and then we will need to connect the sounds into data structure, and define events that launch them for new animations of player moving. Meanwhile, we\u2019re also reworking all the textures to prepare the game to recognize surfaces better, or to recognize when a sound is played in interior/exterior. At the same time, we\u2019re implementing a way to edit the data in animation editor, in order to be able to set up these events visually, not just by playing a loop like in the old system. At the end of all this, there will be sounds playing when the foot of the player touches the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might sound silly at first, but all these things and changes can expand the scope heavily for us and the modders alike. Its not going to be easy, but as I said, we&amp;#39;re not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Eugen Harton / Producer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dgdqgib", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476303.0, "created_utc": 1492447503.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vtvz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdqpib", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Luke_CZ3", "parent_id": "t1_dgdoz52", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 1, "body": "&gt;For one thing, the devs should have somebody to explain these things, or somebody to make any explanations they have made more visible.\n\nDid you ever read any SR?", "edited": 1492450297.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the devs should have somebody to explain these things, or somebody to make any explanations they have made more visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you ever read any SR?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dayz", "name": "t1_dgdqpib", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476573.0, "created_utc": 1492447773.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdoz52", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Calackyo", "parent_id": "t1_dgdodzg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dayz", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The thing is, you shouldn't have to be explaining these again and again.\n\nFor one thing, the devs should have somebody to explain these things, or somebody to make any explanations they have made more visible. \n\nthe other thing, four years is more than enough time to make a AAA game, even from the ground up.
