I love this game, abandoning pretty much every other game I played. But to have it in the current state is truly frustrating. So many elements have taken leaps backward, and are fairly equal to the amount of progressions. Honestly, they could have stopped developing at .61 and moved to eliminating bugs and I would have been happy.
