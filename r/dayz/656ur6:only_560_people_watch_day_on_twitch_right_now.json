BI need to realise that modders are the only ones that can save dayz atm. Dayz was so good, i hsve 1500 hours and used to defend it like you, but oncr you venture into other games and see their development compared, it makes dayz devs look pathetic. They dont even show us internal builds or anything in their fortnightly status report, certain things hsve been on trello for years. It jist goes to show that they are lying about certain things within development.
