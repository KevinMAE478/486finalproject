Last time when I played every time I started on coast, headed inland and before some group of asshats killed me or I died because of a bug I had usually pistol with mag but little to no ammo, pistol without mag or some basic gun with little amount of ammo. My best in 0.61 was AK + one mag + ~60 bullets. That's not a lot after few days of playing.\n\nThere are 12 types of ammo in game, 39 guns, 15 of them don't need mag (but half of them are pretty non existing in current updates and another few are more toy guns than real weapon). Finding ammo, pistol or mag is one thing. Finding corresponding ammo, pistol and mag is totally different thing. But yeah, let's forget about it and decrease amount of everything.\n\n&gt;food status is fixed with some apples\n\nYeah apple bug. Don't use it if you don't want. No one forces you. However if not this bug then half of people would stop playing, because there is no hunting mechanic (nope, running in certain area counting on luck is not hunting), horticulture makes no sense (only pumpkins actually are worth eating), finding canned food is harder, eating 8 chicken breasts to stop being hungry is not fun at all - especially when you need to repeat it 20 minutes later.\n\n&gt;you can drink almost any liquid and not die\n\nBecause IRL drinking liquid kills you... IDK if purifying water even works and even if you have to use purifying tabs that spawn so random it's actually better you can drink from waterpumps.\n\n&gt;diseases are virtually inexistent\n\nAgain, with current medical supplies spawn it's better. I once looked for antibiotics and/or charcoal. I many cities, villages, towns, hospitals and nothing. Other time you go to shed in Cherno and bam! They are there. It totally makes sense... random... too random.\n\n&gt;you can survive any weather with a couple of sticks and a stone\n\nOh yeah, so let's make weather harsher so you will need to spend even more time with sticks and stone, because stopping every few minutes to start a fire place is sooo fun obviously.\n\n&gt;zeds aren't a threat\n\nAgree.\n\n&gt;the weather is too forgiving\n\nSo let's make it harsher, right? Then if it start to rain people will just leave server or stop every 5 minutes to start a fire place. Nice. Obviously finding any gear protecting from rain won't be really possible, because of \"less everything\" policy.\n\n&gt;Where's the fun of running hours without anything to fight against\n\nIt's not here. However what you missed ideas of less everything, harder everything won't make it funnier.

Last time when I played every time I started on coast, headed inland and before some group of asshats killed me or I died because of a bug I had usually pistol with mag but little to no ammo, pistol without mag or some basic gun with little amount of ammo. My best in 0.61 was AK + one mag + ~60 bullets. That&amp;#39;s not a lot after few days of playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 12 types of ammo in game, 39 guns, 15 of them don&amp;#39;t need mag (but half of them are pretty non existing in current updates and another few are more toy guns than real weapon). Finding ammo, pistol or mag is one thing. Finding corresponding ammo, pistol and mag is totally different thing. But yeah, let&amp;#39;s forget about it and decrease amount of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;food status is fixed with some apples&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah apple bug. Don&amp;#39;t use it if you don&amp;#39;t want. No one forces you. However if not this bug then half of people would stop playing, because there is no hunting mechanic (nope, running in certain area counting on luck is not hunting), horticulture makes no sense (only pumpkins actually are worth eating), finding canned food is harder, eating 8 chicken breasts to stop being hungry is not fun at all - especially when you need to repeat it 20 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you can drink almost any liquid and not die&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because IRL drinking liquid kills you... IDK if purifying water even works and even if you have to use purifying tabs that spawn so random it&amp;#39;s actually better you can drink from waterpumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;diseases are virtually inexistent&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, with current medical supplies spawn it&amp;#39;s better. I once looked for antibiotics and/or charcoal. I many cities, villages, towns, hospitals and nothing. Other time you go to shed in Cherno and bam! They are there. It totally makes sense... random... too random.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you can survive any weather with a couple of sticks and a stone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, so let&amp;#39;s make weather harsher so you will need to spend even more time with sticks and stone, because stopping every few minutes to start a fire place is sooo fun obviously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;zeds aren&amp;#39;t a threat&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Agree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the weather is too forgiving&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s make it harsher, right? Then if it start to rain people will just leave server or stop every 5 minutes to start a fire place. Nice. Obviously finding any gear protecting from rain won&amp;#39;t be really possible, because of &amp;quot;less everything&amp;quot; policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where&amp;#39;s the fun of running hours without anything to fight against&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not here.
