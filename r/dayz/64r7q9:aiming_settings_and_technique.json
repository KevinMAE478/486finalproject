Use arm for rough and overall big turns. Let's say there is an enemy on your direct right, use your arm to make the big swing to turn towards that general direction and then use the wrist to make fine adjustments and aim directly on the enemy.\n\nWhen it comes to DPI, I keep it at 500 or so and adjust the rest via in-game sensitivity slider. For me, the rule of thumb is this:\n\n1. For twitch shooters that require precise aim, a full swing from left to right should make the avatar make a full 180 turn.\n\n2. For more slower paced games, full swing from left to right should almost make a 360 because you move a lot more and move a lot more, rather than constantly aiming.\n\nMost importantly, turn off any aim smoothing or aim acceleration. First thing first, in the windows pointer settings, turn off \"enhance pointer precision\". This way, you will get a 1:1 input from your mouse. What this does is, because you know how much movement you need to turn 90 degrees or 180 degrees for example, your muscle memory will kick in and you'll be able to make more precise movements. As I said, for me, when I make a full swing from left to right, my avatar turns 180 degrees. So if I put my mouse to the left-most edge of the pad and swing it back to the middle, I know I will make a 90 degree turn to the right and my mouse will be perfectly stationed in the middle of the mouse pad, so that I can comfortably fine-adjust using my wrist.\n\nI hope this helps.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much a solid answer and advice.
