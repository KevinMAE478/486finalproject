"**Spoilers** ahead, also a bit of text to read, but hopefully answers your question.\n\n**TLDR;** the humour of the film comes from being a man in a male friendship, and you have to become friends with the film to laugh at it..\n\n---\n\nIt *is* aimed at a certain audience: men. Blokes, Lads, Fellers, Geezers and Gentlemen, all. It reflects the male experience really well - the camaraderie, the quiet nervousness when overtly camp gays are coming onto you, the fear of public toilets and random violence while you're vulnerably taking a pee. Being drunk and silly in a place full of quiet types like a church at Midnight Mass on Christmas eve... or a tea shop. Having to do something rugged for the first time, like killing and prepping a rabbit for dinner in an abandoned cottage in the cold. A run-in with the police and the friend who gets you into trouble. Being stupidly poor and the crushing fear of not being successful to pull yourself out of being poor. (Men are defined by what they do and being an alcoholic out of work actor is pretty low for career prospects - these aren't bankers or mercenaries about to parachute into battle in the last scene. It's a *gentle* movie about being a man in a male friendship).\n\nThere are no women, except the cartoonish Farmer's wife (or Mum... Can't remember.. now I'll have to watch it again. Oh no..) and Miss Blenihazitt (or something). All the characters reflect different stereotypes of the male experience.\n\nAll the characters are cartoons. They're ridiculous. They're charactures of men. \n\nThe film is about a friendship between two men, interacting with other men, and so beautifully scripted, acted, edited and filmed - no other film has really shown, gently, the male experience and more so, male friendship. And because of that, men connect with it and the humour is something to be smiled at on the first viewing, but not necessarily laughed at. Not the first time of viewing.\n\nBecause it's about men and male friendship, men are watching the experience of being a man and in a male friendship. Paul McGann's very subtly, delicately acted character ('I'), enables a man to watch the film from the position of 'I'. (He's the only character that *isn't* rediculous.) They're in the first person, being introduced to Withnail and taken along for the ride, literally as they go on a roadtrip. And the two friends break up at the end of the film, but stay friends. They just had to go their different ways.\n\nNow, because men have now seen the film, sucked in by the amazing script, acting, filming and editing, we've now experienced what it's like being friends with Withnail. We became friends with him, but the film ended, and we had to go our separate ways. *We became friends with a film.* And as the film ends, we say goodbye to a friend, a talented, passionate, disgraceful and beautifully awful friend, who it's safe to say goodbye to.\n\nSo we watch it again, because that's what friends do - we stay in touch, we go back to each other. But this is a madcap friend who's a bit crazy, so we watch him again from afar where it's safe, probably with other male friends who've also connected with the film in the same way. And because it's so well scripted, there are lines we all know.\n\nGirls sing songs together. All blokes know that. Blokes don't do that often if at all. Instead, they watch Withnail &amp; I together, which just so happens to be a film about male friendship. We're now friends with Withnail, we're friends with the film, and we're with our own friends. Now we can laugh at Withnail, the ridiculous cartoon male characters that we all know *from the view of being men*, and now we're friends with Withnail, instead of him being just a stranger being drunk and obnoxous. We go on a trip with him. We can even play male games with the film, like matching them drink for drink. And as girls sing songs together, men call out the lines in the film to each other as they watch it, probably drunk. Or dangerously high (*\"ramaramaramarama...*\").\n\nAnd we've all got a bit of Withnail in us, except we all think it's our mate instead of us.", "edited": 1492055586.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers&lt;/strong&gt; ahead, also a bit of text to read, but hopefully answers your question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; the humour of the film comes from being a man in a male friendship, and you have to become friends with the film to laugh at it..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; aimed at a certain audience: men.

Faced with no modern conveniences, a bunch of oddball locals, and a surprise visit from an amorous &amp;quot;Uncle Monty&amp;quot;, their wits are tested, along with their friendship.\n(&lt;em&gt;IMDb&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical reception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The film holds a 94% &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; rating, and an average rating of 8.5 out of 10 from critic website Rotten Tomatoes. In August 2009 The Observer polled 60 eminent British film filmmakers and film critics who voted it the second best British film of the last 25 years. The film was also ranked number 118 in Empire&amp;#39;s 500 Greatest Films of all Time list. In 2009 critic Roger Ebert added the film to his &amp;quot;Great Movies&amp;quot; list, describing Grant&amp;#39;s performance as a &amp;quot;tour de force&amp;quot; and Withnail as &amp;quot;one of the iconic figures in modern films.&amp;quot;\n(&lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More info at &lt;a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/Title?Withnail+%26+I+%281987%29\"&gt;IMDb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Withnail%20and%20I\"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/withnail_and_i/\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/60020699\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1756560\"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I am a bot.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F64xfcn\" title=\"Confidence: 1.04\"&gt;Send me feedback&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"/r/MovieGuide/w/about\"&gt;Data sources and other information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fullmoviesonyoutube", "name": "t1_dg5pz7p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492023526.0, "created_utc": 1491994726.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfcn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5r1mh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boaty_dogs", "parent_id": "t3_64xfcn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fullmoviesonyoutube", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Blocked in Canada...](https://unblockvideos.com/youtube-video-restriction-checker/#url=cMXZUjQfCmk)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Mirror**: https://unblockvideos.com/#url=cMXZUjQfCmk", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://unblockvideos.com/youtube-video-restriction-checker/#url=cMXZUjQfCmk\"&gt;Blocked in Canada...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirror&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://unblockvideos.com/#url=cMXZUjQfCmk\"&gt;https://unblockvideos.com/#url=cMXZUjQfCmk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fullmoviesonyoutube", "name": "t1_dg5r1mh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492026085.0, "created_utc": 1491997285.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfcn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfcn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfcn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfcn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93knv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ILikeMultis", "parent_id": "t1_dg6i4t7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fullmoviesonyoutube", "controversiality": 0, "body": "youpak ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;youpak &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fullmoviesonyoutube", "name": "t1_dg93knv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203807.0, "created_utc": 1492175007.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6i4t7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KorvisKhan", "parent_id": "t1_dg6g3pb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fullmoviesonyoutube", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like what?
