According to a &amp;quot;making-of&amp;quot; documentary included in a special edition DVD of A Bridge Too Far, at the time of its release, &amp;quot;the film was shunned by American critics and completely ignored at Oscar time for daring to expose the fatal inadequacies of the Allied campaign.&amp;quot; Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 73% of 11 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.8 out of 10. While critics agreed that the film was impressively staged and historically accurate, many found the film too long and too repetitive. James Caan and Anthony Hopkins were cited by many critics for the excellence of their performances in a film filled with hundreds of speaking roles and cameos by many of the period&amp;#39;s top actors.\n(&lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More info at &lt;a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/Title?A+Bridge+Too+Far+%281977%29\"&gt;IMDb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A%20Bridge%20Too%20Far%20%28film%29\"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bridge_too_far/\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/332286\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q467053\"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I am a bot.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F65b9t5\" title=\"Confidence: 1.04\"&gt;Send me feedback&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"/r/MovieGuide/w/about\"&gt;Data sources and other information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fullmoviesonyoutube", "name": "t1_dg8wng7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492184914.0, "created_utc": 1492156114.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b9t5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga3dh7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dontsnap", "parent_id": "t3_65b9t5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fullmoviesonyoutube", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To block this movie in America is **Un-American**.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To block this movie in America is &lt;strong&gt;Un-American&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fullmoviesonyoutube", "name": "t1_dga3dh7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249034.0, "created_utc": 1492220234.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vlad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65b9t5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8wlmy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "parent_id": "t3_65b9t5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fullmoviesonyoutube", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This comment is a reminder to format your title with a **(Year)** and a **[Resolution tag]**, acceptable tags are located on the sidebar.
