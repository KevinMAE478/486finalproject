The series started in 1994 with the release of TES: Arena, and is now one of the most well known RPG series to date, though the most popular game is likely TES V: Skyrim, which I&amp;#39;m sure most of you have heard of, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The TES games are known for being some of the largest, most open world games out there, filled with dungeons, secrets, lore, combat, &lt;del&gt;stealth archers&lt;/del&gt; and more. The newest addition to the series, TES VI: Online, is a very different game to the rest of the games, being an MMORPG, and allowing you to explore the entirety of the continent of Tamriel, and being the only game out of the main series to have multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The subreddit is full of discussions about all things TES related, whether it be &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/4xp5l3/what_is_on_your_elder_scrolls_6_wishlist/?ref=search_posts\"&gt;discussing the new installments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/5v1ioc/theory_the_great_war_is_just_the_prelude_to_a/\"&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/5w7178/glitch_no_potato_faces_but_even_more_ghastly/\"&gt;glitches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/pd7NR7o\"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/5lwlxc/you_sleep_rather_soundly_for_a_murderer/\"&gt;So&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/5v0eqs/newly_revealed_info_on_upcoming_bethesda_tes/\"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/X6qQXUX\"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the sub is very helpful and welcoming to new fans (&lt;em&gt;but only if you believe that TES 3 is best TES, no other opinions allowed&lt;/em&gt;). All joking aside though, if you don&amp;#39;t play TES and you enjoy RPGs, you should check out this subreddit, maybe you&amp;#39;ll find your new favourite game series.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We reached out to the moderators for a quick interview on the subreddit, and their opinions on the TES series as a whole. Here&amp;#39;s the interview:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;1. So, give us a brief history of this subreddit. Why did you make it? How did it progress?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Hidden_Heathen\"&gt;u/Hidden_Heathen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I wasn&amp;#39;t there from the beginning, so I can&amp;#39;t really comment on what the subreddit was like in the old days. Me and &lt;a href=\"/u/Avian81\"&gt;/u/Avian81&lt;/a&gt; were invited here about a year ago to help with designing the stylesheet and it has progressed significantly since then, when it had around 15,000 subscribers. Now it&amp;#39;s close to 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Avian81\"&gt;u/Avian81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; When I first joined reddit 3 years ago, &lt;a href=\"/r/ElderScrolls\"&gt;/r/ElderScrolls&lt;/a&gt; was one of the smaller TES subreddits, with less subscribers than &lt;a href=\"/r/Morrowind\"&gt;/r/Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/Oblivion\"&gt;/r/Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. There was barely any activity, it used the default reddit css, and everyone who was interested in TES games just used the subreddit for their respective games. Now it has a sizable community and has grown into a place where people talk about the games, lore, and future of the franchise on an almost daily basis. For the past year it&amp;#39;s had a steady increase in subscribers and activity, which is always good to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. What is it about The Elder Scrolls that you enjoy?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Hidden_Heathen\"&gt;u/Hidden_Heathen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s the lore and the world that makes it special in my opinion. On the outside it looks just like a regular fantasy setting with elves and dragons, but if you go down the rabbit hole you&amp;#39;ll notice how interesting and detailed it is. After all, there&amp;#39;s a reason why there&amp;#39;s an entire subreddit dedicated to dicussing the lore of the series, &lt;a href=\"/r/TESLore\"&gt;r/TESLore&lt;/a&gt;. Detailed world is another thing I love, with all the cleverly hidden treasures and hand crafted locations that make you take a break from adventuring and admire the view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Avian81\"&gt;u/Avian81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The first thing that got me hooked into the series was the sheer amount of autonomy you are given. Not a lot of video games give you the same amount of role-playability as the Elder Scrolls. You&amp;#39;re given freedom to do anything you want the moment you leave the Cave/Sewers/Dungeon/Census Office. The world is open, the main questline is optional, the mountains are climbable, every character was interactable and most of all the setting was alive. You could be the hero destined to save the world, or the town drunk picking fist fights with the town guard all in one game. Plus TES Games are probably the easiest games to mod there are, with thousands of mods and thriving modding communities, they just add more and more to the already limitless possibilities that you are offered. With mods you can fine tune the game to anything your heart desires. I would say that these two things make TES a sandbox game like no other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. What TES game is your favourite and why?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Hidden_Heathen\"&gt;u/Hidden_Heathen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Morrowind, for the reasons I stated above. Morrowind has by far the most interesting world in the series. I love the culture of the Dunmer, every faction has their own traditions, clothes, armour and architecture. It has amazing lore and it probably defined the lore of the series the most. I also love how the game rewards exploration, you could look under a pillow and find an enchanted dagger or levitate to a ledge in some cave and find rare armour. It also has a great variety of spells, weapon types and skills you can experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/avian81\"&gt;u/avian81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Oblivion, definitely. It was my first game and I think it has the most interesting quests, and most beautiful cities in the series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. What are your plans for the sub in the future?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/HiddenHeathen\"&gt;u/HiddenHeathen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We don&amp;#39;t really have any new plans on running the subreddit, it will continue to grow and serve as a place for general discussion about TES. Maybe in the future we might add or change some things, but there shouldn&amp;#39;t be any major changes to how the subreddit operates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Avian81\"&gt;u/Avian81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In the art department I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to add some flairs for some time now, maybe make more snoos for the sidebar. There were also a bunch of unfinished features in the CSS we didn&amp;#39;t implement in the final vesion. Who knows? we might implement them in the future.\nAs of right now, we don&amp;#39;t have plans to change the subreddit significantly - I would say that it runs fine as it is right now. Unless a new game gets announced this E3 we will probably stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Written&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/conalfisher\"&gt;u/conalfisher&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;editor.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "# /r/ElderScrolls\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**38,580** followers for **6 years!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n/r/ElderScrolls is a subreddit centered around the popular RPG series, The Elder Scrolls (or TES for short), made by Bethesda.
