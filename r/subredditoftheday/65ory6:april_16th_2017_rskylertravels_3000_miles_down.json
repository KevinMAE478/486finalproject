I started August 14th a little outside of Toronto, Canada which is where I usually reside. I&amp;#39;ve travelled over 2,900 miles so far, mostly by foot. The plan is to travel 5,000 miles total over the course of 11 months and end in San Francisco, California.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason to do this trip is to have fun and meet as many interesting people and do as many cool things as possible. I&amp;#39;m not a &amp;quot;purist&amp;quot; and walking every step of the way, but I am walking 4/5 of it. I&amp;#39;ve gotten to experience so much on this trip, from Mammoth Cave in Kentucky to the Very Large Array in New Mexico. I&amp;#39;ve gone through 10 states so far and have had the opportunity to see so much of the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Interview&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;What inspired you to walk 5,000 miles?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just graduated highschool back in June and I decided I wanted to take a year off and do something I would really remember. The idea for walking across America originally started as a joke. I use to play a lot of videogames throughout high school and I mainly played with Americans. One day we were just joking around and I said that I&amp;#39;d come and visit everyone. Over the course of a year that idea sort of stuck in my brain and it went from a joke to me thinking &amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot; To &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s actually do it!&amp;quot; I also don&amp;#39;t drive (I don&amp;#39;t even have a license), hence the walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Are you doing this solo or with a running club?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just me doing this. All of my friends are of at college and university. We all have are own paths through life and I decided that mine would just have me walk to San Francisco from Canada, before coming back and doing &amp;quot;what you&amp;#39;re supposed to do&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How many miles do you do a day on average?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a little complicated to answer. So for the first 2,000 miles I was walking with a backpack and everything fit inside there. It was around 50 pounds. A bit north of Waco, TX I hurt my hip and just couldn&amp;#39;t support the weight of my backpack. Those first 2k miles I was walking around 15 miles a day. My maximum was about 20 miles. In Fort Worth I picked up a jogging stroller. I&amp;#39;ve heard of other people who do these walks using them. It has the added benefit of allowing me to carry a lot more water while going through the Southwest. With the jogging stroller, 20 miles is my base amount, my average tends to be between 20-25, and my maximum is 28 miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Are you doing this for charity?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not doing this for charity. I&amp;#39;m doing it for myself mostly. I&amp;#39;m doing it for all the incredible things I get to see, people to meet, and experiences to have. I decided not to do it for charity because I never intended to walk every step of the 5,000 miles, just about 4/5 of it. This trip is about new experiences so I wanted to try out hitchhiking a little bit. I knew if I did it for a cause I&amp;#39;d be expected/pressured to walk every single step. So I decided to just do it my own way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Anything Else to say?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On this trip I&amp;#39;ve gotten to meet and talk to so many people of all backgrounds. I have talked to a lot of older people who have regretted not doing a big trip. They went through life and did what was expected of them but didn&amp;#39;t get to do any major trips and have the sort of experiences I have. So this mainly is for those graduating highschool/college or just have a lot of free time on their hands. Go do a &amp;quot;see the world&amp;quot; trip. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be walking across a country but it should be something cool or fun, and it should last longer than a month. To all of those thinking that you&amp;#39;re too old or have too many responsibilities to do a big trip, I met a guy who was a teacher and right after he retired, he rode his bike across America. I also stayed with a retired dentist with MS, he needed a cane to walk, who still went out and did trips, last I heard he only had a few states left to go before he hit all 50. So as cliche as it is, you&amp;#39;re never to old.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by &lt;a href=\"/u/CanuckBacon\"&gt;/u/CanuckBacon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Interview by &lt;a href=\"/u/HoldMyAwp\"&gt;/u/HoldMyAwp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "#/r/SkylerTravels\n\n**381**\u00a0Followers for\u00a0**7 months**\n\nThis subreddit is about Skyler an American Canadian walking 5,000 miles.\n\nI'm Skyler, I'm a American and Canadian citizen, and I'm walking across the US.
