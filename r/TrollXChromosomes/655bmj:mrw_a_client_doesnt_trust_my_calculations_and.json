I didn&amp;#39;t even know about it the first time!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really wish my boss would&amp;#39;ve sent me to meet with him, but knowing this industry, being in the southeastern US, and knowing of this man I&amp;#39;m sure he would have thrown a fit. I know my boss backed me up, but I hate feeling like there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do or say to prove that I am right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also the second frustrating story this week.
