And that&amp;#39;s without taking race into account on top (WoC are paid worse than white women on average, because of course they are -_-).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while 30% may not always be the right figure to quote regarding women&amp;#39;s pay due to the concerns you&amp;#39;re raising, women are still noticably paid worse than male counterparts even when you look within individual fields or job titles, etc.  And that doesn&amp;#39;t even get into the fact that, all too often, women must excel where men often just need to have a pulse and show up on time to end up in the same positions within a male-dominated field (STEM in general, programming, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PLUS, we have to also take a look at why the industries and jobs women tend to take are also lower paid.  You mention psychology, for example, but why is that lower paid?  It&amp;#39;s certainly not because it&amp;#39;s just so easy to earn a PhD as a psychologist!  Teaching as a profession is also often female dominated (especially in grade/middle school levels) and is low paying.  But it&amp;#39;s a job that is critically important to raising and shaping future generations and involves &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of off-the-clock work.
