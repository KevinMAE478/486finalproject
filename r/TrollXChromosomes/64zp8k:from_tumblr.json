If you called him out on it he would get super offended and say we were bullying him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly the one guy in our group that tried to stay his friend ended up telling us that he couldn&amp;#39;t do it after he said women who were raped probably deserved it . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst part was he blamed it on being Brazilian. I know there are massive cultural differences but I have family members who are Brazilian and a ton of my students are Brazilian, as well as having other Brazilian friends and literally none of them act like him. It&amp;#39;s an excuse and it pisses me off because he&amp;#39;s giving an entire group a bad name.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrollXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg7d0fg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492105807.0, "created_utc": 1492077007.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6s0cp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "quinoa_rex", "parent_id": "t3_64zp8k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrollXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"I want the freedom to hurt other people and never have to think about the consequences.\"\n\nFuck that noise.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want the freedom to hurt other people and never have to think about the consequences.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck that noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrollXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg6s0cp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492069421.0, "created_utc": 1492040621.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sekm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zp8k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg70ct5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "advocatadiaboli", "parent_id": "t3_64zp8k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrollXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No no no, you don't understand, it's only THEIR speech that's free.
