I see my dad maybe twice a year, if that. I always initiate meetings. He doesn't ever try to contact me. He said some fucked up shit to my sister a few months ago but she said she's over it. \n\nHe's soooo lucky he's invited to my wedding as a guest. That my sister allowed that to happen, because honestly it  was up to her. \n\nI think of him as an old friend that I don't really talk to anymore because we've drifted apart, but that I might barely regret not inviting. \n\nFemales standing up to family that is supposed to support them... kicking ass despite the cards they were dealt... that's the real shit.

My own dad was pretty okay growing up, had a LOT of issues that really came to the surface when he and my mom split when I was 18.  He&amp;#39;s a loser. He&amp;#39;s always been a loser. I was just too little to understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He moved off and started a nice little life with his new wife and her two daughters - all very similar to my mom and my sister and I. Hmmmm. But to them he&amp;#39;s Super Dad because their old &amp;quot;dad&amp;quot; was a total piece of shit. Newsflash, folks, he seems great now but wait until he starts abusing pain medication again and has explosive anger issues and starts hitting people. From what I can tell, he&amp;#39;s juuuuust starting that process again now that he&amp;#39;s on &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; for his &amp;quot;shoulder problems&amp;quot;. Ugh. He has also lied about my sister and I hating him to his extended family - which we never get to see, because he never invites us.
