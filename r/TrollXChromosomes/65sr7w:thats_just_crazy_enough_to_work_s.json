Where this guy literally &amp;#39;friendzoned&amp;#39; himself by being a friend to a woman and expecting more. Those kinds of guys are shitty excuses for human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see guys like my boy J(I&amp;#39;ll just call him that to not reveal too much). Who actively pursued this woman who&amp;#39;d give him an inch and hope, to then follow it up with I just see us as friends or something. Then every time he started to move on, she&amp;#39;d want to go on a date, hang out or something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because he&amp;#39;s ran into quite a few women like that(he&amp;#39;s very easy to take advantage of, I tell him that&amp;#39;s pretty much his only weak point as a person), he&amp;#39;s not too keen on making too many friends with women as it&amp;#39;s hard for him to trust them. Is that fair to women? No. But do I get his reasoning? Yes. For the record, he also doesn&amp;#39;t trust guys either. But he has like 20 guy friends and 4 lady friends. Which would look pretty bad under your statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re being too general. I think the better one would be, don&amp;#39;t trust a man who thinks women and men can&amp;#39;t be friends. They are usually sexist. J thinks men and women can be friends, but he&amp;#39;s just scared of being used again. Makes a lot of money and is a really giving person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post. I&amp;#39;m on Adderall right now and it always makes me type long posts it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrollXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgdodnc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492473977.0, "created_utc": 1492445177.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgda8h9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 40, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vulvasaur001", "parent_id": "t1_dgd8qd6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrollXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Introvert here as well.
