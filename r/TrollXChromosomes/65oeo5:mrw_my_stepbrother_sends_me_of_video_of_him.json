If sexual behavior is not wanted, it is harassment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go back to my punching example. If two guys are kind of rough housing, and one lands a real punch, the other guy could either say &amp;quot;woah hey no dude stop&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;yeah bring it let&amp;#39;s box.&amp;quot; One indicates consent, one doesn&amp;#39;t. If the guy who landed the punch beats the other guy up anyway despite lack of consent, it is assault regardless of whether they had been rough housing previously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In OP&amp;#39;s case, her step brother should have expected that his messages would be unwanted because of the nature of their relationship. She clearly indicated after the first one that they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; unwanted.
