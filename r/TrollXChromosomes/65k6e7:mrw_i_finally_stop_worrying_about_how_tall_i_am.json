Great story and absolutely beautiful art by Alex Ross.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah I really liked how they introduced WW in that movie, one of my favorite portrayals I think. Immensely powerful, confident to a fault, oblivious to non-warrior human customs, and still unfailingly kind to the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a scene in either one of the movies, or maybe Justice League or Unlimited, where she liberates a group of women taken captive by some men somewhere in Southeast Asia. It is inferred that they were forced to perform sex acts for their evil male captors. She subdues the men, takes their guns and throws them in a pile, then frees the women so that they can exact their vengeance on the men. Superman scolds her for allowing them to kill their captors, but WW responds that this is justice. I love when Superman and WW butt heads about the meaning of justice, and I thought that was a perfect example of WW&amp;#39;s philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t already, I recommend reading Kingdom Come (a comic/graphic novel).
