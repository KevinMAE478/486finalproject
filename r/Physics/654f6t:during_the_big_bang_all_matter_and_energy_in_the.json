They have no energy *density* (because they are technically propagating forever). It may not be true for other forms. For example, I remember reading an article about how it may be possible to create a black hole by pumping light radially (from all directions) towards a central point from outside. Clearly, there is energy density associated with this.\n\n&gt;What's difficult about learning this, is you get different answers from different people, and it is sometimes hard to know who to trust. There are also seemingly conflicting scenarios.\n\nYeah, it is kinda tough to handle multiple answers. I suppose the best way to go about is to try reading a textbook and asking questions specific to it's interpretation of the topic at hand. That way, you'll confine the discussion (hopefully) to a specific approach to the issue.\n\n&gt;accelerating an object must increase its effect on spacetime.

Just energy. Why? Well, that's what all matter eventually does when you compress it enough, it super heats and breaks down until it is literally just energy.
