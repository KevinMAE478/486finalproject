One way to think about it is this: as light passes through water, more and more of it is absorbed.  But this process would be indescribable if you tried to use the same time and space coordinates to describe the spacetime events in the reference frame of the photon, which really isn't quite intuitive.  If you looked at it from a photon, you couldn't distinguish one atom of water (at say the bottom of a deep ocean trench), from another one (say just at the surface.) Each atom would be symmetric from this no spacetime photon perspective and therefore should have equal probability of absorbing it.  But in reality this \"symmetry\" is broken.  So our \"photon persepctive\" is obviously sort of an unphysical solution.  In fact, this actually happens all the time in general relativity... its really easy for coordinate singularities to exist when there is no actual underlying geometric singularity.
