It's very easy to to lose yourself in what you're doing, and it makes you vulnerable to exploitation. I know it can be hard to hear, but while the natural sciences are better than some areas, there are still people who are willing to use everything you have to give without giving anything back to you.\n\nThere's an excellent book on the subject, [Disciplined Minds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008GRDKPG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1), by Jeff Schmidt.\n\nAs for my own experience, I entered graduate school in physics at 23, because there was nothing more interesting or worthwhile for me to do with my life beyond finding the outer bounds of human knowledge, and spending the rest of my life extending it as best as I could.\n\nOver the course of grad school, I got married to another academic and had two kids. My wife was in a less \"employable\" field outside of academia (Sociology), and I wasn't interested in solving [the two body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_\\(career\\)).\n\nI also found physics research to be much less satisfying than I expected. When you're an undergraduate or grad student, you're drinking from the \"fire hydrant\" of knowledge: there's all you can swallow and then so much more. Academic research is more like digging a well in the mud with a teaspoon. You're thirsty all the time, and every now and then you get a few sips of muddy water. After that Master's, here's what I added to my knowledge base: I became an expert in torsion pendulums, learned a bit about machining metal, got some (inadequate) programming skills, and learned about handling cryogenic fluids and working with ultra-high vacuum equipment. Interesting stuff, as such things go, but a far cry from learning about the fundamentals of the universe, even though I was involved in some pretty basic research (measuring gravity: G, the Inverse-Square Law, and the Equivalence Principle). \n\nThe bottom line is, I left academia with a Ph.D., but to be honest, by the time I finished, the only reason why I finished is because I started. I had other priorities. I'm glad there are people doing basic research, but I wasn't about to spend years making a post-doc salary and then trying to figure out the tenure track grind while trying to coordinate with my wife's career and raise our children. \n\nThese days, I work in the tech industry, at a database company. My physics Ph.D. is basically just a marketing stamp on my resume, and it's nice that it gets me job interviews, but it's strange that I spent my twenties working on it and now it's not contributing in any meaningful way to what I do, and that its value lies primarily in being able to impress others. Truthfully, though, I'm happy. The challenges of my job are just as interesting as the puzzles I solved on a regular basis in graduate school. I love my colleagues, I get to spend time with my family, and I make a comfortable living for myself and my family, doing something that I love. I was able to move to support my wife's (successful) career as a professor, and I don't miss what might have been. I got enough of a taste of it, and I'm happier doing what I'm doing than I would have been. I deal with puzzles daily, and figuring out how to efficiently store and retrieve data from a machine is every bit as satisfying as learning how to model perturbations to the simple harmonic motion of a cryogenic torsion pendulum.\n\nThe bottom line is, should you go to grad school, the \"you\" that enters won't be the same as the \"you\" that graduates. You'll be shaped by your experiences along the way, and your priorities will shift. If you don't mind me being a little blunt, you'll also be less naive. And those will be changes that you will value, and you may not be as interested in what you're interested in, now.\n\nThe bottom line is, the finances shouldn't be too much of an issue; you'll be fine, regardless. The personal identity is the real thing you want to work hard to preserve, in the field or out. \n\nSincerely,\n\n-Thatnerdd", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Sentientearthdweller,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you want to take the exact opposite approach.

So what you should go for is finding the right mix of studying and off-time, so that you can be happy and also get ahead in physics.&lt;br/&gt;\nThat being said, and keeping with the theme of the importance of happiness, my opinion is that taking care of your mental health is by far the most important thing. More than understanding existence, reaching your potential, undiluted knowledge, or any other motivations you might have.
