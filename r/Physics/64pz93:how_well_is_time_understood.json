How can you study the natural world without *any* empirical component -- without observing it and testing its behaviour?\n\nEven on the pure theory side ... someone who scribbles away and comes up with a mathematical framework is a mathematician.  Someone who does the same *and then makes testable predictions* about reality with it, is a theoretical physicist.  It's the part that relates to empirical reality that makes it science.  Without that empirical part, it's just math, or philosophy, or some other discipline.\n\n&gt;Some of Einstein's greatest work was done in thought experiments with no real corollary to empirical measurements or processes.\n\nNo, I'm sorry but that's just ... dead wrong.  Basically *all* of Einstein's work was based heavily on empirical concerns.\n\nHis work on special relativity revolved around the empirical observation that the speed of light was measured to be constant by the Michelson-Morley experiment (which was unexpected at the time), and Maxwell's equations which were empirically established.  His work on general relativity was motivated in part by [Mach's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%27s_principle) -- the observation that local inertial frames are influenced by the global distribution of matter -- and the *very* real observation that a body falling due to gravity feels weightless (which isn't just apparent in a space elevator thought experiment, you can feel it if you jump off of a short ledge, it's easy to demonstrate in reality).  Einstein's thought experiments here weren't pure thought experiments, they are just idealized to capture the essential features of known empirical considerations.  If you read Einstein's book *Relativity: the Special and the General Theory*, he summarizes how his thinking *starts* with the pure, visceral empirical concerns (\"time is what we measure with a clock; length measurements are made in relation to a rigid body serving as a ruler,\" etc.) and then straightforwardly takes the implications of observations about these kinds of measurements to their logical extremes.\n\nLikewise with Einstein's other works, for example on the photoelectric effect, which was observed qualitatively before it motivated Einstein to consider that light itself might be quantized, and not only matter or the interaction between the two.  And observational reality was at the heart of the EPR debate, where Einstein's material conceptualization of the classical world kept him at odds with quantum mechanics -- refusing to accept that QM could be a complete description of the world because of how different the properties of its description were compared to our everyday experience with how the world works.  He was famously uncomfortable with what he pejoratively called \"spooky action at a distance\" because it didn't seem to jive with everything we previously knew about observational reality (that it was deterministic, locally real and counterfactually definite).\n\nEinstein wasn't just some idealized genius who locked himself in a room with a chalkboard and magically produced the right answers.  He had that genius quality too, but he started from the most simple, barebones empirical observations and worked his way up methodically from there.  He didn't just stab at metaphysics in the dark and guess correctly every time.

How can you study the natural world without &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; empirical component -- without observing it and testing its behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even on the pure theory side ... someone who scribbles away and comes up with a mathematical framework is a mathematician.  Someone who does the same &lt;em&gt;and then makes testable predictions&lt;/em&gt; about reality with it, is a theoretical physicist.  It&amp;#39;s the part that relates to empirical reality that makes it science.  Without that empirical part, it&amp;#39;s just math, or philosophy, or some other discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of Einstein&amp;#39;s greatest work was done in thought experiments with no real corollary to empirical measurements or processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;#39;m sorry but that&amp;#39;s just ... dead wrong.  Basically &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Einstein&amp;#39;s work was based heavily on empirical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His work on special relativity revolved around the empirical observation that the speed of light was measured to be constant by the Michelson-Morley experiment (which was unexpected at the time), and Maxwell&amp;#39;s equations which were empirically established.  His work on general relativity was motivated in part by &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%27s_principle\"&gt;Mach&amp;#39;s principle&lt;/a&gt; -- the observation that local inertial frames are influenced by the global distribution of matter -- and the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; real observation that a body falling due to gravity feels weightless (which isn&amp;#39;t just apparent in a space elevator thought experiment, you can feel it if you jump off of a short ledge, it&amp;#39;s easy to demonstrate in reality).  Einstein&amp;#39;s thought experiments here weren&amp;#39;t pure thought experiments, they are just idealized to capture the essential features of known empirical considerations.
