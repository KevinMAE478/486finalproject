By far my favorite series of visual clues from the entire soulsborne franchise relates the the water in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, and I haven&amp;#39;t seen a write up of it before. I&amp;#39;m going to go through how the game tells the player that the city of Irithyll released its water supply to flood the Profaned Capital, likely in an effort to douse the still burning Profaned Flame. I&amp;#39;m also going to include some Imgur links due to the visual aspect of visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting off in the Water Reserve bonfire, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that a lot of water is missing. After all, this is hardly enough water to supply a city the size of Irithyll. Additionally, the fact that Archdeacon McDonnell is sitting in the pool at the bottom of the room means that the religious movement likely had something to do with releasing the water. Perhaps they realized what Sulyvahn was planning, and that Aldrich was being used, and wanted to stop is ambition by quenching the very flame that started his desire? Or maybe it was Sulyvahn&amp;#39;s idea. I don&amp;#39;t know. \n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/9ZNKfom\"&gt;http://imgur.com/9ZNKfom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, since we know a ton of water is missing, where did it go? Well, the other place we see water in Irithyll is during the second encounter with the Sulyvahn&amp;#39;s Beast, under the bridge. \n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/SUxaVb4\"&gt;http://imgur.com/SUxaVb4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bridge seems to indicate that the river is natural, but on closer inspection, it&amp;#39;s clear that a lot of water was forced through this area. The water is murky and grimy with displaced soil, and mud has been dredged up to the sides of the walls of the city. The most concrete proof comes from the trees, which may have originally grown on the bank of a natural creek, or simply in a valley that the city hadn&amp;#39;t expanded to, are now half buried in mud and water.\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/myWFYCq\"&gt;http://imgur.com/myWFYCq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool. So we know a LOT of water quickly rushed through this area. Then where did it go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer is off this cliff, which appears to be some sort of supporting wall for the city. \n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/oF7hQ4a\"&gt;http://imgur.com/oF7hQ4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It almost looks like a dam, which lends credit to the idea that there was at some point natural water in this area, but the fact that the top of the wall is at ground level shows that mud has been washed along the basin by a large current of water. If you&amp;#39;re familiar with the physical layout of Dark Souls 3, you&amp;#39;ll know that the Profaned Capital is at the bottom of this cliff.\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/sVUlwjX\"&gt;http://imgur.com/sVUlwjX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do we know the water ended up in the Profaned Capital? Well, simply because there is water there. Unnatural water, in fact. If we look at the swampy area connected to Irithyll dungeon, we can see the steps of this building actually continue under the water, proving that the swamp wasn&amp;#39;t here when the building was built.\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/tVxamNR\"&gt;http://imgur.com/tVxamNR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also find water in Yorm&amp;#39;s throne room, which has the same muddy film on the top as the water in the basin in Irithyll and the swamp in the profaned capital, indicating it likely came from the rush of water and mud.\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/YKeRLeT\"&gt;http://imgur.com/YKeRLeT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we find the same centipede-spider-long-hared things that we first saw in Irithyll, and appear to originate from the sewers under the city. These things might just live in gross water, and may have started living in Irithyll and the Profaned Capital independently, but since the game shows us them in the sewers of Irithyll first and the Profaned Capital later, they are likely a hint that things that originated in Irithyll have wound up in the Profaned Capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, there is physical evidence that the city of Irithyll released a large amount of water to flood the profaned capital, and the placement of McDonnell, the most faithful servant of Aldrich hints that the religious following of Aldrich had something to do with it.
