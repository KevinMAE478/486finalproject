People have complained that Dark Souls 3 is too much like Dark Souls 1, but considering it's a sequel that complaint is silly, it improves on so many things to be different enough. \n\nMy biggest complaint with DS2 is just how floaty the game felt, the animations, rolling being very slow, iframes tied to a stat, etc. from the quick and solid feel of Dark Souls 1 (albeit clunky) going to Dark Souls 2 felt like a major step down in regards to its feel. This was made immediately apparent after jumping onto Bloodborne which only improved on Dark Souls 1, and then Dark Souls 3 which mixed in elements of both DS1 and BB. \n\nDid it improve the PvP? Sure, DS2 PvP is probably the best in the series, though I am going off what others say. The changes to PvE might have been intentional, but for it to make the PvE significantly worse as a result is an issue for me when it Dark Souls is primarily a PvE game.
