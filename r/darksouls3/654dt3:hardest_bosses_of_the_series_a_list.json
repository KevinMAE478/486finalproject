This list will mostly be based on mechanical difficulty and I&amp;#39;ll try my best to not try and free the list from the bias that comes with nostalgia. I&amp;#39;m gonna avoid chalice dungeon bosses for now, as well as the Mirror Knight and SotC since they involve real players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS- this list will feature mostly bosses from the last 3 games. Most of us remember dying to Artorias&amp;#39; slow start up attacks, but can now easily roll through a much faster pontiff phantom, apply a &lt;del&gt;fire paper&lt;/del&gt; pine bundle and parry the mimicked attack by the real pontiff. There is no denying the player base has become much more skillful, and thus the newer bosses despite being harder may seem to be easier to some of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note- These difficulties will vary from play style to play style. My preferred build is almost always heavy weapon high hp strength builds, so the list may reflect that. Feel free to disagree with boss placements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) &lt;strong&gt;Twin Princes and Ludwig&lt;/strong&gt;: I couldn&amp;#39;t decide which of these 2 deserved more to be on the list, and decided to open the list with a tied duo (trio?).\nLudwig is probably my favourite fight in the Soulsborne series after Maria, and is an absolute blast despite being very challenging. The fight is perfect, I don&amp;#39;t have much more to elaborate on it.\nThe twin princes hit hard, the teleport is frightening, Lorian has great tracking and speed, and the second phase feels insane with all the spells going off while you dance around the Elder Prince&amp;#39;s flaming blade. The fight requires good concentration and a sound feel for the rhythm of the game to do well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) &lt;strong&gt;Fume Knight&lt;/strong&gt;: Looks like Raime did find the power he went to seek after all. Statistically, this is the hardest Soulsborne boss with a 93% failure rate the last time the stats were published, though i feel like a fair bit of his difficulty came from being very slightly overturned and having a few hitbox issues.  Nevertheless, he has massive HP, can 2-3 shot even tank builds, is very fast in the slightly sluggish Ds2 environment and is aggressive. If you didn&amp;#39;t have patience and a lot of points in ADP, this fight got very rough very fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) &lt;strong&gt;Manus&lt;/strong&gt;: The father of the abyss and the vanquisher of Artorias lived up to his name. Few enemies that came before him had his aggression, and his damage, combos and sheer intimidation factor all combined to make a nerve wracking fight. The fight could be cheesed with arrows and the pendant helped, but up straight Manus was terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;strong&gt;Nameless King&lt;/strong&gt;: The biggest terror of the base game, the Nameless King and his drake are practically legend now. The first phase may feel a little harder than it is due to the clouds throwing off depth perception, but the King still hits EXTREMELY hard and is very very aggressive. This feels like a duel worthy of a god of war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Orphan of Kos&lt;/strong&gt;: or as some say, orphan of kosm (couldn&amp;#39;t help myself, sorry). The most aggressive boss in the series (maybe barring the last 3rd of gael), this guy is incredibly quick and very very hard hitting. The screeching, the giant, rapid leaps and powerful slam effects are terrifying and it&amp;#39;s very easy to panic and get destroyed by him. The reason I placed him lower on this list than most would expect is Orphan offers tonnes of opportunities to visceral him. Bloodborne&amp;#39;s biggest gift is the ability to ranged parry, and orphan has multiple attacks that you can safely parry without even being close enough to get hit if you fail. That, and every single one of his frontal leaps is a free backstab.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Lud and Zallen&lt;/strong&gt;:\nYou didn&amp;#39;t put all your points into ADP and endurance? Hahaha f**k you \n-Fromsoft, probably. \nOther than being obnoxiously hard to reach, this fight was basically 2 of an already difficult boss put together to mess with you. Seriously, this fight changes a man. I have only beaten thos boss twice, and I have no idea how i managed to do so both times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Sister Friede and Father Ariandel&lt;/strong&gt;: As others have said before me, this is a Bloodborne fight in a dark souls game. Her recovery speed is too high, and she can do upwards of 5k dmg in one combo, basically meaning you&amp;#39;re pretty dead if you mess up a roll and the inevitable panic roll that follows. She&amp;#39;s aggressive, and although she&amp;#39;s easy to stagger, she recovers fast and can instantly combo you from there. Visually in my top 5 favourite boss fights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/strong&gt;: The final piece of Souls we will ever experience. This fight did not disappoint. You and another unsung hero of time fighting for the Soul that started the story we all fell in love with years ago, at the end of the space and time. The fight&amp;#39;s poetic beauty deserves a post of it&amp;#39;s own, and so we talk about how incredibly aggressive Gael gets towards the end, the strength of his blows, the way the lightning and the spells and the bolts and his cape try to overwhelm you. This was a duel worthy of ending the Souls series. Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Darkeater Midir&lt;/strong&gt;: The greatest champion against the abyss, a descendant of the Grey Dragons. Midir has insane resistances which give him incredible effective HP, and a lot of his attacks are very, very difficult to avoid. The concentration required along with the long length of this fight, and how harshly your mistakes are punished make this the most gruelling fight in the Souls games for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Pinwheel&lt;/strong&gt;: The pinwheel we kill is not the real Pinwheel. The real pinwheel strips away two of his three masks, puts on heavier armour, and invades your Undead Parish to show you what pain means. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So with the swan song of the Souls franchise having been played, I was finally inspired to try and make my own \"most difficult bosses\" list for the games.
