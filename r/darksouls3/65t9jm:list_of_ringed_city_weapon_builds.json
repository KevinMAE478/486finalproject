I literally go maybe 1 death every 30 or so fights and that&amp;#39;s only to people who rush me while I bow or circle with a great shield of there own waiting for a backstab. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It counters the duel great swords, gaels greatsword, letos hammer and both ringed weapons so easily, almost no weapon can break it&amp;#39;s guard at full stamina and the l2 l1 combo tracks and chases so well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a pure strength build with a heavy infusion I can kill anyone in about 3 hits and I can usually still wear heavy armor, although I stopped because it was way to easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s less great for spear summoning or invading  ease people just chug estus and stay as far away as possible. But for blades and sentinels it&amp;#39;s amazing. Just casually walking in front of the host with your shield is so satisfying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does take some skill to know how and when to use it properly but I think that&amp;#39;s what makes it fair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no I don&amp;#39;t just l2 into a l1 over and over that&amp;#39;s just shit playing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dgdpcw5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475082.0, "created_utc": 1492446282.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdaj8u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 226, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zecron8", "parent_id": "t3_65t9jm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No dual shields build, 0/10", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No dual shields build, 0/10&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dgdaj8u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492447950.0, "created_utc": 1492419150.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 226}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t9jm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t9jm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t9jm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t9jm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t9jm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t9jm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1ifr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cortexxeverman", "parent_id": "t1_dgdwjp4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lothric knight spear gives 15 poise, iirc.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lothric knight spear gives 15 poise, iirc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dge1ifr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492488684.0, "created_utc": 1492459884.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdwjp4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Meizuken", "parent_id": "t1_dgdu92i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Here's the new Poise Health modifiers I found from some thread months ago:http://imgur.com/e6zD5tZ\n\nYou guys better download that spreadsheet and update those values.
