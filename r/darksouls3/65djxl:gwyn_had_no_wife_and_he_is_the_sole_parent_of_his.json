Gwyndolin was likely raised there by his Mother. Priscilla/Yorshka and maybe even the Painter being his sisters.\n\nVery likely.  Possibly Velka was responsible for locking them up there.\n\nYour theory sounds nice, but I feel it places too much emphasis on Velka when Velka herself is only very tenuously connected to moon worship, and it involves creating a whole new character to make it work. It also involves too many leaps for me.  I can't find any reason to assume the two in the mural are sisters, or that they actually represent anything in particular.  Also bear in mind that while the Painted World of *Ariamis* may have been associated with moon worship, the Painted World of *Ariandel* likely wasn't.  Being technically the same world there are still connections, possibly in the form of the Painter Girl and Sulyvahn's knowledge of the moon, but there's no reason to believe the Painted World of Ariandel is still used as a place for moon worship.  Additionally there's no lunar imagery at all on that mural- if it were supposed to signify a moon deity you'd think they'd have a moon on there somewhere.  I'd say the image of the two figures killing a serpent simply signifies breaking the cycle, or letting the Flame fade.\n\nSeath works fine as the Nameless Moon.  In DkS2 he and the other Lords were called \"ineffable\" meaning \"cannot be named\", so there's a good reason for him to be referred to as Nameless.  He's also a character that's actually established, so we don't have to invent a whole new character and fabricate relations with other characters just to fill that title.  He didn't create the moon- it is a far older force.  But there's no reason to believe any being created the moon or that any being has a greater association with the moon.\n\nThe mothers of Gwyn's children are never mentioned.  Why?  Because they aren't relevant to the story.  I honestly doubt Miyazaki even knows who they are.  But, of course, the community is the co-author so we also get to decide who Gwyn's lover was.  But that's not a reason to just make up new characters or link characters to each other based on very tenuous evidence.\n\nI like the idea that Gwyn's children were just those who bore the most powerful fragments of Gwyn's Soul.  They didn't have mothers as they weren't biologically \"born\".  Their \"birth\" and order of such refers to when they each received their Souls.  I believe this because honestly no female character is closely linked enough to Gwyn or the children to be their mother.

Why?  Because they aren&amp;#39;t relevant to the story.  I honestly doubt Miyazaki even knows who they are.  But, of course, the community is the co-author so we also get to decide who Gwyn&amp;#39;s lover was.  But that&amp;#39;s not a reason to just make up new characters or link characters to each other based on very tenuous evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the idea that Gwyn&amp;#39;s children were just those who bore the most powerful fragments of Gwyn&amp;#39;s Soul.  They didn&amp;#39;t have mothers as they weren&amp;#39;t biologically &amp;quot;born&amp;quot;.  Their &amp;quot;birth&amp;quot; and order of such refers to when they each received their Souls.  I believe this because honestly no female character is closely linked enough to Gwyn or the children to be their mother.

Skip to Dark Souls 3 and Irythil/ Anor Londo is an &amp;quot;ancient city of moon worshiping nobles&amp;quot; (according to Greirat). The Sunless Realms also belong to the Moon Worshiping Pagans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This alone just make it clear that Gwyndolin&amp;#39;s birth was a secret and he was raised in hiding to take over Gwyn&amp;#39;s throne. Gwyn never knew about Gwyndolin&amp;#39;s existence. That&amp;#39;s why Gwyndolin is so fascinated by the Sun. Yorshka is likely Gwyndolin&amp;#39;s sister, but not a daughter of Gwyn. She is a half White Dragon, and in game there is a certain White Dragon related to sorcery and the moon too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Why do you assume Velka was the &amp;quot;imperial mother&amp;quot; and not Gwyndolin.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply because of the Book of the Guilty. All the Velka spells being related to Revenge (just like the Darkmoon ones). The Crows (Velka worshipers) dropping Ears, as before the Knights they were likely the Darkmoon Blades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Gwynevere was known as the Godmother. So the idea of &amp;quot;mother&amp;quot; that you are thinking are better translated as &amp;quot;Godmother&amp;quot; and this role is already Gwynevere&amp;#39;s. I think the &amp;quot;Imperial Mother&amp;quot; was very literally the Imperial Mother, the Empress Mother of Gwyn&amp;#39;s children. And the only female related to that location is Velka and the Nameless Moon/Darkmoon (Gwyndolin is NOT the Darkmoon, he is the Dark Sun and is never referred in game as the Darkmoon).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dgaoq5u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294654.0, "created_utc": 1492265854.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgajqym", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shroom_Soul", "parent_id": "t1_dgaj5om", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why do you assume Velka was the \"imperial mother\" and not Gwyndolin.

Even more interesting is Dusk&amp;#39;s parentage which could possibly be Gwyn and the &amp;#39;nameless moon deity. Only hint to this is her name, Dusk, which is the time of day right before night.
