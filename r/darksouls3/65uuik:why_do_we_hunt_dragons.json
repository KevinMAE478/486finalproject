The Sunken King built Shulva around him to protect and honor him. The poison building up in him while he slept was likely natural because of his environnement. He destroyed the city not because he wanted to but because of all the poison being released after he was pierced by Yorgh&amp;#39;s spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elana likely only wants revenge because her whole kingdom was destroyed and her husband killed, it&amp;#39;s said that she now feeds souls to Sinh to make him stronger. She also sings to him, which may proves that she actually cares about him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sinh probably fights you only because you&amp;#39;re following him to his own home, after all he is sleeping when you arrive. He must assume you&amp;#39;re hostile, yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dge0nap", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487706.0, "created_utc": 1492458906.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uuik", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge21iw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sleeper4", "parent_id": "t3_65uuik", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because fuck dragons, that's why.
