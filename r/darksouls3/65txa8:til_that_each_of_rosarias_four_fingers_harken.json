This one is a bit odd, since Astraea only makes her home among the dead and forgotten aborted children of the realm, thrown into the Valley of Defilement.

Old Monk is actually already dead when you find him, killed off by the Xanthous Crown, in much the same way the 4 Kings are already dead because of the way the abyss killed them off.

It even gets a nod in DS2, if you look at the map during the opening cutscene of Demon Souls and compare it to the map in the manor in Majula.

If you recall up above, I mentioned the Bed of Chaos and The Old One. DS3 is *full* of stylistic and direct references to characters growing branches and roots as the souls grow older and the fire dies and rekindles. The demons, especially, have this link, because of what the First Witch of Izalith did to create the demons. But every time Fire comes up, it tends to look like branches, and/or roots. Oddly, same thing happens with the ice structures that Alsanna makes in Crown of the Ivory King DLC. Since she doesn't deal with fire at all, and even rests over the Chaos Flame, I'm guessing this style choice is deliberate, to show the influence that The Dark / The Abyss has over magic, and souls. It all goes back to Trees. \n\nAgain, they just can't come out and say \"yes, this is actually in the same line of games\" because of IP laws. But they can heavily reference.
