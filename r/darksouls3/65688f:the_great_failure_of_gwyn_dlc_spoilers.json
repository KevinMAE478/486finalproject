Frampt is associated with the gods, and was, allegedly, a close personal friend of Gwyn. Kaathe, meanwhile, works tirelessly to bring about the age of the Dark Lord. Frampt is basically in the pocket of Gwyndolin, the last god in Anor Londo, and by helping you he's consolidating his position with Gwyndolin in the hopes of being granted position by Gwyndolin in the new Age of Fire, just like Seathe was rewarded with Dukedom by Gwyn for his own part in bringing about the original Age of Fire. \n\nKaathe, meanwhile, is a little weirder, since while he is actually working for you, he doesn't really care about \"you.\" Kaathe wants to bring about the Age of Dark for the same reason that Frampt wants to have you Link the Fire: so that he can be a powerful, trusted friend of the new Dark Lord of everything. You personally don't matter to him; he's whored himself out to Oolacile and New Londo looking for powerful friends, and he appears to you because you beat the Four Kings early, so must be powerful enough to serve his purpose. If, in the narrative context of the game, you failed at any point on your journey, Kaathe wouldn't be bothered in the slightest. He'd just go looking for the next Undead who looked strong to get them to do the same thing.\n\nIMO, the best characterization of both Kaathe and Frampt is \"fair-weather friends.\" They're happy to be friends and sycophants to people in power, but their agenda is mostly just \"keep power and connections, whatever the means.\" They don't actually care who's holding the power, or what they're doing with it, as long as their own lives are enriched by it. That's why Frampt joins Kaathe's side when you take the Dark Lord ending: he's seen the way the wind's blowing and is eager to abandon the failing gods and curry favor with his new lord and master. Presumably, Kaathe would do the same thing should you sacrifice yourself and Link the Fire.\n\nSo essentially, even though my theory about the methods of the primordial serpents is vastly different from yours, the core idea is still the same. The serpents want more, and as they's seen with Seathe (a scaleless, and thus imperfect, dragon who fought for Gwyn and was rewarded with position and power), sucking up to the guy in charge is the best and easiest way of getting more for themselves. Who exactly that guy in power is, or what he stands for, doesn't matter to either of them. \n\nI haven't presented any evidence for my theory over yours yet, but here's why I think what I do. I don't think either serpent wants \"things\" from you because if you stray from their quest lines (such as by attacking either one, or by acting in a way that benefits the other's quest line) they'll leave you. If they just wanted things from you, it wouldn't matter who you supported, since you could easily support both. After all, you gain plenty of both Humanity and souls/items over the course of your journey. To me, this suggests that there is an ideological dispute between them.
