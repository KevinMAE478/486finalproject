The problem is actually getting the dragon in this situation, which is why the spears are probably in a better spot for when you can&amp;#39;t have your dragon hunt go exactly how you planned it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely appreciate the aesthetic of the DSA a lot too. It&amp;#39;s exactly the kind of quasi-melted, ash-darkened wear and tear you&amp;#39;d expect on a dragonslayer&amp;#39;s armor.
