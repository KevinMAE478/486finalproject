Now, this was NOT on NG- still the first playthrough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something I learned through the course of these bosses- don&amp;#39;t heal until you know  you can do it &lt;em&gt;safely.&lt;/em&gt;  Focus more on the boss than your healthbar, to an extent.  Once your eyes and focus are off the boss, you&amp;#39;re done for.  Prioritize the boss over a bit of estus, and even then, when you REALLY need the estus, focus on dodging until you&amp;#39;re in a position to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may sound like a duh thing, but it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve only recently realized about my own play style.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dgd3x7u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492432138.0, "created_utc": 1492403338.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc1x2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EbolaDP", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1u99", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean you can cheeze most bosses with a bow thats not the point here.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean you can cheeze most bosses with a bow thats not the point here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dgc1x2g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492380017.0, "created_utc": 1492351217.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc1u99", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "imposta", "parent_id": "t1_dgc17xy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "firebombs", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;firebombs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dgc1u99", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492379878.0, "created_utc": 1492351078.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ocek", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9ig7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yaxion", "parent_id": "t1_dgc17xy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, actually.
