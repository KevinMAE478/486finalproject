A light devoured by &amp;quot;the shackles that bind this world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also think that the level design of the ringed city is supposed to make us feel like Fillianore. I want to emphasize on the mandlebrot set, everything about the ringed city/dreg heap is meant to make you feel disoriented and nauseated, which in a sense, fromsoft is kinda implying that you are supposed to feel terrible and ashamed at all the failures crumbled around you. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that at the end we witness cannibalism.\nI&amp;#39;ve read a couple of comments here and in youtube of people feeling that the dlc was really depressing, and I think that subconsciously, the level design is supposed to make you feel terrible. The vertigo and subconscious loopiness, reminds me of Kubrick&amp;#39;s technique in The Shining, where spatially impossible sets subconsciously made the viewers feel unease. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sUIxXCCFWw\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sUIxXCCFWw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfJ8rK7eJeQ\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfJ8rK7eJeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference and I guess as a really good example of the culture shock I&amp;#39;m relating to Fillianore, is the story of Mary in Warren Ellis&amp;#39; Transmetropolitan. This is the motion version of her story, give it a watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awgMt3wVm7I\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awgMt3wVm7I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;very similar. An optimist who wakes into a future so beyond reason and depravity that it psychologically affects the optimist turning her into a pessimist. She becomes highly resentful of what humanity has turned the world into.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dg5ickq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492002769.0, "created_utc": 1491973969.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64utko", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64utko", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64utko", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64utko", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64utko", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64utko", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6b4fh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SammyDavisTheSecond", "parent_id": "t1_dg6apwg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's like sweet sweet poetry, my friend.
