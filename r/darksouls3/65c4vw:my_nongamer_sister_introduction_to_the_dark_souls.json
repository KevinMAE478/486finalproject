Either people enjoy the frustration of first starting out or they put it aside without even scratching the surface of the game.  Because Souls games have such a long learning curve, having a decent tutor available to get your feet wet really helps.  I had a co-worker rage quit on Gascoigne so I told him how to summon and basically killed Gascoigne myself (he had so little insight I really couldn&amp;#39;t afford to let him learn) and then spent a few hours in Old Yharnam and The Cathedral Ward teaching him combat tips and tricks.  After Amelia I cut him loose to play the game solo and he ended up platinuming his first game ever.  So that felt good.  All he needed was a nudge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dg964b5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207703.0, "created_utc": 1492178903.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65c4vw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9abw4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rickyhaverland", "parent_id": "t3_65c4vw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I showed my girlfriend last night dark souls telling her it was one of the easiest games ever made and she quickly figured out that I lied", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I showed my girlfriend last night dark souls telling her it was one of the easiest games ever made and she quickly figured out that I lied&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dg9abw4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213039.0, "created_utc": 1492184239.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65c4vw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65c4vw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9nrl7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nekrozys", "parent_id": "t1_dg990x6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Username checks out.
