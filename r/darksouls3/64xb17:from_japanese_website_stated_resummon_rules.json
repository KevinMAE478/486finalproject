They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;descendants of Farron watchdogs who were turned into goatlike demons by some event.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This next part is reachy speculation of mine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that the Farron legion went to the smoldering lake (perhaps seeking the darkness that swallowed high lord wolnir?), got turned into demons there, then went back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the Old Demon King arena looks just like the Gwyn boss arena in the Kiln of the First Flame from DKS1, except made out of demon bodies instead of ash (seriously even the ash stalactites are represented as piles of demon bodies accurately.) My brother and I discussed the idea that Quelana and The Fair Lady may have reconciled (their bodies are close together) and tried to either link or undo the chaos flame (Quelana&amp;#39;s body is scorched and the smoldering lake is obviously the Ash Lake from DKS1.) Why would the fire spread to the ash lake, and why is the Old Demon King standing in the Ash Lake in a replica of Gwyn&amp;#39;s boss arena, unless someone linked the chaos flame?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the chaos flame was linked, or alternatively if Quelana and The Fair Lady tried to do something to the Chaos Flame, that could be the mysterious event mentioned in lore that created the Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But either way, even if that&amp;#39;s not the case, being demons, the Ghru aren&amp;#39;t really out of place in the Smoldering Lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dg69u5q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049176.0, "created_utc": 1492020376.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xb17", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6k285", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stopwatch064", "parent_id": "t1_dg61ada", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Enemy placements etc. that change with increasing ng+ would be amazing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enemy placements etc. that change with increasing ng+ would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls3", "name": "t1_dg6k285", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492059756.0, "created_utc": 1492030956.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xb17", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6cntm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ineffiable", "parent_id": "t1_dg61ada", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls3", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, a true remix and maybe even a remix that helps with some NG+ stuff would really make this game near perfect.\n\nAll they need to do is remaster demon's souls, and remaster dark souls (artorias of the abyss edition) and give both scholar of the first sin treatment.
