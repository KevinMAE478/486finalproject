In theory, you shouldn't have to be rebooting server OS's to fix them. In practice, it ends up helping sometimes. \n\nI work at a public k-12 and I had a laptop I was setting up that was acting like it wasn't whitelisted on our wifi. Called the WAN guy up, he checks/says it's listed...so we spent 15-20 minutes trying various complex things to test for and fix...he had a meeting to get to. On a whim, I rebooted the machine and voila, wifi is fine... Win10 machine too... go figure..\n\nI called him back after his meeting and said \"Guess what fixed it?... IT Crowd\". He starts laughing his ass off knowing exactly what I meant. \n\n[edit]. Another one... I started my job over 19 years ago. During one of the first few years, the IT director over me was at my building supervising a Router upgrade. He had a Cisco Router guy there doing the dirty work along w/ a couple other dudes. I was also brought in to be a gopher basically as I was still really new....ping this...tracreroute that...etc. So not being a cisco guy myself, to this day I don't know exactly what problem they ran into but it was something to do w/ a MAC address on the outbound side of the router not meshing with something correctly. They spent over an hour on this bugaboo and it was getting very late. I was trying to listen in and not bug anyone as they all had more experience than me ... and I didn't ever get along well with this IT director... So newbie me is sitting there thinking...they seem to need a fresh MAC address. I have a bin full (and I mean full) of 10mbit (remember, this is the late 90s) NICs and I'll never need all of them. Each one has a MAC address on it... So newbie me pipes up when they finally take a break to mull things over and says \"Can you use the MAC address on one of these cards?\" Not sure of exact response but it was along the lines of \"No because it might conflict later\"... So they start up again still not able to solve the problem. Another half hour later at least. I re-ask the question... in my mind I was going to just give them the card to keep so it couldn't conflict. In their mind, I was keeping it. This time after the cisco guy answered my question more clearly, I realized he thought I was going to keep the card.. I said \"You don't get it...[walked over with card in hand]. Here take it, put a nail through it into your wall. I don't care. I have more than I need.\" After a second, his eyes lit up and he understood. He took the card and using that MAC, had the problem fixed in 2 minutes. It seemed like a simple Macgyver solution to the problem (Guess what show was my favorite in the 80s... ;-p) and yet at first I was blown off like so much chaff in the threshing floor. \n\nUnlike in OPs situation, I got neither a pat on the back from my IT Dir. nor any bonus cash...he largely ignored me and congratulated the rest of the room for me saving his ass. The cisco guy thanked me and later on when I ran into him at a conference, he was quite positive about it and acknowledged it.

In theory, you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be rebooting server OS&amp;#39;s to fix them. In practice, it ends up helping sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work at a public k-12 and I had a laptop I was setting up that was acting like it wasn&amp;#39;t whitelisted on our wifi. Called the WAN guy up, he checks/says it&amp;#39;s listed...so we spent 15-20 minutes trying various complex things to test for and fix...he had a meeting to get to. On a whim, I rebooted the machine and voila, wifi is fine... Win10 machine too... go figure..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called him back after his meeting and said &amp;quot;Guess what fixed it?... IT Crowd&amp;quot;. He starts laughing his ass off knowing exactly what I meant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[edit]. Another one... I started my job over 19 years ago. During one of the first few years, the IT director over me was at my building supervising a Router upgrade. He had a Cisco Router guy there doing the dirty work along w/ a couple other dudes. I was also brought in to be a gopher basically as I was still really new....ping this...tracreroute that...etc. So not being a cisco guy myself, to this day I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what problem they ran into but it was something to do w/ a MAC address on the outbound side of the router not meshing with something correctly. They spent over an hour on this bugaboo and it was getting very late. I was trying to listen in and not bug anyone as they all had more experience than me ... and I didn&amp;#39;t ever get along well with this IT director... So newbie me is sitting there thinking...they seem to need a fresh MAC address. I have a bin full (and I mean full) of 10mbit (remember, this is the late 90s) NICs and I&amp;#39;ll never need all of them. Each one has a MAC address on it... So newbie me pipes up when they finally take a break to mull things over and says &amp;quot;Can you use the MAC address on one of these cards?&amp;quot; Not sure of exact response but it was along the lines of &amp;quot;No because it might conflict later&amp;quot;... So they start up again still not able to solve the problem. Another half hour later at least. I re-ask the question... in my mind I was going to just give them the card to keep so it couldn&amp;#39;t conflict. In their mind, I was keeping it. This time after the cisco guy answered my question more clearly, I realized he thought I was going to keep the card.. I said &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t get it...[walked over with card in hand]. Here take it, put a nail through it into your wall. I don&amp;#39;t care. I have more than I need.&amp;quot; After a second, his eyes lit up and he understood. He took the card and using that MAC, had the problem fixed in 2 minutes. It seemed like a simple Macgyver solution to the problem (Guess what show was my favorite in the 80s... ;-p) and yet at first I was blown off like so much chaff in the threshing floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike in OPs situation, I got neither a pat on the back from my IT Dir. nor any bonus cash...he largely ignored me and congratulated the rest of the room for me saving his ass.
