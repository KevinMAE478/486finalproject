But being in here by myself is delightful. The admin assistants up on the 5&amp;#39;th floor had invited me up for some Christmas wine and food they brought for a December 24&amp;#39;th potluck. Yes, it was Christmas eve. Now normally my company has Christmas eve off to be with your family. Technically we are open for the 24&amp;#39;th but the Exec&amp;#39;s always tell everyone &amp;quot;if you don&amp;#39;t have to come in then don&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; as a sort of &amp;quot;thank you for all your hard work&amp;quot;. However, since we are technically still operating a few of us sysadmins have to volunteer to &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; that day in case someone actually needs something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always volunteer. It is the best day at work ever. You bring your Xbox in and hook it up to the projector in the boardroom. All your favorite admin assistants bring Christmas-y booze and food and love to share. (Full well knowing the benefit of being on the IT favorite customers list.) And we always get sent home around 2PM anyways because who the heck isn&amp;#39;t going to take a free paid day off? It&amp;#39;s a ghost town and generally a pretty sweet gig and my family does holiday stuff on different days anyway so I always take it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there I am kicking back at my office with a full belly, some tunes, and Gears of War 3. (This was a few years ago.) I&amp;#39;m expecting the &amp;quot;Did anything happen? No? Go home and merry Christmas!&amp;quot; email from my manager any minute now. When suddenly I hear a very loud &lt;strong&gt;KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK&lt;/strong&gt; at the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intrigued as to who hates themselves enough to actually do work on Christmas eve I answer it. In barges &lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;, an angry/confused/hurt look on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey, &lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;! Merry Christmas! How are you doing today?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: I cannot connect to any WiFi at all and it is all your fault!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;She is notoriously oblivious to any and all niceties but it was Christmas and I was into the holiday spirit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: That is terrible! And on Christmas eve too...&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Laying it on thick that nobody in their right mind would be so frantic about getting work done until the holidays were over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Worked into a lather about her issue and probably my attempts at good customer service.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m tired of these things not working!

The phone? It was at home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes of course I brought it. Here it is.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;She pulls out the dirtiest, most neglected Lenovo ThinkPad I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: Itllwahhficntct!!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry, slow down!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: It.

Secretly wishing he had a hazmat suit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay can you please log in for me and show me what happens when you try to connect?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh it connects here just fine.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Internal screaming about how seconds ago the story was it wouldn&amp;#39;t connect to anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: That&amp;#39;s just the problem. It only connects here at work. You admins lock everything down on these laptops so we can only use them here. A different tech told me. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Well I don&amp;#39;t know who [Insert make belief tech that probably exists in her mind.] told you that but it&amp;#39;s simply not true. These devices are purchased and set up specifically so you can work away from the office. It wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense for us to limit the WiFi.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: Sohwynotwierk?!?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, I assume you&amp;#39;re trying to connect to your WiFi at home.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Nods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Well I can&amp;#39;t help you with that. That&amp;#39;s at your house. We&amp;#39;re at work. Do you see how this is an issue?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: No! This is your equipment and you&amp;#39;re responsible for it working. You&amp;#39;re going to help me!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Not wanting to hear about this after the holidays I go the extra mile to help this lady out so I can get the heck out of here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$TurbulentSpud&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. Do you know your home WiFi SSID and password? Did you write it down?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I figure I can manually create a wireless profile for her and tell her to just go home and it will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: My husband handles all of that. Let me call him now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this part it took everything in me to not burst out laughing at this customer as I witnessed the most stunning phone call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;$PhD pulls out her also dirty and neglected iPhone and dials her husband.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Of course, she calls him on speakerphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$HB&lt;/strong&gt;: HALLO?! &lt;em&gt;Sounds like he&amp;#39;s on speakerphone as well. What is it with people and speakerphone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;m here with the IT guy and I need the WiFi password.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$HB&lt;/strong&gt;: WHAT?!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$PhD&lt;/strong&gt;: IT&amp;#39;S ME, $PhD!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;$HB&lt;/strong&gt;: Ohkay.

I&amp;#39;m not kidding. I timed it on my watch. The repeated, yelled questions. It truly was a sight to behold. I secretly wondered what their home life was like. Suddenly a part of their strange, shouted conversation catches my ear.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$HB&lt;/strong&gt;: YES I HAVE IT.

He did all of this without communicating it to the person he lived with. Or in all likelihood he did tell her but she didn&amp;#39;t understand. So in the end I was able to create a new wireless profile for her using the new router credentials and sent her on her way. I immediately went to the bathroom to scrub the laptop off my hands and then checked my phone. During that time the manager had sent out the gorgeous &amp;quot;get the heck outta there&amp;quot; email.
