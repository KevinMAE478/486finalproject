I&amp;#39;ve only worked at this one repair shop so I don&amp;#39;t know how common that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This tale is from my short time (almost 5 months) working at a lousy cell phone/computer repair shop in a dead mall. While I joined to fix computers, I mostly replaced iPhone screens with aftermarket screens of questionable quality for more than apple charges for authentic screens. One of many reasons I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this story isn&amp;#39;t about iPhones. It&amp;#39;s about the ancient desktop that was brought in for repair. Now this was a gateway from 2002 which came with what was then a brand new operating system, Windows XP. it had a pentium 4 and 512MB of RDRAM. For reference, this happened last year, in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came in to work after my $boss had worked the shop the previous day (he didn&amp;#39;t see any reason to have more than one person in a store at any given time), and saw an old, beige gateway desktop on the table. Now the $boss, despite owning not one but four tech repair shops, knew next to nothing about tech, especially computers. So he didn&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with taking in such an old computer. I called the customer to try to dissuade her from wasting money on a computer that is unsafe to go online with, since XP isn&amp;#39;t supported anymore (as did a couple of my coworkers later.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$me: = Me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$rc: = Rambling Customer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: Hello, I&amp;#39;m calling about this Gateway computer you dropped off?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$rc: Oh, yes. So I bought this computer brand new and about a month after I got it, I broke up with my boyfriend. He got angry and put a virus on it, and I&amp;#39;m only just getting around to having it fixed because it&amp;#39;s a pretty good computer and I&amp;#39;d like to be able to use it for web browsing and Word. I got all kinds of software with it~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: Alright, but the thing with that is this computer is extremely old, it&amp;#39;s really not worth the cost to fix it, and since the operating system isn&amp;#39;t supported anymore if you were to go online, within a week it&amp;#39;ll probably be loaded with viruses and unusable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$rc: Well I&amp;#39;d still like to get it fixed, I really don&amp;#39;t want to have to pay for a brand new computer if I can just use this one~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went back and forth like this a few times, before I gave in and said I&amp;#39;d take a look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plugged it in, turned it on, and... &lt;strong&gt;No boot device detected&lt;/strong&gt;\nThat&amp;#39;s odd, maybe the hard drive failed?\nOpened the computer up and.....there was no hard drive. Anywhere. The massive IDE cable was just floating around, unconnected. Apparently, the customer&amp;#39;s evil ex boyfriend had stolen the hard drive over a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Called up the boss to tell him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$me: hey $boss, so it turns out this computer is actually missing a hard drive. Also, this computer is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; too old to be worth fixing, it uses an obsolete hard drive and RAM so old it needs dummy sticks in the empty slots just to work, but the customer &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants it up and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$boss: well look around the shop and try to find a spare hard drive and try to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I managed to find 2 hard drives of the IDE variety in a drawer. But they both had very old (and mostly blank) shop tags on them, so obviously they were there for a reason, and I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t want to put one in a computer. I put them back and called it a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next work day, I was again working after $boss. I went back to the gateway and saw one of the IDE hard drives sitting next to it. Figured I&amp;#39;d go ahead and at least try to get it working. But I wasn&amp;#39;t about to put a mysterious hard drive into a computer without testing it first. So I found an IDE hard drive dock and powered it on. It immediately started billowing smoke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;me: Boy, am I glad I didn&amp;#39;t just plug this into the computer!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me. I put this back in the drawer. $boss took it out and I&amp;#39;m certain he plugged it into the computer. I just wish I was there to see his reaction....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the other hard drive worked and I managed to install XP and get the computer running. A few days later, amazingly, a coworker actually managed to get Windows 7 32 bit running on it. In the end we ended up spending a couple weeks on a now 15 year old gateway desktop and charging over $100 ($boss decided the cost) and although I would normally consider that robbery, I and another coworker tried multiple times to convince her not to go for it.
