Our administrator (boss of the C-level) is fully aware that she&amp;#39;s no IT person. During the interregnums between IT Managers, IT reported directly to the Administrator. Small items she would approve without hesitation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;If you say you need it, I&amp;#39;ll sign.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Larger items were deferred until the new IT manager was hired. Which sometimes was a bit irritating when additional hardware or software was necessary, but overall, it worked well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The C-Level does not have this awareness. She has no idea how anything in IT works or functions. However, this does not stop her from trying to act as another IT manager (you may have noticed this...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The software we run the business on is far from perfect. The vendor did not make it, they bought three different pieces of software, then glued them together. At one point in the not too distant past, one part of the software required an Oracle database, the other parts required Microsoft SQL. A server stood in front of these two dbs and glued everything together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recent versions only require Microsoft SQL, although according to our programmer, there&amp;#39;s still a ton of duplication in the unified db.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can probably guess, the software reflects this glued together structure. It crashes fairly frequently, and the company has put out near endless patches and service packs over the years. It&amp;#39;s been interesting trying to stay on top of everything. However much I dislike the software, their support is very good. They are also very good at telling you which patches will be slow to come out (the list is long, and issues that affect 50% of clients will always take precedence over issues that affect only us (duh, right?)).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these admissions from from the vendor, our C-Level demands perfection from the software, and if a bug is found that affects her users (no matter how small the impact), she expects fixes immediately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One issue with the structure of the database is that if financial reports accessed the data tables normally, the reports would be fairly slow to compile all the data. To work around this, the vendor created additional tables that compile the financial data as the system accumulates it. When a report is run, it pulls the data from these tables, rather than the main. Unfortunately, the processes that fills the fast access tables is not perfect, and things can, and do, get left out. The result is that some of the financial reports won&amp;#39;t match other financial reports. This causes issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To fix the non-matching financial data, the system has a separate SQL job that runs every Saturday at 5am. We&amp;#39;ve been told that this job should only be run when very few people are in the system. Otherwise, there could be dire consequences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the C-Level knows better than the people who wrote the software, and at month end, we are notified when all staff are out of the financial side of the software, and we manually run the job. Every time, I make my reservations known, and every time, I&amp;#39;m told to press on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, the tickets start rolling in. Strange problems in this account, oddball sums in this, why are there weird symbols in this one. Obviously, the job screwed things up. I call support.

Obviously, the downtime is not her fault for ordering the job get run, but vendor&amp;#39;s fault. She demands to see what the job does, and what it fixes. Vendor states that the job does many things, with english descriptions, but that logging is impossible because of the way the job is coded. (I&amp;#39;m not a SQL guy, I have no idea if that&amp;#39;s correct)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not good enough, she needs to be able to point the finger at someone other than herself for the problem. Somebody must have been in the financial side of things when the job was run. She must know who. Both the vendor and I state that it&amp;#39;s not possible to get that information. Both the vendor and I state that it&amp;#39;s a bad idea to run the job again during business hours. Both the vendor and I get overruled the next month. The job gets run. Issues occur.
