Especially them being a small party is very convenient for us, because all their employees are familiar with us, our workflow and requirements. Lately, we have gradually been upgrading the software on our servers to newer versions. This happened whenever we planned to upgrade our own software on that server as well, because only our latest release would benefit from an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For our SQL servers, with every upgrade I provided them with the same specific configuration settings. Having done some 5 servers already, I assumed that by now they would know the drill. So one day I had planned to migrate our largest project to a new cluster of servers, with the actual migration happening at night to minimize downtime. Since these servers were all new, I assumed that our provider would have applied the configuration settings that I had requested during to other upgrades as well. When I was testing the SQL servers in this cluster, I got the same error message as I always would get with servers that had not been configured to our specs. Okay, a bit annoying that they hadn&amp;#39;t done it yet by themselves, but not a big deal. So I sent the provider an email with the request to apply my configuration. They did, and within an hour I got a reply that it had been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here comes trial number 2, and this time I just got a time-out error. Since these servers were behind a load balancer, I assumed that they must have messed up something with the routing of requests, or maybe the SQL server was not properly booted or something the like. The IP address of the load balancer did reply to ping requests, so it was not down. I sent an email back that I couldn&amp;#39;t connect and pasted my commands and output. After an hour or two, they replied that they verified that everything was set up and working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to connect again, and got the same time-out error. I became more and more convinced that they must have messed up something with the load balancer, because recently I discovered that we had a backup server running idle for 2 years, because of a load balancer misconfiguration by our provider. By now I was getting a bit itchy, because there was some 2 or 3 hours left of this working day and it needed to be fixed right now, and also because I had a nightly migration ahead of me. So I escalated the issue to my manager to step in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually a few minutes before the normal office closed, I got an email:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ehmp, I think that you switched a digit in the server&amp;#39;s IP address.
