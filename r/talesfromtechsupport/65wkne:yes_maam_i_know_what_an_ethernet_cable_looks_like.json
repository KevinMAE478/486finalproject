Ah, what are you trying to do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bwife: &amp;quot;He says he wants me to move the cable from that computer&amp;quot; she points to the desktop &amp;quot;to this one.&amp;quot; This one being a laptop that&amp;#39;s on but not plugged into anything. &amp;quot;Do you know how to do that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I realize our poor IT guy is trying to remote into the laptop but can&amp;#39;t because it&amp;#39;s not connected to the internet.

I unplugged the ethernet cable, switched it to the laptop, a quick plug n&amp;#39; play and gave her the nod. She tells IT its now connected, I stayed just long enough for him to remote in and make sure he didn&amp;#39;t need me to do anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About twenty minutes later, Bwife comes back to me and asks if I can switch the cable back to the desktop.
