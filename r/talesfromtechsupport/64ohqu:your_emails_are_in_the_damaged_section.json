Not a tech support guy, but I thought I&amp;#39;d share this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom is the boss of a small business (~12 persons, so no on-site tech support).\nOne morning she arrives at the office, powers up her laptop...and it&amp;#39;s not booting. She can&amp;#39;t do any work without it, so she immediatly drives to a nearby computer repair shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mom : Hi, my laptop won&amp;#39;t start. Can you fix it ? Or at least recover my documents. Especially my emails, I really need them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech guy : Ok ma&amp;#39;am, we&amp;#39;ll see what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Later&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tech guy : So, ma&amp;#39;am, it appears that your hard drive is fried. You&amp;#39;ll need to replace it if you want to use the laptop again. I&amp;#39;ve been able to recover your documents, however the emails are in the section of the drive that has been damaged, so there is nothing I can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother sighs, pays the bill for the recovery, and leaves the shop with the laptop and her documents. She knows that without her emails, the next days are going to be rough. It&amp;#39;s a small business, she takes care of a lot of different things and has to communicate with a lot of different people. She had several years of emails on that thing !&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On her way back to the office she buys a new laptop. She knows she could have just replaced the drive, but the broken laptop is very old already, and she has been planning for an upgrade anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the end of the day when she comes home, bringing along her two laptops, the new one and the broken one. She tells me the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I hear about the drive being &amp;quot;locally&amp;quot; damaged exactly where the emails are, my bullshit-sense starts tingling. I do not know enough about filesystems to know if this is possible, but it seems unlikely at best. Maybe she is skeptical too, because she hands me the broken laptop and asks me to take a look (she knows I love to fiddle around with computers and troubleshoot them).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to fire it up and, sure thing, boot error. I go to the BIOS and the hard drive is not even showing up. Yup, looks like it&amp;#39;s fried, indeed.\nSo I grab an Ubuntu LiveCD I have laying around and try booting from it. It works ! And, surprise, the seemingly broken drive shows up in the file manager. I can mount it and copy files just fine (this is probably also what the tech guy did to &amp;quot;recover&amp;quot; the documents).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the &amp;quot;locally damaged&amp;quot; story seems even more suspicious, so I figure I&amp;#39;d try to find these emails. However, I don&amp;#39;t know where to look (I have never done that before). My mother uses MS Outlook on a MS operating system, so it has to be something like My Documents/Emails, right ? Wrong ! You tech people probably know the right path, but I had to google it. It&amp;#39;s a very complicated one, that goes deep into AppData and contains (seemingly) random numbers and letters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go there and suprise, surprise ! The emails are all there. Not damaged or whatever. I google how to to import them back into Outlook, put them on a USB key, hand the key to my mom and explain her the procedure. I was quite the savior that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess what happened is that the tech guy didn&amp;#39;t even bother searching for the emails and instead preferred to serve my mom some BS about the drive being damaged &amp;quot;at that exact location&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bonus part : turned out the drive was fine, what prevented the boot was a weird bug in the BIOS (yeah, didn&amp;#39;t know that could even happen...). A factory reset fixed the issue. And because the laptop was old and my mom already had a replacement, I got to keep it !\nIt&amp;#39;s been 5 years, I still have it in a closet somewhere and as far as I know it still works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello there !\nFirst post on TFTS, hope I don't break any rules.
