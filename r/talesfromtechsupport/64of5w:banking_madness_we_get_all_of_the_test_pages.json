Very good at his job, very fun to hang out with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: A fellow tech, big classic rock fan (we listened to a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of Led Zeppelin on long drives; I introduced him to Dread Zeppelin, a reggae Zeppelin cover band with an Elvis impersonator as lead singer, and we listened to a lot of them when we ran out of &amp;#39;Zeppelin). With the exception of one week (week 3), we rode together for every week until after week 5, which will become clear shortly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BendR: Formerly known as &amp;quot;Clipboard&amp;quot; (ClipB); proven to be an alcohol-powered technician, a lot of fun to hang out with when he has a buzz on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO EASTERN PA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first Saturday conversion was somewhere northwest of Philadelphia. We assembled in the parking lot promptly at 6 AM, hangovers and all, ready to embark on an epic journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While SDog was doing inventory on our load-out for the week, noticed something strange...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: Huh. Never had one of these before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BendR (very blearily): What? What we got?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting near the front of the equipment van was a large, $Happy color MFP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, this was unusual. BankA had a standard that they never deviated from when it came to printers: 2 secure printers at the teller line, one $Happy black-and-white MFP on the floor, for the managers and financial planners. This would be the only time we carried one of these; after what it put us through, we counted ourselves lucky. That was clumsy foreshadowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We set off, and it was epic... until I got pulled over in New Jersey. I swear I was traveling with the traffic, right up to the point that they all slowed down for the cop I didn&amp;#39;t see. Fortunately, he let me off with a license plate violation (that&amp;#39;s $50 I&amp;#39;d gladly spend again to avoid a 75 in a 50 violation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and then it was a &lt;strong&gt;careful&lt;/strong&gt; trip down the NJ Turnpike, into PA at the Penn Turnpike, then over about a half-dozen &amp;quot;pikes&amp;quot; to the site (I still want to know what a &amp;quot;Skippack&amp;quot; is, and why they named a pike for it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BendR Assumes His Final Tech Form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the successful conversion, we retired briefly to the hotel before the Google search for food. Settling on a place I think was called the Brick and Barrel, we set forth to try and enjoy the Saturday night before we headed out on Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan started off as designated driver. That lasted until the cute-as-hell bartender winked at him, and got him trying some new mixes she was testing on &amp;quot;select customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog took one look at the keys, shrugged, and ordered a beer before passing them on to BendR... who shook his head, ordered an IPA, and handed them to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep... from reckless driving to designated driver in less than 12 hours. Go, me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we finally got ZepFan untangled from the bartender (after reminding him that he had a girlfriend waiting back home for him), we headed back to the hotel. The entire way, BendR was hanging out of the window, howling at the streetlights. I was never more happy not to see any cops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, To CT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...via Philadelphia. You do not visit the Philly area without at least trying a Philly cheesesteak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...and Tuesday, Back to PA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...because whoever made the schedule for that week was a sadist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mystery of the Color Printer Is Revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had been having a great week up to Wednesday. Every conversion was easy, we had awesome testers for UAT (I was starting to think that maybe it was just NY that bred bad testers, which rankled my NY pride), and we were feeling good about this conversion. Best of all, the bank closed at 3 PM instead of the usual 4, so we would be on the road an hour early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We unpacked our equipment, got our tools out and ready, and gingerly lifted that color MFP off of the van.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BendR: This thing is $$$$ing heavy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: Good thing it&amp;#39;s on wheels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: Good thing they laid it down in the van... that thing would have killed someone if they didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We wheeled it into the bank and got it in place, then did the usual: Patched PCs, set up the pinpads and secure printers (BendR soloed the printers, and had them up in time to start staging the PCs... I told you he shaped up quickly!), and were ready with a half hour to spare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: ...no... not going to say it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: No, please don&amp;#39;t. Don&amp;#39;t jinx it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BendR (comes around the corner): Hey, we might just break the record tonight!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Damnit. He had to say it out loud, didn&amp;#39;t he?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: C&amp;#39;mon, guys, you&amp;#39;re not superstitious, are you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me and SDog (in unison): We were &lt;em&gt;sailors&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s pretty much trained into us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Closing time! The bank people are surprisingly quick at balancing, and we begin setting up PCs quickly, knocking them out long before the bridge finishes its checks and configs and gets SDog swapping cables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, now I&amp;#39;m feeling confident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: Good. Hey, got a sec?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We head back to the network room (which, surprisingly, was a spacious storage room, with actual room to move).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: I won&amp;#39;t be heading out with you guys next week. I got word Sunday morning that my grandfather died, and I need to take some bereavement leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (after appropriate condolences and &amp;quot;if there&amp;#39;s anything you need&amp;quot; and a promise to get him home as quickly as possible... which he turned me down on, as it was his turn to drive): Did you tell SDog?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: Not yet. After we wrap up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Can&amp;#39;t Log In... and Everything&amp;#39;s Slow... And The Printer Won&amp;#39;t Stop...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the bridge cuts over to the BankA network, and we begin the scripts and software deployments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, at least, we tried to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right away, we have problems getting to the login servers for BankB&amp;#39;s virtual network. It would take multiple tries with our vendor credentials to get in, only to run into issues with the scripts... and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, the software deployment phase took ages, as the small downloads were taking forever to download.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, it took an extra half hour to get to the point where we could run our own simple tests to see if the machines were ready for UAT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I haven&amp;#39;t said anything up to now about them, it was a quick and dirty test to see if they had network access: BankB intranet, internet, test to see if they printed on the old teller MFP, test to see if they printed on the platform MFP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each test took a geological epoch to complete, and we were all frazzled by the time we could turn them over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a curious thing was happening: we were getting extra test pages on the newly-installed MFP. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of extra test pages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teller and manager for the night began to log in to the PCs. SDog actually came up with a brilliant idea: Since the PCs were taking forever to log in, and since anyone could log into multiple BankA and BankB machines (as long as they didn&amp;#39;t try to log into BankB&amp;#39;s $ProprietaryPOSteamingSSoftware on multiple machines, which was a no-no), he had us have them log into every machine at once, so when they came up, they could be tested as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new color printer was &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; printing test pages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan: Wow, there&amp;#39;s some serious lag in the system. We finished sending the test pages 10 minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: yeah, that&amp;#39;s... odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the stack of pages, and started just sorting them by the PC that sent them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed something very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a test page was printed, it had a header that had the BankB branch number, then an underscore, then the number of the PC that sent it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If my branch was 123, and the PC was 004, the number should read &amp;quot;123_004.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were getting 123s. Also, 157s... and 998s... and 445s... Light bulb moment imminent...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out my phone, and pulled up the schedule of branches for the week for each team. It was all on a big Excel sheet, with each team number, the day of the week, and the branch particulars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Let&amp;#39;s see... 157: yep... 998: yep... &lt;em&gt;etc. and so on&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Hey, SDog! Tell the bridge that we&amp;#39;re getting everyone&amp;#39;s platform test pages! They pointed every platform printer &lt;strong&gt;in the entire BankB network&lt;/strong&gt; at our platform color MFP!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: What? No way. That can&amp;#39;t be right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, when I showed him the test pages (and we got a few more as I pointed this out to him), he realized what else was happening...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: The bridge DDoS&amp;#39;d us! We&amp;#39;re getting all of the print requests, and it&amp;#39;s keeping us from doing network stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took another 10 minutes (and about 15 more test pages) to convince the bridge tech that, yes, everyone was printing to our new color MFP, and yes, we were lagging hard because of it, and definitely, you guys should be fixing this, ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A general call was put out to stop testing the platform until the problem was resolved. Someone decided that it would be hilarious to send a few more test pages, so that got slowed down some more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick rewrite of the printer policy, a quick push to the PCs, and some command line wizardry, and we were able to turn the PCs back over to the testers for UAT again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate printers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZepFan did manage to get SDog aside for a few minutes and let him know what was going on. He was pretty somber on the way back home. This wasn&amp;#39;t the last week we&amp;#39;d see him, but after week 5, he really wasn&amp;#39;t a permanent member of the team... but that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I was doing some follow up work for my company on behalf of BankA, and one of my stops was the color MFP installation site. The manager recognized me, and also...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Branch Manager: Oh, right, that was the night my new printer wouldn&amp;#39;t stop printing. &lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt; That was a fun night!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL; DR:&lt;/strong&gt; New printer brings ALL the boys to the yard with her &lt;del&gt;milkshakes&lt;/del&gt; color printing, and BankA network engineers let her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Added tl;dr for some folks; fixed a link.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "If you are just joining us, here is a recap of everything that has happened up to now:\n\n**Background**: I am a former Navy electrician's mate ([The Fuse Story](https://redd.it/5z1buk), [The Great Ground Hunt](https://redd.it/5zkjd2)), former QA intern ([Fun With Active HTML...
