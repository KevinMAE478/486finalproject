I bet you have slow internet speeds, so you should just upgrade,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;she bolsters, even though nobody thought about the cost of the getting a new modem and router that can support a higher bandwidth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$TheParent: &amp;quot;Well can you fix it now so that we can watch the movie? I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with all these pauses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &lt;em&gt;I check my phone and notice there&amp;#39;s 4 SSIDs in the house; normally there&amp;#39;s only 2 with newer equipment - regular and 5g.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Hmm. 4 SSIDs, I bet the WAPs are on the same channel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$FemFriend: &amp;quot;No it&amp;#39;s just the internet speeds. They don&amp;#39;t have enough internet for &lt;code&gt;$MasFriend&lt;/code&gt; to play a game online and watch Netflix,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;she says with assuredness. I decide to let the internet darling troubleshoot the connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About 30 minutes pass, the movie has been on pause, and &lt;code&gt;$FemFriend&lt;/code&gt; has been guaranteeing that she can fix the problem. Alas, though, she has been unable to troubleshoot the networking congestion. When she was downstairs talking to everyone else, I decided to go check on &lt;code&gt;$MasFriend&lt;/code&gt; and diagnose the second WAP in the house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Hey bud, I heard that your internet connection sucks lately. Did it start when you bought this?&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;pointing to the WAP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$MasFriend: &amp;quot;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s been really slow. On the PS4, it says my download speed is less than 1 megabyte per second.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Yikes! I haven&amp;#39;t seen that since the days of AOL,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;we chuckle,&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Well, let me take a look and I can see what I can do for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the computer now, and I entered the IP address of the default gateway on his SSID. As I suspected, the IP address of his default gateway is the same as the connection used by &lt;code&gt;$TheParent&lt;/code&gt; WAP. This really should be used as an extender, but I better check first to make sure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;So I&amp;#39;m looking at your connection and I have to ask, do you have your own internet service?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$MasFriend: &amp;quot;No, I pay for part of the bill, but it&amp;#39;s all under the name of &lt;code&gt;$TheParent&lt;/code&gt;. Is that a bad thing?&amp;quot; *He looks a little worried.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;No, not a bad thing necessarily, but it makes sense. Your connection is very slow because,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;thinking of how to make this basic,&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re connecting two devices to the same source, so to speak. They both think they&amp;#39;re the primary connection, and the devices are a little...confused.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$MasFriend: &amp;quot;Can you fix it for me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Yeah it shouldn&amp;#39;t be too much to fix it, change some settings and whatnot.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Famous last words? I hope not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve determined that there&amp;#39;s 1 single dmarc point to the ISP, and there&amp;#39;s 2 WAPs connected on the home network. One WAP is connected to the router, and the other used by $MasFriend is trying to connect to the router wirelessly. The confusion for me was caused when there were 2 SSIDs on their home network, and 2 SSIDs for 5g connections. He renamed the SSID when he connected to the network, so now everything&amp;#39;s all confused. I went to connect the device to his PC for easier configuration when I noticed a switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Look at that,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;I showed him the switch on the side that says WAP and Extender. I slid the switch to Extender,&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;this was set up as wireless access point - basically, another Wi-Fi network. You wanted it set as an Extender.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checking my phone, now the second SSID is gone and I run a speed test on the Wi-Fi connection. Suddenly, the speeds are increased from 1/1 to 25/10 mbps. Amazing what the right settings can do for a device, huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$MasFriend: &amp;quot;So, is it okay now? I knew I should&amp;#39;ve called you before letting &lt;code&gt;$FemFriend&lt;/code&gt; try to help me with this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Yeah, well, live and learn. No worries, let&amp;#39;s just check your PS4 connection next.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;The speeds are about the same, around 14/7 mbps which I&amp;#39;d expect - not everything hits the cap.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Just remember, I&amp;#39;m always a phone call away. I don&amp;#39;t mind helping.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We go downstairs and the movie has been resumed, I assume they just thought I had lost interest in it. To be fair, it wasn&amp;#39;t something I wanted to watch anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$FemFriend: &amp;quot;I told you that you need faster internet speed. I can&amp;#39;t even connect to the Wi-Fi on my phone now. Oh well, guess I&amp;#39;ll play Pok\u00e9mon.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$TheParent: &amp;quot;I noticed that the movie hasn&amp;#39;t skipped though. I thought you fixed it, &lt;code&gt;$FemFriend&lt;/code&gt;? How come you can&amp;#39;t connect then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was smiling, eager to offer assistance to $FemFriend for a resolution. I couldn&amp;#39;t wait for the explanation she&amp;#39;d have in store for why her configuration should&amp;#39;ve worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Hey, so I was upstairs, and I fixed the...ahem...&amp;#39;other router&amp;#39; in &lt;code&gt;$MasFriend&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s bedroom. Turns out it was on the wrong setting. It should be good to go, now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$FemFriend: &amp;quot;If it&amp;#39;s fixed, I&amp;#39;d be able to get on the Wi-Fi. It&amp;#39;s not fixed yet.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;She has bugged out eyes and a look of disdain, but she&amp;#39;s about to be even more upset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;Let me ask one thing; are you still trying to connect to &lt;code&gt;$MasFriend&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s SSID?&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;She looks confused, shockingly this guru didn&amp;#39;t know what the SSID was. I motioned for her phone and she did let me check the settings.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Oh okay, see you never connected to &lt;code&gt;$TheParent&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s Wi-Fi, so you&amp;#39;re not actually connecting to the right one. Refresh your list and choose this one with the -ext on the end.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She connects to the correct SSID and is now on their Wi-Fi. There&amp;#39;s still 4 SSIDs available, unfortunately, but I set up the Extender according to the instructions. Turning off the WAP and enabling the Extender setting certainly resolved the issue, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Badmin: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re welcome.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For some background, and to add anonymity since she's a redditor too, this isn't about friends originally but I don't want to disclose details about my personal life online.
