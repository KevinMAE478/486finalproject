Suddenly, the phone goes off, and it&amp;#39;s a call from $Fd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Fd: Hey, $me, can you... Help me with something?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Yeah, sure, what&amp;#39;s going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh no, what does he want this time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Fd: Well, you know how I got that new computer that my uncle built for me?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Yeah...?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Fd: Well any time I start up a game, it runs really slow and then it crashes. I&amp;#39;m not sure what&amp;#39;s wrong, but I trust my uncle to build it right, so I know it&amp;#39;s not the parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This &amp;quot;uncle&amp;quot; has never been a smart sounding dude, but okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Okay, well do you have Teamviewer?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Fd: That must be that horrible thing that $mutualfriend had me get. So yes.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Cool, I&amp;#39;ll take a look around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I do take a look around, and I even tried starting up some games in windowed mode to see if they&amp;#39;d run. Just like he said, there were few games that would run without glitches or crashing. After seeing some visible artifacting and a few explorer.exe crashes, I figured the problems included the graphics card (a GTX 750) and some software, too. Naturally (to me, at least), my next step was to check out the Nvidia drivers and see if I can update them. I go to open GeForce Experience- ...nothing. It&amp;#39;s not installed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Hey, $Fd, did your uncle install the drivers when he built your computer?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Fd: I don&amp;#39;t know what those are, but if it&amp;#39;s important then yes, he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sighs loudly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: I don&amp;#39;t think he installed the driver, that&amp;#39;s why it doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Fd: Well I don&amp;#39;t know if I trust you to actually install important stuff, you might mess it up. No offense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then why did you call me??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Okay, I won&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ll just poke around and see what I can do. We might have to restart, but I&amp;#39;ll run some diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those &amp;quot;diagnostics&amp;quot; were the driver installers, turns out he didn&amp;#39;t have any motherboard drivers, BIOS updates, etc. Thankfully, it worked after that, so I could get out of that situation reaaal quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2: &amp;quot;Can you do it for $1000?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a shorter story from a few days ago, but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue $Me, doing the same absolute nothing that she was months before in Story 1.

I don&amp;#39;t like wires, and my phone&amp;#39;s charging port is breaking.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: You have an iPhone 6, right? They don&amp;#39;t have wireless chargers for those.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want to have to explain to $Fd that the hardware isn&amp;#39;t in the phone, and that it&amp;#39;s not as easy as just throwing power at it.

They tend to break or not work, and regardless, it still plugs into your phone&amp;#39;s charging port. I think you need to get it fixed.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Fd: Well how do the Android phones do it?
