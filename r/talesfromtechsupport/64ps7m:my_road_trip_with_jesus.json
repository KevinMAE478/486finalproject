Also, me.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Jesus: buddy and intern at our IT department. Actually named Jesus. He&amp;#39;s fine with this.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd a number of overly suspicious staff members.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So roughly two weeks ago I get the task to check a lot of offices in my company for functional LAN-ports, since they were supposed to get IP-phones soon. Jesus and I get a list to process, make sure we look official (we are trainees, so the nameplate makes talking to all the older employees a bit easier) and get on our way.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow you should know that the company we work at is quite large and has a big campus, confusing basements and some corridors full of doors without a single goddamn nameplate. We were given a list that contained the phone number of every office, the name of the department and the name of the respective employee. Easy to find, piece of cake, right? How wrong we were.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe ended up walking to the closest department (the hairstylists) only to find out they didn&amp;#39;t open until an hour later. Jesus shrugged and we continued with the next thing on the list: The Customer Service Center (CSC).&lt;br/&gt;\nI crouched under the table, attempting to make sense out of the mess of cables and makeshift switch arrangements - while the female employee on her chair dealt with clueless customers. After carefully pushing cables out of the way, trying hard not to unplug the horrible setup (since they needed their PCs around the clock and any delay would cause trouble), I finally found the original Port. There was one free, so Jesus checked the CSC on the list while I drew a rough sketch for our boss so he could find the damned thing.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe continued this in a variety of circumstances, only to arrive at a meeting room where we were greeted by two employees.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: Good day, we are from tech support, just need to take a quick look at the LAN ports.&lt;br/&gt;\n$employee: But don&amp;#39;t break anything!&lt;br/&gt;\n$me, frowning: Of course not. We just need to check for the ports.&lt;br/&gt;\n$employee: Okay then. What for?&lt;br/&gt;\n$me: Management is planning on getting IP-phones and we need to know if the\u00fd can be installed here.&lt;br/&gt;\n$employee: But don&amp;#39;t unplug anything, we need that!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assure them that won&amp;#39;t happen and mark the port on the list. Jesus and I leave.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe were done with about half the list when another trainee ran up to us with a LAN tester.&lt;br/&gt;\nApparantly, our boss had decided he also wanted the ports checked. Which made sense, but would have been a lot easier if they told us BEFORE we ran a marathon around and through the main bulding. We asked him how to use it and he said we had to find the corresponding server for every port we wanted to check, but can&amp;#39;t tell us exactly how. Back to tech support base, then.&lt;br/&gt;\nFive minutes later several trainees are arguing about wether we just need to plug it into the port and start the check or actually need the servers for it - which would have been a pain in the arse to find since they are all in different locations. Thankfully, our boss drops in to tell us that all we need is a LAN cable and the tester, but we have to revisit the places we&amp;#39;ve been to already.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus wept and we continued our journey.&lt;br/&gt;\nI already frowned over the weird setups before, since I only ever saw one of the two plugged in. Checking the first office&amp;#39;s ports (which are always twin CAT6) I notice that only one of them is connected. Jesus notes that a switch will be necessary.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe next office has also only one of the two ports connected. We figured the guys who installed it must have been lazy and/or (likely and) incompetent, since it&amp;#39;s really not hard to connect both ports. In the bakery department we realize that all four twin boxes have only one port connected, which meant that it wasn&amp;#39;t because of a lack of cables, but intentionally. There were. Four twin CAT6 LAN port boxes. With only a single. Connected. Port. Each. All they had to do was to put a damn LAN splitter in. Why didn&amp;#39;t they? They had none. Did they request them? No. Why not? Because over ten years ago, someone oblivious to IT apparantly needed them cables done and hired people who did exactly that and nothing more. And now we have to deal with it.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut that wasn&amp;#39;t even the worst thing we discovered that day. In one specific office with newer tech, we were once again suspiciously watched by a female employee at her PC who told us &lt;em&gt;not to break anything.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Jesus, whispering: Who is she gonna call? Tech support?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did. She actually did. But that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;br/&gt;\nUnder her desk we discovered a twin CAT6 and a single port, the latter was connected to a switch with her PC, printer etc.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe asked her to save her stuff so we could unplug &amp;amp; check it, which we did.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe twin ports were...connected to each other by a short LAN cable.&lt;br/&gt;\nAt that point, I had a suspicion. In a company where I had my previous education, the network was quite old and the whole room was basically connected by a port connected to another port directly beside the door. When I had to leave there, I was always tempted to pull the plug. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me, thinking to myself: My god, could it be? Could someone actually have been THIS stupid?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. Of course they could.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe tested the ports and the cable turned out to be a network loop which we left exactly how we found it. We were not supposed to break anything, ater all.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhen we returned to the meeting room where we met the suspicious pair of employees, it was fortunately empty. Taking a look at the phone plus base station, I discovered the cable which ran behind the border. Unlike we originally thought, it didn&amp;#39;t connect to the twin port and switch on the opposite wall, but to a phone jack behind a curtain. The switch, however, had both twin ports connected with two cables to his 2 and 3, while the 1 was the out-cable - that was not even freaking connected to anything! Jesus and I just laughed before we realized that the &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t unplug it, we need that&amp;quot; from before was nothing but the distrust of the know-it-all employees. I fixed the switch by properly plugging it and we left for lunch.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we sat there, exhausted, Jesus checked his phone (he had a tracking app) and wordlessly showed it to me. We had run about 4 miles. By the end of the day, it felt like six.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Workmate named Jesus and I had to test the worst installment of LAN ports we have seen in our lives while walking 6 miles and dealing with suspicious employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First TFTS, hope I don't offend or stuff.\n\n**The Dramatis Personae:**  \n$me: IT-guy in training, new to tech support.
