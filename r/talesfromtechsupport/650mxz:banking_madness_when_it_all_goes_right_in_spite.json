To me, it&amp;#39;s important to give some character background for my coworkers in order to understand the team dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of you are desk techs. You may get hands on at your site, or travel to another site for certain repairs or maintenance, but at the end of the day, you go home to your significant other, or your pets, or your houseplants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This project was very different from that. You were on the road for days at a time. You shared car rides, meals, and hotel rooms with people you may have only met in the parking lot minutes before you went to Pittsburgh, or New Haven, or (God forbid) Rochester. If you didn&amp;#39;t get along with them, it could make for some uncomfortable car rides, and it definitely leaked into your work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made it a personal policy to get along with every one of my teammates, even if I didn&amp;#39;t like them. I leave out things like: my hour-long philosophical conversation with SDog about Ozzy Osbourne; or another hour-long conversation with BendR about the similarities in hardcore hip-hop and hardcore punk, and how they end up sounding the same; or a debate about how much better Robert Plant was with Led Zeppelin than he was as a solo artist with ZepFan... these are important to the team dynamic as much as how well we did our jobs, even if I don&amp;#39;t neccessarily find them story-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not everyone has this philosophy...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our New Snowflake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since ZepFan was unavailable for the following week, we got a new teammate for the next trip. No one knew the guy, or had heard anything about him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately, he texted everyone that he wanted to leave for the first site on Friday, because he had something Saturday night and Sunday that he &lt;strong&gt;could not miss&lt;/strong&gt;, and wanted to get a good night&amp;#39;s sleep before the Saturday site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog, uncharacteristically, agreed. To him, a day off was a sacred thing, and no one should interrupt it for work stuff... but the idea of a Sunday off (even if it cost us a day&amp;#39;s pay for just being a tourist) was too tempting. So, we all agreed to meet up on Friday evening to set forth to eastern PA for our Saturday conversion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got there, our new guy had already arrived, had the keys to the vehicles (a two-seat van for equipment, and a car for the other two techs), and had loaded his stuff in the passenger car, set up his phone for GPS and music, plugged in this monstrosity of an AC inverter into the cigarette lighter (which had only one working USB port, which he was using for his GPS) and was impatiently waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new guy: &amp;quot;Vape Bro&amp;quot; (VBro)... a big guy with a Type-A personality, but lacking the ambition that goes along with it. Complains about everything. Also, in case the name didn&amp;#39;t give it away, he vapes. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all met up, exchanged introductions, and paired up for the trip. Since both BendR and SDog smoked, they rode together so they could coordinate smoke stops (the company rented the vehicles, so they had a strict &amp;quot;NO SMOKING IN THE CARS&amp;quot; policy in place). That left me with the new guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took 5 minutes to adjust the seat, then complained he couldn&amp;#39;t get it far enough back to feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took another five minutes plugging in the address for the hotel. This was because he wanted to show off that he used Waze, and not Google Maps, because the latter was &amp;quot;for noobs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He then fired up Pandora, and set the station at &amp;quot;HIM plus some dull alternative crap.&amp;quot; When he asked me if I was okay with this (an hour into the trip), I just shrugged. He took that to mean &amp;quot;WHOA, THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME TELL ME MORE!&amp;quot; and gave me a comprehensive bio of this group that I cared nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He needed to step out right before we left to vape. That was another odyssey. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would crank the window down and vape as we drove, because there was no &amp;quot;NO VAPING IN THE VEHICLES&amp;quot; policy. I wish there was, as the formula this guy used (&amp;quot;I make my own, from a recipe I got on the internet. It&amp;#39;s cheaper!&amp;quot;) smelled like embalming fluid mixed with chemical warfare agents. I learned that, if VBro cranked his windoe down, I should do the same and stick my head out of the window, or fight nausea for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it could have been worse. I&amp;#39;m an ex-smoker, and like all ex-smokers, the smell of second-hand smoke is just horrible to me. Silver linings, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was worse, he would change batteries or refill his vape rig (a Frankensteinian monstrosity that was roughly the size of a baby&amp;#39;s head) while driving. He did this at the same time as he was reading Waze. and he adamantly refused to use my smartphone bracket. I tightened my seatbelt, made a comment or two about road safety...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;VBro: We&amp;#39;re fine. I do this all the time. What are you, a &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and prayed that we get to PA in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once there, we got into the hotel room, where I jumped into bed and fell asleep, and VBro got on his phone and texted his girlfriend for &amp;quot;a while&amp;quot; (he was vague about it when I woke him up for the conversion). As a result, I was able to get breakfast, while he was complaining about not having the time to get anything to eat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spent as little time doing anything for the conversion as he could get away with. While the rest of us were setting up multiple PCs, he was putzing around with a desktop on the platform side, sitting at the desk, &amp;quot;taking care of a software issue&amp;quot; (which I have no clue about, as we had never had any kind of conflict with the deployments we ran), and texting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We set forth for home as soon as the conversion was done. VBro insisted that we take the way Waze dragged us, which avoided anything resembling a highway until we got to NY; as a result, I saw parts of NJ for much longer than I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and that thing he absolutely couldn&amp;#39;t miss on Saturday and Sunday? Sleeping with his girlfriend. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion: We have replaced a personable and hard-working with his polar opposite in every conceivable way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, this was going to be a fun week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back To Connecticut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were scheduled to head to the New Haven part of CT for the rest of the week, so we all agreed to meet up at the shop around 9 AM to get our vehicles, load up our stuff, and begin the 3 hour drive to the &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; conversion of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to ride this time, so I made sure to get there a bit earlier, and set myself up as driver. I put up my smartphone mount, typed in the address in Google Maps (because I really don&amp;#39;t care which GPS I use, as long as it gets me from point A to point B), set up the seat, and was ready in 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was, VBro was late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, NY really hates texting and driving. It&amp;#39;s a 5 point hit on your license if you&amp;#39;re caught. Three of those, and your license is revoked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because VBro hated using smartphone mounts, he was holding his phone while driving, which the cop that pulled him over for it interpreted as texting, which got him a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, dear readers, is known as &amp;quot;poetic justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He managed to complain about the ticket all the way to CT, while saying nothing about the stream of classic rock from the radio app I was using.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;Perfect&amp;quot; Conversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will skip ahead two days, because this is the day that I have been leading up to all story long. This is when we finally got the stars to align in our favor, and momentarily became superstars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, we had all but given up on VBro. He was prone to disappearing for a half hour while he &amp;quot;ran stuff out to the van/dumpster&amp;quot; (vaped), would camp out at a PC to babysit (text his girlfriend), and complained when he was given any physical task harder than lifting a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the Monday branch, he was asked to help load a UPS (one of the 35-40 pound ones) onto a cart, roll said cart to the other end of the bank, and unload it in another room. All told, it was 3 minutes of work, barely any exertion, but somehow, this 6+ foot, 200-ish pound guy hurt his back and complained about it for the rest of the night, and all the next day, and that night...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ended up at some motel in The Middle of Nowhere, CT, with adjoining rooms. This allowed the other 3 guys to party (or, rather, SDog and BendR to party while VBro complained and played some Star Trek MMO) while I slept (I sleep like the dead, so they could have set off fireworks and I would never notice it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started as an ordinary Wednesday. I was up before everyone else, as usual, and snagged the keys to hit a local DD for some non-hotel coffee (seriously, big hotel chains... how do you screw up a beverage that even the crappiest convenience store makes adequately?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat out on the deck, drank my caffeine ration in peace, and read some Robert Jordan... book 0, I believe, as I had resolved to read the entire Wheel of Time by December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of peace, I took a quick shower, got my stuff packed, ran it to the car, and waited for everyone else to awaken... since checkout at this particular motel was noon, I waited quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last to roll out was VBro. According to BendR, he was still awake and active at 5 AM on his MMO. He complained about having to get up &amp;quot;early&amp;quot; (11:30 AM) while he packed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the way, we stopped at some diner with a Greek name, and were served by the hairiest man I have ever seen in a restaurant. It absolutely destroyed my appetite, and I had to resort to the emergency fruit snacks in my tool bag to get through the rest of the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The branch closed at 3 PM, so we rolled in at 1 PM on the dot, unpacked our equipment, and fell into our roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...or, rather, three of us did. VBro had to &amp;quot;use the facilities&amp;quot; for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a really small branch, with only one platform user and 4 tellers. Since only the platform PC needed patching at this point in the process, I just turned on teller PCs, got the VM up, then shut them down, solely so the Windows 7 configs could run once and save us time after they were staged. I left the platform to patch, and turned to SDog...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Hey, do you need me to babysit this? I can go help BendR set something up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: Yeah, go do the pinpads. I&amp;#39;ll go see what VBro is doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This location had 3 indoor teller stations, and each got a pinpad. I nodded, and set to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pinpads are interesting: They come in 3 pieces (the pinpad itself, a module that slides into the back of it, and a dongle that sits elsewhere that acts as an ethernet hub and USB connection to the PC). Basically, you run a cable that&amp;#39;s attached to the dongle through a grommet in the teller line and plug it into the module in the back of the pad; you plug a USB-plug-ended cable into an ethernet port on the dongle, which will plug into a USB port on the PC; after bank hours are done, you unplug the ethernet cable from the legacy PC, plug it into the dongle, then a short patch cable from the dongle to the new PC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All told, it should take 5-10 minutes per station, depending on how messy the cabling was. I watched VBro do one for 20 minutes once. It was painful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BendR got both secure printers set up. It&amp;#39;s about 20 minutes for both, as it&amp;#39;s just unpack them from boxes, set up detachable tray, drop printer on tray, plug in power, plug in ethernet, load paper, and test. It was too much work for VBro, as I never saw him do either of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were all set to switch over by 2 PM. At that point, VBro wandered out to vape, and BendR and SDog wandered out to smoke. When they all came in, I went across the street to get a quick snack and drink at the gas station to supplement my fruit snacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When 3 PM rolled around, we were ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...or, at least, 3 of us were ready, as VBro had wandered back outside to dump the printer boxes in the trash/vape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Unleashed The Kraken?!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took about 5 minutes for the tellers to balance, batch, and give us the go-ahead to set up the remaining PCs. The platform had already been placed, as the manger simply didn&amp;#39;t need it for anything that day; 2 of the tellers were similarly done. The remaining 2 were a matter of minutes, which we finished just as VBro got done &amp;quot;taking out the garbage&amp;quot; and knocked to get let in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BendR (mumbling to me): How convenient. How long do you think he was looking in the window, waiting for us to finish?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;d be amazed if he could see us through all of the vape clouds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BendR (laughing): Good point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog had gotten the all-clear to swap cables, which I got to see for the first time, as the network closet was literally in the lobby (albeit behind a locked door).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The BankB setup was a 48-port $Pancho switch. The BankA setup was a 48-port $Happy switch. Each BankB branch had an identical port setup, which was slightly different than the BankA setup, so you couldn&amp;#39;t simply move port 1 to port 1, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, BankB user ports were all over the place, so leftover cables (after ATM, router, printers, etc. were moved) could be in any port, while they were strictly 1-24 on BankA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I firmly believed at this point that lack of real standardization was one of BankB&amp;#39;s downfalls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, at about 3:45 PM, we got the sign to begin plugging the BankA PCs into the network and begin the scripts and downloads that would bring them online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This involved running a Powershell script (ZepFan and I opened one in Notepad once... it was surprisingly simple) to get them on the proper VPN, naming them in accordance with BankA&amp;#39;s naming convention, naming the VM according to BankB&amp;#39;s convention, setting a &amp;quot;self-destruct&amp;quot; that would wipe the VM on Day Zero (the permanent switchover to BankA, and the death of BankB), and confirming that this all worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, a software deployment would pop up, with whatever software was required (I forgot the particulars). We would stop, let all the PCs catch up at this point, then run this deployment all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a pair of restarts to get all the PCs in compliance, and let the GP updates take effect, we ran one simple script that should come back &amp;quot;ALL GREEN,&amp;quot; test BankB intranet, internet, print to teller, and print to platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For once, we ran through this with no snags. All PCs came back in the green, and we turned them over for UAT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VBro picked this point to head out for a vape, with BendR in tow for a smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog led the manager to her desk, while I rode herd over the two tellers we had been blessed with for testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first machine tested was always the one hooked up to the dot-matrix passbook/bank check printer. Because it added another serial cable to the mess already present on the PC, we referred to it as &amp;quot;the Kraken.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kraken was notoriously glitchy. About every third UAT, we had to spend 5-10 minutes getting the teller PC to actually communicate with the printer. Worse than that, it never too the same procedure twice to get it to work, so we never got a standardized method of resolving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This night, the Kraken chose to unleash. We hit that point in UAT, and hit the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn printer off and back on... nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unplug printer, plug it in, turn it on... nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right-click &amp;gt; driver update... nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, TellerLady, log off, and restart your PC. I want to try something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While she was doing this, I shut down and unplugged the dot-matrix, then waited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had her log back in, but stop before logging in to the BankB VM. At that point, I plugged in the printer, powered it on...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and had her log back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boom. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, TellerGuy, go ahead and begin testing that PC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As this was happening, VBro and BendR walked back in, and BendR was frowning. I heard later that VBro had let slip his secret about Sunday, and BendR played along by laughing... but he was clearly not happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VBro went in to the manager office to &amp;quot;help her test&amp;quot; (she was almost done), and BendR went over to SDog to &amp;quot;confer on where to stop for dinner&amp;quot; (pass on the dirty little secret).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not about 5:15. We are on the verge of greatness... the previous record is 5:30 PM, and we could be breaking it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UAT ends at 5:20... Bridge tech does some final checks... SDog has already gotten the signatures and is sending the fax before he even gets clearance...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and done. Official time, 5:25 PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are the new record holders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Damn...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: I know! (whispers) ...and we did it with 3 people, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t stop for dinner. No one wanted to be out any later on this trip, so we said our &amp;quot;see ya&amp;quot;s and headed out for home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting around doing nothing really took a toll on VBro, as he spent the entire trip asleep. I listened to some of my more aggressive tunes (after 2 days of HIM, it was pretty good to listen to some technical death metal and some sludge while doing 75 on I-91).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we got back, we simply split up, headed to our cars, and went our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, we got the new scedule: Pittsburgh, PA for 5 days and 4 conversions. In addition to keeping VBro, the schedulers have also assigned us a fifth man (since I didn&amp;#39;t know him at this point, I shall call him FNG).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately, despite the day off embargo on making plans, VBro is texting everyone about when we&amp;#39;re leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;VBro: I want to take my portable grill. We could grill some brats on our day off, have a picnic, drink some beers. It&amp;#39;s supposed to be nice on Sunday. (NOTE: It rained all that day.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FNG: That sounds cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: Sure. We could do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BendR: What time are we meeting up tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I went to bed, we were all meeting up at noon Friday to head out to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, only 4 of us were going...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: I looked in the pictures of Wednesday&amp;#39;s site, and I saw VBro vaping in the branch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VBro: I thought it was cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: It&amp;#39;s not. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m firing you from my team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(He can&amp;#39;t really do that. Can he?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;VBro: I thought we were cool, man!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDog: I only want people I can trust to do the job. I don&amp;#39;t trust you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VBro: Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There followed another 3 hours and 40+ texts of VBro and Sdog arguing about who was the bigger a-hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;VBro: I&amp;#39;m going to BigBoss tomorrow and getting reassigned to another team. Stop texting me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and 10 minutes later...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;FNG: So does that mean the picnic is off?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(WAY) &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite being a &amp;quot;man down,&amp;quot; we come off as rock stars, and team leader kicks the bad cog out of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(That story was a lot longer than I intended. Sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Setting**: One week after BankA tried to [DDoS](https://redd.it/64of5w) our branch.\n\n**An Aside About My Story Writing Process**\n\nIf all you really want from this installment is the technical aspect of it, please, by all means, jump ahead to \"**The 'Perfect' Conversion**.\"\n\nI realize that I add a lot of \"fluff\" to these stories. To me, it's important to give some character background for my coworkers in order to understand the team dynamics.\n\nA lot of you are desk techs. You may get hands on at your site, or travel to another site for certain repairs or maintenance, but at the end of the day, you go home to your significant other, or your pets, or your houseplants.\n\nThis project was very different from that. You were on the road for days at a time. You shared car rides, meals, and hotel rooms with people you may have only met in the parking lot minutes before you went to Pittsburgh, or New Haven, or (God forbid) Rochester. If you didn't get along with them, it could make for some uncomfortable car rides, and it definitely leaked into your work.\n\nI made it a personal policy to get along with every one of my teammates, even if I didn't like them. I leave out things like: my hour-long philosophical conversation with SDog about Ozzy Osbourne; or another hour-long conversation with BendR about the similarities in hardcore hip-hop and hardcore punk, and how they end up sounding the same; or a debate about how much better Robert Plant was with Led Zeppelin than he was as a solo artist with ZepFan... these are important to the team dynamic as much as how well we did our jobs, even if I don't neccessarily find them story-worthy.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone has this philosophy...\n\n**Our New Snowflake**\n\nSince ZepFan was unavailable for the following week, we got a new teammate for the next trip. No one knew the guy, or had heard anything about him.\n\nImmediately, he texted everyone that he wanted to leave for the first site on Friday, because he had something Saturday night and Sunday that he **could not miss**, and wanted to get a good night's sleep before the Saturday site.\n\nSDog, uncharacteristically, agreed. To him, a day off was a sacred thing, and no one should interrupt it for work stuff... but the idea of a Sunday off (even if it cost us a day's pay for just being a tourist) was too tempting. So, we all agreed to meet up on Friday evening to set forth to eastern PA for our Saturday conversion.\n\nWhen I got there, our new guy had already arrived, had the keys to the vehicles (a two-seat van for equipment, and a car for the other two techs), and had loaded his stuff in the passenger car, set up his phone for GPS and music, plugged in this monstrosity of an AC inverter into the cigarette lighter (which had only one working USB port, which he was using for his GPS) and was impatiently waiting.\n\nThe new guy: \"Vape Bro\" (VBro)... a big guy with a Type-A personality, but lacking the ambition that goes along with it. Complains about everything. Also, in case the name didn't give it away, he vapes. A lot.\n\nWe all met up, exchanged introductions, and paired up for the trip. Since both BendR and SDog smoked, they rode together so they could coordinate smoke stops (the company rented the vehicles, so they had a strict \"NO SMOKING IN THE CARS\" policy in place). That left me with the new guy.\n\nYay.\n\nHe took 5 minutes to adjust the seat, then complained he couldn't get it far enough back to feel comfortable.\n\nHe took another five minutes plugging in the address for the hotel. This was because he wanted to show off that he used Waze, and not Google Maps, because the latter was \"for noobs.\"\n\nHe then fired up Pandora, and set the station at \"HIM plus some dull alternative crap.\" When he asked me if I was okay with this (an hour into the trip), I just shrugged. He took that to mean \"WHOA, THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME TELL ME MORE!\" and gave me a comprehensive bio of this group that I cared nothing about.\n\nHe needed to step out right before we left to vape. That was another odyssey. \n\nHe would crank the window down and vape as we drove, because there was no \"NO VAPING IN THE VEHICLES\" policy. I wish there was, as the formula this guy used (\"I make my own, from a recipe I got on the internet. It's cheaper!\") smelled like embalming fluid mixed with chemical warfare agents. I learned that, if VBro cranked his windoe down, I should do the same and stick my head out of the window, or fight nausea for 10 minutes.\n\nI guess it could have been worse. I'm an ex-smoker, and like all ex-smokers, the smell of second-hand smoke is just horrible to me. Silver linings, right?\n\nWhat was worse, he would change batteries or refill his vape rig (a Frankensteinian monstrosity that was roughly the size of a baby's head) while driving. He did this at the same time as he was reading Waze. and he adamantly refused to use my smartphone bracket. I tightened my seatbelt, made a comment or two about road safety...\n\n&gt;VBro: We're fine. I do this all the time. What are you, a &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;?\n\n...and prayed that we get to PA in one piece.\n\nOnce there, we got into the hotel room, where I jumped into bed and fell asleep, and VBro got on his phone and texted his girlfriend for \"a while\" (he was vague about it when I woke him up for the conversion). As a result, I was able to get breakfast, while he was complaining about not having the time to get anything to eat.\n\nHe spent as little time doing anything for the conversion as he could get away with. While the rest of us were setting up multiple PCs, he was putzing around with a desktop on the platform side, sitting at the desk, \"taking care of a software issue\" (which I have no clue about, as we had never had any kind of conflict with the deployments we ran), and texting.\n\nWe set forth for home as soon as the conversion was done. VBro insisted that we take the way Waze dragged us, which avoided anything resembling a highway until we got to NY; as a result, I saw parts of NJ for much longer than I wanted to.\n\nOh, and that thing he absolutely couldn't miss on Saturday and Sunday? Sleeping with his girlfriend. Seriously.\n\nSo, in conclusion: We have replaced a personable and hard-working with his polar opposite in every conceivable way.\n\nOh, this was going to be a fun week.\n\n**Back To Connecticut**\n\nWe were scheduled to head to the New Haven part of CT for the rest of the week, so we all agreed to meet up at the shop around 9 AM to get our vehicles, load up our stuff, and begin the 3 hour drive to the \"first\" conversion of the week.\n\nI decided that I wasn't going to ride this time, so I made sure to get there a bit earlier, and set myself up as driver. I put up my smartphone mount, typed in the address in Google Maps (because I really don't care which GPS I use, as long as it gets me from point A to point B), set up the seat, and was ready in 4 minutes.\n\nThe problem was, VBro was late.\n\nSee, NY really hates texting and driving. It's a 5 point hit on your license if you're caught. Three of those, and your license is revoked.\n\nBecause VBro hated using smartphone mounts, he was holding his phone while driving, which the cop that pulled him over for it interpreted as texting, which got him a ticket.\n\nThis, dear readers, is known as \"poetic justice.\"\n\nHe managed to complain about the ticket all the way to CT, while saying nothing about the stream of classic rock from the radio app I was using.\n\n**The \"Perfect\" Conversion**\n\nI will skip ahead two days, because this is the day that I have been leading up to all story long. This is when we finally got the stars to align in our favor, and momentarily became superstars.\n\nAt this point, we had all but given up on VBro. He was prone to disappearing for a half hour while he \"ran stuff out to the van/dumpster\" (vaped), would camp out at a PC to babysit (text his girlfriend), and complained when he was given any physical task harder than lifting a piece of paper.\n\nAt the Monday branch, he was asked to help load a UPS (one of the 35-40 pound ones) onto a cart, roll said cart to the other end of the bank, and unload it in another room. All told, it was 3 minutes of work, barely any exertion, but somehow, this 6+ foot, 200-ish pound guy hurt his back and complained about it for the rest of the night, and all the next day, and that night...\n\nWe ended up at some motel in The Middle of Nowhere, CT, with adjoining rooms. This allowed the other 3 guys to party (or, rather, SDog and BendR to party while VBro complained and played some Star Trek MMO) while I slept (I sleep like the dead, so they could have set off fireworks and I would never notice it).\n\nIt started as an ordinary Wednesday. I was up before everyone else, as usual, and snagged the keys to hit a local DD for some non-hotel coffee (seriously, big hotel chains... how do you screw up a beverage that even the crappiest convenience store makes adequately?).\n\nI sat out on the deck, drank my caffeine ration in peace, and read some Robert Jordan... book 0, I believe, as I had resolved to read the entire Wheel of Time by December 2017.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of peace, I took a quick shower, got my stuff packed, ran it to the car, and waited for everyone else to awaken... since checkout at this particular motel was noon, I waited quite a while.\n\nThe last to roll out was VBro. According to BendR, he was still awake and active at 5 AM on his MMO. He complained about having to get up \"early\" (11:30 AM) while he packed.\n\nOn the way, we stopped at some diner with a Greek name, and were served by the hairiest man I have ever seen in a restaurant. It absolutely destroyed my appetite, and I had to resort to the emergency fruit snacks in my tool bag to get through the rest of the afternoon.\n\nThe branch closed at 3 PM, so we rolled in at 1 PM on the dot, unpacked our equipment, and fell into our roles.\n\n...or, rather, three of us did. VBro had to \"use the facilities\" for an hour.\n\nIt was a really small branch, with only one platform user and 4 tellers. Since only the platform PC needed patching at this point in the process, I just turned on teller PCs, got the VM up, then shut them down, solely so the Windows 7 configs could run once and save us time after they were staged. I left the platform to patch, and turned to SDog...\n\n&gt;Me: Hey, do you need me to babysit this? I can go help BendR set something up.\n\n&gt;SDog: Yeah, go do the pinpads. I'll go see what VBro is doing.\n\nThis location had 3 indoor teller stations, and each got a pinpad. I nodded, and set to work.\n\nPinpads are interesting: They come in 3 pieces (the pinpad itself, a module that slides into the back of it, and a dongle that sits elsewhere that acts as an ethernet hub and USB connection to the PC). Basically, you run a cable that's attached to the dongle through a grommet in the teller line and plug it into the module in the back of the pad; you plug a USB-plug-ended cable into an ethernet port on the dongle, which will plug into a USB port on the PC; after bank hours are done, you unplug the ethernet cable from the legacy PC, plug it into the dongle, then a short patch cable from the dongle to the new PC.\n\nAll told, it should take 5-10 minutes per station, depending on how messy the cabling was. I watched VBro do one for 20 minutes once. It was painful.\n\nBendR got both secure printers set up. It's about 20 minutes for both, as it's just unpack them from boxes, set up detachable tray, drop printer on tray, plug in power, plug in ethernet, load paper, and test. It was too much work for VBro, as I never saw him do either of them.\n\nWe were all set to switch over by 2 PM. At that point, VBro wandered out to vape, and BendR and SDog wandered out to smoke. When they all came in, I went across the street to get a quick snack and drink at the gas station to supplement my fruit snacks.\n\nWhen 3 PM rolled around, we were ready.\n\n...or, at least, 3 of us were ready, as VBro had wandered back outside to dump the printer boxes in the trash/vape.\n\n**Who Unleashed The Kraken?!?**\n\nIt took about 5 minutes for the tellers to balance, batch, and give us the go-ahead to set up the remaining PCs. The platform had already been placed, as the manger simply didn't need it for anything that day; 2 of the tellers were similarly done. The remaining 2 were a matter of minutes, which we finished just as VBro got done \"taking out the garbage\" and knocked to get let in.\n\n&gt;BendR (mumbling to me): How convenient. How long do you think he was looking in the window, waiting for us to finish?\n\n&gt;Me: I'd be amazed if he could see us through all of the vape clouds.\n\n&gt;BendR (laughing): Good point.\n\nSDog had gotten the all-clear to swap cables, which I got to see for the first time, as the network closet was literally in the lobby (albeit behind a locked door).\n\nThe BankB setup was a 48-port $Pancho switch. The BankA setup was a 48-port $Happy switch. Each BankB branch had an identical port setup, which was slightly different than the BankA setup, so you couldn't simply move port 1 to port 1, and so on.\n\nOn top of that, BankB user ports were all over the place, so leftover cables (after ATM, router, printers, etc. were moved) could be in any port, while they were strictly 1-24 on BankA.\n\nI firmly believed at this point that lack of real standardization was one of BankB's downfalls.\n\nFinally, at about 3:45 PM, we got the sign to begin plugging the BankA PCs into the network and begin the scripts and downloads that would bring them online.\n\nThis involved running a Powershell script (ZepFan and I opened one in Notepad once... it was surprisingly simple) to get them on the proper VPN, naming them in accordance with BankA's naming convention, naming the VM according to BankB's convention, setting a \"self-destruct\" that would wipe the VM on Day Zero (the permanent switchover to BankA, and the death of BankB), and confirming that this all worked.\n\nNext, a software deployment would pop up, with whatever software was required (I forgot the particulars). We would stop, let all the PCs catch up at this point, then run this deployment all at once.\n\nAfter a pair of restarts to get all the PCs in compliance, and let the GP updates take effect, we ran one simple script that should come back \"ALL GREEN,\" test BankB intranet, internet, print to teller, and print to platform.\n\nFor once, we ran through this with no snags. All PCs came back in the green, and we turned them over for UAT.\n\nVBro picked this point to head out for a vape, with BendR in tow for a smoke.\n\nSDog led the manager to her desk, while I rode herd over the two tellers we had been blessed with for testing.\n\nThe first machine tested was always the one hooked up to the dot-matrix passbook/bank check printer. Because it added another serial cable to the mess already present on the PC, we referred to it as \"the Kraken.\"\n\nThe Kraken was notoriously glitchy. About every third UAT, we had to spend 5-10 minutes getting the teller PC to actually communicate with the printer. Worse than that, it never too the same procedure twice to get it to work, so we never got a standardized method of resolving the issue.\n\nThis night, the Kraken chose to unleash. We hit that point in UAT, and hit the wall.\n\nTurn printer off and back on... nope.\n\nUnplug printer, plug it in, turn it on... nope.\n\nRight-click &gt; driver update... nope.\n\nFinally...\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, TellerLady, log off, and restart your PC. I want to try something.\n\nWhile she was doing this, I shut down and unplugged the dot-matrix, then waited.\n\nI had her log back in, but stop before logging in to the BankB VM. At that point, I plugged in the printer, powered it on...\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, now.\n\n...and had her log back in.\n\nBoom. It worked.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, TellerGuy, go ahead and begin testing that PC.\n\nAs this was happening, VBro and BendR walked back in, and BendR was frowning. I heard later that VBro had let slip his secret about Sunday, and BendR played along by laughing... but he was clearly not happy.\n\nVBro went in to the manager office to \"help her test\" (she was almost done), and BendR went over to SDog to \"confer on where to stop for dinner\" (pass on the dirty little secret).\n\nIt's not about 5:15. We are on the verge of greatness... the previous record is 5:30 PM, and we could be breaking it now.\n\nUAT ends at 5:20... Bridge tech does some final checks... SDog has already gotten the signatures and is sending the fax before he even gets clearance...\n\n...and done. Official time, 5:25 PM.\n\nWe are the new record holders.\n\n&gt;Me: Damn...\n\n&gt;SDog: I know! (whispers) ...and we did it with 3 people, too.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nWe didn't stop for dinner. No one wanted to be out any later on this trip, so we said our \"see ya\"s and headed out for home.\n\nSitting around doing nothing really took a toll on VBro, as he spent the entire trip asleep. I listened to some of my more aggressive tunes (after 2 days of HIM, it was pretty good to listen to some technical death metal and some sludge while doing 75 on I-91).\n\nWhen we got back, we simply split up, headed to our cars, and went our separate ways.\n\nThe next day, we got the new scedule: Pittsburgh, PA for 5 days and 4 conversions. In addition to keeping VBro, the schedulers have also assigned us a fifth man (since I didn't know him at this point, I shall call him FNG).\n\nImmediately, despite the day off embargo on making plans, VBro is texting everyone about when we're leaving.\n\n&gt;VBro: I want to take my portable grill. We could grill some brats on our day off, have a picnic, drink some beers. It's supposed to be nice on Sunday. (NOTE: It rained all that day.)\n\n&gt;FNG: That sounds cool.\n\n&gt;SDog: Sure. We could do that.\n\n&gt;BendR: What time are we meeting up tomorrow?\n\nWhen I went to bed, we were all meeting up at noon Friday to head out to Pittsburgh.\n\nWhen I woke up, only 4 of us were going...\n\n&gt;SDog: I looked in the pictures of Wednesday's site, and I saw VBro vaping in the branch.\n\n&gt;VBro: I thought it was cool.\n\n&gt;SDog: It's not. That's why I'm firing you from my team.\n\n(He can't really do that. Can he?)\n\n&gt;VBro: I thought we were cool, man!\n\n&gt;SDog: I only want people I can trust to do the job. I don't trust you.\n\n&gt;VBro: Whatever.\n\nThere followed another 3 hours and 40+ texts of VBro and Sdog arguing about who was the bigger a-hole.\n\nFinally:\n\n&gt;VBro: I'm going to BigBoss tomorrow and getting reassigned to another team. Stop texting me.\n\n...and 10 minutes later...\n\n&gt;FNG: So does that mean the picnic is off?\n\n(WAY) **TL;DR**: Despite being a \"man down,\" we come off as rock stars, and team leader kicks the bad cog out of the machine.\n\n(That story was a lot longer than I intended.
