I&amp;#39;d done it plenty of times before, so naturally I was confident that this job would be a cakewalk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fate, it seemed, had other plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I arrived on site and was promptly greeted by a short woman. Mid-20s, dark-skinned, Indian accent, reasonably attractive, but very - uh, what&amp;#39;s the PC term? - &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;self-confident&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Obvious leadership abilities,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I think was another way to put it.&lt;br/&gt;\nFrom the way she spoke to the other employees there, I assume she was at least the shift supervisor - or at least, everyone else let her act like she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Hi, I&amp;#39;m Gambatte from &lt;em&gt;{company}&lt;/em&gt;. I understand you&amp;#39;re having problems with a &lt;em&gt;{unit}&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em&gt;{place}&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;{computer}&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em&gt;{other place}&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shift Supervisor (SS): NO! I already fixed that!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Uh, okay. Can you show me what you mean by &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walked the short distance - as in, less than ten meters - to the unit&amp;#39;s install location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SS: SEE! It&amp;#39;s working!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Great! How did you get it working?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SS: I swapped it with the &lt;em&gt;{same model unit}&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;{other location}&lt;/em&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Okay... Have you tested it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SS: YES! IT WORKS!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Huh... By all rights, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be: the unit is paired to the computer in at least two different ways - you CAN&amp;#39;T just move them around like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SS: WELL IT WORKS, SEE?!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that, she punched in the test command, and sure enough, after a few seconds, the unit produced the indications normally associated with completing a successful test - including a print out, which she angrily thrust in my direction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No point escalating the situation,&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;Anything more I say will clearly be taken as me trying to prove her wrong. I will test it ALL before I leave, though - if she gets angry about it, I can always fall back on the ticket, and say I have to confirm the ticket can be closed.&lt;/em&gt; Prayers of thanks may also have been silently uttered to one or more of the Many Gods of CYA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Okay, well... I&amp;#39;ll replace the faulty unit at &lt;em&gt;{other location}&lt;/em&gt;, and then get started on fixing the &lt;em&gt;{computer}&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SS: IT&amp;#39;S RIGHT HERE!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swear, she got louder with every interaction. I replaced the unit, plugged in the appropriate unit ID for the location, and let the configuration download run while I got started on the computer. Fortunately, as re-imaging the computer required that I crawled under a dark and dusty cabinet, SS soon found a reason to leave me to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t take long for me to discover that the computer&amp;#39;s UPS was non-functional, which was the actual root cause of the issue that the computer had been experiencing. I reported this to the client IT department, who requested that I re-image the computer anyway.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Well, it&amp;#39;s their money,&lt;/em&gt; I thought as I shrugged and carried on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The re-imaging process involved applying an image from Symantec (or possibly Norton, I forget) Ghost from a BartPE boot USB, which takes roughly one (1) eternity to load. However, I happened to have with me a WinPE boot USB, so thinking I might save some time, I booted from WinPE instead.&lt;br/&gt;\nRoughly one (1) eternity later, WinPE finished loading - it appears that the long loading times have more to do with the horribly under-powered hardware than with the specific pre-installation environment being loaded. But after a moment or three, I was able to run the &lt;code&gt;ghost32.exe&lt;/code&gt; from the second USB, and promptly started applying the image to the local disk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While that was running, I wandered back over to the &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; unit. On a hunch, I pulled up the configuration menu - and promptly discovered that the unit was still configured for the other location. And that&amp;#39;s when it hit me - the units are connected to the network; quite literally a standard LAN connection. The control unit that SS ran the test from was configured with the static IP of the local unit... So even though she&amp;#39;d taken that unit away (so it was no longer local), as long as it was still connected to the network, the test would pass. The only indication during the test that it was not running on the local unit would be a short-lived message wouldn&amp;#39;t display - it would appear on the unit &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being tested, some distance away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked on the progress of the computer. Ghost was only at 20%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I entered the ID number for that location, and initiated a configuration download for the unit - hoping desperately that it would work. See, initiating a configuration download causes the unit to download everything - static IP configuration, primary/secondary server configuration - pretty much any and every configurable item; and all of it tied to the unit ID.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there were two units on the network with the same ID. So there should be two units with identical IP addresses.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m sure I don&amp;#39;t need to tell most TFTS readers how reliable network connectivity is when the same IP address appears multiple times on the local network.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the download finished and the unit restarted, the final step in applying it&amp;#39;s new configuration. I performed the final step on both newly configured units (triggering a public key injection so all unit communications are properly encrypted), ran the test - confirming that the local unit DID actually show the correct message - and then went back to check on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ghost showed the progress was at 70%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I tracked down the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; manager - a tall, thin, middle-aged gentleman; similar enough in appearance to SS that they may have been related (which would explain a lot, really) - and let him know what I&amp;#39;d done, what remained to be done, and what he would personally be required to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Also, before I leave, I should mention that SS tried to swap around &lt;em&gt;{units}&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;{locations}&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s good that she wanted to try to fix or at least alleviate the issue, but it just doesn&amp;#39;t work like that - &lt;em&gt;{units}&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;#39;t be swapped between locations without completely reconfiguring them. I have done that, so all locations are currently functioning correctly - but there would have been a world of pain and confusion if anyone had tried to use them after she rearranged them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actual Manager: I see. Did you tell her that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever so briefly, I flashed back to her angrily yelling &amp;quot;LOOK, IT WORKS!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ME: I tried.

Which is to say, I beat a tactical retreat; a fighting withdrawal, if you will. The reality of the situation is that it was already mid-afternoon, I had at least another five hours of work + driving to get home.&lt;br/&gt;\nAt least driving home on a pleasantly sunny afternoon is a nice way to earn time and a half.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "&gt; This should be simple.\n\nFamous last words.\n\n---\n\nThe job was a simple one: attend site, re-image a computer, replace a faulty unit, bug out.
