My experience with tech support was a single summer job doing call-center tech support for an Alarm Company. That was years ago, though, and do my memory of things isn&amp;#39;t super clear... But this one is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Residential and small businesses security alarms come in two main varieties: hardwired and wireless, with the differences being pretty pervasive. Older systems have all sensors directly wired to the control panel, usually a bare-bones consumer version of a Honeywell commercial system, and require a connection to a landline phone system. Newer systems use a radio system to connect to sensors and use a sim card to connect with cell towers, and are usually manufactured by GE, with customization for different vendors. This very different architecture means that\u200b most systems get wholesale swapped out when the customer wants to upgrade... But system integrations can be done, with the old wired system hooked up to a new control panel. It&amp;#39;s a hassle, so no one likes to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of architecture, all systems have batteries for backup power. In wired systems\u200b, it&amp;#39;s in the system junction box, which looks like a standard wall-mounted steel utility box. In wireless systems, it&amp;#39;s part of the control panel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boobleoobleoop. Boobleoobleoop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The phone rings it&amp;#39;s customary 10 second warning before auto-answering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, this is Krasini with $compa-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Help me! I&amp;#39;m going crazy! The fire alarms won&amp;#39;t stop going off, but there&amp;#39;s\u200b no fire! It&amp;#39;s been hours, please make it stop!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok. First I need your name and the make and model of the system...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We go through the usual pleasantries and I get the information I need. The caller isn&amp;#39;t actually panicked, despite having cut me off. It&amp;#39;s an older gentleman and really quite reasonable and down-to-earth now that he&amp;#39;s stepped outside the house and is finally off hold, speaking to a tech. He tells me that it&amp;#39;s a new GE system and that the fire alarms have been going off sporadically since a storm blew over the previous night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hurricane season. I&amp;#39;m in the West, so I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with it, but it&amp;#39;s That Time of Year in Florida, where the company is based and most of the customers are. No hurricanes in this story, but it&amp;#39;s stormy, so these sorts of calls are pretty common right now. Should be a cinch to get fixed. Time to troubleshoot and take care of this. Should be quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First step: go to the control panel and tell me which &amp;#39;zone&amp;#39; is the source of the alarm. In most residential installations, there&amp;#39;s only one sensor per zone, so that makes it easy. No such luck here. He&amp;#39;s got 8 zones, poorly and confusingly labelled and with multiple sensors per zone. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have him turn down the volume so we don&amp;#39;t both go deaf. Now it&amp;#39;s time to traipse all over the house and figure out which zone is which and which fire alarm is the issue. It quickly becomes apparent that All the fire alarms are going bonkers - not just one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting a little suspicious now. This kind of setup, with multiple sensors to a zone and multiple alarms freaking out all at once, is much more typical of a wired system than the wireless one he told me he had, but oh well. These systems do funny stuff sometimes and so do our install techs. I question him a bit more about the situation. Turns out that a lightning strike blew up one of the trees near the house and the surge had blown a few light bulbs and fried the TV. These fire alarms are crazy finicky, so a blast and surge like that could conceivably have knocked them out of whack, even if they aren&amp;#39;t hard-wired. Still a little odd, but possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second step: troubleshoot the bothersome bit of equipment. These are ceiling-mounted fire alarms, so that shouldn&amp;#39;t be hard. I have him silence the alarm and double-check the make and model of the system for me. Then I ask him to take one down and describe its condition to me - while I ask the sorts of details I need to figure it out. This shouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue... Wireless system, so the smoke detector isn&amp;#39;t much different than the cheap model you can get at the hardware store. If all else fails, we can pull the battery until we can ship him a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#39;s an issue. He wrestles with it for 15 minutes while I listen to him and try to help out. Nothing seems amiss, yet, aside from his seeming inability to get a smoke detector out of the bracket it should be designed to come out of easily. Somehow, he&amp;#39;s still chill. Most customers would be ballistic after the first couple suggestions failed to resolve the issue, and even fewer are ok with wrestling a smoke detector for 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, he gets it down. We inspect the bits that could be messed up and find they are doing\u200b ok. Then I ask him to do a power-cycle - pull out the batteries, let the capacitors drain flat, then stick the batteries back in. He can&amp;#39;t find the battery compartment. It isn&amp;#39;t until he&amp;#39;s been inspecting every crevice of it for me that he mentions the wires and the hole in the ceiling...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they are, in fact, wired smoke detectors after all. He&amp;#39;d bought the house with an old system that had changed hands and service providers many times. I hadn&amp;#39;t been able to figure out the smoke detectors because they were seriously old, from an equipment manufacturer that&amp;#39;s been out of business for decades. I asked the customer why he hadn&amp;#39;t told me that before when I&amp;#39;d asked... He told me it was because he hadn&amp;#39;t really known either. It was an integrated system with several layers of various brands of older wired components hooked up to the wireless system control panel, which was all he&amp;#39;d considered important when I&amp;#39;d asked...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been more than an hour now. I&amp;#39;m ready to be done with this call, he&amp;#39;s ready to be done with this call, now he&amp;#39;s got a hole in his ceiling, and the alarm has started going off again. Since I&amp;#39;d told him to take it down and we&amp;#39;re both feeling Done by this point, I tell him we&amp;#39;ll comp an on-site service tech visit and for now, we&amp;#39;ll just take the annoying zone off the system so it&amp;#39;ll shut up. The customer is happy to take us up on that, so I set him on his way to the control panel so I can walk him though the zone deletion process while I open up the scheduler. We get the tech scheduled\u200b, and I help him delete the zone and shut off the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re winding up the call, finishing the schedule, and so on. Just as I&amp;#39;m about to end the call... The alarm goes off again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run back to the control panel! Nothing. The control panel shows no alarms at all and no faults\u200b or errors, either. Now, we&amp;#39;re getting a little annoyed. What on earth could be the matter?!? With the alarm going off, even with the sensors physically\u200b pulled off the network, their zone removed from monitoring, and the system showing no alarm state, it just didn&amp;#39;t make any sense. Clearly, there&amp;#39;s something wrong with the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have him silence the alarm again, unmount the control panel from its bracket, and pull out the plug and the battery for a complete power cycle. We do this, then put it all back together and it boots up as normal. And the alarm goes off again, with no alarm state displayed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m in fk it mode, the customer is in fk it mode. We decide that scorched earth is the best approach until the tech gets out there. We&amp;#39;re going to shut the whole thing down and have the tech replace as many damaged sensors as needed and replace the control panel, too. I have him pull it off the wall again, remove the battery and unplug it after silencing it. This time, it&amp;#39;s going to stay that way until the tech gets here, and I&amp;#39;m going\u200b to try to get the logistics guys to bump up the appointment I&amp;#39;d set up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I&amp;#39;m ending the call again, just about to hang up again, when the bldy alarm goes off again. There should be no way that this is possible. It&amp;#39;s been disassembled pretty completely. There&amp;#39;s literally only one other possible problem that could be causing this, and that&amp;#39;s only if the system integration had been done half-assed. Could be there&amp;#39;s still an old control panel from the system that had been replaced that&amp;#39;s somehow still connected to a sensor, and it&amp;#39;s throwing a fit. The customer is crying now, he doesn&amp;#39;t know of any such old control panel, and we don&amp;#39;t find one as I have him look around the house in closets and odd corners and describe what to look for. An ancient panel shows up in a hall closet and the customer destroys it with abandon... And the alarm just keeps ringing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to wreck it, now. Let&amp;#39;s go to the garage and find the old control box, if there still is one, and rip out the circuit board if we need to. There shouldn&amp;#39;t be one... All the wiring should have been rerouted to the new panel during system integration, so the box should be empty. This shouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary... The customer tries to pull open the door. It&amp;#39;s hot. He uses work gloves and gets a massive lung full of magic smoke...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a fire. A slow smouldering fire. There was a big backup lead-acid battery with my company&amp;#39;s name on it sitting in that old box that should have been empty, powering the old wired sensors. It was an internal temperature based fire alarm system on the old circuit board that was going off. The customer got the battery disconnected and removed\u200b from the building and we laughed about it together... And I promised him a comped replacement system when his free tech visit occurs...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The fire was us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Ok, so I never did IT, not a programmer or anything like that, and so on.
