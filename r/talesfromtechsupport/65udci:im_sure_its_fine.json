You know the kind, the one that never bothers to learn anything about computers because, hey!  They got YOU for that!  And then when they ask for your advice and/or help, they cheerfully ignore said advice and/or help and then whine when it inevitably blows up in their face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my DoD has one of those off the shelf Windows 8 (well now, Windows 10 after he SOMEHOW managed to screw it up so bad...) computers that his now ex-girlfriend bought him at Walmart after his old off the shelf Vista computer died a couple of years ago.  (Which is a tale unto itself, believe me.)  He plugs it into one of those power strip/surge protector/UPS Thingies that provide just enough power in the event of an outage to keep a single PC running just long enough to do a normal shutdown.  Nothing fancy.   He also plugs his monitor, a desk lamp, and our modem/wifi router into it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a few months after he gets this computer, a vicious little thunderstorm rolls through our small neighborhood.  There is nothing around us for two or three miles in any direction, but normally the receiving tower for the local satellite ISP takes the direct hits.  Still, in the name of caution (and because electronics are pricey) I&amp;#39;ve already unplugged my gaming rig, PS3, and other electronics to be on the safe side.  My DoD, fully expecting that a small surge protector is going to protect his computer from a direct hit, does not, and continues to browse the internet as the storm rolls overhead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly &lt;strong&gt;BOOM!&lt;/strong&gt; our neighborhood power grid takes a direct lightning strike.  The lights in the house go out, there is a deafening roar of thunder that rattles the pictures on the walls, and then the lights come back on.  Nobody was hurt, and amazingly nothing blew up or ignited.  We did have to call our ISP to replace our modem/router the next day though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as he waits for the modem/router to come back online, DoD mentions that he heard a loud &lt;em&gt;beep!&lt;/em&gt; from the surge protector Thingy under his desk, meaning it had been a champ and taken one for the team, saving his computer.  It&amp;#39;s still working, but I advice him that it&amp;#39;s best to replace it, since the surge could have damaged it, and I&amp;#39;m not keen on the idea of a potential fire hazard lurking under his desk.  DoD then utters the dreaded words:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DoD:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s fine!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tell him again, that I don&amp;#39;t care if it still works, it took a hit, it needs to be replaced.  He refuses, and keeps right on using it.  Now fast forward a few months.  Our internet is acting up, and I pop under his desk while he&amp;#39;s away at work to reset the router.  As I&amp;#39;m doing so, I happen to look at the Thingy and see that it&amp;#39;s got a blinking red light that indicates a fault somewhere within.  When he gets home, I tell him again to replace it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DoD:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s fine!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that this guy used to be a &lt;em&gt;firefighter?&lt;/em&gt;  So fast forward again to just the other day.  He&amp;#39;s still using the Thingy, and then one day he drags me over to his desk as soon as I get home from work, saying his computer died.  Normally, after work, all I want to do is chill on my own computer for a bit, play some games, watch some vids, and listen to some music before having supper and dragging my ass to bed.  But him saying his computer died diverts my attention instantly.  I do NOT want this man to go without a computer.  I do NOT want him to try and use mine.  My computers are password locked to keep him off after he fried the battery of a previous laptop by using it without permission while I was at work and plugging the charger into the computer, but not the wall.  He couldn&amp;#39;t understand why I was so furious.  It was only a $120 battery after all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I swallow the annoyed sigh and ask him what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DoD:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a loud &lt;em&gt;pop!&lt;/em&gt;, the monitor went black, and the computer shut off. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I pull the tower out of its little cubby, turn it on, and hear the fans coming on.  Okay, so it&amp;#39;s not completely dead, but the monitor is not doing anything.  No picture, no lights, nothing.  I can&amp;#39;t tell if the tower is posting, since his mobo doesn&amp;#39;t have one of those tiny little speakers to play the beeps through.  I&amp;#39;m planning to go get my own monitor and try it out when he says he&amp;#39;s tired and he wants to go to bed, so I leave it until later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I drag myself out of bed a few hours early, because, no matter how awesome sleep is, I want to try and get his computer up and running because I don&amp;#39;t want to get that text at work.  The one asking me for the password to my computer, and then have to deal with the resulting hissy fit when I tell him to stay away from my computers.  I go with my plan from the previous night and after double checking that yes, his system is alive, I haul my monitor in, hook it up - using a different socket on the Thingy - and it works.  His tower is alive and well.  I tell him his monitor died, that it likely caused a small power surge when it went, and his computer&amp;#39;s psu shut itself down to protect itself, and then wander off to get ready for work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward several hours.  I get home, and he greets me with a huge smile, saying it wasn&amp;#39;t the monitor after all.  It was the socket on the Thingy he had it plugged into.  When he plugged his monitor into a different socket, it worked fine.  So I quickly figure that the socket had shorted out in some way, causing a power surge up the monitor and down the cable to the tower, killing power to the monitor completely, and causing the tower&amp;#39;s psu to shut itself down in the name of self preservation.  I ask him then, if he&amp;#39;s FINALLY going to get rid of the Thingy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DoD:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s fine!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cue scream of rage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - Small UPS is damaged by a power surge.
