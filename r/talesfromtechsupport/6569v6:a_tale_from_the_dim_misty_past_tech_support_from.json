We would do it all, from custom PC builds (with the oh-so-modern 488dx, and then the original Pentium!) to networking installs, to on-site visits, etc. I have a few stories from that time, but my favorite involves a Fax Modem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, a regular customer comes into the shop bearing his PC tower. A hefty beast sporting a cool 6 Megabytes of RAM and a 66 MHZ 486DX. Truly a tiny god.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This customer ran a business where his clients would fax him their orders, and he would then process and ship them out. He had been concerned about the cost of fax paper, and he had heard that you could do all of this electronically.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was about to suggest an email solution, since that would save him the cost of paper, and it would allow him to reply back quickly, but he would have none of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His true genius idea was the state of the art 33.6 kbs Fax Modem. He didn&amp;#39;t want to change his process, he just wanted to not buy paper. This modem would accept incoming faxes and render them in a lovely low-res jpg format. (Which he planned to print out on regular paper since it was cheaper...)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I, as the consummate professional I was at 17, told him that it would take about 2 hours at our current queue level. He agreed and left the future of his business in my hands.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I logged the ticket to his account, and began the work. It was a pretty basic install, just an internal card that fit into an ISA slot. (Pre-PCI, for you young&amp;#39;uns.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of RJ-11 jacks on the back, as you&amp;#39;d expect. I plugged everything in, and began loading the drivers and software from the included floppy disk. (No CDs for me, no sir.) Again, a pretty simple install on good ol&amp;#39; Windows 3.11 (the last good MS operating system...)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the fun part. After hooking everything up on the test bench, we began faxing. We faxed to. We faxed from. We tested the auto-accept feature. We tested the scheduled send feature. We tested every feature that fax modem had, and it all worked as advertised.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, after a thorough training session on the software, a happy customer left bearing his newly upgraded computer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about two weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working the counter one lovely summer morning, when the door bursts open like a SWAT team breach. I see about 30 pounds of heavy PC case flying through the air at my face.

Apparently several orders were faxed to him over the last few weeks, and none of them were received, losing him the aforementioned $40k worth of business.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologized profusely, and my boss directed me to take the PC back to the shop while he talked the customer down out of his rage tree.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to the test bench I went, hooking everything up as before. Again, I ran through the full litany of delicate fax-modem testing, and it all worked perfectly, as it had previously.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breaking the cardinal rule of any shop-keeper, my boss invited the customer back to the test bench to prove that everything worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The customer was more furious than ever, seeing the clear indication of a working fax modem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;THEN WHY THE [expletive deleted] DIDN&amp;#39;T IT TAKE MY [expletive deleted] ORDERS YOU LITTLE [expletive deleted]?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was perfectly willing to give the customer $40,000 worth of a pissed-off teenager&amp;#39;s foot into his ass, but again, I was and am a professional. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him to recall the events of that day, in case there was a deficiency in his training that I had left out.
