We have 5 tech&amp;#39;s around the country (2 at remote sites, 1 at the company we support&amp;#39;s depot, and 2 at $TLMSP&amp;#39;s office). This story is about $Vanilla. $Vanilla has one of your typical, basic white girl names (insert your favorite here), and the air-headed personality to match. $Vanilla came from NOLA when the area flooded, moved to the metro area around $Company&amp;#39;s HQ, and got a job because she has family that works for $TLMSP. She previously (supposedly) repaired cell phones for a living.

She constantly asks the same questions about the same issues EVERY day, with seemingly no recollection of previous issues. If you can get her to follow instructions, she follows the lackadaisically and is unable to improvise or adapt to any new information. She seriously brings out the BOFH in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like everyday with $Vanilla is a new story worthy of TFTS, but I drink most of them away.

Firing up the citrix session that provides me with my remote tools, opening my email, bringing up my ticket queue, etc. We&amp;#39;ve recently whittled down the queue to a very reasonable amount, so I only have a handful of tickets. I look down the far right column (Updated date and time) and see that I was assigned two tickets this morning when the call coordinator signed on. Our service desk has the bad habit of putting no information in the ticket description itself, but peppering the title with a crap load of unnecessary chatter. So the first thing I do when I get new tickets is open them up, scan and make sure that I have enough information to proceed with the ticket and modify the ticket title so that I can tell at a glance what the issue is, instead of having to mentally decipher the moronese.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First ticket: &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Tablet (Dell Venue) - Not able to turn on and off the WiFi adapter User states that the&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;option to turn the Wifi adapter on and off is gone&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; (Seriously?!), changed to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Tablet - Wifi&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Moved relevant information to description, check contact info is available. Save. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second Ticket &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Laptop - is no longer working and she is working on critical business items&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; (Everyone&amp;#39;s work is important to someone, i suppose). I am about to change the title of the ticket but I decide to scan the ticket to make sure the relevant information is inside. I see the title has already been changed once (From nearly identical but including &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;THIS IS NOT A MEDIUM REQUEST!!&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, LOL) but there&amp;#39;s no contact info and there&amp;#39;s no information about the system (laptop, desktop, tablet, nature of the error, etc.);  the full description was listed as &amp;quot;Laptop needs to be fixed or replaced immediately&amp;quot;. I double check the name of the agent who opened the ticket (users are able to open tickets directly via the web portal without speaking to a service desk flunkie, I want to make sure I don&amp;#39;t misdirect my anger) and it was not a self-service ticket. I fire an email off to the call coordinator to misroute the ticket based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and &lt;strong&gt;almost&lt;/strong&gt; dismiss the ticket from my mind. Except something doesn&amp;#39;t feel right. We have the occasional drama queen, and people get testy, but generally, they don&amp;#39;t go full aggro unless someone has treated them unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I go back to our ticketing system, perform a full lookup (open, pending, resolved, etc.) of all tickets this user has ever had opened in her name. Lo and behold, 3 different tickets have been assigned for this particular issue. The first being to $Vanilla. FML. (Is it Monday? It feels like Monday.)

No wonder this lady is pissed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second ticket is assigned to $Company&amp;#39;s own Deskside Support (they have 2 employees that don&amp;#39;t work our queue, basically executive escalations, they&amp;#39;re on-site at company HQ). Says he gave the user a loaner, ran diagnostics, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDD is failing, replacement being shipped by Dell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; $Vanilla knows the HDD is covered by Warranty, but it never even got that far because she blatantly ignored her issues once she saw the warranty was ending soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I fire up lync and ask my supervisor to call me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$DD - Supervisor.
