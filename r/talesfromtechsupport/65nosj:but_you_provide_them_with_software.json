We&amp;#39;ll have to wait until Adobe distributes a patch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$User: Well then call them and tell them that this is a very important issue for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "name": "t1_dgcmwkd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492408407.0, "created_utc": 1492379607.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nosj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nosj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5g5r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FuckingFuckPiss", "parent_id": "t1_dgc349s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Idk, could be Asgore.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idk, could be Asgore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "name": "t1_dgc5g5r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385385.0, "created_utc": 1492356585.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc349s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Geoclasm", "parent_id": "t3_65nosj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Howdy?
