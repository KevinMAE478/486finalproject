I followed the directions, but then this happened!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, let\u2019s just take a look and see what we see, starting with...

I\u2019ll just go and add y\u2019here...

Explain?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temphany&lt;/strong&gt;: The directions say that I need to clear out the box before I send!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;:  What?  No, that\u2019s there\u2019s some kind of nonsense.  Why, that\u2019d cause a whole lot more of what you called me up here to fix!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temphany&lt;/strong&gt;: \u201cStep 3: \u2018campus-all\u2019 is a secured list.  Make sure to clear out the box for allowed senders!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;: NOT.  Make sure to NOT clear out the box.  I remember because I made a point to have that word specifically in larger, angry-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She handed me a photocopy of the laminates I\u2019d given the Grand Whuff to support her subjective reality.  A very bad looking black-and-white photocopy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;: -red\u2026  Aw dang it, y\u2019all &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have those terrible copiers?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several months prior, our preferred campus computer vendor had run a promotion offering free accessories worth \u201cup to thousands of dollars\u201d on new computers.  One such generous offering was a printer/copier unit featuring 4-bit grayscale reproduction (up to 2 pages per minute!).  These crap MFCs had briefly flourished on campus, their proliferation to desks driven by departments trying to save pennies-per-copy on the leases for their proper printers and copiers.  We\u2019d been opportunistically purging them as office workers realized how awful they were; the Office of the Grand Whuff apparently had a very high threshold for pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Temphany was confused until I pulled one of the full-color original laminates from under her mouse and handed it to her for comparison.  Step three, being the main failure scenario, was highlighted in light red, with the adverb in a much scarier double burgundy.  The cheap MFC turned both shades of red into the same shade of gray, causing \u2018NOT\u2019 to disappear and hilarity to ensue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temphany&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, just like the photocopier was color blind!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;:  Exactly that, and if\u2019n you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll be confiscating all of these laminates for reprinting before the ADA Lady smells them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to Zero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temphany&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, thanks a million for all your help!  I\u2019m probably going to catch it when the boss gets back, though, dontcha know.  I sure wish I hadn\u2019t done that!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eh, what the hell; she\u2019s due one more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;:  Yeah, our phones are going to be ringing off the hook with angry users wanting an explanation.  Good thing I had a Djintleman\u2019s Agreement with the Grand Whuff that covers exactly this scenario.  Can you pull up the list of messages being \u2018held for moderation\u2019?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the queue was a single message.  I had been slightly worried that turning off the list protections would have caused it to be lost in the flood, but it was still where we&amp;#39;d stashed it.  Temphany read the displayed subject line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temphany&lt;/strong&gt;: What\u2019s this \u201cMessage from the Grand Whuff?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;:  It\u2019s explaining that the email flood was caused by an \u201cunavoidable list mis-configuration,\u201d that has now been fixed, and apologizes for the inconvenience, feel free to follow up with him if you have more questions.  Just enough closure from high enough up the chain so as folk\u2019ll stow the pitchforks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temphany&lt;/strong&gt;:  And that\u2019ll work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluecoat&lt;/strong&gt;: No idea, do the thing!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She clicked the \u2018release\u2019 button and we waited.  Ten seconds later, a cacophony of Outlook new mail chimes swept through offices across campus, placating the masses and officially ending the crisis.  By and large, everyone accepted the vague origin story for the reply-allpocalypse and the Mulligan email meant that we got to drop everything containing the words \u2018campus-all\u2019 from the support queue.  The remaining customers, who felt they had a unique perspective on how the email storm had personally affected them, were directed to leave a voicemail on the \u201cList Support\u201d line, solving the problem once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next:&lt;/strong&gt; San Dimas Standard Time&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5z1s7p/curse_of_the_djinn_part_1/)\n\n**Nonchalant**\n\nHoratio's wry stare tracked me from behind his newspaper as I settled into my chair and, through the thinnest of poker faces, began to loudly regard the state of my desk.\n\n&gt;**Bluecoat**:  Huh.

The UI for Mailman, however, was very cluttered and confusing for your average user that doesn&amp;#39;t like to read words on a screen, hence the laminates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "name": "t1_dg7sfwr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129330.0, "created_utc": 1492100530.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7era3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Matthew_Cline", "parent_id": "t3_652z28", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wait, so the same page that is used to send out a message also allows for the list of approved senders to be changed?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, so the same page that is used to send out a message also allows for the list of approved senders to be changed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "name": "t1_dg7era3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492110759.0, "created_utc": 1492081959.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652z28", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg96nwj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZombieLHKWoof", "parent_id": "t3_652z28", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;drinking djinn &amp; tonics\n\nThanks a lot Blue, I had to clean my monitor after reading that line form laugh spittle.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;drinking djinn &amp;amp; tonics&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot Blue, I had to clean my monitor after reading that line form laugh spittle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "name": "t1_dg96nwj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492208453.0, "created_utc": 1492179653.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652z28", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7dzv3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sandwich247", "parent_id": "t3_652z28", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Amazing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "name": "t1_dg7dzv3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492108729.0, "created_utc": 1492079929.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
