I was working in-house with a company located in about four floors of a 60 story high rise. I don&amp;#39;t remember what the floor the customer was on, but it was up there pretty high forty or higher.\nAnyway, I was doing a follow-up on several complaints he made that he heard voices coming out of his speakers.  I assumed he may have just left a browser window open to some CNN video or  Youtube, but to show good response I went down to his office. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy was in his late 30&amp;#39;s and was way out-of-shape. To top it off, office gossip sort of suggested he wasn&amp;#39;t mentally all there. I brushed that aside and just tried to help. I first replaced his speakers with out-of-box new pair of Dell branded speakers (only kind we had). I then showed him how to mute windows and make sure no browsers were still running.  He kept calling with the problem. I would walk down to the office, listen for the voices, and replace his speakers. This went on at least three times over a two month period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day I get the notice to lock his account as he has left the company.  I overheard some of his peers making fun of him and recounting how he told them the IT department was talking to him through his speakers and he had unplugged them.  Apparently, he then started hearing the same voices through the desktop itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward a few months. The company makes a new hire. The new hire will be replacing the voices guy in the same office. I meet the young lady and she seems to be perfectly normal. Attractive, well kept and actually fairly tech savvy as that office went. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We give her a new workstation and actually don&amp;#39;t bother with speakers as most people use headphones when needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a week passed and she started calling support complaining about the voices.  I thought someone was playing a prank on me and she was in on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her when she might be away from her office. She gave me a day she would be out and I told her I&amp;#39;d setup a &amp;quot;trap for the voices&amp;quot;. She laughed and said sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat in the office with my laptop for three hours. That&amp;#39;s when I heard it. It took me about 10 minutes to identify it as a traffic helicopter.  Apparently the shielding on the internal speaker in the computer and the Dell external speakers is pretty crappy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder what happened to that first guy.
