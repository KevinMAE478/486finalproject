We can restore the image to the drive. This will put the machine back into the exact state it was in before we picked it up. However, since this was not a mistake on our part as we gave you multiple warnings, there will be a charge for any further work. Restoring the image will restore all of your files as well as any previous issues you were having. I can also give you a quote for extracting your important data from the disk image. The data backup and transfer fee will depend on the type of data, the amount of data, and where it&amp;#39;s stored on the filesystem. If you don&amp;#39;t have a portable drive of sufficient size there will also be an equipment charge for a new drive. You have until $date to decide, at which point your disk image will be automatically securely purged from our storage system with no possibility of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few reactions that come after this in descending severity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The customer throws a tantrum, accusing me of intentionally stealing their data so I can hold it for ransom.
