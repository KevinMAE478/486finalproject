This is about the time our friend, CTG, made me lose my shit.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first CTG story: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5vw4kq/smoking_gunerrrrprinter/\"&gt;Smoking Printer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe ending: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5vzb17/farm_animals/\"&gt;Farm Animals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: me&lt;br/&gt;\n$CTG: crazy tech guy&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: innocent VP    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every month, we had about a dozen auto-generated tickets added to the helpdesk queue. The tickets were basically cosmetic, designed to keep other execs from bitching to my boss during management meetings and to make the IT department look good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would generate a ticket for every department head or higher to do basic maintenance on their computer: make sure anti-virus was working, make sure updates had been applied, check the device manager for errors, clear the caches, delete temp files, run chkdsk and defrag, check the amount of free space on the HD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tickets were set to low priority. If a month went by and they weren&amp;#39;t all closed, the still open tickets were bumped to a higher priority and a new batch of low priority tickets were generated for the next month. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, it made our numbers look better because the execs thought they were getting better service, plus we found and fixed minor problems before the user even submitted a ticket.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CTG &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; these tickets. He would grab one and disappear for 2-3 hours. If anyone questioned him, he would explain he was in a VP&amp;#39;s office doing maintenance. If he was caught slacking off when assigned to one of these tasks (normally I&amp;#39;d find him napping in a deserted conference room with the lights off), he would explain that he was waiting for updates to download, so....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to talk to CTG about taking lower priority tasks when high priority tasks were waiting. He would tell me the high priority task wasn&amp;#39;t there when he took the low priority one...and then I&amp;#39;d have to check timestamps and have a discussion about lying. This stopped when I started writing him up every time he did it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which meant I&amp;#39;d also have to apply the same guidelines to all the other techs. Which didn&amp;#39;t improve morale one little bit.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To address the 2-3 hour disappearing act, I also had to set a time limit on the task. If the ticket wasn&amp;#39;t closed in 45 minutes, every tech had to call me and tell me why it was taking longer than usual. More grumbling among all the techs. I didn&amp;#39;t blame them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CTG got in the habit of waiting until the end of the month when the still open tickets got the bump in priority (because the new batch had come in), he would grab them all and spend a couple of days closing them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other techs would grab 2-3 at a time, do them all at the same time, moving between offices, and get them done in an hour or two. Not CTG. He was &amp;quot;extra careful&amp;quot; and did only one at at time. Interestingly enough, each ticket took him exactly 45 minutes. &lt;em&gt;(eye roll)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cover-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, I&amp;#39;m in the break room getting my morning caffeine fix. $VP is also getting his morning fix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$VP: Do you know how much longer it will be before you can get that email upgrade to $CTG?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: What? An email upgrade? &lt;em&gt;(furiously going through all the open tickets in my mind)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: Yeah. If you&amp;#39;re having a problem purchasing the update, I can get the money from my budget. Do you know how much it is?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Ummmm....is there a ticket open for this?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: No. CTG said it doesn&amp;#39;t need a ticket since it&amp;#39;s a new purchase.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Ahhh....What kind of email software do you need? &lt;em&gt;(fishing for information because I have no idea WTF he&amp;#39;s talking about, but I&amp;#39;m not throwing anyone under the bus, not even CTG)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: I don&amp;#39;t know exactly, but I really need it. I can&amp;#39;t keep on using the web app for email. It&amp;#39;s hard to work with.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: You can&amp;#39;t open Outlook at all?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: No. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to use Outlook for about 4 or 5 weeks.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: &lt;em&gt;(Shit! What has CTG done now??)&lt;/em&gt; Do you have some time today? I can come over and take a look.&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: Sure. Now&amp;#39;s a good time.      &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look at VP&amp;#39;s computer. It&amp;#39;s barely functioning. Then it freezes and blue screens on me.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$VP: Oh, just reboot it. It does that every day or two.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: You haven&amp;#39;t put in a ticket for this?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: No. CTG says it&amp;#39;s part of the email update problem that he&amp;#39;s working on.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Are you having any other problems?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: No. CTG fixed all the other problems. I&amp;#39;ve already re-created all the spreadsheets that got lost. I can&amp;#39;t re-enter any of my contacts until the email problem gets fixed. I think everything else is good.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: You lost your data?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: No. I didn&amp;#39;t lose anything. I just had to re-enter it.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: &lt;em&gt;(Oh, holy hell...)&lt;/em&gt; Do you have all your data backed up now?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: Yes. CTG gave me a thumb drive for backups.  &lt;em&gt;(hands over thumb drive)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: How long has CTG been working on this?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: He comes by every day or so and works on it for an hour or two.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Uh.... I think I can get this working better. Can you give me an hour?&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: Sure. I have a meeting. I won&amp;#39;t be back for a couple of hours.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: If I can&amp;#39;t get it fixed by then, I&amp;#39;ll get you a loaner that works.&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: You have loaners? CTG said there weren&amp;#39;t any available.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: I can scrounge up something. We will have you back in your email today.&lt;br/&gt;\n$VP: That would be great!       &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take his laptop and head back to my office. Unfortunately for me--and for CTG--I see him in an empty office on my walk back down the hall.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: &lt;em&gt;(as calmly as possible)&lt;/em&gt; CTG, what happened to VP&amp;#39;s computer?&lt;br/&gt;\n$CTG: &lt;em&gt;(turning pale)&lt;/em&gt; uhhhh.....it wasn&amp;#39;t my fault!&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: What?&lt;br/&gt;\n$CTG: When I was doing maintenance last month it crashed.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Last month?? What do you mean? It crashed? How?&lt;br/&gt;\n$CTG: There was something wrong with the MS updates. After they downloaded, the computer started to crash. It wasn&amp;#39;t me! It was Microsoft!&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: &lt;em&gt;(deadly calm now)&lt;/em&gt; You didn&amp;#39;t report this?&lt;br/&gt;\n$CTG: I couldn&amp;#39;t. Those tickets have a 45 minute time limit on them. I did the best I could in 45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: &lt;em&gt;(shouting)&lt;/em&gt; WHY THE HELL......&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: &lt;em&gt;(turning around and walking out the door and muttering under my breath)&lt;/em&gt; ...didn&amp;#39;t you call me...or open another ticket...oh, shit! Fucking hell! I am so screwed!      &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and I walk straight into Boss&amp;#39;s office and tell her I raised my voice to CTG (which I am not supposed to do). Then I take VP&amp;#39;s computer into my office a do a little searching. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I determined (and CTG later confirmed) was that CTG &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; powered off the computer in the middle of Windows updates. He couldn&amp;#39;t get it to boot back up. He didn&amp;#39;t want to admit that he&amp;#39;d bricked the computer. That meant he couldn&amp;#39;t check out the current iso we used on new computers because he&amp;#39;d leave a paper trail. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead he scrounged up an old Windows OS disk (which I think he brought from home because he wouldn&amp;#39;t admit where he got it), installed that, and tried to download all the updates. But he&amp;#39;s so fucking stupid that he tried to do 2-3 years of updates at once. Guess how that went? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...and he still didn&amp;#39;t get fired, but that was an epic write up. CTG kept insisting that it was Microsoft&amp;#39;s fault. He refused to sign the write up notification. Cue CTG screaming and yelling at me in my office, followed by a trip to HR, where he started hyperventilating. Someone had to drive him home. He got the remainder of the day off because he was so distressed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Since it's the beginning of a long weekend, I thought I'd share another story.
