I was at the shop on my own, so I just manned the front desk until she arrived.\n20 minutes later, I see a car pull up outside our shop (She kind of parked crooked, but OK!), she frantically got out of the car and headed into the shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: SORRY! I got here as quick as I could!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: That&amp;#39;s no dramas at all, we are open till 5:30PM anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, I have a lot of things to do today and seeming as I have to do this for my Husband, considering he should be doing it all, I just got off the phone with him and he told me what to buy, so I&amp;#39;ll do that and head off again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, I do have some Modems here that are fairly cheap and will do the job, but before I sell you one, I need to know which connection you have with your old Modem, if it&amp;#39;s ADSL, ADSL2 etc?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Ohh...um, I&amp;#39;m not too sure to be honest. &lt;em&gt;ISP&lt;/em&gt; said Modem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Nodding my head and thinking - alright, maybe I&amp;#39;ll ask for the area and see which connection is most populated in the area and try from there)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Where abouts do you live, or live nearby as I can likely check to see which is the best one for you. If we make a mistake you can always bring it back and I can issue a refund there&amp;#39;s no issues with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: I live in &lt;em&gt;area&lt;/em&gt;, but what does that have to do with anything, I just need a Modem!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: OK, that&amp;#39;s fine no worries, and are you sure that the Modem is the cause of the problem and that&amp;#39;s why you need a replacement, just making sure, as I said, if there&amp;#39;s an issue you can bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: I don&amp;#39;t know! My Husband said a new Modem, so that&amp;#39;s what I have come to get!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No issues at all, well in your area, it&amp;#39;s mostly ADSL2, so I&amp;#39;ll recommend this one since it&amp;#39;s fairly cheap and I haven&amp;#39;t had an issue with these. (I grab the box and place it on the counter)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: WOW! Are they that small now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: (Puzzled but still not catching on, are you guys using one of those old Motorola Surfboard Modems!)...Uh yeah they are quite small and convenient. And cheap too only (Can&amp;#39;t remember price)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: ONLY ($) - That&amp;#39;s so cheap, I thought it was going to be at least $500!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No, that&amp;#39;s the price. They have gotten cheaper over the years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Excellent, I&amp;#39;ll grab that and if I have any issues...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Give me a call, I am here till 5:30PM and tomorrow from 9:30AM - 5:30PM!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks so much for your help &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: You&amp;#39;re welcome, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, everything went alright, I sold her one of those Netgear white modems, (I used them for so long and I can&amp;#39;t remember the name) and at the back of my head I was like - something isn&amp;#39;t quite right here. Thinking that the modem was going to be $500, and for them to be that small. I kind of dismissed it as, her Husband told her that this is what they needed, she is just doing the run around. I left it at that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No phone calls the rest of the day, fairly quiet to be honest, closed shop at 5:45PM after cleaning and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next day, opened up a bit earlier, we leave an answering machine on through the night in case anyone contacts us out of hours so we can get back to them when we open up. 5 messages on our phone. I thought...well, something&amp;#39;s not right here. It&amp;#39;s never at 5 :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Hi it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt; from Yesterday, my Husband is here and we are having problems connecting the Modem up, could you please call us back on *******, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Hi, it&amp;#39;s me again, could you please contact us as SOON AS POSSIBLE PLEASE, we need to speak about the modem, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Rinse and repeat the next few).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did the right thing and rang &lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt; back up and talked with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;sighs....&lt;/em&gt;* hello....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; from ******* I.T, I received your Voicemail messages, could you tell me what&amp;#39;s wrong with the Modem, are you having issues connecting it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Hi, look, my Husband is here trying to connect the Modem up and it&amp;#39;s not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Hearing in the background - F..KING THING, F..K THIS etc from the Husband).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok what is the problem, is it the wrong connection or something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: (Slightly talking away from the phone - is it the connection?)......&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: (In background) IT&amp;#39;S EVERYTHING!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry, I heard your Husband say something, he is setting it all up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes he is setting it up and he said everything is wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: By everything as I said, the wrong connection type, have you looked through the instru...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: He has went through everything, he has tried it all and nothing is working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok, perhaps it&amp;#39;s best I speak with him then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: (In background) - Mumble...mumble....F**K!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh what did he just say then?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: He&amp;#39;s trying to find where the screen plugs in....(Are you sure it&amp;#39;s not in the box?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: (NO!!!) - He literally screamed this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Hang on - screen? Can I speak with him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: He&amp;#39;s really angry, so you better sort this out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No problems I will do my best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Screen, modem, ok...let&amp;#39;s hear what he says then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;fumble fumble fumble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: WHAT?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt;: Hi it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; from ****** I.T, I hear you are experiencing issues with the modem, can you explain to me what&amp;#39;s going on since you are the one that&amp;#39;s setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah - I CAN&amp;#39;T PLUG THE SCREEN IN! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Screen, well, that is an...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: YOU SOLD MY WIFE DODGY EQUIPMENT, THERE&amp;#39;S NOTHING IN THE BOX THAT EXPLAINS HOW TO CONNECT THE SCREEN, I GOT THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE IN BUT THERE&amp;#39;S NOTHING FOR THE SCREEN!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(My face just went - OOOOOH no...ok...I knew something wasn&amp;#39;t right, how the hell can I explain this in some logical matter)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding here. I&amp;#39;ll just ask again, you are trying to plug your screen - monitor - into your...modem....which your Wife bought from me yesterday that she said you asked her to get?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: That&amp;#39;s correct! A Modem is what we needed! I told her to go get one and this is what we get, a heap of crap!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok, I know this might sound a little bit confusing, and I don&amp;#39;t want to jump to any conclusions here (I had to try as best as I can to explain without offence), but I believe what you were after was a new Computer/Tower - not a Modem, people can get these terms mixed up and I completely understand that, is your Computer a HP/Dell/Acer etc? What you switch on when you want to use your PC?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;silence.....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you want to bring in your equipment to the shop and the Modem that was purchased and I can sort it out for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: BUT! (Some bloke he knows from somewhere said) I needed a new Modem, so I rang around and found out that&amp;#39;s what I needed, and you&amp;#39;re telling me it&amp;#39;s not what I needed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: That&amp;#39;s correct, there&amp;#39;s just been a big misunderstanding with it all and that&amp;#39;s no problems at all, you have got the terms confused and that&amp;#39;s fine, I can sort it all out. Did you want to bring in your Computer to the shop and I will sort it all out or do you want me to send someone around to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;fumble, fumble, fumble&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh hi, look there seems to be a misunderstanding, I don&amp;#39;t think you needed a Modem, I believe you needed a new Computer, do you mind bringing it all back down to the shop and I can take a look at it all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah I can bring it back down no problems at all, my Husband doesn&amp;#39;t want to deal with it now so I&amp;#39;ll sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No worries, these things happen, just bring it all back in the box with accessories and if you want me to service your Computer, I can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Um, I&amp;#39;ll see what I can do, I&amp;#39;ll be there soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, after that call, I was a little bit sort of taken back thinking, hang on, so the Keyboard and Mouse are plugged into the Modem? What...ok. Let&amp;#39;s see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About an hour later &lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt; comes back into the shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry I took too long, I was trying to pack everything back together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No issues at all, as I said, if there was any issues, to bring it all back and I can sort it out. Did you bring your Computer, the one that is faulty with you so I can take a look?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: ....No, I didn&amp;#39;t. When you say Computer, what do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, well, the Computer...hang on, over here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I get up and walk over to the demo Computers that are near some of the products)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: One of these here - this is the Computer, from what I gathered this is what needed to be replaced and not the Modem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: (With a shock look on her face) OH MY GOD! I TOLD MY HUSBAND IT WAS THE COMPUTER BUT HE INSISTED BECAUSE SAM HAD SAID IT&amp;#39;S THE MODEM, HE BELIEVES HE STUPID BUDDIES AND MAKES ME LOOK STUPID RUNNING AROUND FOR HIM!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: So you knew it was this and he was saying it&amp;#39;s the Modem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly right! I feel like an idiot now, I am so sorry for wasting your time. Hang on, can I make a phonecall?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No there&amp;#39;s no problems, it&amp;#39;s a misunderstanding, and if you need to make a call that&amp;#39;s fine, I&amp;#39;ll process the refund and I&amp;#39;ll let you know when it&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(While she was on the phone, I started processing the refund)\nI opened the box, made sure everything was there, I checked the modem and I could see some scratches on the RJ-45 ports, where he said he had plugged the keyboard and mouse in, but otherwise it was all in one piece so I put it to the side and arranged the refund)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt; walks over to me and hands me the phone)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey mate, it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;husband&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;#39;m sorry for this big stuff up, my mate said it was the Modem, and I don&amp;#39;t know much about Computers and all that. The uh, not the modem, the Computer...box - that doesn&amp;#39;t turn on anymore, there used to be lights on the front when it came on and there&amp;#39;s nothing, that&amp;#39;s what I was telling everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: OH! I completely understand now, that&amp;#39;s no problems whatsoever, I have processed the refund and if you want me to fix the PC up for you, then I certainly can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: I should&amp;#39;ve listened to my wife, she said it was the Computer the whole time and she told me you showed here one and that&amp;#39;s why she rang me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Not to worry at all, I&amp;#39;ll let your Wife complete the refund as I need her signature and there&amp;#39;s no problems!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Husband&lt;/strong&gt;: thanks buddy, appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt; hangs up and looks very embarrassed)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: I am so sorry about all this, he told me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: No problems at all, people get mixed up all the time with terms with Computers etc. So it&amp;#39;s no issues. Refund is all done, just need your signature here.\n(Signs)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks so much, so I&amp;#39;ll bring the Computer here because there&amp;#39;s a lot of MYOB info on that we need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Absolutely, you bring it in and I&amp;#39;ll sort it out for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wife&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I never heard from them again. I would&amp;#39;ve been happy to service their Computer, it was just a big misunderstanding.

I was at the shop on my own, so I just manned the front desk until she arrived.\n20 minutes later, I see a car pull up outside our shop (She kind of parked crooked, but OK!), she frantically got out of the car and headed into the shop.\n\n&gt;**Wife**: SORRY! I got here as quick as I could!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: That's no dramas at all, we are open till 5:30PM anyways.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Oh, I have a lot of things to do today and seeming as I have to do this for my Husband, considering he should be doing it all, I just got off the phone with him and he told me what to buy, so I'll do that and head off again.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Well, I do have some Modems here that are fairly cheap and will do the job, but before I sell you one, I need to know which connection you have with your old Modem, if it's ADSL, ADSL2 etc?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Ohh...um, I'm not too sure to be honest. *ISP* said Modem.\n\n\n(Nodding my head and thinking - alright, maybe I'll ask for the area and see which connection is most populated in the area and try from there)\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Where abouts do you live, or live nearby as I can likely check to see which is the best one for you. If we make a mistake you can always bring it back and I can issue a refund there's no issues with that.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: I live in *area*, but what does that have to do with anything, I just need a Modem!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: OK, that's fine no worries, and are you sure that the Modem is the cause of the problem and that's why you need a replacement, just making sure, as I said, if there's an issue you can bring it back.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: I don't know! My Husband said a new Modem, so that's what I have come to get!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No issues at all, well in your area, it's mostly ADSL2, so I'll recommend this one since it's fairly cheap and I haven't had an issue with these. (I grab the box and place it on the counter)\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: WOW! Are they that small now!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: (Puzzled but still not catching on, are you guys using one of those old Motorola Surfboard Modems!)...Uh yeah they are quite small and convenient. And cheap too only (Can't remember price)\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: ONLY ($) - That's so cheap, I thought it was going to be at least $500!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No, that's the price. They have gotten cheaper over the years.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Excellent, I'll grab that and if I have any issues...\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Give me a call, I am here till 5:30PM and tomorrow from 9:30AM - 5:30PM!\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Thanks so much for your help **me**.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: You're welcome, thank you!\n\nSo, everything went alright, I sold her one of those Netgear white modems, (I used them for so long and I can't remember the name) and at the back of my head I was like - something isn't quite right here. Thinking that the modem was going to be $500, and for them to be that small. I kind of dismissed it as, her Husband told her that this is what they needed, she is just doing the run around. I left it at that.\n\nNo phone calls the rest of the day, fairly quiet to be honest, closed shop at 5:45PM after cleaning and headed home.\n\n\nNext day, opened up a bit earlier, we leave an answering machine on through the night in case anyone contacts us out of hours so we can get back to them when we open up. 5 messages on our phone. I thought...well, something's not right here. It's never at 5 :D\n\n**Message 1**: Hi it's **Wife** from Yesterday, my Husband is here and we are having problems connecting the Modem up, could you please call us back on *******, thanks!\n\n\n**Message 2**: Hi, it's me again, could you please contact us as SOON AS POSSIBLE PLEASE, we need to speak about the modem, thanks!\n\n\n(Rinse and repeat the next few).\n\nSo I did the right thing and rang **Wife** back up and talked with them.\n&gt;**Wife**: *sighs....** hello....\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Hey it's **Me** from ******* I.T, I received your Voicemail messages, could you tell me what's wrong with the Modem, are you having issues connecting it?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Hi, look, my Husband is here trying to connect the Modem up and it's not working.\n\n\n(Hearing in the background - F..KING THING, F..K THIS etc from the Husband).\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Ok what is the problem, is it the wrong connection or something else?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: (Slightly talking away from the phone - is it the connection?)......\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: (In background) IT'S EVERYTHING!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Sorry, I heard your Husband say something, he is setting it all up?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Yes he is setting it up and he said everything is wrong with it.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: By everything as I said, the wrong connection type, have you looked through the instru...\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: He has went through everything, he has tried it all and nothing is working.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Ok, perhaps it's best I speak with him then.\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: (In background) - Mumble...mumble....F**K!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Oh what did he just say then?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: He's trying to find where the screen plugs in....(Are you sure it's not in the box?)\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: (NO!!!) - He literally screamed this.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Hang on - screen? Can I speak with him?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: He's really angry, so you better sort this out.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No problems I will do my best.\n\n\n\nScreen, modem, ok...let's hear what he says then.\n\n*fumble fumble fumble*\n&gt;**Husband**: WHAT?\n\n\n&gt;**Me:**: Hi it's **Me** from ****** I.T, I hear you are experiencing issues with the modem, can you explain to me what's going on since you are the one that's setting it up.\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: Yeah - I CAN'T PLUG THE SCREEN IN! \n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Screen, well, that is an...\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: YOU SOLD MY WIFE DODGY EQUIPMENT, THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BOX THAT EXPLAINS HOW TO CONNECT THE SCREEN, I GOT THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE IN BUT THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE SCREEN!\n\n(My face just went - OOOOOH no...ok...I knew something wasn't right, how the hell can I explain this in some logical matter)\n\n&gt;**Me**: Ok sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding here. I'll just ask again, you are trying to plug your screen - monitor - into your...modem....which your Wife bought from me yesterday that she said you asked her to get?\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: That's correct! A Modem is what we needed! I told her to go get one and this is what we get, a heap of crap!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Ok, I know this might sound a little bit confusing, and I don't want to jump to any conclusions here (I had to try as best as I can to explain without offence), but I believe what you were after was a new Computer/Tower - not a Modem, people can get these terms mixed up and I completely understand that, is your Computer a HP/Dell/Acer etc? What you switch on when you want to use your PC?\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: *silence.....*\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Did you want to bring in your equipment to the shop and the Modem that was purchased and I can sort it out for you?\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: BUT! (Some bloke he knows from somewhere said) I needed a new Modem, so I rang around and found out that's what I needed, and you're telling me it's not what I needed?\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: That's correct, there's just been a big misunderstanding with it all and that's no problems at all, you have got the terms confused and that's fine, I can sort it all out. Did you want to bring in your Computer to the shop and I will sort it all out or do you want me to send someone around to you?\n\n\n(*fumble, fumble, fumble*)\n&gt;**Wife**: Hello?\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Oh hi, look there seems to be a misunderstanding, I don't think you needed a Modem, I believe you needed a new Computer, do you mind bringing it all back down to the shop and I can take a look at it all?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Yeah I can bring it back down no problems at all, my Husband doesn't want to deal with it now so I'll sort it out.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No worries, these things happen, just bring it all back in the box with accessories and if you want me to service your Computer, I can do that.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Um, I'll see what I can do, I'll be there soon.\n\nSo, after that call, I was a little bit sort of taken back thinking, hang on, so the Keyboard and Mouse are plugged into the Modem? What...ok. Let's see what happens.\n\nAbout an hour later **Wife** comes back into the shop.\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Sorry I took too long, I was trying to pack everything back together.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No issues at all, as I said, if there was any issues, to bring it all back and I can sort it out. Did you bring your Computer, the one that is faulty with you so I can take a look?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: ....No, I didn't. When you say Computer, what do you mean?\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Oh, well, the Computer...hang on, over here.\n\n(I get up and walk over to the demo Computers that are near some of the products)\n\n&gt;**Me**: One of these here - this is the Computer, from what I gathered this is what needed to be replaced and not the Modem.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: (With a shock look on her face) OH MY GOD! I TOLD MY HUSBAND IT WAS THE COMPUTER BUT HE INSISTED BECAUSE SAM HAD SAID IT'S THE MODEM, HE BELIEVES HE STUPID BUDDIES AND MAKES ME LOOK STUPID RUNNING AROUND FOR HIM!\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: So you knew it was this and he was saying it's the Modem?\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Exactly right! I feel like an idiot now, I am so sorry for wasting your time. Hang on, can I make a phonecall?\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No there's no problems, it's a misunderstanding, and if you need to make a call that's fine, I'll process the refund and I'll let you know when it's done.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Thanks so much.\n\n(While she was on the phone, I started processing the refund)\nI opened the box, made sure everything was there, I checked the modem and I could see some scratches on the RJ-45 ports, where he said he had plugged the keyboard and mouse in, but otherwise it was all in one piece so I put it to the side and arranged the refund)\n\n(**Wife** walks over to me and hands me the phone)\n&gt;**Me**: Hello?\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: Hey mate, it's **husband**, I'm sorry for this big stuff up, my mate said it was the Modem, and I don't know much about Computers and all that. The uh, not the modem, the Computer...box - that doesn't turn on anymore, there used to be lights on the front when it came on and there's nothing, that's what I was telling everyone.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: OH! I completely understand now, that's no problems whatsoever, I have processed the refund and if you want me to fix the PC up for you, then I certainly can.\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: I should've listened to my wife, she said it was the Computer the whole time and she told me you showed here one and that's why she rang me.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Not to worry at all, I'll let your Wife complete the refund as I need her signature and there's no problems!\n\n\n&gt;**Husband**: thanks buddy, appreciate it.\n\n(**Wife** hangs up and looks very embarrassed)\n\n&gt;**Wife**: I am so sorry about all this, he told me...\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: No problems at all, people get mixed up all the time with terms with Computers etc. So it's no issues. Refund is all done, just need your signature here.\n(Signs)\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Thanks so much, so I'll bring the Computer here because there's a lot of MYOB info on that we need.\n\n\n&gt;**Me**: Absolutely, you bring it in and I'll sort it out for you.\n\n\n&gt;**Wife**: Thanks again!\n\nAnd I never heard from them again. I would've been happy to service their Computer, it was just a big misunderstanding. But, it's all in the details!\nIt became a story within the shop to the other employees, and we seen the funny side of it, but at the same time, how I managed the situation etc. \n\nAfter this, I always, double, triple, quadruple checked - are you SURE it's the (NAME OF WHATEVER) that needs to be checked.\n\n**TL;DR** *Husband told Wife to get a new Modem, turned out they needed their Computer serviced and the Husband was adamant that it was a Modem since one of his friends told him so because of how he described the issue*\n\nThanks for reading everyone, and I REALLY hope I didn't stuff up the formatting!\nI have plenty more stories to share and some pics also, so I will post when I can!\n\nEdit;
