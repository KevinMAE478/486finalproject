Oh, half of the voters in said state are fiscally conservative, like small government, and want to make jobs and bomb isis?

He has come out in support of gay rights, wants to improve the pay and view of gays in the workplace, and had an openly gay man working for his campaign in an important role. He even mentioned this in his nomination acceptance speech, which was a first for a republican, period. But nope, you're liberal and against Trump, so you're just going to make up shit that fits your narrative of him. Hell, if CNN told you Trump just grew wings, flew, and gassed millions of jews you would probably believe it. Disgusting.\n\nTrump has openly stated many times that he wants issues like these left to the states anyway. Let the states decide. That way, whatever happens is out of his control and not his responsibility. If the country is full of millennials who are so loving and accepting then that should not be an issue for you. Democracy at it's finest.\n\n&gt; and worse\n\nLOL really man? Like fucking what? Once again, people with political views that do not align with yours are not evil. Stop pretending like Trump, also known as Satan himself I guess, wants to ban the gays and whatever \"worse\" means to you. Did you not listen to a word he said during his campaign?\n\nMaking jobs, beating ISIS, cutting things from the budget, dealing with NK, putting america first in trade deals, stopping illegal immigration, etc.\n\nWhere is the evil there? Where is the \"and worse?\" I mean what horrible people trump voters are right? Get off your high horse. You have left leaning political views, congratulations. Your reply is so pompous and for no reason too. \n\nYou are fear mongering, spreading misinformation, and are letting your biases cloud your mind beyond belief.

Oh, half of the voters in said state are fiscally conservative, like small government, and want to make jobs and bomb isis? Well sure sucks to be a sport loving person in that state right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guess we&amp;#39;re just gonna &amp;quot;boycott&amp;quot; half the country then? As if that would accomplish anything. As if that would help relations, tensions, or help push a democrat agenda. As if all democrats are angels sent from God and all Trump voters are evil, irredeemable people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gonna just ignore all the people in said states that did not vote, could not vote, or voted for a candidate that was not trump? What would that do for local economies and jobs? Some American you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He stands for everything in HB2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally just wrong, not even a way around that one. He has come out in support of gay rights, wants to improve the pay and view of gays in the workplace, and had an openly gay man working for his campaign in an important role. He even mentioned this in his nomination acceptance speech, which was a first for a republican, period. But nope, you&amp;#39;re liberal and against Trump, so you&amp;#39;re just going to make up shit that fits your narrative of him. Hell, if CNN told you Trump just grew wings, flew, and gassed millions of jews you would probably believe it. Disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has openly stated many times that he wants issues like these left to the states anyway. Let the states decide. That way, whatever happens is out of his control and not his responsibility. If the country is full of millennials who are so loving and accepting then that should not be an issue for you. Democracy at it&amp;#39;s finest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and worse&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LOL really man? Like fucking what? Once again, people with political views that do not align with yours are not evil. Stop pretending like Trump, also known as Satan himself I guess, wants to ban the gays and whatever &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; means to you.
