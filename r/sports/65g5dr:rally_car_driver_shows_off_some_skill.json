That crash was not his fault. \n\nThat section of the nurburgring is famous for cars getting light on the front wheels. The section is called Flugplatz (Which in German means flying place, however the corner is named due to a small airfield that used to be nearby). Modern racing cars (And by that I mean cars built within the last 30 or so years) run the bottoms of the cars pretty much flat if the regulations can get away with. That essentially forms a vacuum effect under the car, which sucks the car to the road, and generates grip. The problem is, if the front gets airborne, that flat bottom will push the car over. Porsches did it famously at Le Mans and it happened at Road Atlanta as well. You can place fault either on track design or the engineering of the car, but an incident like this theres almost nothing a driver could do.\n\nAnd heres the kicker, from an aerodynamic perspective, one could argue that no matter WHAT the driver does he is at fault. If he slows down the front may be less likely to get off the ground, BUT you will have less force pushing on the car (higher speed = more downforce), meaning the front could get off the ground anyways. And if he goes quicker the front tires could be more likely to get off the ground due to speed, but the air catching the front of the car may force it down, but that same air is going faster hiting the undertray as well. Its an enormous catch 22 to the point where the driver can never be considered at fault in incidents like this. GT3 cars have always done this at this corner, he just gopt to be the unlucky SOB whos car went over.

That crash was not his fault. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That section of the nurburgring is famous for cars getting light on the front wheels. The section is called Flugplatz (Which in German means flying place, however the corner is named due to a small airfield that used to be nearby). Modern racing cars (And by that I mean cars built within the last 30 or so years) run the bottoms of the cars pretty much flat if the regulations can get away with. That essentially forms a vacuum effect under the car, which sucks the car to the road, and generates grip. The problem is, if the front gets airborne, that flat bottom will push the car over. Porsches did it famously at Le Mans and it happened at Road Atlanta as well. You can place fault either on track design or the engineering of the car, but an incident like this theres almost nothing a driver could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And heres the kicker, from an aerodynamic perspective, one could argue that no matter WHAT the driver does he is at fault. If he slows down the front may be less likely to get off the ground, BUT you will have less force pushing on the car (higher speed = more downforce), meaning the front could get off the ground anyways. And if he goes quicker the front tires could be more likely to get off the ground due to speed, but the air catching the front of the car may force it down, but that same air is going faster hiting the undertray as well. Its an enormous catch 22 to the point where the driver can never be considered at fault in incidents like this. GT3 cars have always done this at this corner, he just gopt to be the unlucky SOB whos car went over.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sports", "name": "t1_dgabht1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261718.0, "created_utc": 1492232918.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga9zmy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cookrw1989", "parent_id": "t1_dga7w41", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sports", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How could he have prevented that?
