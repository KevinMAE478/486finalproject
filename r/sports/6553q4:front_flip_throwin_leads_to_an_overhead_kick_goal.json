Now we come to the AB you described and now you have 1st and 3rd, go ahead run on base with some speed on 1st. Home team is at bat and the crowd is deafening. The bullpen hasn&amp;#39;t been top notch either. In the last week, the man at the plate is hitting 500 with 3 home runs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the type of situations that I love about baseball because I don&amp;#39;t quite get that in other sports. There is nothing that happens in a vacuum. That walk that happened in the 3rd with 2 outs let the 8th place guy leading off in the 6th instead of the pitcher. Everything builds on what happened before and what may seem innocuous at the time could lead to a huge shift in momentum. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sports", "name": "t1_dg84mqf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142385.0, "created_utc": 1492113585.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7zgtf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 210, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Crustice_is_Served", "parent_id": "t1_dg7y17f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sports", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I love watching a guy get to a full count, hitting 4 foul balls, and then getting walked. 10 minutes well spent there.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love watching a guy get to a full count, hitting 4 foul balls, and then getting walked. 10 minutes well spent there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sports", "name": "t1_dg7zgtf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136797.0, "created_utc": 1492107997.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 210}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553q4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg81s6u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "3FtDick", "parent_id": "t1_dg7y17f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sports", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Number 23 scratches his butt.\"\n\n\"Remirez is on his 3rd chew.... and he spit!
