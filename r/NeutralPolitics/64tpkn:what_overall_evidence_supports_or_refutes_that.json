There may have been some attempts on the part of Manafort, Page, or Flynn or others to actively engage with the Kremlin, but I don&amp;#39;t think Trump ever directed these efforts, nor do I think Russia ever actively attempted to work with US actors to achieve their info-war goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NeutralPolitics", "name": "t1_dg5bdug", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991814.0, "created_utc": 1491963014.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fcw5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crawlingfasta", "parent_id": "t1_dg5elsd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NeutralPolitics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're right, I can't prove it. \n\nI can quote Sen.

I've got a little downtime at work so I'll start trying to refute the DNC hack part of this file (I'll try to keep it from getting too technical): \n\n* **34.1. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/)**\n\nAssertions:\n\n6AM May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch (Crowdstrike) detects APT 28 in the DNC network. \n\nWithin 10 seconds an analyst attributes the APT 28 hack to Russia, citing \"governmental attributions.\" \n\nThen the analyst says there's also group of Russian hackers, APT 29, also in the network. \n\nRebuttal:\n\nThe tool used by [APT 28 is actually based on an open source Chinese program and has been repurposed by multiple different hackers.](http://news.softpedia.com/news/malware-used-in-dnc-hack-has-roots-in-chinese-open-source-tool-506773.shtml) Very few details regarding the attribution to Russia have been made public so it's difficult to further refute this attribution. \n\nThere's another big hole in the attribution\n\nWe know that the DNC hacker had access to e-mails until May 26, which is the date of the last e-mail in the WikiLeaks dump (I may be off by a few days, been a while since I checked). Presumably, Crowdstrike expelled the APT 28/29 malware on May 6th when they detected it. Right? **So whoever got the DNC e-mails from May 7th-May 26th wasn't using APT 28/APT 29 malware, which shouldn't have persisted on the network** \n\nI'm going to take it a step further: I doubt Dmitri Alperovitch's credibility. [Read about him here.](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49902/the-russian-emigre-leading-the-fight-to-protect-america/) His dad was a nuclear scientist who defected from Russia. Dmitri  clearly dislikes Russia (and rightfully so, given what happened). Personally, I don't consider him impartial, you can make up your own mind. \n\nThere's another example of Alperovitch and Crowdstrike fabricating a story where they accused \"Russia\" of hacking Ukrainian artillery. Their report was [refuted by both the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Ukrainian military](http://www.voanews.com/a/crowdstrike-comey-russia-hack-dnc-clinton-trump/3776067.html). \n\nI'd also like to point out that OP tries to implicate /u/theshadowbrokers as Russian hackers. There's zero evidence for that and even the US IC hasn't said a peep about them.\n\n* **34.2. Early Independent Investigation**\n\nOf course, Crowdstrike wasn't the only industry partner to weigh in. \n\n&gt;06/20/2016 - Crowdstrike provided another independent cyber security firm, Fidelis, their data and they agreed with Crowdstrike\u2019s conclusions. [Source](http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/dnc_update.html)\n\nThere's not much in here to refute that isn't in the initial crowdstrike report. Basically, a lot of people agree that the malware is APT 28/APT 29. \n\n\n&gt;07/17/2016 - A third independent cyber security company, ThreatConnect, did an analysis of the hack and agreed with the Crowdstrike and Fidelis Assessment. [Source](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/tapping-into-democratic-national-committee/)\n\n\n\n\n&gt;07/26/2016 - Threat connect later provided additional evidence for their claims. [Source](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/)\n\nGuccifer 2.0 sent an e-mail using a French IP address from a vpn service called Elite VPN. ThreatConnect claims it's only available in Russian:\n\n&gt;Browsing to vpn-service[.]us, we find a Russian language webpage for Elite VPN Services. The site mentions that English language support is available via email and ICQ. \n\nThis is **highly fake**. They did release a retraction very recently (past few weeks). \n\n&gt;CORRECTION: The site offers an English language translation when Javascript is enabled in a browser.\n\nThen they claim Guccifer 2.0 must be connected to the owners of Elite VPN Services: \n\n&gt;We created an account on the Elite VPN Service and were able to see which VPN nodes are offered from within France. ...\n\n&gt;It is important to note that the IP address seen in the Guccifer 2.0 AOL communications \u2013 95.130.15[.]34 \u2013 is not listed as an option within Elite VPN Service. ... This demonstrates the server was cloned from the same server image as all the Elite VPN servers but may be a private or dedicated version of the service. ... Based on this information, we can confirm that Guccifer 2.0 is using the Russia-based Elite VPN Service, and is able to leverage IP infrastructure that is not available to other users. \n\n\nAgain, this is **highly fake**. You can go to elite VPN services and [use the same IP address](http://g-2.space/elitevpnatt.png) yourself, right now. Elite VPN services [addressed this as well.](http://g-2.space/elite1.png)  (Via /u/d3fi4nt and http://g-2.space)\n\n\nThreat Connect put out a third report:\n[Does a bear leak in the woods\n](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)\nA lot of these reports are full of filler. It's not even really worth addressing them but I'll grit my teeth and do my best (a lot of this is about DCleaks.com not wikileaks):\n\n&gt;Guccifer 2.0\u2019s use of DCLeaks to share purloined emails from a Hillary Clinton campaign staffer with journalists\n\nThis is true. Guccifer 2.0 knew the password to a part of DCleaks.com that was password protected (it was being shared with journalists though.) I fail to see how it proves Guccifer = DC leaks = Russia though. \n\n&gt;DCLeaks hosted emails belonging to Billy Rinehart Jr. whose email account was breached in the same manner as a known FANCY BEAR attack method [paraphrased]\n\nYes. Billy Rinehart Jr's e-mails were hacked via spearphishing -- anybody with a website can set up a spearphishing campaign. All you need to do is make a fake login screen and e-mail it to people. They go into more details:\n\n&gt;The spearphish message was actually sent from hi.mymail@yandex[.]com, an email address from the Moscow-based webmail provider Yandex.\n\nOk. Anybody in the world (you, me, Donald Trump) can make a yandex e-mail. It was probably used because at that time they didn't require mobile phone verification to make an e-mail account. So **highly circumstantial.** \n\nThen they checked the registration info for DCleaks.com. It's feehan@europe[.]com.\n\n&gt; feehan@europe[.]com, sticks out as notable. This email address uses the same webmail provider as frank.merdeux@europe[.]com, which was in the SOA for the spoofed misdepatrment[.]com domain that we assessed was a part of the DNC hack.\n\nOk. So a hacker used an @europe.com e-mail address to register dcleaks.com. Another hacker used a europe.com e-mail to register a CnC server for the DNC hack. Again, highly circumstantial. At the time, europe.com didn't require SMS verification to make an e-mail address. (I checked this back in July, iirc, they do require it now.) Not requiring SMS verification makes europe.com attractive for hackers. So again, **highly circumstantial.**\n\n&gt;Reviewing the initial name server for dcleaks[.]com, thcservers.*.orderbox-dns[.]com, based on SOA records we identify only 14 other domains initially used these name servers for their most recent registration.\n\nSo the same name server used for dcleaks.com has been used to set up a LOT of obvious spearphishing websites as well as a few websites that are legitimate and not spearphishing e-mails (privacy-yandex[.]ru, servicetransferemail[.]com, service-yandex[.]ru, mail.kuwaitarmy.gov-kw[.]com, gooogle-login[.]com, email-ukr[.]net) \n\nONE of these domains \"service-yandex[.]ru, has previously been associated with FANCY BEAR activity based on feeds from our partners at RedSky Alliance.\"\n\nOK. So what you have here is a name server that allows anonymous registration. A lot of hackers use it to set up their spearphishing servers. Again, this link is **highly circumstantial.**\n\nOK, so that's it for \"early independent investigation\". \n\nThe rest is basically ODNI saying, \"We know it was Russia.\" There's no verifiable facts in any of their reports. \n\n\n [check here yourself\n](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) Pages 16-22 are a riot.  Especially the part where ODNI accuses RT of being anti-fracking to hurt America.\n\n\nWhen I say verifiable facts, I mean one with details such as the one the[ DOJ released on the Yahoo hack.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/948201/download) If ODNI released something with the same level of detail as that release, I'd eat my words and concede that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC.  \n\nThere are plenty of alternative theories, namely, Craig Murray claims the [e-mails were leaked to him by a whistleblower](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/) and Commander X [claims the DNC e-mails were collected by two groups of hacktivists.](http://anonymousglobal.org/commanderx/blog/?p=284) \n\nd3fi4nt has his own theory which you can read about on http://g-2.space\n\n\nIf I missed any details that need to be refuted, let me know. \n\nedit: formatting and stuff\n\n", "edited": 1491958099.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this is a &lt;a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/conspiracy-theory?q=conspiracy+theory\"&gt;conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt; because I disagree with the official narrative, it&amp;#39;s not just me though.

I&amp;#39;ve got a little downtime at work so I&amp;#39;ll start trying to refute the DNC hack part of this file (I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it from getting too technical): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34.1. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/\"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assertions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6AM May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch (Crowdstrike) detects APT 28 in the DNC network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within 10 seconds an analyst attributes the APT 28 hack to Russia, citing &amp;quot;governmental attributions.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the analyst says there&amp;#39;s also group of Russian hackers, APT 29, also in the network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rebuttal:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tool used by &lt;a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/malware-used-in-dnc-hack-has-roots-in-chinese-open-source-tool-506773.shtml\"&gt;APT 28 is actually based on an open source Chinese program and has been repurposed by multiple different hackers.&lt;/a&gt; Very few details regarding the attribution to Russia have been made public so it&amp;#39;s difficult to further refute this attribution. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another big hole in the attribution&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that the DNC hacker had access to e-mails until May 26, which is the date of the last e-mail in the WikiLeaks dump (I may be off by a few days, been a while since I checked). Presumably, Crowdstrike expelled the APT 28/29 malware on May 6th when they detected it. Right? &lt;strong&gt;So whoever got the DNC e-mails from May 7th-May 26th wasn&amp;#39;t using APT 28/APT 29 malware, which shouldn&amp;#39;t have persisted on the network&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to take it a step further: I doubt Dmitri Alperovitch&amp;#39;s credibility. &lt;a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49902/the-russian-emigre-leading-the-fight-to-protect-america/\"&gt;Read about him here.&lt;/a&gt; His dad was a nuclear scientist who defected from Russia. Dmitri  clearly dislikes Russia (and rightfully so, given what happened). Personally, I don&amp;#39;t consider him impartial, you can make up your own mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another example of Alperovitch and Crowdstrike fabricating a story where they accused &amp;quot;Russia&amp;quot; of hacking Ukrainian artillery. Their report was &lt;a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/crowdstrike-comey-russia-hack-dnc-clinton-trump/3776067.html\"&gt;refuted by both the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Ukrainian military&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also like to point out that OP tries to implicate &lt;a href=\"/u/theshadowbrokers\"&gt;/u/theshadowbrokers&lt;/a&gt; as Russian hackers. There&amp;#39;s zero evidence for that and even the US IC hasn&amp;#39;t said a peep about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34.2. Early Independent Investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, Crowdstrike wasn&amp;#39;t the only industry partner to weigh in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;06/20/2016 - Crowdstrike provided another independent cyber security firm, Fidelis, their data and they agreed with Crowdstrike\u2019s conclusions. &lt;a href=\"http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/dnc_update.html\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not much in here to refute that isn&amp;#39;t in the initial crowdstrike report. Basically, a lot of people agree that the malware is APT 28/APT 29. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;07/17/2016 - A third independent cyber security company, ThreatConnect, did an analysis of the hack and agreed with the Crowdstrike and Fidelis Assessment. &lt;a href=\"https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/tapping-into-democratic-national-committee/\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;07/26/2016 - Threat connect later provided additional evidence for their claims. &lt;a href=\"https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guccifer 2.0 sent an e-mail using a French IP address from a vpn service called Elite VPN. ThreatConnect claims it&amp;#39;s only available in Russian:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Browsing to vpn-service[.]us, we find a Russian language webpage for Elite VPN Services. The site mentions that English language support is available via email and ICQ. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;highly fake&lt;/strong&gt;. They did release a retraction very recently (past few weeks). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CORRECTION: The site offers an English language translation when Javascript is enabled in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they claim Guccifer 2.0 must be connected to the owners of Elite VPN Services: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We created an account on the Elite VPN Service and were able to see which VPN nodes are offered from within France. ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the IP address seen in the Guccifer 2.0 AOL communications \u2013 95.130.15[.]34 \u2013 is not listed as an option within Elite VPN Service. ... This demonstrates the server was cloned from the same server image as all the Elite VPN servers but may be a private or dedicated version of the service. ... Based on this information, we can confirm that Guccifer 2.0 is using the Russia-based Elite VPN Service, and is able to leverage IP infrastructure that is not available to other users. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, this is &lt;strong&gt;highly fake&lt;/strong&gt;. You can go to elite VPN services and &lt;a href=\"http://g-2.space/elitevpnatt.png\"&gt;use the same IP address&lt;/a&gt; yourself, right now. Elite VPN services &lt;a href=\"http://g-2.space/elite1.png\"&gt;addressed this as well.&lt;/a&gt;  (Via &lt;a href=\"/u/d3fi4nt\"&gt;/u/d3fi4nt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://g-2.space\"&gt;http://g-2.space&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Threat Connect put out a third report:\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/\"&gt;Does a bear leak in the woods\n&lt;/a&gt;\nA lot of these reports are full of filler. It&amp;#39;s not even really worth addressing them but I&amp;#39;ll grit my teeth and do my best (a lot of this is about DCleaks.com not wikileaks):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guccifer 2.0\u2019s use of DCLeaks to share purloined emails from a Hillary Clinton campaign staffer with journalists&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is true. Guccifer 2.0 knew the password to a part of DCleaks.com that was password protected (it was being shared with journalists though.) I fail to see how it proves Guccifer = DC leaks = Russia though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;DCLeaks hosted emails belonging to Billy Rinehart Jr. whose email account was breached in the same manner as a known FANCY BEAR attack method [paraphrased]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. Billy Rinehart Jr&amp;#39;s e-mails were hacked via spearphishing -- anybody with a website can set up a spearphishing campaign. All you need to do is make a fake login screen and e-mail it to people. They go into more details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The spearphish message was actually sent from hi.mymail@yandex[.]com, an email address from the Moscow-based webmail provider Yandex.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. Anybody in the world (you, me, Donald Trump) can make a yandex e-mail. It was probably used because at that time they didn&amp;#39;t require mobile phone verification to make an e-mail account. So &lt;strong&gt;highly circumstantial.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they checked the registration info for DCleaks.com. It&amp;#39;s feehan@europe[.]com.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;feehan@europe[.]com, sticks out as notable. This email address uses the same webmail provider as frank.merdeux@europe[.]com, which was in the SOA for the spoofed misdepatrment[.]com domain that we assessed was a part of the DNC hack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. So a hacker used an @europe.com e-mail address to register dcleaks.com. Another hacker used a europe.com e-mail to register a CnC server for the DNC hack. Again, highly circumstantial. At the time, europe.com didn&amp;#39;t require SMS verification to make an e-mail address. (I checked this back in July, iirc, they do require it now.) Not requiring SMS verification makes europe.com attractive for hackers. So again, &lt;strong&gt;highly circumstantial.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the initial name server for dcleaks[.]com, thcservers.*.orderbox-dns[.]com, based on SOA records we identify only 14 other domains initially used these name servers for their most recent registration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the same name server used for dcleaks.com has been used to set up a LOT of obvious spearphishing websites as well as a few websites that are legitimate and not spearphishing e-mails (privacy-yandex[.]ru, servicetransferemail[.]com, service-yandex[.]ru, mail.kuwaitarmy.gov-kw[.]com, gooogle-login[.]com, email-ukr[.]net) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ONE of these domains &amp;quot;service-yandex[.]ru, has previously been associated with FANCY BEAR activity based on feeds from our partners at RedSky Alliance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK. So what you have here is a name server that allows anonymous registration. A lot of hackers use it to set up their spearphishing servers. Again, this link is &lt;strong&gt;highly circumstantial.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, so that&amp;#39;s it for &amp;quot;early independent investigation&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest is basically ODNI saying, &amp;quot;We know it was Russia.&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s no verifiable facts in any of their reports. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\"&gt;check here yourself\n&lt;/a&gt; Pages 16-22 are a riot.  Especially the part where ODNI accuses RT of being anti-fracking to hurt America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I say verifiable facts, I mean one with details such as the one the&lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/948201/download\"&gt; DOJ released on the Yahoo hack.&lt;/a&gt; If ODNI released something with the same level of detail as that release, I&amp;#39;d eat my words and concede that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of alternative theories, namely, Craig Murray claims the &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/\"&gt;e-mails were leaked to him by a whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; and Commander X &lt;a href=\"http://anonymousglobal.org/commanderx/blog/?p=284\"&gt;claims the DNC e-mails were collected by two groups of hacktivists.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;d3fi4nt has his own theory which you can read about on &lt;a href=\"http://g-2.space\"&gt;http://g-2.space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I missed any details that need to be refuted, let me know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: formatting and stuff&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NeutralPolitics", "name": "t1_dg55wl7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984629.0, "created_utc": 1491955829.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg514oj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "neuronexmachina", "parent_id": "t1_dg50a34", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NeutralPolitics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The doc was getting popular enough it was running into Google Docs limits, so he moved to a wiki on Reddit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doc was getting popular enough it was running into Google Docs limits, so he moved to a wiki on Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NeutralPolitics", "name": "t1_dg514oj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978283.0, "created_utc": 1491949483.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tpkn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg50n9e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "presidentparrot", "parent_id": "t1_dg50ecy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NeutralPolitics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Aha, I dug into it a bit and it looks like he's still doing updates at /r/TrumpInvestigation/.
