I believe Bayer and Phizer are also condom manufacturers so that part of the industry would sustain a loss as well. \n\nHere's where we get into the mires of social inequality and concepts that are exceptionally difficult to quantify and will likely be thrown out of heavily sourced discussions. There is a subtle but ever-present culture that really wants women to have babies, no matter how much a woman doesn't want to. For whatever my personal anecdotes are worth, I've had teachers and authority figures address young females as if they'll all eventually be mothers and caregivers and [advertisers generally ignore adult childless women](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/business/childless-women-to-marketers-we-buy-things-too.html?_r=0). I've literally been yelled at by family for being adamant about remaining childfree, at the very least biologically, for the rest of my life. Male children of a family face some of this pressure but not as much as the women as motherhood still has deep ties to a woman's worth in society. I think there's a degree of jealousy as well from mothers who sacrificed their bodies and sometimes their careers to create little ungrateful lives that had no desire to live out the former's wishes.
