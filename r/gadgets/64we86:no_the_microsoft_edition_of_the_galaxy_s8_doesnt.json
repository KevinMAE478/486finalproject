Especially now with these two dominant, mature platforms in place. Apps are definitely a big part of the puzzle. It was always easy for me to jump platforms in part because I'm not an app whore. I don't rely on a bunch of specific 3rd party apps. I play some casual games, but that's about it. I care more about the OS UI/UX that I'm going to be \"living in\" than I do about having all 4,000 versions of Angry Birds. But I'm not most people.  \n\nIn my dream scenario, there would be maybe 4 platforms to choose from and there would be some kind of common standard for creating apps that most developers would use and it would make it easy for them to adapt the UI/UX to match the theme/rules of each OS. So they could write say 75-80% of the app once and then just do a little tweaking and have a version for all 3-4 platforms that works well.  \n\nIt's a dream though I know, because there's nothing in it for the manufacturers or the developers. It would just mean more work and no extra profit for them. But I do believe it would be a paradigm that would greatly benefit the users. It would also force the OS and hardware makers to bring their \"A game\" to the field all the time. \n\nInstead we have Apple which has a captive audience with their sticky ecosystem and super profitable devices and the Android free-for-all which dominates because it's the only viable OS option for handset makers to use. Google can all but take their share of the market for granted. Apple isn't much of a real threat since it will always naturally limit it's own market share by keeping the hardware and software in house and proprietary. Apple will only ever offer a few choices of phones that are practically identical and fairly expensive. Apple cares much more about profit margins than it does being able to say it has the most market share. At the end of the day market share doesn't mean much if you aren't profitable.  \n\nAndroid is on so many devices and allows so much leeway that it will never offer a truly consistent end user experience. The substandard experience people get on cheaper devices or devices locked into an older version of the OS, or from OEM software Google can't control will always be a problem.  \n\nThe perfect model I think is in between the two. Strict UI/UX rules and no \"skinning\" beyond basic color themes maybe. No fiddling around that compromises performance. Minimum hardware standards that ensure no garbage phones. Either make the hardware exclusively, or raise the bar so that only the best manufacturers qualify to use your OS. At the same time, unlike Apple, you grant the freedom to access a local file system. You allow the user to reassign the default apps. You allow more flexibility in how the home screen is configured and you use an orderly system, like the live tiles that gives the user freedom while making it impossible to make a shitty mess. Finally you strictly police your app store and set high standards. I don't want 145 different calendar apps to weed through. I want the 20 very best among them and the rest aren't allowed in the story. Quality over quantity. The stupid number of apps arms race between iOS and Android just filled both app stores with a bunch of shit we have to dig through. Devs may not like this, but I would ban garbage from the store. No Chinese bikini girl picture apps that do nothing. No amateur hour nonsense. No apps that aren't at least 3/5 stars. And make a better app store than anyone has yet. One that makes it easy to search and sort. One that even lets you tick certain boxes for the features you want and filter results. i.e. I want a note taking app that: Allows you to embed photos, Offers font choices, syncs with DropBox. Then it only shows you those results and hides the other 32 note taking apps.  \n\nYeah, it's all a pipe dream I know.  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a really hard market to enter, you&amp;#39;re right. Especially now with these two dominant, mature platforms in place. Apps are definitely a big part of the puzzle. It was always easy for me to jump platforms in part because I&amp;#39;m not an app whore. I don&amp;#39;t rely on a bunch of specific 3rd party apps. I play some casual games, but that&amp;#39;s about it. I care more about the OS UI/UX that I&amp;#39;m going to be &amp;quot;living in&amp;quot; than I do about having all 4,000 versions of Angry Birds. But I&amp;#39;m not most people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my dream scenario, there would be maybe 4 platforms to choose from and there would be some kind of common standard for creating apps that most developers would use and it would make it easy for them to adapt the UI/UX to match the theme/rules of each OS. So they could write say 75-80% of the app once and then just do a little tweaking and have a version for all 3-4 platforms that works well.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dream though I know, because there&amp;#39;s nothing in it for the manufacturers or the developers. It would just mean more work and no extra profit for them. But I do believe it would be a paradigm that would greatly benefit the users. It would also force the OS and hardware makers to bring their &amp;quot;A game&amp;quot; to the field all the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead we have Apple which has a captive audience with their sticky ecosystem and super profitable devices and the Android free-for-all which dominates because it&amp;#39;s the only viable OS option for handset makers to use. Google can all but take their share of the market for granted. Apple isn&amp;#39;t much of a real threat since it will always naturally limit it&amp;#39;s own market share by keeping the hardware and software in house and proprietary. Apple will only ever offer a few choices of phones that are practically identical and fairly expensive. Apple cares much more about profit margins than it does being able to say it has the most market share. At the end of the day market share doesn&amp;#39;t mean much if you aren&amp;#39;t profitable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Android is on so many devices and allows so much leeway that it will never offer a truly consistent end user experience. The substandard experience people get on cheaper devices or devices locked into an older version of the OS, or from OEM software Google can&amp;#39;t control will always be a problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The perfect model I think is in between the two. Strict UI/UX rules and no &amp;quot;skinning&amp;quot; beyond basic color themes maybe. No fiddling around that compromises performance. Minimum hardware standards that ensure no garbage phones. Either make the hardware exclusively, or raise the bar so that only the best manufacturers qualify to use your OS. At the same time, unlike Apple, you grant the freedom to access a local file system. You allow the user to reassign the default apps. You allow more flexibility in how the home screen is configured and you use an orderly system, like the live tiles that gives the user freedom while making it impossible to make a shitty mess. Finally you strictly police your app store and set high standards. I don&amp;#39;t want 145 different calendar apps to weed through. I want the 20 very best among them and the rest aren&amp;#39;t allowed in the story. Quality over quantity. The stupid number of apps arms race between iOS and Android just filled both app stores with a bunch of shit we have to dig through. Devs may not like this, but I would ban garbage from the store. No Chinese bikini girl picture apps that do nothing. No amateur hour nonsense. No apps that aren&amp;#39;t at least 3/5 stars. And make a better app store than anyone has yet. One that makes it easy to search and sort. One that even lets you tick certain boxes for the features you want and filter results. i.e. I want a note taking app that: Allows you to embed photos, Offers font choices, syncs with DropBox. Then it only shows you those results and hides the other 32 note taking apps.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s all a pipe dream I know.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gadgets", "name": "t1_dg63yto", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043195.0, "created_utc": 1492014395.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ytt1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "baker2795", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ybs9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gadgets", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would like to see more competition in the phone market (as far as OS goes).
