Not sure if this includes nighttime temp which would make it a too low estimation.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Desert_(ecoregion)\n\nAccording to http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/watvap.html#c1 the saturation vapor density at that temperature is 30.4 g/m^3.\n\nRelative humidity% = Acutal vapor density / Saturation vapor density * 100%  \n  \nRearranging:  \n  \nAcutal vapor density=Relative humidity% * Saturation density / 100%  \n  \nSo in the Sahara we can estimate that the actual density of water in the air is:  \n  \n30% * 30.4 g/m^3 / 100% = 9.12 g/m^3\n\ndensity of liquid water is roughly (slight dependence on temperature) 1 g/cm^3 = 1,000,000 g/m^3  \n  \nAssuming the MOF could somehow remove all of the water in air passing through the device at night we can find how much air would need to be processed to extract some quantity of water.\n\nSay we want to determine the amount of air that would need to pass through and be completely stripped of all water in order to generate 1 liter of water.  1 L = 0.001 m^3\n  \nTo get 1L = 0.001m^3 of water we need 0.001m^3 * 1,000,000 g/m^3 = 1000g of water (1kg). (generally known, but I wanted to show the math)  \n  \nif each m^3 of air has 9.12 g of water we need 1000g / 9.12g/m^3 = 109.5 m^3 of air to pass through the device long enough for the harvesting to occur.  \n  \n1 CFM ~= .0283 m^3/minute.  A random computer fan (140mm) I found on newegg move about 66 CFM (https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181051).  Not sure how representative this is of small fans, but I'm going with it.  \n66CFM * 0.283 m^3/m per CFM ~= 1.9 m^3 per minute.\n  \nAt 100% efficiency stripping all the water from the air assuming all absorption required can happen fast enough under that flow condition the device could harvest 1L in 109.5m^3 air/L water / 1.9 m^3/minute ~= 57 minutes... lets say an hour.  \n  \nI guess this seems plausible enough, but I would want to know the harvesting efficiency and rate.  I would guess the actual efficiency at that flow rate could be much less like 10% (just a guess based on nothing really), so I'd be much more inclined to believe that it can harvest 1L in 1hour/10% =10 hours which I'd call one night.  Again maybe it can work, but the unknowns could make or break the idea.  What is the efficiency of harvesting water for a given flow rate.  Maybe someone can chime in with more experience and realistic probable efficiency numbers.  What if the efficiency is more like 1%?  Then you'd need a 10x the size of the MOF.  I imagine increasing the air flow rate would lower the efficiency.

Not sure if this includes nighttime temp which would make it a too low estimation.  &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Desert_(ecoregion)\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Desert_(ecoregion)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/watvap.html#c1\"&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/watvap.html#c1&lt;/a&gt; the saturation vapor density at that temperature is 30.4 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relative humidity% = Acutal vapor density / Saturation vapor density * 100%  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rearranging:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Acutal vapor density=Relative humidity% * Saturation density / 100%  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the Sahara we can estimate that the actual density of water in the air is:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30% * 30.4 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 100% = 9.12 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;density of liquid water is roughly (slight dependence on temperature) 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,000,000 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming the MOF could somehow remove all of the water in air passing through the device at night we can find how much air would need to be processed to extract some quantity of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say we want to determine the amount of air that would need to pass through and be completely stripped of all water in order to generate 1 liter of water.  1 L = 0.001 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get 1L = 0.001m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water we need 0.001m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; * 1,000,000 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000g of water (1kg). (generally known, but I wanted to show the math)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if each m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air has 9.12 g of water we need 1000g / 9.12g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 109.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air to pass through the device long enough for the harvesting to occur.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 CFM ~= .0283 m&lt;sup&gt;3/minute.&lt;/sup&gt;  A random computer fan (140mm) I found on newegg move about 66 CFM (&lt;a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181051\"&gt;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181051&lt;/a&gt;).  Not sure how representative this is of small fans, but I&amp;#39;m going with it.&lt;br/&gt;\n66CFM * 0.283 m&lt;sup&gt;3/m&lt;/sup&gt; per CFM ~= 1.9 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 100% efficiency stripping all the water from the air assuming all absorption required can happen fast enough under that flow condition the device could harvest 1L in 109.5m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; air/L water / 1.9 m&lt;sup&gt;3/minute&lt;/sup&gt; ~= 57 minutes... lets say an hour.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess this seems plausible enough, but I would want to know the harvesting efficiency and rate.  I would guess the actual efficiency at that flow rate could be much less like 10% (just a guess based on nothing really), so I&amp;#39;d be much more inclined to believe that it can harvest 1L in 1hour/10% =10 hours which I&amp;#39;d call one night.  Again maybe it can work, but the unknowns could make or break the idea.  What is the efficiency of harvesting water for a given flow rate.  Maybe someone can chime in with more experience and realistic probable efficiency numbers.  What if the efficiency is more like 1%?  Then you&amp;#39;d need a 10x the size of the MOF.  I imagine increasing the air flow rate would lower the efficiency.
