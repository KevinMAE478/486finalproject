Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation.

This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.[60] The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates.

This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.[60] The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tumblr", "name": "t1_dg5yi60", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037206.0, "created_utc": 1492008406.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7hk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xx5f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7hk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xx5f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7hk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xx5f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6mak7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nourishing_peaches", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lo86", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tumblr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tumblr", "name": "t1_dg6mak7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492062366.0, "created_utc": 1492033566.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7hk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xx5f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6vsho", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bombernaut_", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lo86", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tumblr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just don't let the streams cross or else you'll be left with interrobangs, and no one wants to clean those up.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t let the streams cross or else you&amp;#39;ll be left with interrobangs, and no one wants to clean those up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tumblr", "name": "t1_dg6vsho", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074016.0, "created_utc": 1492045216.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lo86", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sparkpuppy", "parent_id": "t1_dg6e0d2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tumblr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The exclamation points on that article are contended by powerful quotation mark force fields to prevent them from wreaking havoc on the rest of Wikipedia.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exclamation points on that article are contended by powerful quotation mark force fields to prevent them from wreaking havoc on the rest of Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tumblr", "name": "t1_dg6lo86", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061624.0, "created_utc": 1492032824.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6e0d2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "billybobskcor", "parent_id": "t3_64xx5f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tumblr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What about the article on exclamation points?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the article on exclamation points?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tumblr", "name": "t1_dg6e0d2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492053470.0, "created_utc": 1492024670.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7hk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xx5f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lh9s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sparkpuppy", "parent_id": "t3_64xx5f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tumblr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Spiders also do it.
