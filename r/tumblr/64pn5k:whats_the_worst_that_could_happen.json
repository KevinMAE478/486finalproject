Not to mention a big cause of climate change.\n&gt; all kinds of medicine and help for disabled people and people with mental illnesses.\n&gt; Have been used to lobotomize and sterilize the 'mentally ill', clitorectomies for 'nymphomaniacs', diagnose sexuality as a mental disorder, diagnose running away from slavery as a mental disorder (Drapetomania), and non-voluntary euthanasia. The list goes on, but I think you get the idea.\n\nOnce again, everything can be used for evil. Medicine has been used for evil but saved millions of more people than it has hurt. All the things I listed have helped the world overwhelmingly more than it has hurt it.\n\n&gt; Today's best science could be tomorrow's eugenics if we don't question the ethics and consequences of science with the same scrutiny that proposals for eugenic initiatives should have gotten. Ethical and moral questions are philosophical questions, not scientific ones, but scientists and doctors must answer those questions every single day.\n\nScience is questioned all the time. It's the literal point of science. Someone has a theory or something then someone else disproves that and then someone else adds to it in a different way. In time it gets better and better. Also scientists shouldn't need to answer those questions. Scientists provide all the tools and philosophers/economists/social scientists decide what to do with them.\n\n&gt; Never said it is evil, just that it has been used for evil and that it isn't inherently good -just a tool. To throw the question back at you; Do you believe boats are inherently good?\n\nNo, but boats are more often used for good things than bad.\n\n&gt; I think we're missing a lot of important historic lessons when we enshrine science as inherently good. Who knows how history will view today's science?\n\nI see it like this: Science is the absolute best tool to provide facts and answers. I consider almost all knowledge universally good and science and philosophy are the two main producers of knowledge. The more the people know, the better the world. Therefore I could technically consider science inherently good.\n\nThe future will have progressed and of course see the faults we do not see today. But I ask you one thing; what do you want to do instead of science then? If we just stop with technological progression now we will be stuck with the current faults of science. I therefore consider funding for sciences extremely if not one of the most important things, since it will provide more truth and the more truth we have the better.\n\nEDIT: this also reminds me of the common trope that science is spooky that is based on fear of things that are different. This includes things like the ads with a caption like \"has science gone to far?\" and such. Also note that if you ask an average person who does not know anything about the subject what they think of genetic modification and ultra advanced robotics they will generally be extremely sceptic. This is because they blame it on the wrong thing. They say that it is too risky because some corporation or government is going to try to create an ubermensch ot something. But instead of removing the corporations or governments they see genetic modifications as the problem and are against them. The same with robotics is true because people are suspicious of robotics after automation put so many people out of jobs. Instead of blaming it on the capitalist system which has trouble handling automation, they blame it on the robots. These things are basically less severe versions of climate change denial, but I fear they may be heavily manipulated if we ever get to that point in technology. Another cause might also be all the media about robot revolutions and such. This view mostly seems to be heled by both lower and upper class white people in first world countries since they are generally a bit afraid of change.\n", "edited": 1492470444.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have all been used for war.

The list goes on, but I think you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, everything can be used for evil. Medicine has been used for evil but saved millions of more people than it has hurt. All the things I listed have helped the world overwhelmingly more than it has hurt it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s best science could be tomorrow&amp;#39;s eugenics if we don&amp;#39;t question the ethics and consequences of science with the same scrutiny that proposals for eugenic initiatives should have gotten. Ethical and moral questions are philosophical questions, not scientific ones, but scientists and doctors must answer those questions every single day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Science is questioned all the time. It&amp;#39;s the literal point of science. Someone has a theory or something then someone else disproves that and then someone else adds to it in a different way. In time it gets better and better. Also scientists shouldn&amp;#39;t need to answer those questions. Scientists provide all the tools and philosophers/economists/social scientists decide what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Never said it is evil, just that it has been used for evil and that it isn&amp;#39;t inherently good -just a tool. To throw the question back at you; Do you believe boats are inherently good?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, but boats are more often used for good things than bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;#39;re missing a lot of important historic lessons when we enshrine science as inherently good. Who knows how history will view today&amp;#39;s science?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see it like this: Science is the absolute best tool to provide facts and answers. I consider almost all knowledge universally good and science and philosophy are the two main producers of knowledge. The more the people know, the better the world. Therefore I could technically consider science inherently good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The future will have progressed and of course see the faults we do not see today. But I ask you one thing; what do you want to do instead of science then? If we just stop with technological progression now we will be stuck with the current faults of science. I therefore consider funding for sciences extremely if not one of the most important things, since it will provide more truth and the more truth we have the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: this also reminds me of the common trope that science is spooky that is based on fear of things that are different. This includes things like the ads with a caption like &amp;quot;has science gone to far?&amp;quot; and such. Also note that if you ask an average person who does not know anything about the subject what they think of genetic modification and ultra advanced robotics they will generally be extremely sceptic. This is because they blame it on the wrong thing. They say that it is too risky because some corporation or government is going to try to create an ubermensch ot something. But instead of removing the corporations or governments they see genetic modifications as the problem and are against them. The same with robotics is true because people are suspicious of robotics after automation put so many people out of jobs. Instead of blaming it on the capitalist system which has trouble handling automation, they blame it on the robots. These things are basically less severe versions of climate change denial, but I fear they may be heavily manipulated if we ever get to that point in technology.
