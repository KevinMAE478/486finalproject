If you enjoy it, sure. But the reason it doesn't really count as content that decides whether or not a game is great is because it's a side feature that doesn't really progress your character in view of a larger goal. Random side things were not what made vanilla great. (Transmogging has to fall in this category as well even though I personally enjoy it very much.)\n\nI want to point out that recent expansions vary in quality, strengths and weaknesses. Compare and contrast people's attitudes between Legion and WoD. WoD was such a terrible expansion that if Blizzard had released another expansion like that WoW would have very likely died. I don't want to flesh out a huge argument about why WoD was terrible becuase of the huge circle jerk towards the end of the expansion that it would be beating a dead horse. Plenty of people have [done that already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UYr2ay2iSo). I'd also like to point out that cataclysm was released in 2010, almost 7 years ago now so to include it in your list of \"recent\" expansions doesn't make a lot of sense. So I think you need to fix your scope a little bit depending on what you really mean to say.\n\n&gt;the quests don't feel like grinding anymore\n\n&gt;The dungeon finder is also a huge upgrade from standing outside portals all day\n\nSo, as you can probably tell even if you didn't say it concretely is that TBC and Vanilla WoW were highly inconvenient games relative to the more streamlined version that exists today. The problem with this is that Blizzard added a little too much convenience into the game and made it a little boring. The Garrisons is a great example of convenience gone wild with being able to gather mats without even requiring the professions to do so. I think you'd agree with this sentiment because you said that the dungeon finder could use a nerf which suggests that you understand that too much convenience is a bad thing.\n\nThe reason why the original WoW is so memorable is exactly because of how painfully slow the pacing was in comparison. It took almost 30 minutes to form a group and another couple of minutes to actually visit the summoning stone, this made it difficult to form a party but it meant that players were more invested in each other while working together. This meant that people formed bonds and shared experiences together because of this investment. Compare this to what LFR is like, people barely communicate, if someone does something wrong they get kicked and not everyone is working towards the end goal and just dance next to the boss while everyone else does the heavy lifting. This should really go to show how cancerous a system like LFR is, IMO it doesn't even deserve to be in the game.\n\nIn addition to this, because everything required so much effort to do, there was that much more value in it. The world felt bigger because you had to take flight paths and zeppelins/boats everywhere. The world felt more dangerous because if you ran out of food or water then you'd have to walk all the way back, remember, hearthstone CD was an hour or so. Mobs took longer to kill and if you pulled too many then you'd be dead meat. This meant that you had to constantly be aware of your surroundings. All of this made the game infuriatingly slow paced and frustrating, but that's what made it so damn fun.\n\nThis is why Azeroth feels a little forgettable after the cata remake, you don't spend any significant time in any of the zones since you out level them half way through the story arc. The mobs are too easy to kill and this is something [Ion has mentioned as being a problem](https://youtu.be/hEn8iVkOMd4?t=167). The pacing is all wrong to the point where he says it's \"broken\", and I'd have to agree with that.\n\nYes, nostalgia is a big factor in why TBC and vanilla are so well remembered, but the core reason why people are so intensely nostalgic for these times in the game's growth is because it was much more \"painful\" and hence much more enjoyable. People formed bonds with strangers more readily and the world felt bigger as a result of not being able to teleport everywhere and own crowds of mobs at a time. \n\n*It's not like there hasn't been enough time past after more recent expansions to be nostalgic about them. We're not nostalgic for them because they're not nearly as memorable.*\n\nI have to say though that WoD did have its moments like its raiding scene. When there was content that people weren't bored sick of, it was excellent. I really enjoyed raiding during cata as well. I think Legion has been a pretty good expansion. Blizzard learned two major things from Wod. 1) That people want to go out into the world and interact with each other to give the MMO experience. 2) People don't want regular expansions but regular content. It's a huge step in the right direction and has caused the game to experience a bit of a [revival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgN6HZJ9_F8). It's a matter of getting that balance between pain and pleasure right and recently, they've not been pushing the pain buttons enough for the pleasure button to be worth as much as it used to.", "edited": 1492183573.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll quickly disagree about pet battles being meaningful content.

This should really go to show how cancerous a system like LFR is, IMO it doesn&amp;#39;t even deserve to be in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, because everything required so much effort to do, there was that much more value in it. The world felt bigger because you had to take flight paths and zeppelins/boats everywhere. The world felt more dangerous because if you ran out of food or water then you&amp;#39;d have to walk all the way back, remember, hearthstone CD was an hour or so. Mobs took longer to kill and if you pulled too many then you&amp;#39;d be dead meat. This meant that you had to constantly be aware of your surroundings. All of this made the game infuriatingly slow paced and frustrating, but that&amp;#39;s what made it so damn fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why Azeroth feels a little forgettable after the cata remake, you don&amp;#39;t spend any significant time in any of the zones since you out level them half way through the story arc. The mobs are too easy to kill and this is something &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/hEn8iVkOMd4?t=167\"&gt;Ion has mentioned as being a problem&lt;/a&gt;. The pacing is all wrong to the point where he says it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;, and I&amp;#39;d have to agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, nostalgia is a big factor in why TBC and vanilla are so well remembered, but the core reason why people are so intensely nostalgic for these times in the game&amp;#39;s growth is because it was much more &amp;quot;painful&amp;quot; and hence much more enjoyable. People formed bonds with strangers more readily and the world felt bigger as a result of not being able to teleport everywhere and own crowds of mobs at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like there hasn&amp;#39;t been enough time past after more recent expansions to be nostalgic about them. We&amp;#39;re not nostalgic for them because they&amp;#39;re not nearly as memorable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say though that WoD did have its moments like its raiding scene. When there was content that people weren&amp;#39;t bored sick of, it was excellent. I really enjoyed raiding during cata as well. I think Legion has been a pretty good expansion. Blizzard learned two major things from Wod. 1) That people want to go out into the world and interact with each other to give the MMO experience. 2) People don&amp;#39;t want regular expansions but regular content. It&amp;#39;s a huge step in the right direction and has caused the game to experience a bit of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgN6HZJ9_F8\"&gt;revival&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a matter of getting that balance between pain and pleasure right and recently, they&amp;#39;ve not been pushing the pain buttons enough for the pleasure button to be worth as much as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg98int", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492210851.0, "created_utc": 1492182051.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chl7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chl7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65chl7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9bvjs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Token_Why_Boy", "parent_id": "t1_dg97ctx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like the other guy, changing your view is gonna be hard.
