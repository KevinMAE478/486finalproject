It's a nice way to manipulated facts to suit a specific argument, but when taker in broader context, it seems more likely that african american turnout was down due to the candidate, not any nefarious scheme to prevent them from voting.

Regardless, the NC law shortened the early voting period from 17 days to ten days, however it required polling locations to maintain the same number of hours as the 17 day period. This means that early voting locations would be open longer hours (like 8am to 9pm) instead of four or five hours per day over 17 days. Testimony at trial showed that more people would likely cast ballots during the early voting period if polling locations were open extended hours, rather than more days.\n\n&gt;Get rid of same-day registration\n\nSame day registration can be problematic due to the systems in place to confirm residency before casting a legal ballot.

The problem has a couple facets. \n\nFirst, IDs cost money. The cost varies from state to state, but it can be anywhere from $8.50 to $30. To people without a lot of money, $30 could be an entire week's worth of groceries. \n\nSecond, it requires lots of documents. You need a copy of your social security card, your birth certificate, proof of residency. If you lost or never got your SSN card or BC, that's extra money you have to throw in just to get an ID. If you're homeless, it's going to be a lot more difficult to provide proof of residency. And then that could open a whole thing where homeless people aren't allowed to vote, which is obviously a problem.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, getting an ID takes time. You have to gather the correct documents, go to the DMV, wait however long (could be hours). Getting to the DMV could be really difficult if you live in an area where the nearest DMV is 20 miles away from you and you don't have a car or rely on public transport. In some cities, it could take 2 hours just to get there and back. This also means you have to schedule time off work, which is difficult if you work a low-end job where the management isn't likely to give you whatever free time you want. Also, that could potentially be a whole day's worth of work you just lost out on, which means a whole day's worth of money. And then there's the consideration of if you have kids. If they're too young, you have to bring them with you, but what if they go to school and you're at the DMV when they get off? Can't have that.\n\nSo it would be an extra burden placed on poor people who are more likely to be black or Hispanic. Like I said, if the government or state governments provided free IDs for anyone that could be sent to them, then I don't think anyone would actually have a problem with showing your ID to vote. But since that's not the case and probably won't happen anytime soon for a variety of reasons, it impacts less people with no downsides (voter fraud is virtually non-existent and a non-issue) to just not require an ID to vote.\n\nEdit: I'm turning off notifications for this.

This makes the share of middle class+ voters higher, relative to the total population, whereas right now that group actually represents less than 50% of the nation. (Half of all Americans earn less than 31k/yr, no one calls that middle class)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Middle class+ voters are more likely to vote republican than are working class on down voters. Though the presidential election this year threw a wrench in those works, it does still demonstrate that minority groups are very strongly against the republicans, so anything they can do to lessen the influence of those groups the more it helps them. Even if they toss aside some of their own (poor white) voters they get to compete for the middle class+ vote which is tilted toward their side of the field. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond that a lot of older minority people, due to very real legislated hatred, avoided interacting with the government. In some cases their generational poverty made it so they never owned a car to drive in the first place. Unlike poor whites, who generally had some form of government photo ID already, these groups were less likely to possess such documents. Beyond that they were less likely to have immediate access to the documents needed to get one&amp;#39;s first ID (birth certificate, social security card, proof of address.) All of those pieces cost money to get, and generally require at least one or two other forms of ID, which again they just didn&amp;#39;t have.

Where IDs cost money, the amount might not be much to you and me. But, to a lot of people... $5, $10 is a lot of money. Not to mention racial gaps in car ownership and access to places which one could more conveniently gain a voter ID or photo ID.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, most blacks and Hispanics have cars, and this would likely effect only the poorest among them... but, because they are disproportionately poorer, it would affect a greater number of them when compared to whites. But, that&amp;#39;s important, especially in close elections, and especially in poor states and counties where the racial wealth gap is much larger than the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These voter-ID laws are similar in some ways to poll tests, in that poll tests themselves may not be racist... but, they were certainly intended to disproportionately affect black voters, who were, at the time, disproportionately less educated than whites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgakes6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492285829.0, "created_utc": 1492257029.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65inz6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgapul2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "raka_defocus", "parent_id": "t3_65inz6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'll use my own state as an example.
