It happens, in an effort to make seats cheaper for the average consumer, and these incidents where passengers have to be removed &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4cb5744-1e9d-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9\"&gt;are the exception, not the rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;United Airlines should have chosen another customer when the randomly drawn person proves to be belligerent.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree with this sentiment. How do you justify this action to these two groups: 1) The first three people who left without incident? 2) The follow-up customer you must choose to replace the belligerent one?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In both groups, they suddenly now have recourse to regain their seats - by being belligerent and obstructive. By engaging that type of personality, United Airlines is opening themselves up to potential liability (&lt;em&gt;i.e. customers may demand even more money than they offer and sue for not being given the option to &amp;#39;be obstructive&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;)...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...but more importantly, by engaging that type of personality, it means that the problem at hand does not get solved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The airport police should not have used such force.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three points in regards to this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, you must delineate - airport police &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; United Airlines. United Airlines hands were clean the moment they called security. Airport police typically work inside of the terminal, and are legal representatives of the executive branch of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As legal representatives of the executive branch of government, they were beholden to the laws: the removal of a trespasser from private property. The longer this man remained on this plane, the more trespassing they were doing, and costing the company increasing amounts of money in damages (&lt;em&gt;via delays&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk about the greater overreach of the police, I don&amp;#39;t think this is the place to do it. Right now, United Airlines is taking the brunt for the actions of these officers, who are not paid United Airlines employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;United Airlines should have offered more compensation and handled this in a sloppy manner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the only point presented I will tentatively concede to. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a fuck up - this should have been handled before any passenger reached the gate. But it didn&amp;#39;t, something, somewhere, got lost in translation.. some kind of human error occured, and people in charge realized: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Crap. We have to fix this issue.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally, this happens prior to boarding, but very rarely does it happen post-boarding. They had a decision to make, and they made it, following their proper protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In regards to the compensation offered, I can&amp;#39;t speak to it. I don&amp;#39;t have enough information on the plans they offer and what kind of negotiations they conduct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, I feel this does not matter - at some point, negotiations failed, and the passenger was declared as obstructive by the Captain. The Captain must be obeyed by the staff, and the staff had to call the police, as they (the staff) were not authorised to use force. I do not think this is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Sloppy, maybe, but that does not make the decision a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;United Airlines was trying to accommodate staff over passengers.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are a business and have every right to do so, if it&amp;#39;s in the interest of keeping their business working more efficiently overall.

After that payout, they should address how the issue happened and aim to avoid it in the future. The issue is that they have a clause which limits compensation they can offer (1350? Iirc), (their contract of carriage). Clearly they should add exemptions for situations where they have no choice.\n\nAlso, contract of carriage states the legal reasons for removing a passenger, none of them state \"to allow employees to be moved\" or anything remotely similar. I would link but I'm on mobile, however, this is public on their website.

Some of the interpretation is subjective, and other details aren't known, but let's see if United violated what they laid down. \n\nFirst, some basics (Rule 3, section H and section K)\n\n&gt;No employee or agent of UA has the authority to alter, modify, or waive any fare rules or any provision of the Contract of Carriage unless authorized by a corporate officer of UA.\n\n&gt;Except where provided otherwise by law, UA\u2019s conditions of carriage, rules and tariffs are subject to change without notice, provided that no such change shall apply to Tickets issued prior to the effective date of such change.\n\n&gt;To the extent there is a conflict between this Contract of Carriage and any terms and conditions printed on or in any ticket, ticket jacket or eticket receipt, this Contract governs.\n\nThat last one is taken from the top. Sorry for the weird linearity. In ascending order, we have (as I see it) that tickets/ticket folders do not overwrite the Contract of Carriage. Pretty straightforward, but it means that if the ticket says something that contradicts what United has in the Contract, you go by the Contract. Next we have that the Contract can change without notice (so they can have it say whatever they want whenever they want) *however* it does not affect any tickets that have already been issued. In other words, this version of the Contract is relevant to the situation this last Monday (Sunday?). And finally, the uppermost rule means that only select few are given the ability to negotiate this contract- though even if they did, it would not affect tickets already distributed.\n\nAlright, since part of your argument centered around the 'overbooking', lets head down there, that's section 25:\n\n&gt;When there is an Oversold UA flight that originates in the U.S.A. or Canada, the following provisions apply:\n\nRight off the bat we have a problem. *Was the flight oversold?* We're fairly certain that if it was oversold, it was oversold by *one*. And that one person did voluntarily decide not to be boarded before the plane was, well boarded. Which gets us to the other problem: this is about denied boarding compensation. The gentleman in question wasn't actually ever denied boarding. So if the flight counts as oversold after the issue has already been appropriately handled, it'll have to also count as being denied boarding- which again *he wasn't*. Even if he was, we have to assume that the flight crew either lied, or the body of reporting available misinterpreted their statements.\n\nRule 25 2b states:\n\n&gt;The priority of all other confirmed passengers may be determined based on a passenger\u2019s fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and the time in which the passenger presents him/herself for check-in without advanced seat assignment.\n\nThis isn't a random lottery as implied by many articles.\n\n&gt;The request for volunteers and the selection of such person to be denied space will be in a manner determined solely by UA.\n\nBut the request for volunteers is left to United Airlines. This sounds like someone applying a part of United Airline's contract to a different part of the contract- which is *wrong*. The only way out is if 1), the flight was not oversold, 2) the man was denied boarding (he wasn't) and 3), United Airlines used whichever program was required and it churned out those four seats. This is an entirely possible turn of events, but I'm stopped at #1 and #2 in particular. Because if he wasn't denied boarding, he was removed from the flight.\n\nThere's a completely different section that addresses being removed from the flight, section 21. Specifically, United Airlines can refuse to transfer or remove from the aircraft at any point for the following reasons: \n\n&gt;Breach of Contract of Carriage \u2013 Failure by Passenger to comply with the Rules of the Contract of Carriage.\n\nPretty straightforward. It's possible that he broke the Contract of Carriage in some other section that I haven't read; I don't know. But in the parts I have read, the gentleman in question has not broken any of their rules. The next two deal with weather, and government, and part D gives airlines a right to search passengers. E requires a person to prove their identity at request, and F deals with failure to pay. G is for internationals, and then we reach a big one: H, Safety. The first four are the particularly important ones, though maybe our gentleman was barefoot, or pregnant at nine months.\n\n&gt;Safety \u2013 Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew including, but not limited to:\nPassengers whose conduct is disorderly, offensive, abusive, or violent;\nPassengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security directives;\nPassengers who assault any employee of UA, including the gate agents and flight crew, or any UA Passenger;\nPassengers who, through and as a result of their conduct, cause a disturbance such that the captain or member of the cockpit crew must leave the cockpit in order to attend to the disturbance;\n\nFirst off, it's not *limited* to these. But by the same token, I think the second one has the best chance of being applied. It's pretty clear that the individuals have to comply with the flight crew. However, do they have to comply to the managers? It's also pretty clear he wasn't interfering with their duties. At the end of the day, United was the one that called the airport police after they fucked up their own rules and regulations, resulting in the situation in the first place!\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at &lt;a href=\"https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx\"&gt;United&amp;#39;s Contract of Carriage&lt;/a&gt;: because it makes sense to judge United by &lt;em&gt;their own rules&lt;/em&gt;.

Even if he was, we have to assume that the flight crew either lied, or the body of reporting available misinterpreted their statements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule 25 2b states:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The priority of all other confirmed passengers may be determined based on a passenger\u2019s fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and the time in which the passenger presents him/herself for check-in without advanced seat assignment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a random lottery as implied by many articles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The request for volunteers and the selection of such person to be denied space will be in a manner determined solely by UA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the request for volunteers is left to United Airlines. This sounds like someone applying a part of United Airline&amp;#39;s contract to a different part of the contract- which is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. The only way out is if 1), the flight was not oversold, 2) the man was denied boarding (he wasn&amp;#39;t) and 3), United Airlines used whichever program was required and it churned out those four seats. This is an entirely possible turn of events, but I&amp;#39;m stopped at #1 and #2 in particular. Because if he wasn&amp;#39;t denied boarding, he was removed from the flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a completely different section that addresses being removed from the flight, section 21. Specifically, United Airlines can refuse to transfer or remove from the aircraft at any point for the following reasons: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Breach of Contract of Carriage \u2013 Failure by Passenger to comply with the Rules of the Contract of Carriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward. It&amp;#39;s possible that he broke the Contract of Carriage in some other section that I haven&amp;#39;t read; I don&amp;#39;t know. But in the parts I have read, the gentleman in question has not broken any of their rules. The next two deal with weather, and government, and part D gives airlines a right to search passengers. E requires a person to prove their identity at request, and F deals with failure to pay. G is for internationals, and then we reach a big one: H, Safety. The first four are the particularly important ones, though maybe our gentleman was barefoot, or pregnant at nine months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safety \u2013 Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew including, but not limited to:\nPassengers whose conduct is disorderly, offensive, abusive, or violent;\nPassengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security directives;\nPassengers who assault any employee of UA, including the gate agents and flight crew, or any UA Passenger;\nPassengers who, through and as a result of their conduct, cause a disturbance such that the captain or member of the cockpit crew must leave the cockpit in order to attend to the disturbance;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; to these. But by the same token, I think the second one has the best chance of being applied. It&amp;#39;s pretty clear that the individuals have to comply with the flight crew. However, do they have to comply to the managers? It&amp;#39;s also pretty clear he wasn&amp;#39;t interfering with their duties. At the end of the day, United was the one that called the airport police after they fucked up their own rules and regulations, resulting in the situation in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg5nk2h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492016168.0, "created_utc": 1491987368.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wmz7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wmz7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wmz7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wmz7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wmz7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6hii0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "parent_id": "t1_dg6hi5y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/CriticalityIncident ([3\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/CriticalityIncident)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

Minor or not it would&amp;#39;ve made a difference.

However, again returning to the objective facts, if this method of handling the situation was designed to reduce the damages done to United in delays, it obviously failed considering the plane was kept there for another two hours and the guy was eventually let back onto the plane. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg5vjm7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033585.0, "created_utc": 1492004785.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wmz7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5srkl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nepene", "parent_id": "t3_64wmz7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;United Airlines has a legal right to remove someone from their private property after making every effort to accommodate them for their purchase. \n\nThey don't.
