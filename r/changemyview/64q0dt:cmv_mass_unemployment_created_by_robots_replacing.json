In fact a the [majority of economists](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437296/economists-against-ubi) really don't think its a realizable idea, and don't think it will be a solution for unemployment due to technology. \n\n&gt;the population should still be able to maintain their current standards of living but with a decreased workload.\n\nThat is based on a TON of ifs.

Nothing is really robot proof.\n\n&gt;These remaining jobs could be distributed amongst people in a way that only requires most people to work a few days a week.\n\nThe ways those jobs work that's actually not a good thing. Much of those jobs require constant attention and focus of a singular individual or team of individuals... switching people in and out wont make it better.
