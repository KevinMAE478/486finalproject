Together, they account for 70% of the US market. As much as they try to distinguish themselves, they all selling exactly the same product. They all have the same pressures on them including fuel costs, the logistics of moving empty planes around, winning the loyalty of frequent fliers, etc. Like Coke and Pepsi, there isn't a lot of room for them to differentiate their goods.\n\nThis means that there aren't a lot of flights in the US where one airline is dramatically cheaper than another. A New York to Los Angeles flight pretty much costs the same for each airline. There are exceptions when it's the hub of the airline. Delta has an advantage in Atlanta, American has Dallas, and United has Chicago. (Southwestern is a little bit different because it uses a point to point model rather than a hub and spoke model, and it doesn't have reserved seats, but the other three are largely the same.)\n\nThis means that PR makes a big difference. Think about Coke and Pepsi. Say they are in vending machines right next to one another. They taste the same, cost the same, and are equally available. The only thing distinguishing them is their marketing. And if Coke just put out a funny Super Bowl commercial, and the CEO of Pepsi just got arrested for stomping on a puppy, it's likely you'll go with the Coke, all things being equal. \n\nSure United can offer discounts, but that means millions in lost revenue. Just to get to a neutral position against Delta and American, they have to be cheaper every time. **Ultimately, all American airlines are going to suck. The trick is to suck slightly less than your competition.** United really screwed up their reputation with this video. Before I thought all of them sucked equally. Now I will always book with one of the other three, unless United really is much cheaper.

Together, they account for 70% of the US market. As much as they try to distinguish themselves, they all selling exactly the same product. They all have the same pressures on them including fuel costs, the logistics of moving empty planes around, winning the loyalty of frequent fliers, etc. Like Coke and Pepsi, there isn&amp;#39;t a lot of room for them to differentiate their goods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that there aren&amp;#39;t a lot of flights in the US where one airline is dramatically cheaper than another. A New York to Los Angeles flight pretty much costs the same for each airline. There are exceptions when it&amp;#39;s the hub of the airline. Delta has an advantage in Atlanta, American has Dallas, and United has Chicago. (Southwestern is a little bit different because it uses a point to point model rather than a hub and spoke model, and it doesn&amp;#39;t have reserved seats, but the other three are largely the same.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that PR makes a big difference. Think about Coke and Pepsi. Say they are in vending machines right next to one another. They taste the same, cost the same, and are equally available. The only thing distinguishing them is their marketing. And if Coke just put out a funny Super Bowl commercial, and the CEO of Pepsi just got arrested for stomping on a puppy, it&amp;#39;s likely you&amp;#39;ll go with the Coke, all things being equal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure United can offer discounts, but that means millions in lost revenue. Just to get to a neutral position against Delta and American, they have to be cheaper every time. &lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, all American airlines are going to suck. The trick is to suck slightly less than your competition.&lt;/strong&gt; United really screwed up their reputation with this video. Before I thought all of them sucked equally. Now I will always book with one of the other three, unless United really is much cheaper.
