This is necessarily true, since our assignments of meaning to terms in a language is arbitrary. No word *inherently* represents the concept it expresses in a language. (For more on this type of argument, see section 3, [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/). )\n\nThe second thing you've asserted - that the longer certain terms stick around, the more problematic they get - is less plausible. \n\nIt's true that one of the standard tactics of people who want to destroy and silence ideas that they oppose is to \"co-opt\" the lingo that people use in expressing those ideas. They'll then either assign it a negative connotation (as you say,) or, they'll assign it a distorted meaning that effectively makes people who hear it used confused about what it really means. \n\nYou are suggesting that we can't avoid these negative affects, and that it may be better to drop their use altogether. There are at least two reasons why this is probably not advisable. \n\nTo begin with, when you're talking about a big system of ideas and principles (i.e., a theory,) you're talking about a lot of nuanced information. Theoretical terms do important work in our theories and our discussions about our theories. If we just abandon all or many of them, it will become nearly impossible to keep track of the theories themselves (and even harder to *teach* these theories to people who don't know about them.) So, abandoning all our theoretical terms is basically just giving up. If you think these theories are really important and needed, giving up on them altogether is out of the question. \n\nAnother reason not to drop terms that are usurped is that, if you work very carefully, the false definition of a term can be a way to introduce its *proper* definition. Similarly, it is can be used to point out weaknesses in the false interpretation of the theory it occurs in. \n\nTake the following example. \n\nI say, \"I'm a feminist.\"\n\nSomeone responds, \"wtf? Why do you hate men? That's sexist.\"\n\nMe: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nThem: \"Modern feminists hate all men.\"\n\nMe: \"Who specifically are you talking about?\"\n\nThem: \"Raging pink-haired blah blah blah\"\n\nMe: \"Have you ever actually heard or read a feminist who said this?\"\n\nThem: \"A famous feminist said, 'men are rapists and that's all they are.'\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, yeah, that was a great speech. She really did a good job of explaining how society dehumanizes men.\"\n\nThem: \"That's not what she did she said men are rapists...\"\n\nMe: \"Actually, that is only half the sentence. The full quote is, 'In a patriarchal society, men are rapists and that's all they are.'.\"\n\nThem: \"That's sexist against men.\"\n\nMe: \"It's sexist to say that if society defines women as having less of a say than men, they also define men as overpowering women, even if they both agree? Because, that's what that means. If I *falsely* define women as having less power than men, then no matter what, the man's decision will always overpower a woman's decision. Since rape is what occurs when one person overpowers another person and has sex with them, that definition makes all heterosexual sex rape. It's obviously *false* that all heterosexual sex is rape, not to mention the fact that its super demeaning to both men *and* women. So, a society that defines men as having more of a say than women is inherently irrational and harmful to everyone, regardless of their gender.\"\n\nWill this always work? Of course not. Some people are really invested in and blinded by their biases. But, they would be that way no matter *which* terms we used. \n\nHowever, a lot of people really are at least trying to be open to reason.\n\n\nOh, I thought of one more reason to stick to the original terms. Say someone comes to gain a better understanding of a term. Then, when they hear it misused, it will be *extremely* noticeable to them. They might even themselves start trying to counteract misinformation surrounding them. At the very least, it will cause them to pause and consider the source of this misuse. They might then be more skeptical of *other* things people say about theories whose terms they misuse. So, learning the correct meaning of a single term can be a very powerful motivator for changing a *multitude* of false beliefs.\n\n ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, you&amp;#39;re sort of asserting two things, one of them necessarily true and the other one not so obviously true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The obviously true thing you&amp;#39;re saying is that no term is impervious to being usurped and assigned a negative meaning.

She really did a good job of explaining how society dehumanizes men.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not what she did she said men are rapists...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Actually, that is only half the sentence. The full quote is, &amp;#39;In a patriarchal society, men are rapists and that&amp;#39;s all they are.&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s sexist against men.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s sexist to say that if society defines women as having less of a say than men, they also define men as overpowering women, even if they both agree? Because, that&amp;#39;s what that means. If I &lt;em&gt;falsely&lt;/em&gt; define women as having less power than men, then no matter what, the man&amp;#39;s decision will always overpower a woman&amp;#39;s decision. Since rape is what occurs when one person overpowers another person and has sex with them, that definition makes all heterosexual sex rape. It&amp;#39;s obviously &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; that all heterosexual sex is rape, not to mention the fact that its super demeaning to both men &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; women. So, a society that defines men as having more of a say than women is inherently irrational and harmful to everyone, regardless of their gender.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will this always work? Of course not. Some people are really invested in and blinded by their biases. But, they would be that way no matter &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; terms we used. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, a lot of people really are at least trying to be open to reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, I thought of one more reason to stick to the original terms. Say someone comes to gain a better understanding of a term. Then, when they hear it misused, it will be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; noticeable to them. They might even themselves start trying to counteract misinformation surrounding them. At the very least, it will cause them to pause and consider the source of this misuse. They might then be more skeptical of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things people say about theories whose terms they misuse. So, learning the correct meaning of a single term can be a very powerful motivator for changing a &lt;em&gt;multitude&lt;/em&gt; of false beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg8rp4h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173610.0, "created_utc": 1492144810.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659dsl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8kdmh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jstevewhite", "parent_id": "t3_659dsl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know if I disagree, per se, but I'd say there are many words that only have negative connotations in specific contexts.
