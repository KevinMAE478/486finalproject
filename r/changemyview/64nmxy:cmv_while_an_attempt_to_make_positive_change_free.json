Look, when I was a younger man, it was rare to meet a man or woman with a college degree. It was assumed that meant they were smarter than the rest of us, although obviously that wasn&amp;#39;t always the case, and still isn&amp;#39;t. The working class obviously think we are smarter than the college folks because we actually, you know--work for a living. But back then a college degree carried a lot of weight.  Nowadays a college degree just means you are a well educated security guard where I work--and I am not joking with that at all. I wish I was, in fact. The bottom line is the younger generation is getting screwed and it is about to get even worse when you consider how many jobs may be disappearing in the future thanks to new technologies. Also, to throw one other monkey wrench in the free college debate even if the degrees are free to the kids, and there is some latent value in each degree which I don&amp;#39;t foresee, they really aren&amp;#39;t free. You, as a young person are plunking down four years of your life down to earn it. That is a cost right there no one ever talks about. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg3o4oh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904647.0, "created_utc": 1491875847.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3n6te", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheLordoftheGuys", "parent_id": "t1_dg3mvpi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree with your assessment of what is currently happening with the prices of colleges, and I agree that students mustn't waste all of their time in college on degrees that have no real future (have a gender studies degree but make sure you have another degree that allows it to be useful in a field).
