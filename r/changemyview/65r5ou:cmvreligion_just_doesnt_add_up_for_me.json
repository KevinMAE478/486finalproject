To start off I wanted to mention why I believe religion exists. I think religion was created because of society&amp;#39;s natural fear of death. To some extent almost no one wants to believe this is our only life and there is nothing after it. Because of this fear I tihnk many religions were created. One of the biggest problems I have with religion is there are not consistent at all. Sure you could say Christianity based religions all revolve around Christ, but there are religions that don&amp;#39;t worship Christ.  There are different factors, in my opinion, that dictate which religion you believe, if you do. This is partially based upon the people around you, like family and friends, or your research on the internet. The problem I have is a lot of  people claim there religion is the right one, with no actual reason as to why that is. The thought of a afterlife is very pleasing to hear for most people, but if people around you believe it, you feel more comfortable believing it. Saying you have faith is just another way of saying you have no explanation. If there are over 1000 religions, then not every one of them can be right. Scientists have proven that our consciousness  and memories are all in our brain. One deep question to consider is if someone is a upstanding citizen with no sins, then they get a traumatic brain injury that changes there personality and makes them commit sins, are they going to hell? Religions might be tradition, but believing in one just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. It is true that no one can prove the afterlife, but  there is no factual basis in any of them, and there is just too many. You can&amp;#39;t prove a negative. No one can prove santa doesn&amp;#39;t exist, but people believe he doesn&amp;#39;t. Religion is like that too. You can&amp;#39;t prove it exists, but the only difference is people are more willing to believe it because it relates to the afterlife.

That's an appropriate social context (a business isn't a \"religious\" setting, taxes isn't a \"religious\" activity) but not a proper context for understanding the subject of what people believe and worldviews. For that, we're talking about \"belief structures\". Assumptions you build on, and defend with your best reasoning, rumors, stories, and things. \n\nA \"religion\" is usually just a traditionalist belief structure with legendary stories and supernatural themes to describe what's beyond that horizon of what we know for sure. These are belief structures that believe (trust) that deliberate action and possibly objective goals are behind the cosmos, whereas secular belief structures believe (trust) in chance and arbitrary luck without goals or intentionality. These are gamblers versus choosers, and choosers tend to deliberately choose their faiths and have conversions, whereas gamblers tend to say it's just the cards they were dealt (an atheist will never say they chose atheism) and try to play them, which they mistake for navigating facts. These are mindsets and personalities and approaches to life, not based on facts or information, but perspectives and experiences. Still, they'll both say *things* are one way or another (rather than the believer is), and begin circular reasoning, lying, cherry-picking, and embellishing with complex hyperlogic or ultra-emotion when your questioning goes beyond what's knowable, but they still seem to know. People do that because it's how they feel and experience the world and have to think that's how it really is, to believe they're whole. It's an omniscience/omnipotence thing, based in insecurity, which is why these are group activities and turned outward. Lots of people don't form worldviews at all or question what religion is or anything, and may figure that's all taken care of. Lots of belief structures start by trying to convince people something's wrong (sin, you've been lied to, etc.).\n\nAnyway, here's a crack in your reasoning:\n\n&gt;I have put some deep thought into this, and the whole concept of religion just doesn't make sense for me.. I think religion was created because of society's natural fear of death.\n\nYou don't understand religion and it doesn't make sense to you, but you think you especially know why society does it. When talking about belief structures, that's a problem. Since there are no rules and anything goes, you *really* need to be the accountable one and track your own logic hard, and mind the horizon of what you know for sure.\n\nThe realest thing to do would be remain consistent: e.g. \"The whole concept of religion just doesn't make sense for me. I think it was probably created, and I don't know why. If I created a religion, it would be because I'm very afraid of death.\"\n\n&gt;Because of this fear I tihnk many religions were created.\n\nFor legendary stories, the motivator is usually hope and assuring the future generation to maintain a degree of order in their lives, so that the god will be faithful to reward it, so as to motivate cultural unity and prosperity. It's about having some kind of order and meaning in circumstances that can be so dire you wouldn't want to live, or fear death, but more fear the futility of a hard life and suffering for nothing.\n\n&gt;The problem I have is a lot of people claim there religion is the right one, with no actual reason as to why that is.\n\nBecause it's working for them, which is the biggest proof interpersonally.\n\n&gt;The thought of a afterlife is very pleasing to hear for most people, but if people around you believe it, you feel more comfortable believing it.\n\nThis is a common misconception by people who don't understand the traditions but know generalizations about them. Afterlives are actually incredibly downplayed, and seldom if not almost never mentioned. You only really hear about them at funerals, and the afterlives are usually very generic, if they even exist (Judaism, for example, doesn't identify one). The formal afterlife of the spiritual literature is usually very different than what the average believer thinks (Christians don't go to heaven according to The Bible, Jesus returns and establishes a supernatural messianic theocracy on Earth, resurrecting everybody and damning most). Of course the official belief is heaven, but the textual description is..that. Most folks don't even bother to reconcile it because nobody cares much about the afterlife.\n\n&gt;Saying you have faith is just another way of saying you have no explanation.\n\nMost folks aren't using their belief structures to explain things. \"Faith\" historically and cross-culturally means something like \"trust\". You have faith, or trust in the god's good character to not abandon or trick you.\n\n&gt;If there are over 1000 religions, then not every one of them can be right.\n\nSome of them think they're all right. Gandhi thought that.\n\n&gt;Scientists have proven that our consciousness and memories are all in our brain.\n\nOkay well whatever meanings or conclusions you draw from that isn't scientific.\n\n&gt;You can't prove a negative. No one can prove santa doesn't exist, but people believe he doesn't. Religion is like that too. You can't prove it exists, but the only difference is people are more willing to believe it because it relates to the afterlife. There might be an afterlife, but if there is, most likely it won't be anything like any religion in the world expects it to be.\n\nThat's just not accurate. The afterlife isn't the key driver or even a key feature in most of these belief structures.\n\nPeople believe in these gods because they try them out, build confidence and have structure, reconcile guilt and feelings of emptiness and nihilism, and realize they're responding to *something* and therefore believe it's as real as it seems.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well to have this conversation, for starters, &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t an appropriate way to understand what we&amp;#39;re talking about, because it creates a false dichotomy (religious, non-religious).
