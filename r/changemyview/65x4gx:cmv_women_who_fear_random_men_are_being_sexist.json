I understand well enough why they&amp;#39;d do so, it isn&amp;#39;t a judgement that all men are more violent or dangerous, it&amp;#39;s perfectly normal, functional, reasonable caution toward a person both more likely to be dangerous to them and more capable of doing harm to them, in a circumstance/environment where that&amp;#39;s elevated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgdvp4x", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492482107.0, "created_utc": 1492453307.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x4gx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge5uv6", "gilded": 1, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Just_Treading_Water", "parent_id": "t3_65x4gx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So I'm going to have to go with your female friends here and agree that you generally just don't get it because you don't understand what they face on an almost daily basis.  You bring up the power differential, which as you pointed out can also be a significant problem for a male, but you have completely decontextualised from the world that people live in.\n\nCurrent statistics put 1 out of every 5 women in the US have been sexually assaulted, compared to 1 in 71 men.  \n\nThink about that for a minute...  \n\nAny time you are sitting in a room with 5 women, there's a good chance that one of them has been subject to sexual violence at some point in their life. In a 300 person university auditorium class, assuming a 50% gender balance 30 of those women have been sexually assaulted compared to 2 of the men. Even if a woman has been lucky enough not to be assaulted, there's a good chance it has happened to at least one of her friends and they have talked about it.\n\nSo that is straight up sexual assault.  Let's look at the day to day experience for an average woman:\n\n65% of all women had experienced street harassment\n23%  had been sexually touched\n20% had been followed\n9% had been forced to do something sexual\n\nSo that is just going about their day, minding their own business walking to or from work or running errands. They are continually subjected to objectification,  harassment, and violence.  All of this sends a message of \"you are not safe\".  A message that many women are bombarded with every time they leave their home.\n\nNow what if they go out to bar or for drinks somewhere.  Have you ever been out somewhere and seen a guy giving unwanted attention to a girl or group of girls? have you ever seen that situation where the guy or guys is not picking up on the social queues and the girl has to verbally let him know that his attention is unwanted?  Have you ever seen that guy respond with anger? or invective? Maybe he calls her a lesbian, or a bitch, or ironically a whore. Maybe he says something about how she is dressed or tells her she just needs a good fuck and indicates he's the guy to do it.  Maybe he even makes a rape \"joke\".  Maybe he gets physical?\n\nOr maybe none of this happens and some guy just decides to drug their drink.  A recent study of three US college campuses found that 1 in 13 people report having been involuntarily drugged in the previous academic year (79 percent of the victims were female).  17% of those drugged reported having unwanted sex.\n\nAs an aside, it is also worth pointing out that 1 out of 100 students surveyed admitted to drugging someone or knew someone who had drugged someone (the overwhelming majority of whom were men) - which means that at any given bar or any given party there is likely between 1 and 10 people who have been willing to involuntarily drug someone in the past. \n\nThis doesn't even begin to tap into the online culture of misogyny. Just take a look at reddit (never mind the shittier parts of the web).  If a girl posts a picture that happens to include her body and or face -- it doesn't matter if it is a picture showing off the amazing cosplay or some amazing accomplishment.  A significant number of the posts are either calling her an attention whore, commenting on her looks, or detailing what the commenter would like to do to her. Compare this to male redditors who post pictures of their achievements that also happen to include their bodies or faces.  It really is appalling. \n\nSo now throw into this the power differential that you mentioned. Where most women would not be able to physically prevent violence against them or get away.  \n\nIt's not just that women are afraid someone will sucker punch them out of the blue (as a man might be) but that they live in a culture where people are constantly telling or showing them that they are powerless, and then proving it to them or their friends on an absolutely astonishing scale - 20% of women have been sexually assaulted.\n\nTo bring this back to you, and how the world is a different place for you (and men in general):\n\nHow many times have you been catcalled while walking down the street? \nHow many times have you been followed while walking down the street?\nHow many times have you had someone \"accidentally\" touch your ass or your junk?\nHas a girl ever called you an asshole or threatened you with violence for turning down her advances?\nHave you or any of your male friends ever been involuntarily drugged while out?\n\nNow here's a bit of a ridiculous thought experiment. \n\nLet's imagine that you did something stupid and ended up in jail.  Not just any jail, but a jail that contains a significant number of gender-indiscriminate rapists  - maybe 1-2% of the prison population, so out of a prison population of 5000, there might be 50-100 of these predatory types.\n\nMost of the inmates here are hardened criminals, maybe they are naturally large individuals, maybe they've been working out continually since they were incarcerated, or maybe they just have an impressive capacity for violence. Now imagine you are smaller than 80-90% of the rest of these big potentially violent offenders.\n\nYou arrive, and as a \"new fish\", people fuck with you.  There are lots of catcalls and comments about not dropping the soap or about your pretty mouth.  Maybe the comments are more innocuous, and someone tells you that you'd be prettier if you smiled more often, or that the orange of your jumpsuit really brought out the colour of your eyes. Now imagine that when you are in the communal showers one of these big inmates sets up in the shower immediately next to you, despite the shower being empty, maybe he makes eye contact with you while he soaps his junk. Imagine that you run into one of the catcallers while out in the yard, maybe they follow you around for a bit, maybe he tells you he can't wait for tonight.\n\nHow would you be feeling in these moments?  Would you be giving in to \"illogical fear\"? and trying to keep your distance from the other inmates? Do you think you might start fearing random men and start taking precautions for your own safety?\n\nNow I know, you are going to say \"that is a totally over the top and ridiculous scenario\", but is it?  In general, men are bigger than women.  It is probably not ridiculous to imagine a woman who is smaller than 80-90% of all the men around her.  The statistics put 1% of people surveyed at willing to involuntarily drug someone, and another survey done between 1991 and 1998, 1882 college students were surveyed and found that for 120 out of those 1882 (about 6%) the descriptions of their sexual activities met the criteria for rape or attempted rape, but who had not been charged. Eighty-one percent of these undetected rapists reported that they had had sex with women who were incapacitated because of drugs or alcohol. Not all of the people in the prison catcalling or fucking with you would actually rape you or assault you, but some of them would.  How can you tell the difference? Is it reasonable to be afraid?\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to have to go with your female friends here and agree that you generally just don&amp;#39;t get it because you don&amp;#39;t understand what they face on an almost daily basis.

I am afraid of being alone with men whether I know them or not. Men are perpetuators of most sexual assaults, and almost all assaults on strangers. It must be uncomfortable to be grouped with rapists when a woman turns around rather than pass you in an alley or sits by another woman on a bus. I can see how that seems unfair, but it isn't about you individually. The color of a person's skin does not influence the likelihood of robbing a bank independent of their socioeconomic class, a person's gender does increase their risk of being a more powerful sexual predator, even if that risk is low. Most people know no more than one person involved in a bank robbery or murder (most). We all know multiple people who are rape victims. Also, I'm aware of female rapists. However, I'm a very very unlikely target for them, so I'm less afraid of them, although I want them to have the same consequences as male offenders. Also, imagine how many more women would be raped if we did not take precautions? If I walked around my city drunk every night in secluded areas at the same time could I make it a year without being assaulted by a man again? Almost certainly not. My viewpoint is not sexist. If 15-20% of your acquaintances died in auto accidents before they were 30, you would make sure your car was safe and would avoid potentially dangerous situations with other cars. Would you hate cars? No, not all cars are dangerous, but a significant number of them are.  I'm curious how you think caution with a gender can be the same  as caution of a race. Most terrorists in America have been white. You are more likely to be robbed by a white person if you are white and a black person if you are black. I'm more afraid of larger and younger individuals, not because they are more likely to rape, but if they attempt to rape, I am less likely to overpower them. If you said, \"I'm cautious with women, because I don't want to be  accused of sexual harassment or for women to feel harassed and I think about that often in how I approach women,\" I would applaud you for taking those considerations. For every man like you, who thinks women are sexist for being cautious of men, there is another who will ask her if she led her rapist on or could have avoided the assault. Sometimes, those dichotomies can come out of the same mouth.  If you continue to maintain your views, maybe you should ask yourself why you feel that way. It seems like you may be offended that you occasionally have to think about risks women face, while forgetting this is something we face severe consequences for if we are not on guard for it all the time. Politicians are pushing for women to have to keep their rape embryos and defunding their access to std tests. If you want women to feel safer, all you can do is your part to make sure they are.

Most people know no more than one person involved in a bank robbery or murder (most). We all know multiple people who are rape victims. Also, I&amp;#39;m aware of female rapists. However, I&amp;#39;m a very very unlikely target for them, so I&amp;#39;m less afraid of them, although I want them to have the same consequences as male offenders. Also, imagine how many more women would be raped if we did not take precautions? If I walked around my city drunk every night in secluded areas at the same time could I make it a year without being assaulted by a man again? Almost certainly not. My viewpoint is not sexist. If 15-20% of your acquaintances died in auto accidents before they were 30, you would make sure your car was safe and would avoid potentially dangerous situations with other cars. Would you hate cars? No, not all cars are dangerous, but a significant number of them are.  I&amp;#39;m curious how you think caution with a gender can be the same  as caution of a race. Most terrorists in America have been white. You are more likely to be robbed by a white person if you are white and a black person if you are black. I&amp;#39;m more afraid of larger and younger individuals, not because they are more likely to rape, but if they attempt to rape, I am less likely to overpower them. If you said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m cautious with women, because I don&amp;#39;t want to be  accused of sexual harassment or for women to feel harassed and I think about that often in how I approach women,&amp;quot; I would applaud you for taking those considerations. For every man like you, who thinks women are sexist for being cautious of men, there is another who will ask her if she led her rapist on or could have avoided the assault. Sometimes, those dichotomies can come out of the same mouth.  If you continue to maintain your views, maybe you should ask yourself why you feel that way. It seems like you may be offended that you occasionally have to think about risks women face, while forgetting this is something we face severe consequences for if we are not on guard for it all the time. Politicians are pushing for women to have to keep their rape embryos and defunding their access to std tests. If you want women to feel safer, all you can do is your part to make sure they are. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgdxlih", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484255.0, "created_utc": 1492455455.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x4gx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdzqft", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rand337", "parent_id": "t3_65x4gx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd argue that although women fearing random men may indeed perpetuate a cycle of fear and sexism, it is unreasonable to ask women to stop practicing this form of discriminatory caution unless it can be proven to a high degree that their caution is unwarranted.

Let&amp;#39;s see...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Terror: &lt;a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.de/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1\"&gt;http://www.businessinsider.de/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Afghanistan: &lt;a href=\"http://icasualties.org/oef/\"&gt;http://icasualties.org/oef/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Iraq: &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Women: &lt;a href=\"http://now.org/resource/violence-against-women-in-the-united-states-statistic/\"&gt;http://now.org/resource/violence-against-women-in-the-united-states-statistic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It more or less matches up. (The last link only contains 2005 deaths, but extrapolate that to 10 years and you get almost exactly to 11k.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some women are fearful towards men not simply because of the theoretical possibility of a man or a group of men overpowering them; I&amp;#39;d think it&amp;#39;s because of the constant stream of stories of male violence they hear from childhood onward, which are real stories to boot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a rational fear, unlike the black bank robbers. White bank robbers marginally out-number black bank robbers: &lt;a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/bank-crime-statistics-2011/bank-crime-statistics-2011\"&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/bank-crime-statistics-2011/bank-crime-statistics-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And BTW the terror stats include 9/11. If you exclude that, the terror death numbers are relatively tiny, lest you suggest fear of random Muslims is justified. More deaths from amok shootings by whites.
