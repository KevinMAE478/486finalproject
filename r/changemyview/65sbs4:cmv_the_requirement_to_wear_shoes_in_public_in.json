If you&amp;#39;re walking outside in winter in many parts of the world you will need shoes if you don&amp;#39;t want to risk frostbite.  In the summer in many places it will be too hot to walk around on the hot tar or sidewalks to make going barefoot comfortable.   Not to mention that in cities there is gross things that people want to avoid stepping on - like urine, vomit, trash, other spilled things, and with crowded places you are likely to get your toes stepped on but people who are wearing shoes, which is unpleasant even if it just happens once.  Not to mention that in most urban areas you are always balancing some risk of stepping on something like broken glass and in rural areas - in many parts of the world - shoes offer some protection from dangerous things like snakes, spiders, scorpions and more.  My point being that while our aversion to not wearing shoes might be slightly over the top, there are &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; reasons to wear shoes for most of the population - and that won&amp;#39;t change even if we talk about it more.  And if most people are wearing shoes than the taboo of not wearing shoes will likely remain in place, which makes it sort of reasonable for businesses to require patrons to be shod, since doing otherwise harms their image. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgcz31v", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424879.0, "created_utc": 1492396079.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcyd0o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ManMan36", "parent_id": "t1_dgcx73r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have already responded to the parasites argument\n&gt; As for your parasite argument, there isn't really much of a defense for this one.
