I would argue that \"culture wars\" is even more of a \"buzzword\" than toxic masculinity, but that's really a different debate.  \n\n&gt;Personally, though, what's wrong with \"toxic\" masculinity?\n\nSo, obviously aside from the abuse example, the problem with ideas of masculinity that could be called \"toxic\" is not that they promote dominance, confidence, sexual aggression, or ambition.  The problem with the kinds of masculinity you see referred to as toxic (by people who aren't just lobbing accusations at any male who they disagree with) is that they have a much greater tendency to promote the devaluation of women.  \n\nThe Red Pill community here on reddit (and elsewhere to some extent) is a great example.  On the face of it, it's about people \"taking the red pill\" and waking up to the fact that they need to \"increase their sexual market value\" by being more confident, working on their appearance, and not being afraid of judgment.  If it was purely a subreddit promoting male sexual dominance (in an \"alpha\" sort of way, not in a \"rule the world\" kind of dominance) then there wouldn't really be much controversy around it.  Hell if it were just a subreddit for pick up artists it probably wouldn't be much to talk about.  But the problem with The Red Pill as a community is that it promotes a seriously unhealthy idea of women and relationships.  Users regularly refer to women as \"plates\", as in \"how many plates can you keep spinning\" because they are regularly manipulating multiple women into sleeping with them without any commitment.  Many in the community regard commitment to any one woman as a sign of weakness, never mind marriage.  Some have even stated that women are incapable of love in the way that men are, and as such do not deserve love from men.  There are even discussions about how women are just naturally suited to subservience to men, how women are genetically less intelligent, and how women are all sluts who desire to be raped.  \n\nThis kind of thinking also devalues men who do not follow the same line of thinking.  People on the Red Pill will refer to men who have different ideas about masculine sexuality as \"Blue Pill\" men or \"White Knights\".  It devalues men too, just to a lesser extent than it devalues women.\n\nDoes that represent all men?  Certainly not.  Does that even represent everybody who frequents that community?  No, it does not.
