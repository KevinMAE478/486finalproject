Well, it's also within your legal rights to cheat on your girlfriend, but that doesn't excuse it from being morally reprehensible.\n\nThere is a clear problem here with responsibility of fault and proportionality of force. It was entirely United's fault for creating a situation in which they had to remove people from the aircraft. It is their problem to rectify. The fact that no one volunteered to give up their seat on the offer of $800 signifies that United did not offer enough to offset the value of the flight to passengers. Guaranteed, the value to United of someone giving up his/her seat was more than $800, yet, instead of offering more, and resolving the conflict to the mutual benefit of all parties, United opted to utilize aggressive force to subjugate the preferences of a passenger to its own. While arguably within its right to do so, it was in violation of the spirit and expectation of mutual, commercial exchange, and, IMO, a moral violation of proportionality of force in defense of property.\n\nWhat do I mean by a violation of proportionality of force? Well, for example, in some states, it is legal to shoot trespassers on your property. If you, like me, believe it is morally wrong to shoot someone just for setting foot on your property, then you may be sympathetic to a philosophy of proportionality of force. Without going into an essay, to put it briefly, the use of violence as a defense of oneself and one's property ought to remain in proportion with the level of aggression one is being threatened by. I believe that United Airlines, given the context of the scenario, engaged in disproportionate enforcement. That is to say that, although the passenger was in the wrong for not abiding crew instructions, United was also in the wrong because it unreasonably escalated the situation to the point of violence when it was well within its power, expertise, and ability to resolve the situation at a lower point of escalation, at little cost to itself.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logical fallacy: appeal to authority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are suggesting that United is not in the wrong because what they did is within their legal rights. Well, it&amp;#39;s also within your legal rights to cheat on your girlfriend, but that doesn&amp;#39;t excuse it from being morally reprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a clear problem here with responsibility of fault and proportionality of force. It was entirely United&amp;#39;s fault for creating a situation in which they had to remove people from the aircraft. It is their problem to rectify. The fact that no one volunteered to give up their seat on the offer of $800 signifies that United did not offer enough to offset the value of the flight to passengers. Guaranteed, the value to United of someone giving up his/her seat was more than $800, yet, instead of offering more, and resolving the conflict to the mutual benefit of all parties, United opted to utilize aggressive force to subjugate the preferences of a passenger to its own.
