Let&amp;#39;s say a 500 person plane overbooks by 5% and sells 525 tickets. At $500 per ticket, that&amp;#39;s an extra $12,500 (25x$500) in revenue for the flight. Divide that by 500 and we&amp;#39;re talking about an extra $25 per ticket. For a round trip you&amp;#39;re paying $50 more. For business travelers that&amp;#39;s negligible.
