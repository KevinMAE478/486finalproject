Before the 1920's, tipping was seen as un-American. They were seen as bribes when the idea was that everyone would receive equal treatment/service. When prohibition hit, revenue decreased, and restaurants started encouraging servers to take those bribes to supplement the restaurant not paying them. The rest is history. Servers are just as much a victim of the system as the customer is, and the extra few dollars are worth more to servers than to you. I have seen and felt the difference an $8 tip makes versus a $6 one. Most importantly, protesting tipping by not tipping does nothing.

The reasoning is that they are giving poor quality service or lying about how much they are making. Neither of which a restaurant can have. Also, have you tried living off of minimum wage? It is terrible. I do agree with you that servers need to be paid differently, but until that happens, people need to, well, change their view of tipping. What people don&amp;#39;t realize is that the servers as well as the customers are victims of the system. As I said before, if someone doesn&amp;#39;t make enough, they get fired. What other job can you think of where you get fired for not getting paid enough? Second, it isn&amp;#39;t the servers who go into the job thinking &amp;quot;oh, I&amp;#39;ll just guilt them into paying me.&amp;quot; It is the restaurant who says &amp;quot;this is what we legally have to pay you per hour, we made it so tipping is essentially mandatory, so go get the rest of your paycheck.&amp;quot; That is not only how it is but how it started. Before the 1920&amp;#39;s, tipping was seen as un-American. They were seen as bribes when the idea was that everyone would receive equal treatment/service. When prohibition hit, revenue decreased, and restaurants started encouraging servers to take those bribes to supplement the restaurant not paying them. The rest is history. Servers are just as much a victim of the system as the customer is, and the extra few dollars are worth more to servers than to you. I have seen and felt the difference an $8 tip makes versus a $6 one. Most importantly, protesting tipping by not tipping does nothing. The server has nothing to do with the policy, and the restaurant doesn&amp;#39;t care because they already got their money. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg98m9v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492210976.0, "created_utc": 1492182176.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659nhb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659nhb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659nhb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659nhb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659nhb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659nhb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hn9e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "d1no5aur", "parent_id": "t1_dg99zfw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree with your opinion.
