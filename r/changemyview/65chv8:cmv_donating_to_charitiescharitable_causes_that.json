In a competitive charity market, that means competing with other charities and potentially convincing donors to donate to their charity instead of another.\n\nAll that said, if you donate to an inefficient charity, then you empower its advertising ability to compete with more efficient charities. You contribute in that way to less money going to more efficient life saving. Not just in the lost opportunity of YOUR donation but by helping them steer other donors away from saving more lives.\n\nIn this way, it may be argued that MORE harm may be done by contributing to an inefficient charity than by using the same money selfishly.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of a simplified argument that Organization X can save a life for 100$ and Organization Y needs 400$ to save a life.\n\nLet's say you donate 110$ to Organization Y. Organization Y uses your donation to do 1/4 of the work in saving one life and spends the other 10$ on their marketing.\n\nNow, since marketing for a nonprofit needs to have a healthy return, you can expect that they should be able to raise at least 100$ for every 10$ spent on marketing.

That means, your 110$ donation is convincing someone else to donate 100$ to Organization Y that may have otherwise gone to organization X. That's a difference of about 3/4 of a life your money spent on advertising costs, and since your donation saves 1/4 a life, your balance sheet is negative 1/2 of a life. Compare that to just keeping the money and your balance sheet is at zero. It is therefore, more moral to spend money selfishly than to donate to a bad charity.\n\nActually, over and above that, money spent selfishly creates jobs, circulates wealth, stimulates the economy. If you really want to save lives and better people's quality of life, supporting strengthening economies is pretty much the best thing you can do.

So this distinction decreases overall charitable giving, as charity already was a completely voluntary action-- if they don&amp;#39;t feel as motivated by a certain charity, they just don&amp;#39;t give as much to charity. On a philosophical level, how can spending $1000 to buy a big TV be morally okay, but spending $1000 on a charity that doesn&amp;#39;t maximize lives saved immoral?
