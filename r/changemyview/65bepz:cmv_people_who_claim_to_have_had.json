They know reading will improve their vocabulary, their understanding of other cultures, their ability to empathise, and perhaps even they know that there are intense pleasures to be found in literature that few other art forms can match. They feel, therefore, a sense of guilt at their status as a non-reader. Perhaps even (depending on their social circles) a sense of shame as well. They need an excuse for why they do not read: an excuse to give others and, more importantly, an excuse to tell themselves. Their excuse is that they cannot enjoy literature because they didn&amp;#39;t enjoy their time in school and so &lt;em&gt;it must be school&amp;#39;s fault&lt;/em&gt;. The real reason why they don&amp;#39;t read is that they either have not quite made the effort to give it a proper go or they are somewhat ashamed at their own reading level and are conscious of their inability to access books beyond a &amp;#39;teen fiction&amp;#39; level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b) Incorrect&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people, however, genuinely believe that school has put them off literature for life. I contest that this is an ill-informed and immature point of view, based on a misunderstanding of literature. &lt;em&gt;Even if&lt;/em&gt; I concede that they have had Romeo and Juliet, The Great Gatsby, Great Expectations, Lord of the Flies and Of Mice and Men &amp;#39;spoilt&amp;#39; for them, what these people often do not realise is just how vast literature is. I think some people assume that in reading the above-mentioned texts, they&amp;#39;ve somehow had a holistic taste of what literature &amp;#39;is&amp;#39; and so therefore if they didn&amp;#39;t enjoy these texts at school they must hate all literature. The more you experience literature, the more you realise how under-read you are, and how little your tiny experience of it reflects the larger whole.

They could spend all their life reading and never again touch one of the authors they studied in school, though they owe each author a debt nonetheless for being a stepping stone. Or they could wait 10 years and re-read Of Mice and Men and realise that their dislike of it was not because of school but because of being a teenager, and with maturity comes new appreciation for different things. More likely, I think, they&amp;#39;ll find Of Mice and Men rather simplistic and be stunned instead by the (far superior) East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath. But many people will not make the effort to experience this, because they believe that they have &amp;#39;experienced literature&amp;#39; as a 15 year-old, and literature was not for them, so why try?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not saying everyone can/should enjoy reading.&lt;/strong&gt; I am saying that it&amp;#39;s not school&amp;#39;s fault if people don&amp;#39;t: school does not turn keen readers into non-readers.

As a kid, I would play football (soccer) with friends at lunchtime, and it was fun. Then in secondary school (high school) it was something we did as part of PE class, and it was miserable. It was just lots of drills, and lad culture which I hated. At university, I didn't even consider playing football again - although I was still fairly sporty in general, I'd decided I didn't like football. *Maybe* if I'd given it another go I would have enjoyed it again, but I didn't want to and I think it's fair to say that school 'spoilt' football for me.\n\nEdit: I see you're also from the UK.

You can still get lost in a book and think deeply about it. &amp;#39;Analysis&amp;#39; isn&amp;#39;t some kind of magical thing that destroys books: it&amp;#39;s simply the process of actually &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about what you&amp;#39;re consuming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also think you&amp;#39;re seriously underestimating how strong simple classical conditioning can be - if reading is associated with unpleasant experiences throughout school, then that association can become very hard to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not see cause and effect. If reading was an unpleasant experience at school, that&amp;#39;s because the person did not like reading in the first place and so being made to do it was a horrible chore. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg8zbfn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492193475.0, "created_utc": 1492164675.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8z6bc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "must-be-thursday", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yw3m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think school can make reading a given book much more of an unpleasant experience than it would otherwise have been.

I think you can get just as much out of watching Arrested Development as you could The Importance of Being Earnest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I think reading should be fun, not work. All novels are written not just to spread a message, but to entertain. If your literature class constantly felt like work, I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say it your school spoiled literature for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to give another example of what I mean, sometimes there are &lt;a href=\"/r/AskReddit\"&gt;/r/AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; threads about working at a fast food chain or restaurant. People like eating at McDonald&amp;#39;s or Taco Bell, but a lot of the employees in those threads say they refuse to eat at the place they used to work, even if they liked it beforehand. The food is supposed to taste good, but the negative feelings they developed at the job spoiled the restaurant experience for them. Literature is meant to entertain and enlighten. If your school&amp;#39;s literature program constantly created negative feelings such as shame, boredom, failure, etc. and you never got back into literature, then I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say they spoiled it for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg9g14s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492219481.0, "created_utc": 1492190681.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93cx7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FaerieStories", "parent_id": "t1_dg931qr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Sure, but I'm probably not going to give it a second try.

There's usually a token book written by a woman or a black man in the school curriculum, but it's very limited.

Of Mice and Men is a book that I dislike as a piece of literature and find much inferior to Steinbeck's other work, but is absolutely brilliant for teaching students essential skills of understanding literature, especially concerning how literature and society become mirrors of one another.\n\nFrom the US curriculum, which texts, in your view, need to go, and which texts need to come in?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, but I&amp;#39;m probably not going to give it a second try.

He tried to teach me how to play the game. What I wanted to do was go out, walk around in the sunshine, hit the ball, and try to get it in the hole. But instead of playing the game poorly for fun, he made me spend the entire time just working on how to hit the ball correctly.

It was unbelievably boring, and I felt terrible because I couldn't get it right. \n\nIt wasn't his fault. He wanted me to learn the correct technique because if you develop bad habits early, it's harder to correct them. But it was such an unpleasant experience that it ruined golf for me.

They give students challenging books they want children to read, rather than fun, easy books they children want to read themselves. That just fills people with negative emotions. It's hard and they feel bad about themselves for not succeeding. It's boring because it's a topic they were forced to read, and not one they chose to read. It's an unpleasant experience all around.

But if the time limit runs out and you never achieve it, it feels horrible. \n\nThis is a major problem in the American educational system, and one that some innovative educators are trying to solve. Sal Khan of Khan Academy really focuses on this idea of making learning fun. Kumon makes sure students fully overcome a challenge before giving them the next one.

They learn things because they have to look them up in order to solve a problem.\n\nI enjoy reading because I started reading really easy books when I was very young. The only times I moved on to more complex ones is when I got bored with the easy ones and wanted a new challenge myself, not because someone made me want to do it. I've gotten good at Counter-Strike because I was kind of good at it and wanted to get better on my own. \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that people learn better in experiential rather than didactic methods. If my mother simply tells me a stove is hot, I won't learn as well as if I touch the stove and burn my hand. The American school system aims for \"good enough\" rather than developing people who actually appreciate literature. \n\nSo I agree with the two points you made. I'd like to say it's the individual's fault. But so many people say they don't read literature after high school that I don't think it's fair to blame every person. If one person is fat, it's their fault. If everyone is fat, it's a systemic issue. And I think that the American education system often does spoil otherwise fun subjects for people by creating too many negative experiences upfront.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are experiential learners. You try something, and if you have a positive experience, you like it and try it again. If you try something and have a negative experience, you will dislike it. I think it&amp;#39;s possible to manufacture experiences that people enjoy, and manufacture experiences that people hate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, I know someone who ruined golf for me. He tried to teach me how to play the game. What I wanted to do was go out, walk around in the sunshine, hit the ball, and try to get it in the hole. But instead of playing the game poorly for fun, he made me spend the entire time just working on how to hit the ball correctly. We stood in place the entire time and did drills where I hit the ball and he critiqued my form. It was unbelievably boring, and I felt terrible because I couldn&amp;#39;t get it right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t his fault. He wanted me to learn the correct technique because if you develop bad habits early, it&amp;#39;s harder to correct them. But it was such an unpleasant experience that it ruined golf for me. You could argue that I didn&amp;#39;t put in enough effort to really appreciate the game, but I don&amp;#39;t care. There are millions of other great things out there. Someday I might still rediscover golf and realize I like it, but I have no desire to even try. I just associate it with work, rather than fun. What he should have done is just let me go out and have fun, then I would improve because I wanted to, not because he wanted me to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schools teach literature in the same didactic way. They give students challenging books they want children to read, rather than fun, easy books they children want to read themselves. That just fills people with negative emotions. It&amp;#39;s hard and they feel bad about themselves for not succeeding. It&amp;#39;s boring because it&amp;#39;s a topic they were forced to read, and not one they chose to read. It&amp;#39;s an unpleasant experience all around. Plus, like my golf coach who only took me out once, schools focus on getting all kids to read.

I am a voracious reader but very nearly grew to hate reading due to the way reading and literature are handled in school. To this day, I still hate reading certain types classic literature and I can directly link it to the bad teachers I had. School requires a form of reading which for many, who are not literature fiends, is very very unnatural. This forced methodology that is commonly encountered in schools (things like analyzing for deeper meaning, looking for archetypes, etc.) are the source of this stress and discomfort. Whether you like it or not, being forced to read in an unejoyable way can generate a Pavlovian response, where the feelings of stress, discomfort and boredom, which are part and parcel with badly/incompatibly taught reading in school, become associated with the act of reading itself.  This doesn't mean that they can't become readers again but why should they? I am sure if I worked hard I could overcome my hatred of these categories of classic literature if I wanted to work at it, that would require me slaving through a LONG time of fighting my Pavalovian generated hatred of said literature.

I am a voracious reader but very nearly grew to hate reading due to the way reading and literature are handled in school. To this day, I still hate reading certain types classic literature and I can directly link it to the bad teachers I had. School requires a form of reading which for many, who are not literature fiends, is very very unnatural. This forced methodology that is commonly encountered in schools (things like analyzing for deeper meaning, looking for archetypes, etc.) are the source of this stress and discomfort. Whether you like it or not, being forced to read in an unejoyable way can generate a Pavlovian response, where the feelings of stress, discomfort and boredom, which are part and parcel with badly/incompatibly taught reading in school, become associated with the act of reading itself.  This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they can&amp;#39;t become readers again but why should they? I am sure if I worked hard I could overcome my hatred of these categories of classic literature if I wanted to work at it, that would require me slaving through a LONG time of fighting my Pavalovian generated hatred of said literature.

Blaming highschool is an easy out, a way to shift the blame from yourself to &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; and works exactly like saying &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re all crooks&amp;quot; when it comes to politics; by saying school ruined literature, what you&amp;#39;re really saying is that you&amp;#39;re smart enough to get it, you just don&amp;#39;t like being force fed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgdliql", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470656.0, "created_utc": 1492441856.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bepz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9naq5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anonoman925", "parent_id": "t1_dg9kpmg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Gather data. \n\nYou could survey outside the grocery store for adults. \n\nStudent assessments will tell you. \"What spoke to you in the book Dandelion Wine\".
