You're talking deep ethnic problems between many of the countries, Japan and China are really easy recent examples. Japan conquered and brutally enslaved a large part of East and South East Asia in WW2 and not everyone from the old generation really appreciates being enslaved (The Rape of Nanking, Bataan Death March, etc.). China has been recently flexing its political power to try and take land from the countries around it citing bullshit ties. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands_dispute#The_Philippines So,a lot of people dislike the Chinese in the region. Even more so since Chinese immigrants are spreading all over East and South East Asia which kinda pisses people off, further exacerbating ethnic issues.\n\nThere's deep set racism over the idea of class. South East Asians (such as filipinos) are seen as low class. For Filipinos, think Mexicans in the US but global. Filipinos send migrant workers everywhere such as maids where they can be subject to serious racism and little to no rights. Singapore has had a problem with people abusing maids. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/singapores-domestic-workers-routinely-exploited-and-often-abused-in-the-service-of-rich-nationals-10422589.html.\n\nSo no, segregating by race does not solve racial problems.

You&amp;#39;re talking deep ethnic problems between many of the countries, Japan and China are really easy recent examples. Japan conquered and brutally enslaved a large part of East and South East Asia in WW2 and not everyone from the old generation really appreciates being enslaved (The Rape of Nanking, Bataan Death March, etc.). China has been recently flexing its political power to try and take land from the countries around it citing bullshit ties. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands_dispute#The_Philippines\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands_dispute#The_Philippines&lt;/a&gt; So,a lot of people dislike the Chinese in the region. Even more so since Chinese immigrants are spreading all over East and South East Asia which kinda pisses people off, further exacerbating ethnic issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s deep set racism over the idea of class. South East Asians (such as filipinos) are seen as low class. For Filipinos, think Mexicans in the US but global.
