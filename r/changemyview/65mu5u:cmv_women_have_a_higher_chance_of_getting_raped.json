It\u2019s a comforting myth, guaranteed to make it easy to pretend that sexual assault is something that only happens to people who make bad choices. It\u2019s also a myth that has been thoroughly debunked by the Justice Department, RAINN and many other organizations. A Federal Commission on Crime of Violence study found that just 4.4 percent of all reported rapes involved \u201cprovocative behavior\u201d on the part of the victim. (In murder cases, it\u2019s 22 percent.) It also found that most convicted rapists could not remember what their victims were wearing. Studies show that women with passive personalities, who tend to dress in layers, long pants and sleeves and high necklines, are actually more likely to be raped.

Rape isn't about sexuality. \n\n**3 out of 5 rapes the rapist already knows the victim.**  (national crime victim survey 2000) \n**Rape is about power / frustration and [not sexuality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/910975).** \nSo a rapist is someone who already knows the victim and commits a crime of passion, originating from a power fantasy or a frustration/anger. Therefore the clothes of a victim aren't the influencing factor for rape. Moreover, rapists are more likely to attack vulnerable people, not sexy people. This is why people with mental handicaps, elderly, children are raped as well. \n\n\n#### 2. OP is ignoring agency of rapist.\n\nRape is an active crime that requires the agency of the rapist. In fact it is one of the most physical and intimate crimes, so there is a very focused agency involved. This agency begins from observing the victim, then cornering them, ignoring their protests, forcing them/hurting them, continuing the sexual assault and finally leaving the victim in their assaulted state. When OP says that sexiness of clothes increases chances of sexual assault it ignores the rapist's agency and by silence falsely implies that the rapist just get aroused beyond control/agency and therefore rape; as if there were no intermediate stages between arousal and crime. The difference between a rapist and a regular person is that upon sexual arousal, both respectively exercised their agency in a way that one committed a crime and the other didn't. So since there is agency to react with the rapist, it shouldn't matter that society be concerned about stimulus created by the victim.\n\n\n#### 3. OP's view shouldn't matter even if true because it comes from a principally flawed perspective. \n\nIn a rape, the rapist is the offender, and the person being forced is the victim, so why should there be a perspective of the victim trying to evade a legally defined crime instead of the criminal being dissuaded? Rape is principally and in practice a crime under ANY circumstances. That is, people shouldn't be raped EVEN IF they wear sexy clothes. Therefore clothing shouldn't matter, since **society's response to crime should be to punish crime, not to reduce liberties of the victims.** The intent is to eliminate rape, and not to reduce clothing choice, therefore even if OP was right about sexiness of clothes causing rape, their basis of perspective itself is flawed.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will make three arguments to change your view: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;1.
