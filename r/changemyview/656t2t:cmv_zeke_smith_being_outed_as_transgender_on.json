There's no way it was just a matter of editing a narrative, this happened during Tribal Council, and outing Zeke as trans was part of Varner's argument for why everyone should vote out Ozzy.\n\nI agree that shows can and do use clever editing, and Survivor does this all the time. But this moment didn't happen during downtime on the beach, it happened during one of the main stage parts of the show.\n\nI think the show has a few fake elements (just check out the impossible camera angles during challenges). But the outing moment last night was not a matter of clever editing, it would have required active participation by all parties if it was staged. And this has destroyed Varner's reputation in the eyes of the public. People on /r/survivor are making desperate pleas for people to stop harassing him over this.\n\nSo while I understand your point regarding editing and deception when it comes to these types of shows, I'm not sure this moment can really be attributed to that. Both Varner and Zeke would have to be in on it. And maybe they were! But what would a TV producer have to give to you in order for you to go on public TV and do something that would run serious risk of ostracizing you from your own community?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the scene in question? There&amp;#39;s no way it was just a matter of editing a narrative, this happened during Tribal Council, and outing Zeke as trans was part of Varner&amp;#39;s argument for why everyone should vote out Ozzy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree that shows can and do use clever editing, and Survivor does this all the time. But this moment didn&amp;#39;t happen during downtime on the beach, it happened during one of the main stage parts of the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the show has a few fake elements (just check out the impossible camera angles during challenges). But the outing moment last night was not a matter of clever editing, it would have required active participation by all parties if it was staged. And this has destroyed Varner&amp;#39;s reputation in the eyes of the public.
