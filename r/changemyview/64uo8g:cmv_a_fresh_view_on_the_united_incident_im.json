First and foremost being that you shouldn't be disappointed in humanity on random drama. For one, that plane isn't a sample of humanity, it's a group of people in a very specific set of circumstances nested within a variety of cooperative rule structures upon rule structures. It's reasonable and actually helpful for people to trust those structures, within reason, instead of playing John Wayne.\n\nNote that an airplane is nested on the cusp of a complex national, legal, technical, professional, and practical settings, in which the passenger is something of a spectator with no control that just sits there and waits while everything is handled. It's a very vulnerable setting, it's not a social setting. Not everybody is paying extreme levels of attention to detail, and so many might not know why the man is being detained, but what they *do* know is that he's not going to be carried off to be sacrificed to Ba'al or stoned to death or that things are happening for no reason, or to exploit people. The broader moral issues are well under control. So they filmed to keep a record so that accountability doesn't slip, which is what matters here.\n\nSecondly, being disappointed in humanity on issues like these is to take \"humanity\" extremely personally and to look with a judgmental, not brotherly or understanding eye, but an unwarranted maternal one (you shouldn't be lovingly sizing up mankind on little quirks and nuances, with some romantic vision for the future, because we're not yours in that sense). That sucks to do, for you and everybody. Your number one and most intimate sample of humanity is you, your own thoughts and behavior. So if you judge very eagerly, broadly, and personally on such small events, you're going to create a recursive feedback loop in that the more negativity you perceive, the more you see in yourself, the more you see in others, etc. People get delusional and neurotic (very high in negative emotion for no reason (i.e. highly suspicious interpersonally without any grievance to address)) like that, and that's not an exaggeration. You can create ambient misery for yourself with recursive feedback loops, which are like self-deception. Beware. These long journeys start with a few small steps.\n\nAcknowledge that many of these passengers were excellent, responsible people acting on their experience and immediate, limited appraisal of the matter, and also taking cues from one another for what's appropriate. Even with the information that's now come out, they probably did the right thing in not challenging the airline or the police, because none had enough weight to throw around to make a difference on the spot and the situation wasn't dire. By filming and taking it to those who do have more weight to throw around, like reporters who take it to others who do, like the public, a controversy is breaking out that might offset broader airline and police abuses with better policies and accountability. All this while also helping the victim make it out of the situation better than he went in, and far exceeding the actual cost of the abuse (a high profit lawsuit). Frankly, I wish I were that doctor getting my ass kicked with the whole of society behind me wanting to put me in a justice castle.\n\nOn to your points:\n\n&gt;And they [the grocery store cashier] probably feel they'll get in trouble if they let the person just walk out with it.\n\nNo, they'd definitely get in trouble. The product doesn't belong to them or the customer, and they're not any particular moral authority exceeding the capabilities of anybody.\n\nAlso you're assuming the cashier sympathizes with the SNAP individual. They might see them every day trying to scam them, or people like them, or just being irresponsible all the time without iill intent. You're seeing the cashier from a moral perspective, not as a person or even as a cashier.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, I'm sure the person purchasing isn't just scamming or trying to make it up. Nothing there looked obviously invalid for SNAP, it isn't as if they were trying to purchase cosmetics or something.\n\nThat's just naive. It's not to say they *were* definitely scamming, but there's absolutely no way you could have any certainty in the matter because you have no information whatsoever, except to assume a real scammer would be very linear and have no plan or cunning (like steal the food and use the money to buy cosmetics, rather than vice versa). \n\nYou assume a thief always thieves and operates in a linear fashion, not *sometimes* thieving where the opportunity is best, and cleverly, complexly, or in a layered manner. Most are opportunistic and habitual, trying the SNAP card first and playing their bit, and failing that suddenly find they had money in their wallet they forgot about.\n\nThat's why it's naive. Being good natured causes you to not understand people's capacity or motivations for complex deceit in a cerebral way. To mitigate this, roleplay. Act with yourself. Your high trait-openness allows you to hypothetically feel beyond your experience, so don't use it to think analytically and see all the moral truths and boundaries and judge, use it to experience having been there. Project yourself into the cashier and try to see it from their perspective hypothetically, rather than trying for an informational and analytical moral judgment. Then you'll see why you might suspect fraud on the part of the customer, or maybe how this isn't the first time you've seen this (as a cashier). \n\nIn that game, you might see yourself standing in line and understand some of the ways you might look, as good-spirited but perhaps a little too much. Not that you aren't who you intend to be, but how it can look, and so then you can better express yourself and your good nature. \n\nOr maybe it's exactly as it should have been. You'll know when you become the cashier, who you do understand, rather than moralizing by assuming you know entire categories of people (workers, the market, the poor, the plane, etc.) and the whole of humanity itself (what's morally right in any given situation).\n\nAnyway I digress. I think you're very trait-open because I can identify with you. However I know some of the perceptual issues with that and how you can help yourself to understand to a higher degree of resolution. You should try to accept that the passengers of the United Incident were right, and that your moral feelings are right, and so collide those contradicting perspectives by putting yourself in their shoes and you should be able to see what you're not seeing and what you don't know, and from that you can derive your best possible response and opinion of it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should change your view for a few reasons.

For one, that plane isn&amp;#39;t a sample of humanity, it&amp;#39;s a group of people in a very specific set of circumstances nested within a variety of cooperative rule structures upon rule structures. It&amp;#39;s reasonable and actually helpful for people to trust those structures, within reason, instead of playing John Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that an airplane is nested on the cusp of a complex national, legal, technical, professional, and practical settings, in which the passenger is something of a spectator with no control that just sits there and waits while everything is handled. It&amp;#39;s a very vulnerable setting, it&amp;#39;s not a social setting. Not everybody is paying extreme levels of attention to detail, and so many might not know why the man is being detained, but what they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know is that he&amp;#39;s not going to be carried off to be sacrificed to Ba&amp;#39;al or stoned to death or that things are happening for no reason, or to exploit people. The broader moral issues are well under control. So they filmed to keep a record so that accountability doesn&amp;#39;t slip, which is what matters here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, being disappointed in humanity on issues like these is to take &amp;quot;humanity&amp;quot; extremely personally and to look with a judgmental, not brotherly or understanding eye, but an unwarranted maternal one (you shouldn&amp;#39;t be lovingly sizing up mankind on little quirks and nuances, with some romantic vision for the future, because we&amp;#39;re not yours in that sense). That sucks to do, for you and everybody. Your number one and most intimate sample of humanity is you, your own thoughts and behavior. So if you judge very eagerly, broadly, and personally on such small events, you&amp;#39;re going to create a recursive feedback loop in that the more negativity you perceive, the more you see in yourself, the more you see in others, etc. People get delusional and neurotic (very high in negative emotion for no reason (i.e. highly suspicious interpersonally without any grievance to address)) like that, and that&amp;#39;s not an exaggeration. You can create ambient misery for yourself with recursive feedback loops, which are like self-deception. Beware. These long journeys start with a few small steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge that many of these passengers were excellent, responsible people acting on their experience and immediate, limited appraisal of the matter, and also taking cues from one another for what&amp;#39;s appropriate. Even with the information that&amp;#39;s now come out, they probably did the right thing in not challenging the airline or the police, because none had enough weight to throw around to make a difference on the spot and the situation wasn&amp;#39;t dire. By filming and taking it to those who do have more weight to throw around, like reporters who take it to others who do, like the public, a controversy is breaking out that might offset broader airline and police abuses with better policies and accountability. All this while also helping the victim make it out of the situation better than he went in, and far exceeding the actual cost of the abuse (a high profit lawsuit). Frankly, I wish I were that doctor getting my ass kicked with the whole of society behind me wanting to put me in a justice castle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to your points:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And they [the grocery store cashier] probably feel they&amp;#39;ll get in trouble if they let the person just walk out with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, they&amp;#39;d definitely get in trouble. The product doesn&amp;#39;t belong to them or the customer, and they&amp;#39;re not any particular moral authority exceeding the capabilities of anybody.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also you&amp;#39;re assuming the cashier sympathizes with the SNAP individual. They might see them every day trying to scam them, or people like them, or just being irresponsible all the time without iill intent. You&amp;#39;re seeing the cashier from a moral perspective, not as a person or even as a cashier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I&amp;#39;m sure the person purchasing isn&amp;#39;t just scamming or trying to make it up. Nothing there looked obviously invalid for SNAP, it isn&amp;#39;t as if they were trying to purchase cosmetics or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just naive. It&amp;#39;s not to say they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; definitely scamming, but there&amp;#39;s absolutely no way you could have any certainty in the matter because you have no information whatsoever, except to assume a real scammer would be very linear and have no plan or cunning (like steal the food and use the money to buy cosmetics, rather than vice versa). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You assume a thief always thieves and operates in a linear fashion, not &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; thieving where the opportunity is best, and cleverly, complexly, or in a layered manner. Most are opportunistic and habitual, trying the SNAP card first and playing their bit, and failing that suddenly find they had money in their wallet they forgot about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s naive. Being good natured causes you to not understand people&amp;#39;s capacity or motivations for complex deceit in a cerebral way. To mitigate this, roleplay. Act with yourself. Your high trait-openness allows you to hypothetically feel beyond your experience, so don&amp;#39;t use it to think analytically and see all the moral truths and boundaries and judge, use it to experience having been there. Project yourself into the cashier and try to see it from their perspective hypothetically, rather than trying for an informational and analytical moral judgment. Then you&amp;#39;ll see why you might suspect fraud on the part of the customer, or maybe how this isn&amp;#39;t the first time you&amp;#39;ve seen this (as a cashier). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that game, you might see yourself standing in line and understand some of the ways you might look, as good-spirited but perhaps a little too much. Not that you aren&amp;#39;t who you intend to be, but how it can look, and so then you can better express yourself and your good nature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it&amp;#39;s exactly as it should have been. You&amp;#39;ll know when you become the cashier, who you do understand, rather than moralizing by assuming you know entire categories of people (workers, the market, the poor, the plane, etc.) and the whole of humanity itself (what&amp;#39;s morally right in any given situation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway I digress. I think you&amp;#39;re very trait-open because I can identify with you. However I know some of the perceptual issues with that and how you can help yourself to understand to a higher degree of resolution. You should try to accept that the passengers of the United Incident were right, and that your moral feelings are right, and so collide those contradicting perspectives by putting yourself in their shoes and you should be able to see what you&amp;#39;re not seeing and what you don&amp;#39;t know, and from that you can derive your best possible response and opinion of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg5d5sp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491994273.0, "created_utc": 1491965473.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uo8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uo8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uo8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uo8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uo8g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg590p5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "caw81", "parent_id": "t1_dg58g21", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think that someone thought of that on the spot - I think that is the reasoning many people have discovered as they grow/mature and why we don't appease to certain acts like violence.

The only thing that was unusual about this situation was the police needing to be called.\n\nIt's actually statistically uncommon from what I've read. Most of the bumps are resolved with voluntary bumps because people are happy with the compensation offered. But I'm not sure what this has to do with anything -- if anything, if it *is* common, all the more reason not to try to resolve the inevitable conflict that arrived from it by smoothing over tensions and being conflict-avoidant, as it clearly needs to be dealt with. \n\n&gt;As an introvert, you really wouldn't take the $800, hotel room, and the chance to be on a seat without someone else next to you? In fact, maybe with the vouchers you could upgrade to first class and not be as close to another person as you would be in coach.\n\nNope, as an introvert, I don't like being stuck away from home, unless it's a planned vacation I've mentally prepared for. Besides, it just delays the suckiness of the flight (which you're all prepared for) to the next day, you deal with security and waiting again, etc. I especially wouldn't choose it if it meant a vacation day would need to be wasted on it! I value my vacation days highly, personally. \n\n&gt;Maybe I'm a different type of introvert, but the idea of being in a metal tube with a bunch of very stressed out people, already delayed for hours, with that level of human drama having happened, is terrifying to me. I'd very much be wanting to leave and just take a later flight.\n\nAll of the delays already happened. You can't avoid them. And you get to try again tomorrow, maybe face new delays, sit in the airport longer, not get home that day and be able to recover, etc.\n\nI don't think your feelings of aversion to stress are necessarily introvert based though. Based on your reaction in the scenario you describe (grocery store), you are extremely conflict avoidant, but that's not an introversion thing. I'm pretty introverted, but I'm not conflict avoidant in that way (not conflict-seeking, but conflict doesn't make me as uncomfortable as I suspect it makes you or really that uncomfortable at all, generally). \n\nI, personally, think your whole view assumes that avoiding conflict = best and that people generally want to avoid conflict to the extent that they'd do a lot to do so. But I disagree with that thoroughly. Avoiding conflict in that manner leads to trouble in the long run and is not a way to really live.

Most of the bumps are resolved with voluntary bumps because people are happy with the compensation offered. But I&amp;#39;m not sure what this has to do with anything -- if anything, if it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; common, all the more reason not to try to resolve the inevitable conflict that arrived from it by smoothing over tensions and being conflict-avoidant, as it clearly needs to be dealt with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an introvert, you really wouldn&amp;#39;t take the $800, hotel room, and the chance to be on a seat without someone else next to you?

Besides, it just delays the suckiness of the flight (which you&amp;#39;re all prepared for) to the next day, you deal with security and waiting again, etc. I especially wouldn&amp;#39;t choose it if it meant a vacation day would need to be wasted on it! I value my vacation days highly, personally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m a different type of introvert, but the idea of being in a metal tube with a bunch of very stressed out people, already delayed for hours, with that level of human drama having happened, is terrifying to me. I&amp;#39;d very much be wanting to leave and just take a later flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the delays already happened. You can&amp;#39;t avoid them.
