Each school is broken further into other denominations. To keep things relative simple, Catholics include Roman Catholics, Eastern Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Anglo-Catholics, and some others. Protestants include Lutherans, Baptists, Methodists, etc. Some of the Protestant sects are more traditional than others. Lutherans are closer to Catholics than they are to evangelical Christians, for example. \n\nOne of the largest divides between the two is *how* you are \"saved.\" Catholics believe we are *all* saved through faith and works. What does that mean? Well, it means that having faith in God, *and living according to His will* are the best way to be granted eternal salvation, but they're not the only way. For someone who is ignorant of the Church, salvation is possible so long as he or she lives a moral life. The theory is that when we are all judged at death, we are held accountable for our actions. Someone who never knew of Jesus, but lived a moral life, would *still* be granted eternal salvation. Protestants believe we are saved through faith alone. In other words, in order to be granted eternal salvation, you must accept God. By accepting him, you will naturally be led to act correctly. \n\nNow, we could argue this point of Christian philosophy all day, but it *does* show how some denominations hold Easter at a higher esteem than others. For Catholics, for example, the entire week leading up to the start of the Easter season (which lasts for 50 days) is important. It's called Holy Week. The resurrection is simply the climax of the story, which *must* be taken as a whole, not as individual events. Catholics celebrate mass daily because at the last supper (Holy Thursday), Jesus gave us the command to \"do this in memory of Him.\" Every single mass, at any time of the year, will reaffirm the gift of the Eucharist given by Jesus to his apostles on Holy Thursday. \n\nOn Good Friday, Jesus is executed in one of the most brutal (though not uncommon) methods of execution. This sacrifice absolutely is important. That's why Catholics fast on Good Friday. It's a reminder that Jesus died for all of humanity, both those who died before him, and all those to come in the future. That's a *huge* sacrifice. \n\nSo now we've got two things: Jesus died for us and he gave us instructions on how we can best honor his memory. But why? Christianity is not about simply following the rules. It's a two-way exchange. What do we get in return for trusting in God and in living as He asked? \n\nEnter Easter Sunday. On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead. Before doing so, he also brought all the souls in hell into heaven with him. He offered us an amazing gift: eternal life with God. He brought us into his family. His father became our father. Without his sacrifice *and* resurrection, the story is incomplete. Without the resurrection, Jesus would simply be a martyr and his sacrifice would have been for nothing. The reward of his death, the reason we say Jesus died for us, is the resurrection. \n\nNow, getting back to how some denominations interpret events differently, more traditional denominations place much more weight on the resurrection because Christianity is a happy and joyous religion and Easter is the most joyous occasion of all. It's a promise from God, fulfilled by Jesus, that we will all be granted eternal life. When you're responsible for your own actions, rather than simply trusting in God, that reward becomes even *more* important and worth living for. \n\nHope that helped a bit!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the person you&amp;#39;re responding to, but I can offer a bit of explanation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two main theological schools of Christianity, Catholicism and Protestantism.
