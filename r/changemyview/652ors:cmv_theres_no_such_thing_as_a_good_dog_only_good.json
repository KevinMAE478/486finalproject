While my experience is anecdotal, I'm sure that many have had the same sorts of experiences, and research into it (which probably exists somewhere) would likely show this to be true, at least to an extent.\n\nI have a dog, Caesar. He is a schnauzer mix rescue. My wife and I fostered him and eventually chose to adopt him.\n\nWe also fostered one of his litter mates, Napoleon. We had the two of them for a few months. When we began the foster process, the puppies were too young to adopt, and we eventually decided to be the permanent home for only one of the two dogs. Their \"personalities\" were the reason for this. \n\nOur dog has a very docile temperament. He is friendly, but also pretty meek and submissive. He is calm, and not very destructive. He doesn't chew stuff up out of boredom. When left to his own devices, you will find him on top of the biggest cushion he can find, sleeping. \n\nHis litter mate Napoleon, on the other hand, was aggressive from day one. When we first got them home, Napoleon stood *in* the dog food and growled at Caesar and wouldn't let him eat. Napoleon would get aggressive with us as well, growling at us, and even biting us a few times while we were trying to train him. He chewed up some of the carpet. He would be aggressive toward Caesar pretty frequently. \n\nSo eventually, we decided that we would only officially adopt Caesar, and give Napoleon back to the rescue organization to find another home. I'm sure he did (he was cute as a motherfucker), and he probably would do pretty well as an only dog, where he wouldn't have the competition with his litter mate as a source of aggression. \n\nThe point of this story is that we had two dogs from the same litter, which essentially makes them twins. I don't know what the first 4 weeks of their life was like before we fostered them, but I can assume that both of them experienced it pretty equally. We, as dog owners, raised them both together, doing the exact same stuff for both of them. Yet Napoleon had a mean streak from the beginning, and training didn't seem to make him any better. Caesar, on the other hand, was more docile from the get-go, and took to training very well. He is now a very obedient dog and has been for the 4 years we've had him. \n\nSo here's two dogs with the same \"blood,\" same experiences, and the same owners (whether we're \"good\" or \"bad\" at being dog owners isn't relevant based on your premises), with completely opposite temperaments. So I don't know *what* could be the reason for this difference except for inherent traits in the dogs themselves, that had nothing to do with their training/owners. It doesn't even seem to have anything to do with the *breed.* Dogs just seem to have pretty unique personalities, a lot like humans do. Sometimes, like Napoleon, this personality is notably worse (for the purposes of being a pet - he might have made a great wild animal) than with other, similarly situated dogs. ", "edited": 1492115227.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is pretty easy to be pretty objective about this. While my experience is anecdotal, I&amp;#39;m sure that many have had the same sorts of experiences, and research into it (which probably exists somewhere) would likely show this to be true, at least to an extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a dog, Caesar. He is a schnauzer mix rescue. My wife and I fostered him and eventually chose to adopt him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also fostered one of his litter mates, Napoleon. We had the two of them for a few months. When we began the foster process, the puppies were too young to adopt, and we eventually decided to be the permanent home for only one of the two dogs. Their &amp;quot;personalities&amp;quot; were the reason for this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our dog has a very docile temperament. He is friendly, but also pretty meek and submissive. He is calm, and not very destructive. He doesn&amp;#39;t chew stuff up out of boredom. When left to his own devices, you will find him on top of the biggest cushion he can find, sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His litter mate Napoleon, on the other hand, was aggressive from day one. When we first got them home, Napoleon stood &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the dog food and growled at Caesar and wouldn&amp;#39;t let him eat. Napoleon would get aggressive with us as well, growling at us, and even biting us a few times while we were trying to train him. He chewed up some of the carpet. He would be aggressive toward Caesar pretty frequently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So eventually, we decided that we would only officially adopt Caesar, and give Napoleon back to the rescue organization to find another home. I&amp;#39;m sure he did (he was cute as a motherfucker), and he probably would do pretty well as an only dog, where he wouldn&amp;#39;t have the competition with his litter mate as a source of aggression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of this story is that we had two dogs from the same litter, which essentially makes them twins. I don&amp;#39;t know what the first 4 weeks of their life was like before we fostered them, but I can assume that both of them experienced it pretty equally. We, as dog owners, raised them both together, doing the exact same stuff for both of them. Yet Napoleon had a mean streak from the beginning, and training didn&amp;#39;t seem to make him any better. Caesar, on the other hand, was more docile from the get-go, and took to training very well. He is now a very obedient dog and has been for the 4 years we&amp;#39;ve had him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s two dogs with the same &amp;quot;blood,&amp;quot; same experiences, and the same owners (whether we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; at being dog owners isn&amp;#39;t relevant based on your premises), with completely opposite temperaments. So I don&amp;#39;t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; could be the reason for this difference except for inherent traits in the dogs themselves, that had nothing to do with their training/owners. It doesn&amp;#39;t even seem to have anything to do with the &lt;em&gt;breed.&lt;/em&gt; Dogs just seem to have pretty unique personalities, a lot like humans do.

That is the dogs evolutionary trick - we didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;domesticate them&amp;quot;, they adapted/mutated to co-exist with us.  So...it is true that they won&amp;#39;t be well behaved dogs without guidance, it isn&amp;#39;t true that they&amp;#39;ll be violent and aggressive with humans if left un-trained.
