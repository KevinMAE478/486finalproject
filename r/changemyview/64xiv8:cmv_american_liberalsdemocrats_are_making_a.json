Or, if you have a demographic that is a minority and historically persecuted, but generally is economically doing quite well (many Asians, Jews). \n\nOr even more basic, the conflict is about whether a person's primary *political* identity is based on class or demographics. And if, as the \"Democratic\" faction believes, it is based on demographics, then they feel slighted when class is given policy priority.

Or, if you have a demographic that is a minority and historically persecuted, but generally is economically doing quite well (many Asians, Jews). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even more basic, the conflict is about whether a person&amp;#39;s primary &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; identity is based on class or demographics. And if, as the &amp;quot;Democratic&amp;quot; faction believes, it is based on demographics, then they feel slighted when class is given policy priority. I think these concepts are harder for us in the US to grasp because we have never really had a equivalent to a Labour party, and also because demographic conflicts are bigger for us because we&amp;#39;re more demographically heterogeneous than most European countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg7t04w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129927.0, "created_utc": 1492101127.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ob4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kaasmoneyplaya", "parent_id": "t1_dg63ptr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In my opinion there is a mix of factors that are at play here.

The obvious advantage seems to me that a critique that is intersectional both recognizes the unique (dis)advantages of particular group, whilst still also offering a set of policies that are to the advantage of all the least well-off.

Right of the bat, I think it is 5-10% tops of Trump-supporters, an already small group of people (with disproportionate political power), that can be persuaded by such a message. Which would have been more then enough to ensure a Trump loss.\n\nI don't exactly know to what extent this holds for Trump-supporters, but a significant amount of right-wing populist-voters are former (center)-left labor party voters. So even though such voters tend to hold bigotted views they can be won over, as long as they feel they have something to show for it. I remember reading some qualitative research into (iirc) Rhode Island Trump-voters, where the racist language was often coated in 'I see all these minorities getting social benefits, why can't I get that?' indicating that there is room here to appeal to them without not appealing to minorities. \n\nIn my own country we had a liberal-labor coalition, where the labor party basically caved to the liberal party on economic issues, whilst it was probably most prolific when it comes to our policies towards refugees. That party suffered the biggest loss in seats in our history.

Gains before justice are thefts and exploitation, and those attitudes are exactly why so many of the marches we've taken towards social progress have taken *centuries* when they could have taken decades.\n\n&gt;I live in a deeply red state. Most of my family and many close friends are (mostly blue-collar) Republicans. Certainly they are straight and white. \n\nI lived in a deep red, rural county in the rust belt for the first 22 years of my life. Literally everyone there, including my family, are straight, white, blue-collar Republicans. Just so you know, these people aren't foreign to me, I don't hypothesize about them from my ivory tower in New York City. I know them intimately and I've spent more than my share of time at bars, bonfires, and shooting ranges with them.\n\n&gt;Privileged is debatable.\n\nIt's only debatable because most of these towns have &lt;1% non-white people, so the privilege is entirely invisible to them, not non-existent. Both political parties go out of their way to lionize coal miners and farmers and drill press operators, and to *never* blame them for their problems, *never* chide them for making use of government services, which is completely *opposite* how they themselves tend talk about minorities, single mothers, gay people, etc.\n\n&gt;\"Self-interest obsessed\" is really stretching it. Certainly they have self-interest in mind, just like every other demographic does.\n\nSure, but the demographics that make up the Democratic party balance self interest with mutual interest. Part of being on the left is learning about solidarity, paying it forward, and protesting on behalf of people whose problems are not the same as yours. You protest with and on behalf of each other, with the understanding that it comes back around. The one and only time I saw the right wing turn out for mass protests was when a black man was elected president.\n\n&gt;But they are also decent people who generally want to see injustice and discrimination addressed as long as it doesn't come primarily at their expense. Which is actually fair, I think, although it may sound a little selfish.\n\nNo, it's not fair, and it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how injustice and discrimination work. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Disadvantage for black people equals advantage for white people. period. Every time a black resume is thrown in the garbage, all the white ones move that much closer to the top. Every black home buyer who's directed by real estate agents into shittier parts of town results in making those homes more sellable to racist whites. Every job that goes to a white person because racism knocked a black person out equals money in their pockets, equals investment into their communities, equals tax dollars for their schools. \n\n&gt;A lot of them know they are being screwed by the wealthy. A lot of them are very pro-union. They are reachable -- but the truth is they feel, and there is some validity to this, that liberals see them as the enemy rather than the real enemy, the super-rich, and want to achieve a better life for minorities at their expense.\n\nAnd they're wrong. None of the Democratic policies have \"non-whites only\" attached to them. The problem is that they're indignant not being the center of attention. When you go to a left wing event or activist circle, you go in knowing that the stage must be shared. Muslims get some time, Immigrants get some time, Black people get some time. Even then, at the end of the day, the majority of Democrats on TV are white people, but that's not enough for blue collar rural whites, for some reason. They must be on some kind of confirmation bias where they only notice the minorities speaking and tune out the 90% white people. \n\nI also highly doubt that this comes to them naturally. What you describe is a narrative that has been pumped into them for decades on talk radio and television, and it stretches back into the Civil Rights era, then back to Jim Crow. This state of affairs now is not distinct from the history of civil rights, it's only the latest chapter, these attitudes and resentments are the *direct descendents* of the ones that fought tooth and nail against equality every step of the way. I'm not willing to give up the ship now just because these people don't realize where they actually fit into history. Even many liberals simply don't understand this, they have a sort of blank slate image of social attitudes and don't understand how cultural transmission works between generations. What you're \"observing\" about the Democrats \"talking so much about minorities\" is a trope that's been rattling around in American politics for almost half a century now. \n\n&gt;Essentially I think that, although marginalized demographics face special challenges, it is much more of a handicap to be poor than it is to be a minority, although certainly being a minority increases the likelihood of you being poor. \n\nSure, but you put a poor black man and a poor white man next to each other, who's going to get more shit in life? Privilege must be examined on the basis of \"all else being equal\" or else it's inconclusive and has to be discarded. \n\n&gt;Social and economic issues are intertwined but not synonymous.\n\nI just don't see it that way. I think the division between the two is an illusion, set up by people who want to make the all-too-familiar pitch: \"Oh yes, we'll help black folks with that 10% pay gap someday, but for now let's just focus on getting **everyone** a 5% raise.\" Progress before equality is a promise that's been made and broken over, and over, and over again.\n\n&gt;I fit into a few marginalized categories myself. But I do know enough white conservatives personally to agree with the charge that liberals, while so full of empathy towards racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, are almost completely devoid of it towards blue-collar whites. Even assuming blue-collar whites are relatively better off than the other groups we're talking about, why does empathy have to be zero-sum?\n\nBlue collar conservative whites choose not to listen to Democrats when they push for infrastructure overhauls, minimum wage increases, protections for unions, universal healthcare and higher education, paid parental leave, subsidized or government-provided daycare, the list goes on. They take that, filter it through their lens of racial resentment, and decide they'd rather forgo ALL of that because a dime of it might go to a black person. As I said, I spent the first 22 years of my life in a deep red county in the rust belt, and all the conversations I had with white, blue collar conservatives eventually led to this. Sometimes you'd have to get them really angry before they'd admit it, but at the end of the day the attitude comes down to, \"Keep your hands out of my pocket, nigger.\" and as a result they're willing to cut off their noses to spite their faces.\n\nIf they want empathy, they have to show it, that's the compact within the Democratic party. Black activists chip in empathy for LGBT causes. White atheists chip in empathy for protecting Muslims from Islamophobia. Rich celebrities chip in empathy for the working poor. 10th generation Americans stand up for immigrants. Blue collar whites are welcome to join the coalition, but they have to see past themselves first, but instead they have a tendency to be bigoted themselves, or *at the very best* are quietly unbigoted and do nothing to fight bigotry. The fact that they're willing to vote GOP at all is a huge red flag that they're fundamentally bereft of empathy. As a result, any alliance extended to them by Democrats is by nature precarious and short-lived, and **necessarily** means sidelining all of the groups whom, when attention is paid to them, makes blue collar whites indignant. \n\nIt's just gross to me that someone defending blue collar conservative whites demand Democrats show some empathy. They're coming from a position from which practically zero empathy flows and demanding an extremely multicultural, multiracial, pluralistic party sideline everything to give them (what amounts to) near-exclusive attention. It's the most bratty and entitled and oblivious mindset I can imagine. Again, this is largely based on the people I know in the rust belt. They offer no sympathy to anyone unlike themselves (except the occasional black child in Africa, as long as that child *stays* in Africa), but expect everybody all over the country to drop what they're doing and solve their problems and theirs alone.\n\nI admire that you want to mend the relationship between Democrats and blue collar whites, but it's dismaying to me that your idea of mending it is 100% about Democrats bending and shirking their commitments and principles, while those blue collar whites get to stay the same forever and never fix the really stupid and shitty parts of their culture that they inherited and cling to. To me that just sounds like making their party into a populist Republican party clone, using the government to solve problems but through a lens where only solutions that benefit straight white men are prioritized. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the Democrats are fine, it's blue collar whites that need to improve, and as I said, I will spoil the shit out of every election from here on out if the Democrats bend on the fundamental identity of the party as one of a pluralistic compact between equals sharing a stage.  I could not bear to vote for a party that regularly abandons principles to protect the fragile egos of straight white men, and I've held my nose and pulled the lever for a **lot** of elections.

They offer no sympathy to anyone unlike themselves (except the occasional black child in Africa, as long as that child &lt;em&gt;stays&lt;/em&gt; in Africa), but expect everybody all over the country to drop what they&amp;#39;re doing and solve their problems and theirs alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admire that you want to mend the relationship between Democrats and blue collar whites, but it&amp;#39;s dismaying to me that your idea of mending it is 100% about Democrats bending and shirking their commitments and principles, while those blue collar whites get to stay the same forever and never fix the really stupid and shitty parts of their culture that they inherited and cling to. To me that just sounds like making their party into a populist Republican party clone, using the government to solve problems but through a lens where only solutions that benefit straight white men are prioritized. I&amp;#39;m going to go out on a limb here and say that the Democrats are fine, it&amp;#39;s blue collar whites that need to improve, and as I said, I will spoil the shit out of every election from here on out if the Democrats bend on the fundamental identity of the party as one of a pluralistic compact between equals sharing a stage.  I could not bear to vote for a party that regularly abandons principles to protect the fragile egos of straight white men, and I&amp;#39;ve held my nose and pulled the lever for a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of elections. If anything, the voice that Democrats offer to marginalized groups has been the one good that&amp;#39;s kept me voting for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg63ptr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042933.0, "created_utc": 1492014133.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60w69", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gilescb", "parent_id": "t1_dg5u2rf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Perfect.

After the election I posted something to facebook where I said that despite being liberal I was optimistic that the GOP congress would work for the country as a whole and represent my interests against the tyranny I feared coming from the White House.  I figured we were now all in this mess together (clearly I was wrong). My black friend commented that the GOP has never represented him or his interests and he has no reason to think they would do so now. I recognized in that moment that my opinion came from a place of privilege and my friend, having very different life experiences than me could not see eye to eye with me on that issue.  I am also a woman so I can see where he is coming from, as the GOP isn&amp;#39;t super supportive of women&amp;#39;s issues either.  But I at least recognized that he had a perspective that was different than mine for reasons I didn&amp;#39;t have experience with and it helped me to understand him better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg66xqj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046256.0, "created_utc": 1492017456.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xiv8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xiv8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xiv8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xiv8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85nmj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gilescb", "parent_id": "t1_dg84wgu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My wife is Japanese, but thanks for playing.

It also fails to capture how things like low-graduation rates, high incarceration rates and teen pregnancy, which disproportionately affect poor communities (both rural and urban, white and black) are ultimately economic issues because they effectively remove people from the labor market. That attitude is polarizing.  When you say that the dems should focus on issues facing all Americans you are discounting the experience of tens of millions of Americans and what they deal with every day.  The message that economic inequality is the source of all societies ills and fixing that will fix everything invalidates the very real experience of people who are discriminated against because of their skin color or religion or sexual orientation or gender.  \n\nCommunication and messaging were a problem during this campaign, not just from the candidates but from supporters as well. There were HUGE privilege issues at play here but too many people don't know how to talk about or hear about privilege without getting aggressive/defensive.  \n\n&gt;A common strategy to belittle those interested in these broader issues was to say that we just don't understand the importance of, say, LGBT issues because we're white males, \"privileged\", \"Berniebros\", etc.\"\n\nI don't think the intent of most people discussing this was to belittle, its just that many people are terrible at communicating what privilege means.  At this point I think we need to jettison the word entirely because it is far too loaded.  When talking about how \"privilege\" affects one's ability to understand the importance of an issue all that really means is that is very easy for a white person to look at a black person, or a man to look at a woman, or a christian to look at a muslim, or a straight person to look at a gay person, or an able-bodied person to look at a disabled person, and say \"your problems are like my problems, we are the same.\"  And that is great.  It is important to find common ground and face common issues in a united way.  But too often you see the person in the privileged position discounting the experiences of the other person because they themselves have never experienced it.  \"That wasn't sexism, you just didn't interview well,\" or \"That wasn't racism, you were just dressed like a thug.\"  That attitude is dismissive of the reality \"others\" experience and perpetuates the privilege and superiority of the privileged person-- I'm sure most people don't intend to convey that message and don't even realize they are doing it, but they are.  \n\nThe reality is that \"Bernie-Bros\" didn't really understand the importance of LGBT issues or BLM or whatever other social movements you want to include, but not because they were racist or sexist or intentionally biased, but because they were valuing their own experience above the experience of the \"others\" because they genuinely believed that to be the more important issue.  That made those in the other category feel discounted.  \n\nI am not convinced Bernie would have won the general. \"Socialist\" is a dirty word in much of America.

It also fails to capture how things like low-graduation rates, high incarceration rates and teen pregnancy, which disproportionately affect poor communities (both rural and urban, white and black) are ultimately economic issues because they effectively remove people from the labor market. That attitude is polarizing.  When you say that the dems should focus on issues facing all Americans you are discounting the experience of tens of millions of Americans and what they deal with every day.  The message that economic inequality is the source of all societies ills and fixing that will fix everything invalidates the very real experience of people who are discriminated against because of their skin color or religion or sexual orientation or gender.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Communication and messaging were a problem during this campaign, not just from the candidates but from supporters as well. There were HUGE privilege issues at play here but too many people don&amp;#39;t know how to talk about or hear about privilege without getting aggressive/defensive.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A common strategy to belittle those interested in these broader issues was to say that we just don&amp;#39;t understand the importance of, say, LGBT issues because we&amp;#39;re white males, &amp;quot;privileged&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Berniebros&amp;quot;, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the intent of most people discussing this was to belittle, its just that many people are terrible at communicating what privilege means.  At this point I think we need to jettison the word entirely because it is far too loaded.  When talking about how &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot; affects one&amp;#39;s ability to understand the importance of an issue all that really means is that is very easy for a white person to look at a black person, or a man to look at a woman, or a christian to look at a muslim, or a straight person to look at a gay person, or an able-bodied person to look at a disabled person, and say &amp;quot;your problems are like my problems, we are the same.&amp;quot;  And that is great.  It is important to find common ground and face common issues in a united way.  But too often you see the person in the privileged position discounting the experiences of the other person because they themselves have never experienced it.  &amp;quot;That wasn&amp;#39;t sexism, you just didn&amp;#39;t interview well,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;That wasn&amp;#39;t racism, you were just dressed like a thug.&amp;quot;  That attitude is dismissive of the reality &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; experience and perpetuates the privilege and superiority of the privileged person-- I&amp;#39;m sure most people don&amp;#39;t intend to convey that message and don&amp;#39;t even realize they are doing it, but they are.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is that &amp;quot;Bernie-Bros&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t really understand the importance of LGBT issues or BLM or whatever other social movements you want to include, but not because they were racist or sexist or intentionally biased, but because they were valuing their own experience above the experience of the &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; because they genuinely believed that to be the more important issue.  That made those in the other category feel discounted.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced Bernie would have won the general. &amp;quot;Socialist&amp;quot; is a dirty word in much of America.
