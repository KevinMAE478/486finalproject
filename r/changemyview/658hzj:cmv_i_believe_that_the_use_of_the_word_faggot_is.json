I am well aware that there's nothing in my original comment explicitly generalizing it, but I think it is reasonable to expect people to draw that inference, especially given the context.\n\n&gt; We have no clear responsibility to account for the feelings or sensitivity of others. \n\nWell, true, if you do not care about other people then it is not important how they respond to situations you put them in. Most people do care, and that is enough incentive to be more considerate.\n\nAs for responsibility, that is a confused notion and has more to do with virtue-signalling than anything else. You do indeed not have an inherent responsibility to be considerate, but I (and I should this time make clear that I expect you to infer others may share my perspective) will likely have a lower regard for you if you are inconsiderate.\n\nHonestly, I think both you and OP were overcomplicating things. A large amount of people are opposed to using that word, that word has a greater impact on a certain demographic, you (presumably) do not belong to that demographic, they want you to stop using the word, you should be considerate and comply. Instead, you question the validity of their emotional response, despite the fact that you probably cannot influence it much on a macroscopic level. I consider that either irrational or actively hostile.\n\n&gt; We must be clear as well, that any ideas must be freely spoken about\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; and merely use language that would not lead to people to begin to act irrationally (as that's what you have to admit people are doing when they are \"triggered\", correct?)\n\nAgreed with reservations; being triggered is not rationally motivated, but there are other likely objections against using the word.
