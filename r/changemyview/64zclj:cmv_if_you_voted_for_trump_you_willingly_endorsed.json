I feel like the Trump voters who only picked him because he was the lesser of two evils didn&amp;#39;t listen to the &amp;quot;With Her&amp;quot; crowd because of the enemy effect. People are so filled with pride, that they usually don&amp;#39;t want to admit defeat. People tend not to listen to the other side as they don&amp;#39;t want to admit that they were wrong. That is why I find this subreddit so interesting, as you sometimes see someone who will not cave in all all to their view, similar to someone who didn&amp;#39;t listen to the other side because they didn&amp;#39;t want to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you again though :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg6p006", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065708.0, "created_utc": 1492036908.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zclj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6o339", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "parent_id": "t1_dg6o2uy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Onlyusemifeet ([3\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Onlyusemifeet)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

They voted for Trump because Trump at least spoke to them, and what they are seeing around them, in an economic sense.

There was no economic recovery in the city I live in, nor the surrounding areas. The two major factories that were the economic drive in this town are NOT coming back. The businesses that are associated with those factories have closed and are not coming back. The entire city is characterized by abandoned buildings. The neighborhood I live in is beautiful. Comprised of large elegant stately homes built in the late 1800s. Homes that would go for millions of dollars in most other medium sized cities.

You could argue that Kennedy (or maybe Carter) was the last president to really focus on this middle class under pressure. Trump made these people a focal point of his campaign, as did Bernie Sanders. This is why many people who supported Bernie in the primaries jumped to Trump, despite the fact that politically they are almost polar opposites. These people, have been ignored for at least two decades, if not more, as they watch their life crumble around them. These people are desperate, trapped for life in these small towns with no escape. Their children are trapped in these small towns for life. The ones that CAN get out, do and mostly have, the rest are stuck. These people are the ones voting for Trump. There is no money to \"retrain\" to help these people. University is more expensive than ever and there are no funds to target rural Americans. Even if they retrained, there are no jobs here for them to take. Rural America is being absolutely pounded by poverty and no one gives a shit.

Rural voters view this statement as return the USA to a time when their city was not a barren wasteland of foreclosures, abandoned properties, drug use and crushing poverty. A time when they could proudly keep food on the table and not worry about the economic collapse of their world around them. These communities have been crying for help, for someone to reverse the continuous blow by blow beat down they are receiving.
