I\u2019m not saying this is the case, but purely from the data we cannot conclude one or the other, I\u2019m somewhat of a statistician by trade, and I\u2019d even go as far as to say there is **not a single** study that properly categorizes the effect of drug policies, simply because there is no country where all drugs are legal. Even if there is, we\u2019d have to account for other covariates, selection bias and a thousand more things to reach a conclusion, and we don\u2019t even know the first thing about multi-generational effects. The closest thing we have is different marijuana policies across countries but even there the in-group variance  (legal and not legal) is enormous and I\u2019d be hesitant to draw any conclusion. Furthermore we have literally zero reason to assume that effects from marijuana policies necessarily carry over to other drugs. Meth is about as close to weed as weed is to orange juice.\n\nIf we want to consider **truly** long term effects, the only use case we really have is alcohol, and the only data point is that after centuries of legalized alcohol, it is widely used. This does not prove a causal effect any more than the war on drugs proves it the other way around, but it is worth considering.

It is a poorly kept business secret that if you can get your customers addicted, you are set for life. The food-, drink- and legal drugs industry understands this all too well, and do not take any steps to prevent it. Why would they?

Americans consume 55kg (120 freedom units) of sugar per year (including HFCS), and the fast food industry generated a whopping **$200 billion** of revenue in the USA alone. I don\u2019t really see a reason why the legalized recreational drug industry would have public health as a prime interest, when it is most likely at odds with their profits, and that behavior would not mirror comparable industries.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this \u2018changed your view\u2019, but I felt there were some downsides missing from the picture, and I hope you now at least consider them.

Keep in mind that the vast majority of drugs **are** legalized, taxed and regulated. Alcohol, tobacco and anything you can get in a pharmacy.\n\nI\u2019ll try to address your arguments one by one, although I don\u2019t disagree with all of them. For the sake of simplicity I\u2019ll limit the post to recreational drugs. Performance enhancing drugs are a whole separate issue.\n\n&gt;-It reduced crime.\n\n&gt;-Less people in jail.\n\n&gt;-Save lots of money by ending the war on drugs and by not jailing drug users.\n\nThis is really the same argument iterated three times, which I will call the \u2018resources on crime\u2019-argument. Other people have pointed out that all of these also apply to legalizing murder. We obviously don\u2019t want to legalize murder, so this cannot be a conplete argument on its own. An obvious distinction is that murder is a *malum in se* while illegal drug use is a *malum prohibitum*. However, so are hitchiking (in some regions), copyright infringement, jaywalking, illegal immigration and building a house without a licence, but there are good (or at least plausible) reasons to outlaw all of these. The \u2018resources on crime\u2019-argument **only** works if you can show **separately** that this outweighs the negative effects. The above examples show that this is not self-evident for any *malum prohibitum*. You seem to think they do, as is your right, I disagree. I'll explain why in the rest of the post.\n\n&gt;-Gain money from the taxes on drugs.\n\nI must say this seems somewhat at odds with the obvious anti-government libertarian views in the rest of the post (a tyrannical overreach of the government into people\u2019s personal freedom and whatnot). However, I certainly don\u2019t want to resort to a strawman argument so I\u2019ll let that slide. For the most part, I agree that the ability to gain tax revenue would be a net plus for society.\n\n&gt;-Adults should have the freedom and liberty to put whatever they want in their own bodies as long as their not hurting anybody else. Its their choice even if it ends up hurting them. Its an overeach of government and tyranical to take away the freedom of adults in this way.\n\nAgain I am sympathetic to the argument, but the harsh reality is that some people need protection from themselves, and for lack of an alternative the government needs to supply it. Many people simply are not capable of making an informed decision on the subject and will be led by misinformation or no information at all. \n\nI saw you mention in another post something to the extend of \u2018Most people when they first start the drug know how addictive it can be\u2019 but unfortunately this simply isn\u2019t true. I\u2019ve read a few biographies of drug users. Anthony Kiedis (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame, with an obvious heroin problem) and Wim Kieft (a European soccer player who blew like $ 8 million on cocaine) spring to mind. The conscious decision making you describe doesn\u2019t match their stories at all. Often, alcohol is involved, people hardly know what they\u2019re actually taking (idk some white powder, Steve brought it), and the effect does not match conventional wisdom at all. \n\nFor instance, the often heard \u2018If you do heroin one time you\u2019re hooked for life\u2019 is a complete myth. A typical heroin user case is this: The user **smokes** his first heroin. Injecting your first dose does not really happen as it is kind of equivalent to having an entire bottle of Jack Daniels as your first drink. Often they\u2019re drunk when it happens, imagine an after-party kind of setting. The high feels good, obviously, but when it wears off it does not leave them with a craving. They go on with their lives and pretty much forget about it until months later someone else brings some to the next get-together. \u2018Huh\u2019, they think, \u2018Apparently all this \u201cinstantly hooked\u201d stuff is bullshit. I hadn\u2019t even thought about heroin for months. This doesn\u2019t seem so bad. What\u2019s the harm in another hit?\u2019 It creeps up on you. You repeat this a few times and you do not notice the addiction until it\u2019s already there. An informed decision, taking the upsides, downsides and risks into account, could not be more different from what these people are doing.\n\nFurthermore, ask yourself: what makes you think we **can** educate people on the dangers of drugs? Where would we do this? In schools? What about people in poor neighborhoods (already at prime risk) who may skip school, or what about my friend Steve, who tried it and says it isn\u2019t all as bad as they told us in Drug Ed? What is our track record on educating people on similar matters? Alcohol? Tobacco? Fast food? Soft drinks? Many people (citation needed) are alcoholics, and isn\u2019t like 35% of the USA obese nowadays? **Clearly** the education department needs some work before we can apply it to substances that are even more dangerous, more addictive and more enjoyable while we expect people to stay clean and informed.\n\nAlso take into account that legalizing for example crystal meth doesn\u2019t just legalize crystal meth. It legalizes a crystal meth production business, a crystal meth government lobby, a crystal meth R&amp;D department (sugar free meth!) and in-your-face crystal meth establishments all over your town, featuring enjoyable social settings, neon signs and two-for-one discounts between 10 and 11. \n\nImagine a Coca Cola-type conglomerate pushing meth unto the population, complete with Christmas commercials, product placement in Game of Thrones (okay, maybe not Game of Thrones), and Kendall Jenner offering some branded meth to a police officer during a civil rights march. Hell, I\u2019d be tempted myself, and I consider myself pretty smart (sorry) and aware of the risks. Like the majority of the western population I was also a fucking idiot and a kid when I just turned 18, and I thank God I didn\u2019t have a clue where to get any of that stuff. \u2018Just once\u2019 is very easy when all you have to do is show your ID in a store and hand over 5 dollars.\n\n**I wish** personal freedom was a good enough argument to offset all of that, but I\u2019m afraid it isn\u2019t. People are happier and society works better when some of our freedoms are limited. That\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s the way it is. I guess you could disagree with this if you truly believe freedom is the be-all-end-all of governmental goals, but I think \u2018to govern well\u2019 is a governments ultimate goal and this sometimes involves limitations.\n\nWhew, that turned out longer than I thought.

But this could be better managed though decriminalisation, rather than legalisation or keeping them illegal. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg5ppn6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492022804.0, "created_utc": 1491994004.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wg05", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wcbh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BrennanDobak", "parent_id": "t3_64wg05", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It might be a little late, but if you are still paying attention to your CMV I would like to make a few points, although several people have already made some fantastic points you dismissed.\n\n\nPlease elaborate on what you mean by \"regulate.\" Do you mean that they would need to go through the FDA before being legally released to the public?
