The assignment is designed to give you practice in areas such as forming a topic, generating a thesis statement, doing research, integrating that research into your essay as support for your argument, formatting documents, proofreading, revising, refutation, etc.  These are things I care about.  Now, if you are simply reusing a paper you wrote in another class, then you aren&amp;#39;t getting to practice any of these skills.  The whole point of the assignment is to compel you to go through the entire writing process, so that you can practice all the stages in the process and get better at them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg3strh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491910618.0, "created_utc": 1491881818.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o5pp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3uz9i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TwentyFiveChestnuts", "parent_id": "t1_dg3u027", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "... \n\nThat seems a bit unnecessarily antagonistic. \n\nWhy are you calling said writing \"bad\"?
