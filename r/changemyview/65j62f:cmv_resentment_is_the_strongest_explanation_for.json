[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "changemyview", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the middle of the country--i.e. the mid-West, Rust Belt, Appalachia, and similar places--voted for Trump in larger numbers than expected.  Common explanations are &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Economic: these places have never fully recovered from the recession, and automation is killing jobs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social: drug addiction, hatred of the success of gay and black rights movements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Political: resentment at the success of Obamacare because they ideologically disagree with government intervention, a perception that we are restraining and embarrassing ourselves in global conflicts, and the growth ideological libertarianism&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Media manipulation: Russian bots, Russian hacking, moneyed powers like Bannon and the Mercer family building organizations to distort public opinion of Clinton, and more basic media obsession with a disgusting spectacle which translates into free media for Trump&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These likely contributed some amount to middle America voting for Trump.  However, I think a stronger reason--one that more consistently unifies observed behavior--is a feeling of resentment, driven by the perception that these people are no longer valued in America.  I&amp;#39;m not going to argue whether they deserve respect--probably they deserve more in some ways and less in others.  I won&amp;#39;t argue whether they are respected--I think it&amp;#39;s clear that people who don&amp;#39;t live in these places, on average, think the people who do live there are mostly stupid and a little crazy.  Also note that I&amp;#39;m not excusing or blaming these people, just explaining; this view has nothing to do with me assigning blame to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my positive reasons, i.e. evidence that they feel this way and it motivated them to vote for Trump.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) More than ever people personally identify with their political affiliation.  Rather than voting Republican or mostly agreeing with the Republican platform, people identify as a Republican, and vote for them come hell or high water--ironically, that literally has happened, we&amp;#39;re living through hell and are about to get a lot of high water.  They see Republicanism, patriotism, and Christianity as virtue-signaling--showing that they are good, ethical people worthy of respect.  They also see each of these things--and therefore themselves--as being condescended by liberals, and they resent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The collapse of economic opportunities in these places is a signal to them that they have lost social value.  They culturally identify with having a strong work ethic and when there were industry, farm, and manufacturing jobs, they were rewarded for their work ethic.  Now jobless, they are desperate to bring these jobs back and reassert the values they once had confirmed in their economy and society.  That&amp;#39;s why, rather than face the fact that these jobs are never coming back, they desperately voted for a candidate&amp;#39;s silly promises to bring them back.  They&amp;#39;re also suspicious that immigrants have taken these jobs and hope the jobs will come back if they deport immigrants.  They want these jobs specifically--not tech jobs, not legal jobs, not retail jobs--because they see these jobs specifically as masculine and socially valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/breaking-faith/517785/\"&gt;&amp;quot;Establishing causation is difficult, but we know that culturally conservative white Americans who are disengaged from church experience less economic success and more family breakdown than those who remain connected, and they grow more pessimistic and resentful.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;  Church attendance was down before the election, and seems to correlate with a resentful and isolated attitude.  With queer and women&amp;#39;s rights advancing, the explicit message was that Christianity is an ancient religion inappropriate for the modern era.  A lot of my family in Florida, and old high school friends, post defiant Christian and nostalgic posts.  Who are they defying in their Facebook network?  Well, me a little, I suppose--although they probably aren&amp;#39;t thinking of me specifically, but me-like people who went off to college.  They&amp;#39;re virtue signaling to their network, and feeling like their culture is decaying and under siege.  They&amp;#39;re echo-chambering their resentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Black people&amp;#39;s social value is rising and middle America sees it as a decline in white social value.  Maybe it is a decline in the automatic authority, trust, and value that the nation assigns to white people&amp;#39;s expressions; and maybe our society used to value white expressions too much, or used to devalue minority expression too much--so in a sense this is more like a course-correction rather than an injustice.  But deserve it or not, we know that people are always angry at losing anything, and rationalize why they deserved to have it.  The narrative of white privilege may be true, but for these poor Americans, they feel accused of a crime they didn&amp;#39;t commit.  Standing in their shoes, it looks to them like they did everything right and didn&amp;#39;t get rewarded--they have no understanding that, and no particular desire to understand that, black people have experienced worse for longer.  Segregation of populations, together with manipulated media, gives middle America ground to hold onto a comfortable fantasy that everyone else has it so easy and they have it so hard.  They feel under-valued and angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Trump represented a shameless assertion--more like a suicidal, berzerk scream--of middle America&amp;#39;s most exaggerated values.  It made them feel valued, considered, defended, represented, and it made everyone else feel hurt the way that they had been hurting.  He&amp;#39;s a use car salesman in his personal history and personality, but a) subtlety is not the public&amp;#39;s strong suit, so this didn&amp;#39;t matter as much as the fact that he doesn&amp;#39;t flinch, and b) they&amp;#39;re willing to overlook his coastal elitism by deliberately focusing on an alternative if fictional narrative:  he fairly earned what he has, and he&amp;#39;ll give everyone else the same opportunity.  In fact, Trump&amp;#39;s main strong suit is his ability to collect and deflect responsibility regardless of whether he truly is responsible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the negative reasons, i.e. why I don&amp;#39;t think the other reasons explain enough:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) We&amp;#39;ve had economic troubles before but they never split along regional and cultural lines like this--we never ridiculed people in the Dust Bowl or Great Depression, because we fundamentally saw everyone as American.  Now in the recovery from the recession, coastal elitists jeer at the stupidity of middle America and their self-inflicted suffering.  We&amp;#39;ve had cultural fights but back then even relatively secular people still were Christian and asserted the value and piety of Christians, and only suggested moderation.  The Civil Rights fight was divisive but the liberal side fundamentally didn&amp;#39;t advocate the destruction of conservatism; rather than antagonize, it begged for black people to be allowed to take part in a shared middle class.  We&amp;#39;ve faced media manipulation before but it never struck at our joints; it always tried to sway us all in one direction or another rather than splitting and moving a subset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) White people, even in these regions, still have basically good standards of living, even if they have dipped a bit and they feel more stress to maintain it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) People didn&amp;#39;t really vote for policy--in fact, we hardly heard any policy from Trump.  Everything was primarily pitched at the gut, not the head.  He gave no international policy or plan; he didn&amp;#39;t tell us how he&amp;#39;s get the wall built or how he&amp;#39;d make Mexico pay and I doubt even his supporters really think that&amp;#39;s going to happen; in opposing globalism he actually contradicted libertarianism.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/the-flip-flop-president/522840/\"&gt;He can flip-flop all he wants and not lose support.&lt;/a&gt; Also,\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/05/01/on-issue-after-issue-voters-favor-democrats-and-for-now-they-dont-want-to-vote-for-them-either/?utm_term=.c59d42a1080c\"&gt;we also know that most people support Democratic policy more than Republican policy, even if they don&amp;#39;t vote that way--so policy isn&amp;#39;t the real issue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Media manipulation could only get a toe-hold in the first place by exploiting these existing resentments.  I don&amp;#39;t think FOX News has run a single story in its decades-long run that didn&amp;#39;t fundamentally come from resentment--wherever it comes from, it&amp;#39;s not reality.  FOX didn&amp;#39;t create our division, even if it has super-charged it; people complained about the left-wing media decades before that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Yes mainstream reps and dems also had (more reasonable) policy ideas for how to deal with these losses of industries, things like job training etc, but those plans weren&amp;#39;t perfect; nobody likes change, and many people simply aren&amp;#39;t fit to learn programming or such at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this focus on small county issues played a massive role in Trumps win. For those who supported Trump for these reasons, I wouldn&amp;#39;t exactly call them wise, as his &amp;#39;solutions&amp;#39; are wrought with problems, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t call them resentful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgb026z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492310686.0, "created_utc": 1492281886.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j62f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j62f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc0owc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AddemF", "parent_id": "t1_dgbk11n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think you assume I'm a leftist, which I'm not.

I disagree with basically everything you wrote, every assumption you made, every \"negative reason\" and \"positive reason\".

If you really want to change your view you are going to have to let go of a huge collection of assumptions. In my attempt to change your view I am going to directly challenge the most factually innacurate of your assumptions and leave alone your assertions like: \"come hell or high water--ironically, that literally has happened, we're living through hell and are about to get a lot of high water.\" \n           \n\"Positive Reasons\"       \n1) NO. Voters in the US are rejecting the two party system and that's a big reason why Trump won. Don't confuse Pro-America nationalism with support for political factions. [The majority is neither DEM or GOP](http://www.npr.org/2016/02/28/467961962/sick-of-political-parties-unaffiliated-voters-are-changing-politics) and [Third Parties](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/third-party-voters-played-key-role-election-results) are stealing votes from both Blue and Red parties.      \n         \n2) The collapse of critically important sectors of the American economy happened for real reasons. Some of these were the direct result of policy and others are the result of automation. This is not because of social values this is economics and education and industry. Nations like Sweden embrace capitalism decades ago and the people of that nation worked together to build great things to offer the world. Sweden exports Vehicles, Airplanes, heavy machines, furniture. The tiny nation can afford to have strong social nets because they have a vibrant economy that is not due to exploitation of natural resources. The US economy instead spent much of the last 50 years looting the wealth of the middle class and exploiting foreign peoples to manufacture goods like textiles and giving away every technological innovation we could via horrible policies that allow the wealthy 1% to capitalize while leaving the middle class to starve.        \n           \n3) The majority of Trump voters were Women and minorities. Look it up.\n\n4) I went to elementary school with all white people. My state was very white, and spent a ton on education. My third grade class was 14 kids. 7 Boys and 7 Girls. 4 of those boys are now dead of opiate overdoses. My home state was Vermont. I supported Bernie obviously. People like to share what they have. \"Segregation of populations, together with manipulated media, gives middle America ground to hold onto a comfortable fantasy\" Sure it does. Let's let go of the fantasy. We need a better government then we have had for the last few decades at least.      \n        \n5) Trump is fake. He absolutely had to be fake to win. Why? Because the opposing political faction painted him as a vile disgusting human and tried to argue that any \"Trump Voter\" would embody those values. When accused of being a misogynist vile man who says horrible things about all women, Trump responded in the only way that would completely win the moment in the eyes of the majority of people for good or bad reasons. \"I only ever said horrible things about Rosie O'Donnel\". Brilliant lie. It's not true. Every human has said bad things before and the Billionaire playboy that is Donald Trump said and did more than most absolutely. But Trump being a **bad Christian man** has nothing to do with me or you. Us, the American people, we need to be concerned with killing the TPP and renegotiating NAFTA and net neutrality and economic opportunity for Americans. Americans should be driving cars built in America by people who make $50/hour. Americans should not be exploiting Mexicans on $1/hour wages building cars in a way that makes a CEO rich somewhere. If Trump tried to grab a pussy or not makes no difference. The President needs to work for you and I.        \n           \n\"Negative Reasons\"        \n1) The internet exists now and we have Facebook that allows us to comfortably reside within thought bubbles. I don't see Trump supporters suffering, I see them celebrating, living life, and going long on the stock market. However many of my liberal friends who haven't switched to Trump are reporting through Facebook their nightmarish struggle with what I think is Cognitive Dissonance. The Media told you that you were right and moral and good because you supported a certain political faction and that narrative is collapsing.       \n          \n2) No. You can't just refer to \"These Regions\" and end up with a true statement. Certain Regions I am familiar with that is included in your \"They\" term have not \"dipped a bit\". These are regions where nearly every child leaves to find work after school or dies from Opiate addictions. The towns are dead.         \n          \n3) Racist people vote for Trump. Lots of those people don't pay attention to policy. I do however. The Build a Wall plan came with a very very simple payment plan. Tax some of the remittences sent home by Illegal immigrants. [It's Billions of dollars](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/01/news/economy/mexico-peso-money-transfer-trump-remittance/) and completely possible. I knew the claim by the MSM that \"there was no plan\" was bullshit when I voted for Clinton.      \n        \n4) The MSM created your problem of cognitive dissonance. It was in their interest to craft a narrative for you to help you consume their advertisers products. FOX is a small piece of the MSM. Every one of these corrupted organizations is capable of producing a good piece of journalism. It's just the very basic business model of CNN or MSNBC to offer a product to private interests like Pharmaceutical companies or political parties.      \n         \nDid I help change your View?

Brilliant lie. It&amp;#39;s not true. Every human has said bad things before and the Billionaire playboy that is Donald Trump said and did more than most absolutely. But Trump being a &lt;strong&gt;bad Christian man&lt;/strong&gt; has nothing to do with me or you. Us, the American people, we need to be concerned with killing the TPP and renegotiating NAFTA and net neutrality and economic opportunity for Americans. Americans should be driving cars built in America by people who make $50/hour. Americans should not be exploiting Mexicans on $1/hour wages building cars in a way that makes a CEO rich somewhere. If Trump tried to grab a pussy or not makes no difference. The President needs to work for you and I.        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Negative Reasons&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\n1) The internet exists now and we have Facebook that allows us to comfortably reside within thought bubbles. I don&amp;#39;t see Trump supporters suffering, I see them celebrating, living life, and going long on the stock market. However many of my liberal friends who haven&amp;#39;t switched to Trump are reporting through Facebook their nightmarish struggle with what I think is Cognitive Dissonance. The Media told you that you were right and moral and good because you supported a certain political faction and that narrative is collapsing.       &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) No. You can&amp;#39;t just refer to &amp;quot;These Regions&amp;quot; and end up with a true statement. Certain Regions I am familiar with that is included in your &amp;quot;They&amp;quot; term have not &amp;quot;dipped a bit&amp;quot;. These are regions where nearly every child leaves to find work after school or dies from Opiate addictions. The towns are dead.         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Racist people vote for Trump. Lots of those people don&amp;#39;t pay attention to policy. I do however. The Build a Wall plan came with a very very simple payment plan. Tax some of the remittences sent home by Illegal immigrants. &lt;a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/01/news/economy/mexico-peso-money-transfer-trump-remittance/\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s Billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; and completely possible. I knew the claim by the MSM that &amp;quot;there was no plan&amp;quot; was bullshit when I voted for Clinton.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) The MSM created your problem of cognitive dissonance. It was in their interest to craft a narrative for you to help you consume their advertisers products. FOX is a small piece of the MSM. Every one of these corrupted organizations is capable of producing a good piece of journalism. It&amp;#39;s just the very basic business model of CNN or MSNBC to offer a product to private interests like Pharmaceutical companies or political parties.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I help change your View?

I feel the majority of votes were easy to discuss. You had two options, Trump or Hilary. Here is some important points purely from observation from Reddit activity and other sources:\n\n\nMajority of educated/younger citizens agree both candidates were awful. Because of this, they were torn which is actually worse. \n\n\nTrump had the advantage that all Republicans hated Hilary by default more but also had the advantage of having a strong base within the voting population. Hilary had a problem where even democrats were voting for Trump not because they support Trump but think he will cause less damage. \n\n\nThe news served a strong role. Hilary has lost a lot of trust in recent history. \"Resentment\" implies revenge taking place when voting against her, which wasn't the case. Distrust and resentment are two very different things. \n\n\n\nI am majority of the time Democrat. I agree with environmental issues requiring priority, I believe in pushing programs that help humans navigate our complicated society, I agree with the original healthcare plan that got ruined into the shit show it is now, I agree maybe the military budget is a bit higher than it needs to and it could totally go anywhere else and help the people more whether it's education, health, science research, space  exploration, or even infrastructure development. These are all varying points in democratic concerns among many others. \n\n\nI also subscribe to many republican ideologies, I am not fond of hand outs for example and feel food and other resources should be given away rather than money to buy it since anyone at the bottom of the wealth pyramid that needs handouts are the same people that probably don't know how to manage money. I also think the system is fairly equal in opportunity, granted that very well varies upon where you live as well so I understand both sides to that.\n\n\nOverall, I hated Trump. He came off as an incompetent donkey that I felt would accomplish nothing during his presidency. However, that's why I voted for him, I trusted it would be four years of no progress rather than the opposite, four years of anti-progress. My distrust in Hilary and her clear knowledge in how the government works was terrifying to me. Trump has stupid ideas I strongly disagree with. I love foreigners, I love immigrants, I love diversity, and I want more of them to keep America special like it is with the such diverse population. Trump wants the opposite, he made it clear it's his passion to close borders. However, I also knew he wouldn't accomplish that task, so that was irrelevant to me if he should be president or not. Many people took that into account as a reason to vote for him, but I took it as a reason TO vote for him, he wants to accomplish impossible tasks while Clinton wishes to accomplish tasks I very much had confidence she could deliver on. \n\n\nI am far from alone. It was not resentment or revenge towards Clinton, it was simply distrust and fear. The majority of older individuals also have a very programmed opinion on Trump. They believe Trump is a huge business man. Our age group knows that isn't true, but anyone that uses television to feel informed will think otherwise. Donald Trump is a business man, good with money, he MUST be what's good for a country struggling with money issues... right? \n\n\nClinton though, she keeps talking about Russia being a problem, possibly a war. Trump was preaching the opposite. You know what people that lived in a country that's been at war for over fifteen years that hasn't seen ANY results want? PEACE. Clinton poorly attempted to portray herself as a competent leader that wishes to handle business and not play games, totally the leader the country needs. As a result, the moron portrayed herself without any help from Trump as a war monger. Everyone felt she was a war monger based on her attitude. Trump and his followers piggy-backed this and not only did Trump talked about LESS military activity, but he exploited her words and regularly used them against her. So now we know it wasn't also just issues against trusting Clinton, it's also about whether or not who is most likely going to bring peace to this country as well. \n\n\nA good number of Trump followers are splitting up, some unsatisfied with what he delivered and some still confident. The fact there is such tension going on implies there was also some form of trust invested in him as a candidate. Yes, it's very possible I am the minority. I used low level game theory on who to root for, some literally liked Trump until later when he seized to show any improvement towards his promises. The fact there is actual sincere anger from the country implies that I am the minority, that everyone angry is actually SURPRISED with what we got. This means that people actually voted for Trump for a reason that did not involve resentment but rather they expected something out of him.\n\n\nAll and all, media manipulation has been going both ways, sides have been split since the moment Bernie Sanders and all the incompetent morons in the republican party proved people do indeed watch those speeches they give stopped being in the race. People loudly said since the get-go our options are shit, nobody was really happy... except for that large group of Trump supporters that is. Many not Trump supporters though, many of them voted for Clinton and many voted against her like I said. Trump, though having the minority of voters, had a firm place of votes that didn't have the need to exploit the resentment among everyone else. Clinton made her voters all split from the lack of transparency and the lack of understanding with what the people needs or wants, or the least making it clear that's the case. The conspiracies and conspiracy theories circulating around her made things more difficult. \n\n\nDonald Trump, also oddly enough, actually campaigned. You know who didn't? Clinton. Trump stole so many areas from Clinton, many conspiracy theories exist as to why, some bound to be real. Clinton came off super ill, her double making a twitter post hinting she made an appearance where Hilary should be, Hilary not exactly putting any energy into her election, it is very possible she was ill. However, because it was kept a secret, we don't know why she decided to let Bernie Sanders and some others carry her weight, but she lost her elections because of it. It's possible she wasn't ill and is just a moron, who knows for sure. The fact Trump actually ran though, that gave him the opportunity to convince Americans that he was the answer to problems and Hilary didn't even so much as try to convince Americans herself otherwise. \n\n\nThis is also not resentment, this is just how things work in our politics. Trump shows up and preached to the choir, all choirs. America ISN'T great, but he claims he will make it great again. We have so many problems and we as Americans are so divided because of all of them. We have opportunities becoming more and more scarce, money isn't circulating, there is once again racial tensions, America ISN'T great and he claims will fix that. Hilary though? Not even once did she show up and even say \"yes, I agree.\" She literally allowed him to snag up just enough votes to not need the majority, he had enough. \n\n\nTrump said he wants America to have less involvement around the world, he wants to address the immigration problem, he wants to fix the economy and create jobs.

He's not a 'trial by fire' type, who can point to their suffering as the source of their strength.  He's not a 'hero of the struggle' who wins by working twice as hard as the competition.  He's certainly not a 'genius' whose prodigious talent is recognized by all in the end.  \n\nThe narrative is that of Randy Savage and many more since: [The Heel-Face turn](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn).\n\nThe Heel-Face turn is a fascinating explanation because of one main factor: The more of a douchebag the heel is, the more effective the story.  So a milquetoast douchebag-light well connected wanker like Jeb can't pull it off.  He's not a *Heel*!\n\nBut the more people criticized Trump, the more this narrative structure was enforced.  The more of a racist, homophobic, geriatric, born-wealthy, vain, tasteless, cowardly, slimy, stupid, cretinous, sexual assaulting, money-grubbing, Russian mafia supporting *Heel* he is the more he can be identified with that narrative arc.\n\nThat's why your point about policy is so correct and so incorrect at the same time.  People voted for the *narrative*, and the policy supported that narrative.\n\nNow I know I've almost changed your view with this so I'll post one last piece of evidence:\n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9nYjmuqfTAhUMTrwKHd8gDYIQjRwIBw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fextra-mustard%2F2015%2F03%2F24%2Frandy-macho-man-savage-wwe-hall-of-fame&amp;psig=AFQjCNGySVjqC4Va93Ox4BNmlKx8kgbejQ&amp;ust=1492379960046789\n\nAren't those muscles stronger than any namby pamby *feelings*?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take issue with &amp;#39;the strongest&amp;#39;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strongest explanation I&amp;#39;ve seen is pro-wrestling!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of narratives and meta-narratives, Trump doesn&amp;#39;t fit any of the real world archetypes that college educated liberal academia have much experience with. He&amp;#39;s not a &amp;#39;trial by fire&amp;#39; type, who can point to their suffering as the source of their strength.  He&amp;#39;s not a &amp;#39;hero of the struggle&amp;#39; who wins by working twice as hard as the competition.  He&amp;#39;s certainly not a &amp;#39;genius&amp;#39; whose prodigious talent is recognized by all in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The narrative is that of Randy Savage and many more since: &lt;a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn\"&gt;The Heel-Face turn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Heel-Face turn is a fascinating explanation because of one main factor: The more of a douchebag the heel is, the more effective the story.
