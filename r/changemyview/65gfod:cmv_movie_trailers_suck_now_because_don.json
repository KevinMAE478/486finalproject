Just imaging IT&amp;#39;s trailer having LaFontaine&amp;#39;s voice over makes me laugh. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7no56Zw1e20\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7no56Zw1e20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_LaFontaine\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_LaFontaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just look at the movies he narrated. Most of them are comedies and or children movies.\nScooby-Doo, Casper, The Simpsons Movie, Dumb and Dumber, The Emperor&amp;#39;s New Groove, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Digimon: The Movie, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, Stuart Little, Home Alone 1/2/3, Rush Hour 1/2/3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, Daddy Day Care, Space Jam, Spy Kids, Star Kid, Chicken Run etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Someone else said movie trailers today suck because they show too much lmao. This circlejerk needs to die, go watch movie trailers that were released 2 or 3 decade ago. They&amp;#39;re no different. Social media has evolved, and we see half a dozen TV spots, discuss trailers on platforms like forums or reddit, YT content creators making &amp;#39;trailers explained&amp;#39; which dissect every second of the trailer. Superman is going to come back in the Justice League movie? OMG SPOILERS they showed the entire movie in the trailer godamn, Superman died in BvS tho!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDEuS5wIk5Q\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDEuS5wIk5Q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgaj34u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492282002.0, "created_utc": 1492253202.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gfod", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gfod", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gfod", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gfod", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gfod", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgasezr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Trent_Boyett", "parent_id": "t1_dgar4v7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're exactly right, I was missing an 'a'.
