Unlike most who initially supported the war (ex: [Andrew Sullivan](https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/02/-a-false-premise/205994/)), neocons like Bill Kristol and Wolfowitz have still not retracted their support for the invasion of Iraq, and continue to push for further regime-toppling. \n\n&gt;This is somewhat akin to the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.

Israel's security goals have clearly played an outsized role in our foreign policy strategy. \n\n&gt; Also, since World War I, the US has been sympathetic to using military action for humanitarian purposes (AKA, \"to make the world free for democracy\"). There are horrific human rights abuses being committed by these regimes (Hussein, Assad, the Kim dynasty, etc.) and there is an argument to be made that the US has a moral imperative to end the abuse because it's the only power capable of it. You can argue that that's just a post hoc justification, but that doesn't mean it's not a serious consideration.\n\nWe are extremely selective in who we apply these rules to, and they always overlap with our interests. US bombs are currently blowing up Yemeni civilians and bringing them to the point of famine (we're helping Saudi Arabia fight ethnic/religious rivals).   The rationale for the Iraq War was a potential terrorist attack on the US, not humanitarian in nature (the rationale for Syria regime-toppling). It's extremely easy to create a humanitarian rationale for toppling most Middle East governments, because they are all so lacking in the humanitarian quality. \n\nI still agree with Andrew Sullivan, who initially was a huge war supporter, but came to the conclusion that: \"The closer you examine it, the clearer it is that neoconservatism, in large part, is simply about enabling the most irredentist elements in Israel and sustaining a permanent war against anyone or any country who disagrees with the Israeli right.

Syria's conflict and Iraq's conflict are rooted in completely different things.\n\nFirst of all, Syria is not Iraq. There was no civil war in Iraq when the United States got involved. There wasn't a substantial amount of Russian influence. There wasn't a refugee crisis. It was not done following a major uprising across the Arab world. They're not the same situation, and they're not being handled in the same way.\n\nThe primary goal of the United States in Syria is to reduce Russian influence, full stop. Syria is arguably the last relevant state which the Russian Federation maintains a heavy level of influence over. It's in a strategic location from both an economic and militaristic perspective, and without it Russia will largely lose the ability to project force outside of countries they immediately border. By limiting this influence(through civil war, regime change, whatever) the United States is weakening a geopolitical rival. \n\nWhile yes, there is some overlap and spillover(Americans advocating for Israel advocate for the removal of Assad, Israel benefits by having a hostile nation incapacitated), that doesn't mean that these are the primary causes of the conflict or the actions of the United States. Correlation does *not* guarantee causation. \n\nFurther, if we were to believe that US foreign policy in the Middle East is centered around Israel's well being, then why has Iran not been eliminated? Why hasn't there been a regime change in Iran? A crippled Iran would benefit Israel more than a crippled Iraq or Syria ever could. Iran directly and substantially funds terror groups such as Hezbollah in the region and has made it clear that their position is to destroy the nation of Israel. Why would the United States bother with a nation in chaos(with limited American influence) such as Syria when they could be focusing their efforts on a legitimate threat to Israel's security and prosperity- Iran.\n\n&gt;In my opinion, those sympathetic to this ideology have made a disproportionate percentage of the American foreign policy elite, which has lead the US to adopt a strategy of toppling Middle Eastern regimes at the expense of US and Western interests. \n\nHow does this explain the European led campaign in the Libyan civil war?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Arabs fight among each other in sectarian conflicts, Israel refuses to accept refugees in large numbers,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t exactly a fair argument. You can&amp;#39;t expect a nation to accept large numbers of refugees from a hostile nation- especially when you&amp;#39;re already at a greater risk of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;yet continue to press forward with the same regime-toppling ideology. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the &amp;quot;same&amp;quot; ideology, though.
