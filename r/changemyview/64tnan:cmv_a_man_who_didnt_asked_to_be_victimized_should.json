The article appears to be accurate, since it reported in a neutral tone specific details which would be a matter of public record.  If they were reporting inaccurately, they could be too easily called on it, damaging their reputation.  The events are clearly of interest to the public, since reddit is absolutely full of posts about this incident.  \n\n&gt; Why is this okay?\n\nThe news site and the events covered are both in the U.S., and in the U.S. Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Speech are among our highest values.  They are both part of the very first amendment to the Constitution, put there by the Founders because of their great importance.  \n\n&gt; This article should not be in the public's interest\n\nThe public is interested in making a value judgement about the situation.  This background information is quite relevant to this, as I don't believe there is video available of the earlier stages of the incident.  We have only hearsay about how the doctor reacted to earlier actions by airline employees, and information about how reasonable and trustworthy he is is relevant to what we think the earlier stages might have been like.  \n\nThe article says that:\n\n&gt; The Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure permitted Dao to continue practicing medicine in 2015 under certain conditions, after he completed his probation and underwent psychological evaluations, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.\n\nThat he needed psychological evaluations to keep his medical license after having committed multiple felonies over several years is relevant in judging whether he might have been acting reasonably or unreasonably in resisting being removed from the flight.  \n\n&gt; So, why should we allow these popular news networks to put information out there to further mess with this man?\n\nWhat makes you think they're putting this information out in order to mess with him?  \n\nWhose judgement would you trust to make the evaluation that a news site was \"trying to mess with someone\"?  If the government's, do you think it would be ok for Donald Trump to silence reporting on the crowd size during his inauguration on this basis, or for Hillary Clinton (had she won) to silence reporting on the details of her criminal actions related to her email server?
