Or reject evolution? To you, that may seem ignorant. But to someone who's entire life revolves around their church, to profess a believe in evolution, even if they believe it, would ostracize them from all of their friends and family. Or for a conservative who believes in free market, accepting climate change may be associated with a belief that they would then have to accept more government regulation. In fact, it's been shown that conservatives are more likely to believe in climate change when presented along with free market solutions rather than gov't based ones.\n\nSo what you are calling ignorant is really in many cases, people making a choice between two viewpoints, or between being accepted by their friends and family. \n\nAnd it isn't limited to Republicans. Democrats/liberals have their own anti-science folks in those who reject vaccinations, for example. They are \"ignorant\" in their belief about vaccinations. That doesn't mean you can or should label them ignorant overall. Same should apply to Republicans. Everyone has some level of ignorance around certain topics. Those can be topics you think people should know and care about, well, that is your opinion. Others may care more about other things, and there is nothing wrong with that. We would hope those making policy for our nation spend the time to understand these kinds of issues scientifically (fat chance of that right now :( ) but I really don't think it's fair of you to try to label entire groups as ignorant because of the things they choose to pay attention to.\n\nAs for selfishness, most individuals tend to take care of those around them before those in different communities. That is human nature.

But to someone who&amp;#39;s entire life revolves around their church, to profess a believe in evolution, even if they believe it, would ostracize them from all of their friends and family. Or for a conservative who believes in free market, accepting climate change may be associated with a belief that they would then have to accept more government regulation. In fact, it&amp;#39;s been shown that conservatives are more likely to believe in climate change when presented along with free market solutions rather than gov&amp;#39;t based ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what you are calling ignorant is really in many cases, people making a choice between two viewpoints, or between being accepted by their friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it isn&amp;#39;t limited to Republicans. Democrats/liberals have their own anti-science folks in those who reject vaccinations, for example. They are &amp;quot;ignorant&amp;quot; in their belief about vaccinations. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can or should label them ignorant overall. Same should apply to Republicans. Everyone has some level of ignorance around certain topics.

Your discussion here though is a cheap parlor trick in that you are asking us to \"prove the negative\". This would be possible if you gave solid targets to deal with. Instead, you couch your arguments with \"well not all\" and by redefining precise terms into more nebulous terms which make them almost impossible to attack. In doing this, you are basically doing what conservative talk show hosts do when they say that most, \"like 2/3 of\", immigrants are criminals. They couch their language strictly to prevent people with direct and diverse experiences from challenging them. It mentally allows them to discard someones perspective by saying \"well that's not the norm and doesn't represent the majority, it is a unicorn\". The only difference between these two arguments is the topic. \n\n1. You redefine selfishness as both selfishness and hedonism. I have a feeling that you also conflate looking after ones own self-interests with selfishness. In my viewpoint, there is nothing wrong with looking after ones own self interests. Many democrats do the same. You could make a solid argument that many of the poor who vote exclusively Democrat do so not out of some great interest in the broader good but for what it will get them. Caring about someone else is a luxury, it is really hard to do it when you are worried about how you will feed your own family. I knew many African-Americans in my old town that voted for Trump. Certainly far from a plurality but way more than I expected to find. The universal reason, he spoke to their self-interests about trying to bring middle class jobs back. There is a fine line between looking after ones own self-interests and the definition of selfishness and you have done nothing to show that you recognize or know the difference. \n\n1. Education and ignorance are not the same things. I know quite a few people who are highly worldly intelligent who never had a chance to get degrees. I also know quite a few people with PhD's in STEM fields, being a scientist myself, who couldn't think their way out of a paper bag. There is also a solid argument to be made that attending college tends to cause people to trend to the left due to how facts are presented and how anyone who does not identify as leftist is shut down. Full disclosure: I mostly disagree with this view point but it is STILL a valid viewpoint and one that does have its basis in fact and should NOT be discarded as spurious. \n\n2. You conflate what the party does with what its people believe; this is an issue on BOTH sides of the isle. For example, Hillary Clinton devoutly supported the TPP. Most Democrats and leftists (which are not the same) such as myself were completely opposed to it. Yet most Democrats still supported Hillary. You view all Republicans as behaving in lock-step, much as Republicans view all Democrats. It is a logical fallacy of sorts in that you believe that all the individuals of a group follow the beliefs of the whole. \n\n3. Let's get into science, a topic as a scientist I love dealing with. You say that 2/3 of Republicans don't believe in evolution. While it is true that a large number do not, this is due to the higher number of evangelicals who align with Republicans. Even within Democrats, those who tend to consider themselves evangelical or attend church regularly, are much less likely to support evolution than even non-evangelical Republicans. As such, it is clear that not believing in science is much more related to religious views than political views. Even in light of this, the number for republicans is 49%, which is right on the edge of being most and FAR from your 2/3's number that you quoted. Source: [Pew Research survey 2013](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/03/republican-views-on-evolution-tracking-how-its-changed/) Anti-global warming on the other hand is solidly and disturbingly Republican. That being said, it doesn't even begin to get into main-stream leftist anti-science views such as anti-vax and naturopathy. So to argue that Democrats are somehow superior in their pro-science is a huge stretch, the difference is where they tend to be anti-science. \n\nSo in conclusion, it is impossible to challenge your views because your views are too nebulous to challenge so I challenge what little concrete you have given. \n\nEDIT: Also, I should address your abysmal sources of evidence for your points.

He is a person who doesn't care with being factually correct as much as he care with hearing himself speak. \n\n\n* Your selection from Pro-Con shows some significant issues from a scientific rigor and methodology stand point. They start with a particular hypothesis \"Conservatism is low-effort thought\" and then seek to demonstrate said hypothesis with their tests. It is really easy to distort reality when doing this.
