People are flock animals and flock animals need leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, I would suggest that you have a very limited and skewed understanding of anarchism.  You have what I would call an outsider-influenced view of anarchism, meaning that you are using a definition of anarchism that is not used by anarchists themselves, but rather comes from opponents of anarchism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anarchism would not be &amp;quot;defeated&amp;quot; if people formed groups and those groups &lt;em&gt;chose&lt;/em&gt; leaders, because anarchism does not mean and never has meant &amp;quot;individuals acting individually and without leadership.&amp;quot;  Anarchism means &amp;quot;without &lt;em&gt;rulers&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; and a &lt;em&gt;ruler&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt; are not the same thing.

A group of individuals who decide to work together and to elect one of their own to lead, manage or oversee their collective enterprise is not betraying anarchism in any sense -- that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; anarchism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I would be wary of using arguments like &amp;quot;People are flock animals and flock animals need leaders.&amp;quot;  Are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a flock animal, who needs a leader?

El Alto sits on the Altiplano, the plateau overlooking La Paz, the capital. A few decades ago El Alto was just a small town, but as global economic changes caused the shutting down of mines and small farms, huge numbers of people came here. Unable to reside in La Paz, they built settlements up on the plateau, changing the town into a major urban area with 850,000 residents. Seventy percent of the people who have jobs here make their living through family businesses in an informal economy. Land use is unregulated, and the state provides little or no infrastructure: most neighborhoods do not have paved roads, garbage removal services, or indoor plumbing, 75% of the population lacks basic health care, and 40% are illiterate.[56] Faced with this situation, the residents of the informal city took their self-organization to the next step, by creating neighborhood councils, or juntas. The first juntas in El Alto go back to the \u201850s. In 1979 these juntas started to coordinate through a new organization, the Federation of Neighborhood Councils, FEJUVE. Now there are nearly 600 juntas in El Alto. The juntas allow neighbors to pool resources to create and maintain necessary infrastructure, like schools, parks, and basic utilities. They also mediate disputes and levy sanctions in cases of conflict and social harm. The federation, FEJUVE, pools the resources of the juntas to coordinate protests and blockades and constitute the slum dwellers as a social force.

El Alto sits on the Altiplano, the plateau overlooking La Paz, the capital. A few decades ago El Alto was just a small town, but as global economic changes caused the shutting down of mines and small farms, huge numbers of people came here. Unable to reside in La Paz, they built settlements up on the plateau, changing the town into a major urban area with 850,000 residents. Seventy percent of the people who have jobs here make their living through family businesses in an informal economy. Land use is unregulated, and the state provides little or no infrastructure: most neighborhoods do not have paved roads, garbage removal services, or indoor plumbing, 75% of the population lacks basic health care, and 40% are illiterate.[56] Faced with this situation, the residents of the informal city took their self-organization to the next step, by creating neighborhood councils, or juntas. The first juntas in El Alto go back to the \u201850s. In 1979 these juntas started to coordinate through a new organization, the Federation of Neighborhood Councils, FEJUVE. Now there are nearly 600 juntas in El Alto. The juntas allow neighbors to pool resources to create and maintain necessary infrastructure, like schools, parks, and basic utilities. They also mediate disputes and levy sanctions in cases of conflict and social harm. The federation, FEJUVE, pools the resources of the juntas to coordinate protests and blockades and constitute the slum dwellers as a social force. In just the first five years of the new millennium, FEJUVE took a lead role in establishing a public university in El Alto, blocking new municipal taxes, and deprivatizing the water services.
