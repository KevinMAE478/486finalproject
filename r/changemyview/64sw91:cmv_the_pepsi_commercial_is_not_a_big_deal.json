Hell, maybe good material on your resume too - &amp;quot;socially conscious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you are black / brown / lgbt etc. from a poverty and are in a REAL protest in Fergussion or Baltimore, then most likely, you will be beaten up by the police, sprayed with chemicals, or taken to jail and have criminal records lodged against you. Worst case, you might get molested or shot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ad basically shows a bunch of &amp;quot;diverse&amp;quot; people protesting, and then begging for a rich white model/star to join in. The rich white model joins in the protest, just walks over to the police casually, hands over a Pepsi and basically chills out to music, with a smug look of &amp;quot;solving the problem&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t blame Pepsi specifically (and I&amp;#39;m sure they had good intent), but it basically brought out an ugly truth - for a rich waspy kid, a &amp;quot;protest&amp;quot; is a glorified picnic, but for a poor minority person, a &amp;quot;protest&amp;quot; means putting your life and future on the line. (I&amp;#39;m assuming it might be even worse in a non-1st-world country with civil war or unstable government.) And this Pepsi Ad saw protests from a purely rich-kid college-campusey POV, which was cringey.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg5cucw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993831.0, "created_utc": 1491965031.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sw91", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wmxh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "1000ancestors", "parent_id": "t3_64sw91", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not a \"big deal\" but it is a disgusting piece of anti-protestor propaganda.
