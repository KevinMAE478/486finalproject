If there was an entity (politician, organization, celebrity, whatever) that could guide people from that activism toward a more tangibly constructive service, I think it would bear fruit.  I think most Americans would sacrifice both time and money to make the country a better place, the problem is that no one can agree on how best achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there was an option to pursue an Americorps type position where it was clear you&amp;#39;d be helping America and your countrymen for a 1 or 2-year stint, which also either improved or at least didn&amp;#39;t hamper your future plans after (so stuff like college deferment), that might go a long way toward people feeling more connected.  I don&amp;#39;t know what the economic ramifications of something like that would be, but I really haven&amp;#39;t heard any politician or public speaker advocate for communal sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably couldn&amp;#39;t be mandatory, but if it became &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; it would be even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dge9e1u", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492498155.0, "created_utc": 1492469355.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y0lb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8q27", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "parent_id": "t1_dge8ppt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/James_McNulty ([8\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/James_McNulty)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

It doesn&amp;#39;t matter to me if that difference is skin color or mindset. What matters to me is how much pain is caused in service of it. In our history, curiosity has served us better than race. But if my curiosity led me to dissect living people to see how they work, then that would be worse than a world where everyone happened to have the same skin color - say a distant future where skin tone has somehow averaged out until our modern concept of race is indistinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgee3j9", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492504230.0, "created_utc": 1492475430.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgebjw3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KingOoblar", "parent_id": "t1_dgeaibk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I said \"other people\" and meant white people as just one example.
