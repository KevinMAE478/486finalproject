And part of that is due to the fact that black people do in fact commit more crimes than white people.  However, it is generally thought that this is not &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are black, but rather due to a number of social and economic pressures that tend to drive black people towards commiting crimes (although it is also partially explained by harsher treatment from the justice system due to racial discrimination).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is my firm belief that men are incarcerated at higher rates not due to some violent nature inherent to men, but rather due to a combination of social and economic pressures that drive men towards committing crime.  These social and economic pressures are at the root of the problem, and more work should be done to correct them.  Criminals do not tend to commit crime for no reason whatsoever.  It is far more common that they commit crimes due to being forced into horrible situations through no fault of their own, and they see crime as a way out.

Inmates with higher testosterone concentrations had more often been convicted of violent crimes [...] 9 out of 11 inmates with the lowest testosterone concentrations had committed nonviolent crimes, and 10 out of 11 inmates with the highest testosterone concentrations had committed violent crimes.\n\nand Dabbs &amp; Morris, 1990: Testosterone, Social Class, and Antisocial Behavior in a Sample of 4,462 Men\n&gt; Analysis of archival data from 4,462 U.S. military veterans [...] Testosterone was correlated with a variety of antisocial behaviors among all individuals. However, socioeconomic status (SES) proved to be a moderating variable, with weaker testosterone-behavior relationships among high SES subjects.\n\nThese are just correlations, but there is some causal evidence from animal literature (where we can completely control for environmental factors): castrating mice after birth reduces adult agressive behaviour (Heino, Edwards &amp; Roffi, 1993: Intermale aggression in mice: does hour of castration after birth influence adult behavior)\n\nMore recently, the body of work of professor Jack van Honk addresses the direct (short-term) effects of administrating testosterone in people, showing that it increases risky behaviour (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2003.08.007), reduces unconscious fear responses (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.04.003) and empathy (http://doi: 10.1073/pnas.1011891108).\n\n\nThis is not to say that men are, because of testosterone, destined to be these dominant reckless creatures incapable of empathy - far from it. The effects are small and I think the gender roles imposed on men might have a larger role for the prison gap you're talking about.

Inmates with higher testosterone concentrations had more often been convicted of violent crimes [...] 9 out of 11 inmates with the lowest testosterone concentrations had committed nonviolent crimes, and 10 out of 11 inmates with the highest testosterone concentrations had committed violent crimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and Dabbs &amp;amp; Morris, 1990: Testosterone, Social Class, and Antisocial Behavior in a Sample of 4,462 Men&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Analysis of archival data from 4,462 U.S. military veterans [...] Testosterone was correlated with a variety of antisocial behaviors among all individuals. However, socioeconomic status (SES) proved to be a moderating variable, with weaker testosterone-behavior relationships among high SES subjects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just correlations, but there is some causal evidence from animal literature (where we can completely control for environmental factors): castrating mice after birth reduces adult agressive behaviour (Heino, Edwards &amp;amp; Roffi, 1993: Intermale aggression in mice: does hour of castration after birth influence adult behavior)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recently, the body of work of professor Jack van Honk addresses the direct (short-term) effects of administrating testosterone in people, showing that it increases risky behaviour (&lt;a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2003.08.007\"&gt;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2003.08.007&lt;/a&gt;), reduces unconscious fear responses (&lt;a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.04.003\"&gt;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.04.003&lt;/a&gt;) and empathy (http://doi: 10.1073/pnas.1011891108).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that men are, because of testosterone, destined to be these dominant reckless creatures incapable of empathy - far from it. The effects are small and I think the gender roles imposed on men might have a larger role for the prison gap you&amp;#39;re talking about. But to claim that testosterone plays no role at all is to disregard a lot of research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg9fstv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492219215.0, "created_utc": 1492190415.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8owm3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rockmar1", "parent_id": "t1_dg8oq0n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; More testosterone means that we tend to be more prone to violence, aggression and impulsive and risky activities.\n\nAnd again, I ask that you provide a source on this.

That's not really something that happens in real life. You don't typically have a homeless family stay together where the man is out hunting and gathering for the family. Instead, to survive, men and women seek different methods to make a quick buck because what each has to offer from their place in society differs by gender.\n\nSince we're taking pause for examples and anecdotes, I will chime in with what my experience has been in criminal defense work. Most crime is committed by a small proportion of individuals and the primary causes of the vast majority are poverty, drug addiction, and mental illness (or some combination of the three). Those things affect men and women equally. However, they do not respond to such environments in the same way because men and women are resourceful in different ways. \n\nFor example, a homeless woman suffering from mental illness or substance abuse might turn a trick or shoplift and sell her wares on the street to support her addiction. The types of crimes women tend to commit reflect the fact that they are physiologically less prone to violence and aggression than men. \n\nComparatively, a homeless male with a substance abuse disorder doesn't really have the same options as the female above. No one's paying for that dude's tricks. A lot of people are frightened by the presence of an obviously homeless man, and anyway, he's going to get booted from most stores before he can steal anything. So what are his next best options to support his habit? \n\nWell, he's either going to sell drugs, rob someone, or steal. Well, if he's selling drugs, that disparity you can blame on the war on drugs. The reason more men sell drugs than women is because women aren't great candidates for this position. Generally speaking, female drug dealers are substantially more likely to get jumped and robbed because it's an easy crime of opportunity for her drug using customers. \n\nIf he's robbing another person to support himself, now you have a violent crime and a victim so he's much more likely to face incarceration in his disposition. Alternatively, if he gets caught stealing, he's more likely to face an aggressive confrontation upon arrest which of course yield additional charges for him. Now you have multiple charges instead of the sole shoplifting charge. Whereas if a woman gets caught stealing, she's probably not going to have 10 officers kneeing her in the back where she feels like she needs to defend herself. A single shoplifting charge will yield a slap on the wrist; no harm, no foul. \n\nSo, while I'd agree with you on the general point that overincarceration is the real crime here, it's not because men are out trying to do noble things for women and children as society mandates. It's because they have no way to make a living outside of crime and their underlying issues hinder their ability to get to a place where they can support themselves -- whether that be because he lacked any kind of familial structure of support growing up or now, lack of education, substance abuse, untreated mental illness, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, etc. If you grew up in foster care or got into Juvie, you don't get the opportunity to learn healthy emotional coping skills and how to operate in a functioning society because you're always lacking some basic human need. (Obviously this applies equally to women). As an individual stuck in the cycle of poverty, you don't get an opportunity to develop patience or gratitude and without basic coping or life skills, your testosterone manifests as outward aggression because you have no healthy alternative outlet -- especially for young adult men. So now you have adult men in the cycle of incarceration, part of the cycle of poverty, which leads to more desperation, likely depression or some other mood disorder development, and more crime. Repeat. \n\nThe disparity is not because of society's gendered expectations so much so that men and women are just different, with different tendencies, and that once you get into this cycle it becomes increasingly difficult to manage a way out. With each crime, you face more time than the last one, and life becomes a treadmill of anger, fighting, pain, and emptiness. It's easier for men to get swept up in this system, and earlier, which isn't necessarily their fault, but nor is it an issue of any kind of societal expectations -- generally people who are in a place of desperation don't place such a high value on providing for others. Our problem with overincarceration stems from poverty and men who are victims of poverty are the ones who wind up incarcerated. \n\n \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I am saying that this is a horrible injustice because, for example, if someone needs to rob a bank to feed their family there should be no reason that it&amp;#39;s just expected of the man to be the one to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean to sound condescending, but this is quite a charmed view of crime. That&amp;#39;s not really something that happens in real life. You don&amp;#39;t typically have a homeless family stay together where the man is out hunting and gathering for the family. Instead, to survive, men and women seek different methods to make a quick buck because what each has to offer from their place in society differs by gender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;#39;re taking pause for examples and anecdotes, I will chime in with what my experience has been in criminal defense work. Most crime is committed by a small proportion of individuals and the primary causes of the vast majority are poverty, drug addiction, and mental illness (or some combination of the three). Those things affect men and women equally. However, they do not respond to such environments in the same way because men and women are resourceful in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a homeless woman suffering from mental illness or substance abuse might turn a trick or shoplift and sell her wares on the street to support her addiction. The types of crimes women tend to commit reflect the fact that they are physiologically less prone to violence and aggression than men. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, a homeless male with a substance abuse disorder doesn&amp;#39;t really have the same options as the female above. No one&amp;#39;s paying for that dude&amp;#39;s tricks. A lot of people are frightened by the presence of an obviously homeless man, and anyway, he&amp;#39;s going to get booted from most stores before he can steal anything. So what are his next best options to support his habit? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, he&amp;#39;s either going to sell drugs, rob someone, or steal. Well, if he&amp;#39;s selling drugs, that disparity you can blame on the war on drugs. The reason more men sell drugs than women is because women aren&amp;#39;t great candidates for this position. Generally speaking, female drug dealers are substantially more likely to get jumped and robbed because it&amp;#39;s an easy crime of opportunity for her drug using customers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;s robbing another person to support himself, now you have a violent crime and a victim so he&amp;#39;s much more likely to face incarceration in his disposition. Alternatively, if he gets caught stealing, he&amp;#39;s more likely to face an aggressive confrontation upon arrest which of course yield additional charges for him. Now you have multiple charges instead of the sole shoplifting charge. Whereas if a woman gets caught stealing, she&amp;#39;s probably not going to have 10 officers kneeing her in the back where she feels like she needs to defend herself. A single shoplifting charge will yield a slap on the wrist; no harm, no foul. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while I&amp;#39;d agree with you on the general point that overincarceration is the real crime here, it&amp;#39;s not because men are out trying to do noble things for women and children as society mandates.

The relevant section:\n\n&gt;Research has shown that testosterone has particular effects within the brain where it can alter the reactivity of areas of the brain that use the neurotransmitter dopamine for neuronal communication. What does this mean? Neurons (a type of brain cell) use chemical substances called \u2018neurotransmitters\u2019 to communicate with one another across the gaps that exist between them. The release of neurotransmitter by a neuron is therefore a form of neuron to neuron signalling.  Dopamine is an important brain substance for behavior.  For example, it has been described as \u2018the pleasure chemical\u2019 because dopamine release by neurons in a part of the brain called the ventral tegmental area has been shown to underlie all forms of pleasure motivated behavior.  That is; things like sex, eating (chocolate for example), drinking (alcohol for example) but also other addictive behaviors such as smoking and even financial addictions like gambling. In essence when a person is driven to engage in all of these behaviors there will be dopamine signalling by neurons that form the part of the brain known as the ventral tegmental area.\n\n&gt;Testosterone is therefore likely to achieve its effects on risk taking behavior because it affects the level of dopamine activity arising from neurons in the ventral tegmental area. For example, larger amounts of testosterone are associated with having more dopamine neurons, and more dopamine neurons could mean more dopamine will be released by ventral tegmental area neurons.  It has, for example, also been shown that individuals who seem to display a greater level of risk taking behaviour have less of a certain type of dopamine receptor.\n\nI can cite many more studies that show links between testosterone and risk-taking if you need them.\n\n&gt; I believe that they are more prone to risk taking because society forces them to. So in your example, if there is a man, his wife, and they have two kids, and they are a poor family, the man is more expected to take risks to try and get them out of poverty than the rest of them. He would be taking those risks not due to testosterone in his veins, but rather due to his wife and children depending on him.

I'm going to address this specifically, because there are a number of good general critiques of your argument by other commenters.\n\n* We can identify the \"legitimate\" cause of imprisonment: men are more likely to commit violent crime - and we can identify the \"ilegitimate\" cause: bias in the judicial system against men.\n* Similarly, we can identify the \"legitimate\" cause of male dominance in STEM: men are supposedly better at it, and the \"ilegitimate\" cause: societal factors discourage women from entering STEM.\n\nNow, as others have said, the statistical evidence is there: 80% violent crimes are done by men. Whether or not you can argue for bias against men (this would be tricky, but I could see a few arguments for it that I could believe), the fact of the matter is that the crime *is there*. The sentencing is legitimate- unless women are murdering lots of people we don't hear about, the sentencing matches the criminality of men. Women just don't do as many violent crimes.\n\nLet's compare this first to the \"STEM gap\" and then to racial profiling in sentencing.\n\n* When women get into STEM, there is no evidence they are inferior at it.\n* On the other hand, there is strong societal evidence - toy marketing is probably the most obvious - that women are far less encouraged to engage in analytical thinking than men at a young age.\n\nThe difference should be clear: the \"legitimate\" cause of the gap is dubious, and the \"ilegitimate\" cause is prominent- the opposite of the case for biased male incarceration.\n\nNow let's look at bias against black people in sentencing, which is itself a large reason why male incarceration is so common: the criminal justice system is, fairly objectively, biased against black men (and black women, but black men most prominently).\n\nThe big one here is drug offenses. Black offenders are something like 5x more likely to be incarcerated for drug possession than white offenders committing the *exact* same offense.\n\nThat discrepancy doesn't exist for men as a whole, though: a man and a woman committing similar crimes will - I believe - receive roughly equal sentences most of the time.\n\ntl;dr- everything suggests that, unlike the situations you have cited as similar, male incarceration is due to male criminality, not bias against men. There is no conceptual argument I see for that bias' existence, and there is immense statistical evidence that men perform most violent crimes. Furthermore, your argument largely ignores the other demographic issues in favor of pushing a male victimization narrative.\n\nIn fact, I'd like to address that, because I firmly believe that men, as a monolithic demographic, are probably the least-victimized group in all of society, with the possible exception of heterosexual white christian men in western countries.\n\n&gt;  It is far more common that they commit crimes due to being forced into horrible situations through no fault of their own, and they see crime as a way out. Drug dealing, gang activity, robbery, etc. are all examples of crimes that are typically associated with desparation rather than deep psychological issues.\n\nI am sorry to be blunt, but this is completely beside the point. Doing a bad thing because bad things happened to you and made you a bad person is not being a victim- under this definition, there is no such thing as criminality.\n\n\"Victimhood\", to the extent that it is a legitimate category and not a rhetorical tool, means something bad happened to you, and by extension your demographic, that you had NO responsibility for. Criminality due to nebulous psychological problems is not that, at all.\n\nFor example: starving because you can't get a job makes you a victim.

The focus isn't always on the gender gap, but the impact of this is commonly discussed. \n\nAnd the way the conversation is framed is necessarily going to be different than say, something like the STEM gap, due to the nature of prison versus STEM jobs. STEM jobs are something desirable, prison obviously isn't. So for STEM jobs, the focus of the discussion is around the minority who we want to get more of something, while for prison populations, the discussion is around the majority who we want to have less of something (given that we already have such a disproportionate prison population, presumably the solution in general here is to incarcerate fewer men, not more women). But given that the majority population is the one impacted, its feels unnecessary to explicitly frame it that way. When men are 92% of the prison population, the phrases \"we have an incarceration problem\" and \"we have a male incarceration problem\" are basically redundant. In most contexts, they're saying the exact same thing, and is widely acknowledged as a problem.\n\nBut getting a bit broader, as I don't think you're just talking about actual incarceration rates. In terms of men's apparent proclivity towards crime and violence, this is also a widely discussed issue. A google search of \"are men more violent than women\" will yield a ton of articles and studies examining the causes of this. I don't know if its in the scope of this CMV to debate any particular theory, but they range from biological / evolutionary causes to social discussions of gender roles and power dynamics.\n\nTo summarize, people have extensively discussed why in practice men seem prone to violence and crime (both from a biological and a social standpoint), and the end result of this (high incarceration rates), is widely considered a national embarrassment. So when you say this is \"overlooked\", what do you mean by that? You say at the end of your post:\n\n&gt;  it absolutely disgusts me that there appear to be no movements aimed at correcting this discrepancy\n\nCould you describe in more detail what specific type of \"movements\" you want to see, if not protest against our prison system in general or movements about deconstructing gender roles (often aligned with feminism)?
