I think s/he did a poor job framing the argument (sorry!), so I want to add my two cents.  \n\nFirst off, for those giving the argument \"the man had his choice -- he could've not had sex or made sure his partner was on birth control!\" For starters, reverse the genders and tell me if you think that that is a legitimate argument *against abortion,* because this is essentially the same thing. Sure, the man won't birth the child, but you're still taking away his ability to choose what's best for his life. \n\nThe same people espousing this argument would be appalled if someone used it on a woman, so why don't they feel the same way when it's reversed? \n\nSecondly, let's look at what happens when a woman and a man find out their pregnant. A woman has the following options: \n\n1. Keep the Child\n\n2. Abort the Child\n\n3. Carry the Child and put it up for abortion\n\nNONE of those options require the \"permission\" of the man. The woman has *complete* control over her decision and her body, and the man is forced to go along with whatever the woman decides. If the woman wants to keep the child? Man on the hook for child support. Man wants to keep the child and woman wants to get rid of it? Tough luck for the man, it's the woman's body (which is fine, nobody is arguing this as it is the way it should be). Woman wants to put the child up for adoption? That's her choice as well.\n\nSo now we look at the man's options:\n\n1. Become financially responsible for the child\n\n2. Hope the woman has an abortion\n\nThe man has absolutely no choice. If the woman wants to keep the child, he's either going to act like the father (yay!) or be forced to pay child support -- even if he's in a point of his life where he can't afford it (and for those of you saying \"tough luck, shouldn't have had sex!\" I'd love to hear you saying that to a pregnant 16 year old girl). He's completely hostage to the mother's decision.\n\nNow, let's give the man a *choice.* Let's give him the simple ability to \"opt out\" of obligated child support if he signs a document a certain time period after discovering the woman is pregnant.\n\nThe man's choices now look like this:\n\n1. Become financially responsible for the child\n\n2. Hope the woman has an abortion\n\n3. Sign a \"paper abortion\" and forfeit all your rights and responsibilities for the child\n\n\"But!\" some of you will say \"this now forces the woman to do something she doesn't want!\" **That's not true at all, this is not a zero-sum game.** Let's look at the woman's options now:\n\n1. Keep the Child\n\n2. Abort the Child\n\n3. Put the Child up for adoption\n\nABSOLUTELY NONE OF HER OPTIONS HAVE CHANGED! She still has ALL THE FREEDOM she had before. Does she want to keep the child? She can! Does she want to abort the child? She can! Does she want to put the child up for adoption? She can!\n\nThis did not hurt the woman at all, and gave the man something he didn't have before (and that women have had for a while now) -- reproductive choice. Sure, the decision might be a bit harder now for the woman, but that's what happens when you make everyone *equal* and give *everybody options.* The woman still has all her rights and privileges, and now the man has some rights as well.\n\nThe only decent argument I have heard against this is that this hurts the child. But this is disingenuous. If a woman can have an abortion because the \"fetus does not have full human rights,\" then this isn't hurting a child, it's hurting a *fetus* -- something that does not have full human rights yet. The other argument is that this puts unnecessary strain on society due to tax dollars having to go towards child support, and that is a much more logical argument to which I answer -- at what cost? Are you really okay with denying someone their reproductive rights because it's \"cheaper\"?\n\nI'd love to hear y'all's perspective. This is a much more nuanced issue than people think, and it's interesting to see everyone's thoughts. Like I mentioned earlier, the only argument that I *HATE* and think is extremely sexist/short-sighted/stupid is the \"THE MAN HAD HIS CHOICE, HE COULD'VE NOT HAD SEX/USED BIRTH CONTROL!!\" If you think telling a woman that is wrong, it's sexist for you to think it's okay to tell that to a man.

Any parent to a child that has been born has responsibilities towards it, and the only way to give up those responsibilities towards it are to have an adoption. You do not have a responsibility (in the eyes of the law) to give up your body for your kid. Abortion removes the fetus from using your body to sustain itself, a right it does not have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right to give up your kid is valued less than the kids right to have support, and the right to not have something live off of your body is valued highest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgb9ikk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492323595.0, "created_utc": 1492294795.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65krso", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0oku", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "parent_id": "t3_65krso", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Note:** Your thread has **not** been removed.\nYour post's topic seems to be fairly common on this subreddit.
