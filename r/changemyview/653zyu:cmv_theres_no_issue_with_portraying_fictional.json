If his lineage was suddenly black, that would make the racism we see in midworld through out the series make no sense.

Roland pretty much rises above all of that, however.  Sure, his outlook and personality is definitively white, and he is no modern racial equality activist, but he is colorblind in one of the most honest and positive ways possible.   Either you are of use to him to save the multiverse, or you are not.  If you are white and get in his way, he will shoot you dead.  If you are black and get in his way, he will also shoot you dead.

There are no fabulously rich 50s black people who mingle with all the white people in huge ballrooms etc. It's as if you suggested he were an Eskimo. Sure, there's nothing wrong with it as a principle, but it doesn't make much sense (and yes, I am exaggerating).\n\nThirdly, as we seem to somewhat agree, I'd like to once again refer to the character of James Bond. He's posh and aristocratic and elitist, and there really hasn't been a history of that in the UK so far. Look at the MPs, they are still significantly white, and their behaviour is defined by decades of white supremacy, if I can call it that. It's hard to believe a black Bond would realistically have the background necessary to be as suave and aristocratic as the ones before him. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to imagine that, though, as it would be a good role model for kids of any race, but I am significantly concerned of having the character written for the actor rather the other way around.\n\nFinally, and as a completion of my argument above, can you think of a black actor that would actually fit the role perfectly?

People get attached to them, and have their own image about them, and it really delegitimizes a lot about their backstory if they suddenly change race, or gender, or any other established traits. I think as a rule, characters should only change parts of them that are unknown, or constantly keep the audience guessing by constantly throwing out bogus backstory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the above isn&amp;#39;t really the case here, because James Bond isn&amp;#39;t one person, but many, so why not have a black Bond? Hell, I prefer anyone over Daniel Craig.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, your example of Batman being black wouldn&amp;#39;t really work because his story is based on a lot of cliches that don&amp;#39;t really apply to black people, at least historically. There are no fabulously rich 50s black people who mingle with all the white people in huge ballrooms etc. It&amp;#39;s as if you suggested he were an Eskimo. Sure, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with it as a principle, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense (and yes, I am exaggerating).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, as we seem to somewhat agree, I&amp;#39;d like to once again refer to the character of James Bond. He&amp;#39;s posh and aristocratic and elitist, and there really hasn&amp;#39;t been a history of that in the UK so far. Look at the MPs, they are still significantly white, and their behaviour is defined by decades of white supremacy, if I can call it that. It&amp;#39;s hard to believe a black Bond would realistically have the background necessary to be as suave and aristocratic as the ones before him. I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s a bad thing to imagine that, though, as it would be a good role model for kids of any race, but I am significantly concerned of having the character written for the actor rather the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, and as a completion of my argument above, can you think of a black actor that would actually fit the role perfectly? Someone with the charm of Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery, and without the street fighter nature of Daniel Craig? I am actually having a hard time finding someone...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg7b9sn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492100488.0, "created_utc": 1492071688.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653zyu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rz0v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "exotics", "parent_id": "t3_653zyu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In some instances it clearly wouldn't matter, however in others it does.\n\nThe fact that people want to make a character a different race sometimes says \"Hey, I want to push my race agenda\" rather than just saying \"This dude is the perfect actor for the role.\".
