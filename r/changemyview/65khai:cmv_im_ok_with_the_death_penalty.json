But the high current cost is due in large part to the safeguards in place (automatic appeals, length of the process, etc...) to prevent innocent people from being killed. But innocent people have been executed under the current system. So either it costs even more to further reduce the number of people wrongly executed, or you cut costs which is very likely to result in even more innocent people killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 1.6% of death row inmates since 1973 have been exonerated, however, research suggests the rate of innocence is likely over 4% (&lt;a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/one-25-executed-us-innocent-study-claims-248889\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). That&amp;#39;s one in 25, and with 2900 or so inmates currently on death row, that means 116 are likely to be innocent. Are you ok with killing that many innocent people? Or even half that many? And spending more money to do it than just keeping them in prison would for life would cost?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless and until the justice system can be made mistake-free, at least with respect to capital punishment, the only reasonably ethical/moral solution would seem to me to be to stop killing innocent people right along with the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgdu39b", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480327.0, "created_utc": 1492451527.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65khai", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgchxdv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Huntingmoa", "parent_id": "t1_dgcho9x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "then how is no death penalty not the way to achieve this?
