That's why patients receive thorough amounts of information on the risks and effects of treatment, as well as possible alternatives.\n\n&gt;Both ftm and mtf hormones lead to an increased risk in heart problems and other possible side effects.\n\nThe risks of these versus the negative effects of untreated dysphoria is a consideration to be made between a patient and their doctor. We get blood tests to make sure things are going reasonably safely. There are plenty of life-saving drugs with side-effects of similar intensity (not very).\n\n&gt;When I was 14, I thought as soon as I was 18 I was going to go to a doctor and start the process\n\nhahaha. no fam. You don't just walk into the doctor's and start HRT. I went through 14 months of consultation before receiving anything. And this is after I've become a legal adult.

The studies I've seen indicate around 1-2% regret rates which is a far cry from as high as 20%. Those same studies also carefully clarify that one of the strongest factors in regret was the loss of personal relationships due to negative reactions to the transition, so saying that someone \"regrets their transition\" is often overly broad. Do they regret the physical changes? Is it the loss of certain privileges they regret? Is it their treatment at the hands of society they regret? Are their regrets based in religious guilt? Are their regrets due to loss of close family or friend relationships? Are their regrets due to poor surgical outcomes/complications? There is a lot to isolate before you can really understand \"transition regret\" fully.\n\n&gt;and the short amount of time it's been studied, it is hard to know how accurate this is.\n\nI wouldn't say that roughly 5 decades of formal research on the topic is a \"short amount of time\". I will certainly concede that a lot of the most important research has hit the floor in the last two decades, but we actually have been studying this issue for a long time.\n\n&gt;Gender disphoria is the hate and discomfort that a transgender person feels about their body. In most cases, it is treated by transitioning. Interesting though is that some cases go away with age around or before age 30. This seems to be pretty uncommon, but I believe it is worth mentioning. \n\nI don't know how accurately we can say that something like gender dysphoria has \"gone away\". There were times in my life that it \"went away\" but that was solely a short-sighted perspective on my part. The reality was that I had just convinced myself to ignore it and then began developing coping mechanisms around the practice of ignoring it. This lead to dysfunctions in other aspects of my life which did not seem to be related to gender dysphoria. It was only retrospectively that I recognized that repression is less of a surgical knife cut on the parts of your psyche that you don't like and more like using a shotgun to kill a spider in your home. There's a lot of collateral damage and it effects you in a lot of ways that don't seem entirely obvious at first.\n\nWhen people tell me their trans feelings \"went away\" I'm inclined to take it with a grain of salt simply by virtue of my own (limited) experience. At 11 my trans feelings hit me with full force. I hated the effects of male puberty. I wanted to crawl out of my own skin. I decided that I had to learn to live with my body (because I did not know transition was an option) and I built coping mechanisms around dissociating from my body. I became a very dysfunctional being for this period of time but one could easily say that my trans feelings had \"gone away\".\n\nAt 23-24 I started to struggle with my gender dysphoria again but this time very openly. I was much more aware of trans issues and the option of transition so for the first time I was struggling not just with feelings and internal pain I didn't understand but with an issue I could put a name on. Around the late part of my 24th year of life I officially diagnosed myself as \"not trans\" on the tail end of a particular mushroom trip and my feelings seemingly \"went away\". By 26 I was such a miserable wreck of a person that I was seriously considering putting a bullet in my own head. By that summer I decided to transition and all the struggle and the dysfunction seemingly disappeared over night. But if you'd asked me at 14 or 17 or 25 if my trans feelings had gone away I would have said yes. Yet here I am.\n\nI've seen this particular narrative reflected by a lot of older transitioners who started in their late thirties or even as late as their 50s. They all will readily tell you that there were points in their life that the feelings \"went away\" but be quick to amend that really the feelings hadn't gone away, they had just mustered enough psychic strength to repress the feelings for a time.\n\n&gt;I don't understand the point of transitioning if you don't have gender disphoria. It isn't medically necessary and it is more likely for you to regret your transition if you don't have it. Many people who appear to be going along with the \"trend\" of transgenderism say they don't have to have gender disphoria to transition. It's concerns me that they say this because I don't want people who are going to be unhappy transitioning to transition. It could possibly make it harder for transgender people to transition in the future if a large number of people choose to detransition or commit suicide. \n\nI would probably entirely agree with this point honestly. I hate the \"you don't have to have gender dysphoria to be trans\" bullshit. That's an argument for another day but I think it's as absurd as saying \"you don't have to sexually prefer men to be a gay man\". You are arguing for a total lack of borders around any label in order to be as inclusive as possible, even when it robs your labels of any potency of meaning whatsoever. It's dialectal nihilism.\n\nSo I'm not arguing against your total view here actually as much as trying to weaken some of your black and white certainty in it. While I'm personally a little uncomfortable with actually allowing anyone younger than 16 to transition, I prefer to remain mostly agnostic on that issue since by and large it's not up to me to dictate the terms of a treatment that should be between a patient and a qualified medical professional. I also understand that if I'd known at 13 what I do now, I would have signed up for at minimum puberty blockers right away, so that stays my judgement a little bit as well.\n\nI would also like to talk about you a little bit. It seems like one of your main contentions is that people absent gender dysphoria should transition, and you describe how destransition regrets contribute to your own reluctance to transition, but do you not have gender dysphoria yourself? It seems that if you have gender dysphoria, then you're not actually included in your own arguments and thus what should be a consideration for people without gender dysphoria shouldn't be a consideration for yourself. If you want to transition and you have gender dysphoria, I cannot promise you that it won't be a deep internal struggle for years to come. I cannot promise you that transitioning will entirely put to bed your struggle with your gender identity or your body. I can promise you that for those of us who are gender dysphoric it makes our lives a great deal easier than they were.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some studies have been done that say up to 1/5 of transgender people regret their transition&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please link these studies. The studies I&amp;#39;ve seen indicate around 1-2% regret rates which is a far cry from as high as 20%. Those same studies also carefully clarify that one of the strongest factors in regret was the loss of personal relationships due to negative reactions to the transition, so saying that someone &amp;quot;regrets their transition&amp;quot; is often overly broad. Do they regret the physical changes? Is it the loss of certain privileges they regret? Is it their treatment at the hands of society they regret? Are their regrets based in religious guilt? Are their regrets due to loss of close family or friend relationships? Are their regrets due to poor surgical outcomes/complications? There is a lot to isolate before you can really understand &amp;quot;transition regret&amp;quot; fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and the short amount of time it&amp;#39;s been studied, it is hard to know how accurate this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that roughly 5 decades of formal research on the topic is a &amp;quot;short amount of time&amp;quot;. I will certainly concede that a lot of the most important research has hit the floor in the last two decades, but we actually have been studying this issue for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gender disphoria is the hate and discomfort that a transgender person feels about their body. In most cases, it is treated by transitioning. Interesting though is that some cases go away with age around or before age 30. This seems to be pretty uncommon, but I believe it is worth mentioning. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how accurately we can say that something like gender dysphoria has &amp;quot;gone away&amp;quot;. There were times in my life that it &amp;quot;went away&amp;quot; but that was solely a short-sighted perspective on my part. The reality was that I had just convinced myself to ignore it and then began developing coping mechanisms around the practice of ignoring it. This lead to dysfunctions in other aspects of my life which did not seem to be related to gender dysphoria. It was only retrospectively that I recognized that repression is less of a surgical knife cut on the parts of your psyche that you don&amp;#39;t like and more like using a shotgun to kill a spider in your home. There&amp;#39;s a lot of collateral damage and it effects you in a lot of ways that don&amp;#39;t seem entirely obvious at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people tell me their trans feelings &amp;quot;went away&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m inclined to take it with a grain of salt simply by virtue of my own (limited) experience. At 11 my trans feelings hit me with full force. I hated the effects of male puberty. I wanted to crawl out of my own skin. I decided that I had to learn to live with my body (because I did not know transition was an option) and I built coping mechanisms around dissociating from my body. I became a very dysfunctional being for this period of time but one could easily say that my trans feelings had &amp;quot;gone away&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 23-24 I started to struggle with my gender dysphoria again but this time very openly. I was much more aware of trans issues and the option of transition so for the first time I was struggling not just with feelings and internal pain I didn&amp;#39;t understand but with an issue I could put a name on. Around the late part of my 24th year of life I officially diagnosed myself as &amp;quot;not trans&amp;quot; on the tail end of a particular mushroom trip and my feelings seemingly &amp;quot;went away&amp;quot;. By 26 I was such a miserable wreck of a person that I was seriously considering putting a bullet in my own head. By that summer I decided to transition and all the struggle and the dysfunction seemingly disappeared over night. But if you&amp;#39;d asked me at 14 or 17 or 25 if my trans feelings had gone away I would have said yes. Yet here I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen this particular narrative reflected by a lot of older transitioners who started in their late thirties or even as late as their 50s. They all will readily tell you that there were points in their life that the feelings &amp;quot;went away&amp;quot; but be quick to amend that really the feelings hadn&amp;#39;t gone away, they had just mustered enough psychic strength to repress the feelings for a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand the point of transitioning if you don&amp;#39;t have gender disphoria. It isn&amp;#39;t medically necessary and it is more likely for you to regret your transition if you don&amp;#39;t have it. Many people who appear to be going along with the &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot; of transgenderism say they don&amp;#39;t have to have gender disphoria to transition. It&amp;#39;s concerns me that they say this because I don&amp;#39;t want people who are going to be unhappy transitioning to transition. It could possibly make it harder for transgender people to transition in the future if a large number of people choose to detransition or commit suicide. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would probably entirely agree with this point honestly. I hate the &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t have to have gender dysphoria to be trans&amp;quot; bullshit. That&amp;#39;s an argument for another day but I think it&amp;#39;s as absurd as saying &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t have to sexually prefer men to be a gay man&amp;quot;. You are arguing for a total lack of borders around any label in order to be as inclusive as possible, even when it robs your labels of any potency of meaning whatsoever.
