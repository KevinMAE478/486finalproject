If their fatness affects you, then your drinking affects them.  So does your smoking.  So does your speeding, turning without indicating, eating meat, eating nuts, eating dairy, eating gluten...\n\nTrickle down effect.  I'll go through it all:\n\n1-Drinking, your consumption of alcohol increases your odds of getting into an accident, fighting, we all know what it does.  So like their fatness (if preventable)-you shouldn't do this.  No drinking.\n\n2-Smoking, second hand smoke kills.  Even if it didn't, it stinks.  It stains stuff.  This is a habit of choice that affects others, so, like your fat people (if preventable), you can't smoke.\n\n2-Speeding and turning without indicating, like alcohol, increases your chances of getting into an accident.  So like their fatness (if preventable)-you shouldn't do this.  Obey the rules of the road.\n\n3-Eating meat, you could be a vegan.  If you you were, you would reduce greenhouse gasses because a lifetime of veganism(or even just vegetarianism) can reduce gasses significantly.  Despite what Trump says, SCIENCE KNOWS that a change in global climate affects us all.  So no meat for you.  I guess, since vegan is better, no dairy, no eggs either.  Oh, and make sure you choose your clothes and house wisely, cause most glues use animal products... (this will drive up your cost of living a lot, btw).\n\n4-Nuts and gluten, these are just examples.  You really shouldn't be eating anything that could produce an allergic response in others, because you don't NEED to, and it can affect their health.  Teachers can't even bring nut products to school for lunch in a sealed container in the staff room.\n\nAll of these are choices people are entitled to make.  Not all of them are good for them, and some people don't acknowledge that they are bad.  I've witnessed smokers dying of cancer going outside for a cig.\n\nThe fat peoples weight isn't your problem any more than your drinking, smoking, driving and dietary choices are OUR problem.\n\nThat is to say, they ARE, but we have freedom of choice.

If their fatness affects you, then your drinking affects them.  So does your smoking.  So does your speeding, turning without indicating, eating meat, eating nuts, eating dairy, eating gluten...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trickle down effect.  I&amp;#39;ll go through it all:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-Drinking, your consumption of alcohol increases your odds of getting into an accident, fighting, we all know what it does.  So like their fatness (if preventable)-you shouldn&amp;#39;t do this.  No drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2-Smoking, second hand smoke kills.  Even if it didn&amp;#39;t, it stinks.  It stains stuff.  This is a habit of choice that affects others, so, like your fat people (if preventable), you can&amp;#39;t smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2-Speeding and turning without indicating, like alcohol, increases your chances of getting into an accident.  So like their fatness (if preventable)-you shouldn&amp;#39;t do this.  Obey the rules of the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3-Eating meat, you could be a vegan.  If you you were, you would reduce greenhouse gasses because a lifetime of veganism(or even just vegetarianism) can reduce gasses significantly.  Despite what Trump says, SCIENCE KNOWS that a change in global climate affects us all.  So no meat for you.  I guess, since vegan is better, no dairy, no eggs either.  Oh, and make sure you choose your clothes and house wisely, cause most glues use animal products... (this will drive up your cost of living a lot, btw).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4-Nuts and gluten, these are just examples.  You really shouldn&amp;#39;t be eating anything that could produce an allergic response in others, because you don&amp;#39;t NEED to, and it can affect their health.  Teachers can&amp;#39;t even bring nut products to school for lunch in a sealed container in the staff room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these are choices people are entitled to make.  Not all of them are good for them, and some people don&amp;#39;t acknowledge that they are bad.  I&amp;#39;ve witnessed smokers dying of cancer going outside for a cig.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fat peoples weight isn&amp;#39;t your problem any more than your drinking, smoking, driving and dietary choices are OUR problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is to say, they ARE, but we have freedom of choice.  So unless YOU are willing to remove ALL things from your life that impact other people (some of which are detailed above, but there are many more), then, like you, they have a right to choose their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg5kg9l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492007325.0, "created_utc": 1491978525.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64onjl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64onjl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64onjl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5mb7g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IrishFlukey", "parent_id": "t1_dg4nx85", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, but you can make the exact same argument against a wide range of illnesses and other health conditions, far too many to list.
