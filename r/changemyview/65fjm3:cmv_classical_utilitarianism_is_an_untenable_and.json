I used to be sympathetic to it, but after understanding the objections in this post, I gave it up. They all &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum\"&gt;reduce it to absurdity&lt;/a&gt; like this: &amp;quot;In some situation, utilitarianism would justify doing action X, but we feel that action X is unethical; therefore utilitarianism is an untenable ethical system.&amp;quot; A utilitarian can simply ignore this kind of argument and &amp;quot;bite the bullet&amp;quot; by accepting its conclusion, but they would have to accept some very uncomfortable ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this post I ignore objections to utilitarianism which call it &lt;em&gt;unrealistic,&lt;/em&gt; including the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_hedonism\"&gt;paradox of hedonism&lt;/a&gt;, the difficulty of defining/measuring &amp;quot;happiness,&amp;quot; and the difficulty of predicting what will maximize happiness. I also ignore objections which call it &lt;em&gt;unjustified&lt;/em&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-question_argument\"&gt;open-question argument&lt;/a&gt;, and objections based on religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Classical utilitarianism seems quite popular here on CMV, which I noticed in a recent CMV &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/63l2vd/cmv_letting_a_fetus_with_an_incurable_disease\"&gt;post about a fetus with an incurable disease&lt;/a&gt;. The OP, and most of the commenters, all seemed to assume that classical utilitarianism is true. A search for &amp;quot;utilitarianism&amp;quot; on &lt;a href=\"/r/changemyview\"&gt;/r/changemyview&lt;/a&gt; turned up plenty of other posts supporting it. Users have called classical utilitarianism &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hm7uw/i_believe_utilitarianism_is_the_only_valid_system\"&gt;&amp;quot;the only valid system of morals&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eltro/i_believe_that_utilitarianism_should_be_the_only\"&gt;&amp;quot;the only moral law&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2yta8c/cmv_utilitarianism_is_the_best_source_for_morality\"&gt;&amp;quot;the best source for morality&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5hzak4/cmv_the_only_valid_moral_philosophy_is_one_that\"&gt;&amp;quot;the only valid moral philosophy&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1th1id/utilitarianism_is_the_most_effective_method_of\"&gt;&amp;quot;the most effective way of achieving political and social change&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ddpxl/i_believe_that_a_utilitarian_society_is_the_only\"&gt;&amp;quot;the only morally just [foundation for] society&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jzvzb/i_believe_that_human_life_must_have_finite_value\"&gt;et cetera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1yimak/i_dont_think_any_conventional_morals_make_sense\"&gt;et cetera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only three posts from that search focused on opposing utilitarianism. Two &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/25vvbd/cmv_i_think_that_kantian_ethics_is_the_best\"&gt;criticized it&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hn2b9/because_i_learned_a_lot_of_cool_stuff_in_the\"&gt;Kantian perspective&lt;/a&gt;, and the latter was inspired by a post supporting utilitarianism because the poster &amp;quot;thought it would be interesting to come at it from a different angle.&amp;quot; I found &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb0qz/cmv_utilitarianism_is_too_demanding_and_too\"&gt;exactly one post&lt;/a&gt; focused purely on criticizing utilitarianism...and it was one sentence long with one reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, no one else appears to have made a post about this. I sincerely reject utilitarianism because of the objections below. While they are framed as opposing &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; utilitarianism, objections (1) to (3) notably apply to any form of utilitarianism if &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot; is replaced with &amp;quot;utility.&amp;quot; I kind of &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; someone to change my view here, since I have no moral framework without utilitarianism (although using informed consent as a deontological principle sounds nice). &lt;strong&gt;Change my view!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The objections:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A helpful thought experiment for each of these objections is the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Utilitarian AI Overlord.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Each objection can be seen as a nasty consequence of giving a superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI) complete control over human governments and telling it to &amp;quot;maximize happiness.&amp;quot; If this would cause the AI to act in a manner we consider unethical, then classical utilitarianism cannot be a valid ethical principle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster\"&gt;The utility monster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;utility monster&amp;quot; is a being which can transform resources into units of happiness much more efficiently than others, and therefore deserves more resources. If a utility monster has a higher happiness efficiency than a group of people, no matter how large, a classical utilitarian is morally obligated to give all resources to the utility monster. See &lt;a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2569\"&gt;this SMBC comic&lt;/a&gt; for a vivid demonstration of why the utility monster would be horrifying (it also demonstrates the &amp;quot;Utilitarian AI Overlord&amp;quot; idea).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The more like a utility monster that an entity is, the more problematic it is, but also the less realistic it is and therefore the less of a problem it is. The logical extreme of a utility monster would have an infinite happiness efficiency, which is logically incoherent.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Money makes people decreasingly happier as that person makes more money: &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/subjective-well%E2%80%90being-and-income-is-there-any-evidence-of-satiation\"&gt;increasing income yields diminishing marginal gains in subjective well-being \u2026 while each additional dollar of income yields a greater increment to measured happiness for the poor than for the rich, there is no satiation point\u201d&lt;/a&gt;. In this real-life context, giving additional resources to one person has diminishing returns. This has two significant implications (responses 3 and 4):&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We cannot assume that individuals have fixed efficiency values of turning resources into happiness which are unaffected by their happiness levels, a foundational assumption of the \u201cutility monster\u201d argument.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A resource-rich person is less efficient than a resource-poor person. The more that the utility monster is &amp;quot;fed,&amp;quot; the less &amp;quot;hungry&amp;quot; it will be, and the less of an obligation there will be to provide it with resources. At the monster&amp;#39;s satiation point of maximum possible happiness, there will be no obligation to provide it with any more resources, which can then be distributed to everyone else. As &lt;a href=\"/u/LappenX\"&gt;/u/LappenX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:\n&amp;quot;The most plausible conclusion would be to assume that the &lt;em&gt;inverse relation between received utility and utility efficiency&lt;/em&gt; is a necessary property of moral objects. Therefore, a utility monster&amp;#39;s utility efficiency would rapidly decrease as it is given resources to the point where its utility efficiency reaches a level that is similar to those of other beings that may receive resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster\"&gt;We are already utility monsters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A starving child in Africa for example would gain vastly more utility by a transaction of $100 than almost all people in first world countries would; and lots of people in first world countries give money to charitable causes knowing that that will do way more good than what they could do with the money ... We have way greater utility efficiencies than animals, such that they&amp;#39;d have to be suffering quite a lot (i.e. high utility efficiency) to be on par with humans; the same way humans would have to suffer quite a lot to be on par with the utility monster in terms of utility efficiency. Suggesting that utility monsters (if they can even exist) should have the same rights and get the same treatment as normal humans (i.e. not the utilitarian position) would then imply that humans should have the same rights and get the same treatment as animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuttals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Against response (1): Realistic and problematic examples of a utility monster are easily conceivable. A sadistic psychopath who &amp;quot;steals happiness&amp;quot; by getting more happiness from victimizing people than the victim(s) lose is &lt;em&gt;benevolent&lt;/em&gt; given utilitarianism. Or consider an abusive relationship between an abuser with Bipolar Disorder and a victim with &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia\"&gt;dysthymia&lt;/a&gt; (persistent mild depression causing a limited mood range). The victim is morally obligated to stay with their abuser because every unit of time that the victim spends with their abuser will make their abuser happier than it could possibly make them unhappy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All of these responses &lt;em&gt;completely ignore the possibility&lt;/em&gt; of a utility monster with a fixed happiness efficiency.  Even ignoring whether it is realistic, imagining one is enough to demonstrate the point. If we can imagine a situation where maximizing happiness is not good, then we cannot define good as maximizing happiness. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster/dczw6uv\"&gt;Some have argued&lt;/a&gt; that an individual with a changing happiness efficiency &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster/dczxsf4\"&gt;does not even count as a utility monster&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;A utility monster would be someone who, even after you gave him half your money to make him as rich as you, still demands more. He benefits from additional dollars so much more than you that it makes sense to keep giving him dollars until you have nearly nothing, because each time he gets a dollar he benefits more than you hurt. This does not exist for starving people in Africa; presumably, if you gave them half your money, comfort, and security, they would be as happy--perhaps happier!--than you.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Against responses (2) to (4): Even if we consider individuals with changing happiness efficiency values to be utility monsters, changing happiness efficiency backfires: just because happiness efficiency can diminish after resource consumption does not mean it will &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; diminished. For living creatures, happiness efficiency is likely to increase for every unit of time that they are not consuming resources. If a utility monster is &amp;quot;fed,&amp;quot; then it is unlikely to stay &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; for long, and as soon as it becomes &amp;quot;hungry&amp;quot; again then it is a problem once again. Consider the examples from rebuttal (1): A sadistic psychopath will probably not be satisfied victimizing one person but will want to victimize multiple people, and in the abusive relationship, the bipolar abuser&amp;#39;s moods are unlikely to last long, so the victim will constantly feel obligated to alleviate the &amp;quot;downswings&amp;quot; in the abuser&amp;#39;s mood cycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism\"&gt;Average and total utilitarianism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox\"&gt;the mere addition paradox, and the repugnant conclusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it is good to increase the average happiness of a population, then it is good to kill off anyone whose happiness is lower than average. Eventually, there will only be one person in the population who has maximum happiness. If it is good to increase the total happiness of a population, then it is good to increase the number of people infinitely, since each new person has some nonzero amount of happiness. The former entails genocide and the latter entails widespread suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When someone dies, it decreases the happiness of anyone who cares about that person. If a person\u2019s death reduces the utility of multiple others and lowers the average happiness more than their death raises it, killing that person cannot be justified because it will decrease the population\u2019s average happiness. Likewise, if it is plausible to increase the utility of a given person without killing them, that would be less costly than killing them because it would be less likely to decrease others\u2019 happiness as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each person&amp;#39;s happiness/suffering score (HSS) could be scored on a scale from -X to X where X is some arbitrary positive number on a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale\"&gt;Likert-type scale&lt;/a&gt;. A population would be &amp;quot;too large&amp;quot; when adding one person to the population causes the HSS of some people to drop below zero and decrease the aggregate HSS.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuttals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Response (1) is historically contingent: it may be the case now, but we can easily imagine a situation where it is not the case. For example, to avoid making others unhappy when killing someone, we can imagine an AI Overlord changing the others&amp;#39; memories or simply hooking everyone up to &lt;a href=\"http://wireheading.com\"&gt;pleasure-stimulation devices&lt;/a&gt; so that their happiness does not depend on relationships with other people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Response (2) changes the definition of classical utilitarianism, which here is a fallacy of &lt;a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts\"&gt;&amp;quot;moving the goalposts&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Technically, accepting it concedes the point by admitting that the &amp;quot;maximum happiness&amp;quot; principle on its own is unethical.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority\"&gt;The tyranny of the majority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a group of people get more happiness from victimizing a smaller group than that smaller group loses from being victimized, then the larger group is justified. Without some concept of inalienable human rights, any cruel acts against a minority group are justifiable if they please the majority. Minority groups are always wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ddpxl/i_believe_that_a_utilitarian_society_is_the_only/c9pbiz2\"&gt;&amp;quot;organ transplant scenario&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; is one example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[Consider] a patient going into a doctor&amp;#39;s office for a minor infection [who] needs some blood work done. By chance, this patient happens to be a compatible organ donor for five other patients in the ICU right now. Should this doctor kill the patient suffering from a minor infection, harvest their organs, and save the lives of five other people?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the &amp;quot;organ transplant&amp;quot; procedure was commonplace, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ovlew/cmv_the_organ_transplant_scenario_is_a_bad\"&gt;it would decrease happiness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear that people would avoid hospitals if this were to happen in the real world, resulting in more suffering over time.&lt;/strong&gt; Wait, though! &lt;strong&gt;Some people try to add another stipulation: it&amp;#39;s 100% guaranteed that nobody will ever find out about this. The stranger has no relatives, etc.&lt;/strong&gt; Without even addressing the issue of whether this would be, in fact, morally acceptable in the utilitarian sense, it&amp;#39;s unrealistic to the point of absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuttals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Again, even if a situation is unrealistic, it is still a valid argument if we can imagine it. See rebuttal (2) to the utility monster responses.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This argument is historically contingent, because it &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ovlew/cmv_the_organ_transplant_scenario_is_a_bad/cw0u222/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=changemyview\"&gt;assumes that people will stay as they are&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a utilitarian, it would be moral to implement this on the national scale. Therefore, it stops being unrealistic. Remember, it&amp;#39;s only an unrealistic scenario because we&amp;#39;re not purist utilitarians. However, if you&amp;#39;re an advocate of utilitarianism, you hope that one day most or all of us will be purist utilitarians.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;4. The superfluity of people.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is less efficient to create happiness in naturally produced humans than in some kind of mass-produced non-person entities. Resources should not be given to people because human reproduction is an inefficient method of creating happiness; instead, resources should be given to factories which will mass-produce &amp;quot;happy neuroblobs&amp;quot;: brain pleasure centers attached to stimulation devices. No happy neuroblob will be a person, but who cares if happiness is maximized?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can specify that the utilitarian principle is &amp;quot;maximize the happiness &lt;em&gt;of people.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuttals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Even under that definition, it is still good for an AI Overlord to mass-produce people without characteristics that we would probably prefer future humans to keep: intelligence, senses, creativity, bodies, et cetera.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The main point is that utilitarianism has an underwhelming, if not repugnant, endgoal: a bunch of people hooked up to happiness-inducing devices, because any resource which is not spent increasing happiness is wasted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for making this post so long.

The utility monster: If some being can turn resources into happiness more efficiently than a person or group of people, then we should give all resources to that being and none to the person or group.\n2. The mere addition paradox and the \"repugnant conclusion\": If maximizing total happiness is good, then we should increase the population infinitely, but if maximizing average happiness is good, we should kill everyone with less-than-average happiness until only the happiest person is left. Both are bad.\n3. The tyranny of the majority: A majority group is justified in doing any awful thing that they want to a minority group. The \"organ transplant scenario\" is one example.\n4. The superfluity of people: Letting people live and reproduce naturally is inefficient for maximizing happiness. Instead, beings should be mass-produced which experience happiness but lack any non-happiness-related traits like intelligence, senses, creativity, bodies, etc.\n\n- Responses to these objections are described and rebutted.\n- Change my view: These objections discredit classical utilitarianism.\n\n###Introduction\n\nClassical utilitarianism is the belief that [\"an action is right insofar as it promotes happiness, and that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should be the guiding principle of conduct\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2yta8c/cmv_utilitarianism_is_the_best_source_for_morality). I used to be sympathetic to it, but after understanding the objections in this post, I gave it up. They all [reduce it to absurdity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) like this: \"In some situation, utilitarianism would justify doing action X, but we feel that action X is unethical; therefore utilitarianism is an untenable ethical system.\" A utilitarian can simply ignore this kind of argument and \"bite the bullet\" by accepting its conclusion, but they would have to accept some very uncomfortable ideas.\n\nIn this post I ignore objections to utilitarianism which call it *unrealistic,* including the [paradox of hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_hedonism), the difficulty of defining/measuring \"happiness,\" and the difficulty of predicting what will maximize happiness. I also ignore objections which call it *unjustified*, like the [open-question argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-question_argument), and objections based on religious belief.\n\nClassical utilitarianism seems quite popular here on CMV, which I noticed in a recent CMV [post about a fetus with an incurable disease](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/63l2vd/cmv_letting_a_fetus_with_an_incurable_disease). The OP, and most of the commenters, all seemed to assume that classical utilitarianism is true. A search for \"utilitarianism\" on /r/changemyview turned up plenty of other posts supporting it. Users have called classical utilitarianism [\"the only valid system of morals\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hm7uw/i_believe_utilitarianism_is_the_only_valid_system), [\"the only moral law\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eltro/i_believe_that_utilitarianism_should_be_the_only), [\"the best source for morality\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2yta8c/cmv_utilitarianism_is_the_best_source_for_morality), [\"the only valid moral philosophy\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5hzak4/cmv_the_only_valid_moral_philosophy_is_one_that), [\"the most effective way of achieving political and social change\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1th1id/utilitarianism_is_the_most_effective_method_of), [\"the only morally just [foundation for] society\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ddpxl/i_believe_that_a_utilitarian_society_is_the_only), [et cetera](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jzvzb/i_believe_that_human_life_must_have_finite_value), [et cetera](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1yimak/i_dont_think_any_conventional_morals_make_sense).\n\nOnly three posts from that search focused on opposing utilitarianism. Two [criticized it](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/25vvbd/cmv_i_think_that_kantian_ethics_is_the_best) from a [Kantian perspective](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hn2b9/because_i_learned_a_lot_of_cool_stuff_in_the), and the latter was inspired by a post supporting utilitarianism because the poster \"thought it would be interesting to come at it from a different angle.\" I found [exactly one post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb0qz/cmv_utilitarianism_is_too_demanding_and_too) focused purely on criticizing utilitarianism...and it was one sentence long with one reply.\n\nBasically, no one else appears to have made a post about this. I sincerely reject utilitarianism because of the objections below. While they are framed as opposing *classical* utilitarianism, objections (1) to (3) notably apply to any form of utilitarianism if \"happiness\" is replaced with \"utility.\" I kind of *want* someone to change my view here, since I have no moral framework without utilitarianism (although using informed consent as a deontological principle sounds nice). **Change my view!**\n\n###The objections:\n\nA helpful thought experiment for each of these objections is the **\"Utilitarian AI Overlord.\"** Each objection can be seen as a nasty consequence of giving a superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI) complete control over human governments and telling it to \"maximize happiness.\" If this would cause the AI to act in a manner we consider unethical, then classical utilitarianism cannot be a valid ethical principle.\n\n##1. [The utility monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster).\nA \"utility monster\" is a being which can transform resources into units of happiness much more efficiently than others, and therefore deserves more resources. If a utility monster has a higher happiness efficiency than a group of people, no matter how large, a classical utilitarian is morally obligated to give all resources to the utility monster. See [this SMBC comic](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2569) for a vivid demonstration of why the utility monster would be horrifying (it also demonstrates the \"Utilitarian AI Overlord\" idea).\n\n**Responses:**\n\n1. The more like a utility monster that an entity is, the more problematic it is, but also the less realistic it is and therefore the less of a problem it is. The logical extreme of a utility monster would have an infinite happiness efficiency, which is logically incoherent.\n2.  Money makes people decreasingly happier as that person makes more money: \"[increasing income yields diminishing marginal gains in subjective well-being \u2026 while each additional dollar of income yields a greater increment to measured happiness for the poor than for the rich, there is no satiation point\u201d](https://www.brookings.edu/research/subjective-well%E2%80%90being-and-income-is-there-any-evidence-of-satiation). In this real-life context, giving additional resources to one person has diminishing returns. This has two significant implications (responses 3 and 4):\n3. We cannot assume that individuals have fixed efficiency values of turning resources into happiness which are unaffected by their happiness levels, a foundational assumption of the \u201cutility monster\u201d argument.\n4. A resource-rich person is less efficient than a resource-poor person. The more that the utility monster is \"fed,\" the less \"hungry\" it will be, and the less of an obligation there will be to provide it with resources. At the monster's satiation point of maximum possible happiness, there will be no obligation to provide it with any more resources, which can then be distributed to everyone else. As /u/LappenX [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster):\n\"The most plausible conclusion would be to assume that the *inverse relation between received utility and utility efficiency* is a necessary property of moral objects. Therefore, a utility monster's utility efficiency would rapidly decrease as it is given resources to the point where its utility efficiency reaches a level that is similar to those of other beings that may receive resources.\"\n5. [We are already utility monsters](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster):\n\n&gt;A starving child in Africa for example would gain vastly more utility by a transaction of $100 than almost all people in first world countries would; and lots of people in first world countries give money to charitable causes knowing that that will do way more good than what they could do with the money ... We have way greater utility efficiencies than animals, such that they'd have to be suffering quite a lot (i.e. high utility efficiency) to be on par with humans; the same way humans would have to suffer quite a lot to be on par with the utility monster in terms of utility efficiency. Suggesting that utility monsters (if they can even exist) should have the same rights and get the same treatment as normal humans (i.e. not the utilitarian position) would then imply that humans should have the same rights and get the same treatment as animals.\n\n**Rebuttals:**\n\n1. Against response (1): Realistic and problematic examples of a utility monster are easily conceivable. A sadistic psychopath who \"steals happiness\" by getting more happiness from victimizing people than the victim(s) lose is *benevolent* given utilitarianism. Or consider an abusive relationship between an abuser with Bipolar Disorder and a victim with [dysthymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia) (persistent mild depression causing a limited mood range). The victim is morally obligated to stay with their abuser because every unit of time that the victim spends with their abuser will make their abuser happier than it could possibly make them unhappy.\n2. All of these responses *completely ignore the possibility* of a utility monster with a fixed happiness efficiency.  Even ignoring whether it is realistic, imagining one is enough to demonstrate the point. If we can imagine a situation where maximizing happiness is not good, then we cannot define good as maximizing happiness. [Some have argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster/dczw6uv) that an individual with a changing happiness efficiency [does not even count as a utility monster](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5qjljk/cmv_nozicks_conclusion_from_the_utility_monster/dczxsf4): \"A utility monster would be someone who, even after you gave him half your money to make him as rich as you, still demands more. He benefits from additional dollars so much more than you that it makes sense to keep giving him dollars until you have nearly nothing, because each time he gets a dollar he benefits more than you hurt. This does not exist for starving people in Africa; presumably, if you gave them half your money, comfort, and security, they would be as happy--perhaps happier!--than you.\"\n3. Against responses (2) to (4): Even if we consider individuals with changing happiness efficiency values to be utility monsters, changing happiness efficiency backfires: just because happiness efficiency can diminish after resource consumption does not mean it will *stay* diminished. For living creatures, happiness efficiency is likely to increase for every unit of time that they are not consuming resources. If a utility monster is \"fed,\" then it is unlikely to stay \"full\" for long, and as soon as it becomes \"hungry\" again then it is a problem once again. Consider the examples from rebuttal (1): A sadistic psychopath will probably not be satisfied victimizing one person but will want to victimize multiple people, and in the abusive relationship, the bipolar abuser's moods are unlikely to last long, so the victim will constantly feel obligated to alleviate the \"downswings\" in the abuser's mood cycle.\n\n##2. [Average and total utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism), [the mere addition paradox, and the repugnant conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox).\nIf it is good to increase the average happiness of a population, then it is good to kill off anyone whose happiness is lower than average. Eventually, there will only be one person in the population who has maximum happiness. If it is good to increase the total happiness of a population, then it is good to increase the number of people infinitely, since each new person has some nonzero amount of happiness. The former entails genocide and the latter entails widespread suffering.\n\n**Responses:**\n\n1. When someone dies, it decreases the happiness of anyone who cares about that person. If a person\u2019s death reduces the utility of multiple others and lowers the average happiness more than their death raises it, killing that person cannot be justified because it will decrease the population\u2019s average happiness. Likewise, if it is plausible to increase the utility of a given person without killing them, that would be less costly than killing them because it would be less likely to decrease others\u2019 happiness as well.\n2. Each person's happiness/suffering score (HSS) could be scored on a scale from -X to X where X is some arbitrary positive number on a [Likert-type scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale). A population would be \"too large\" when adding one person to the population causes the HSS of some people to drop below zero and decrease the aggregate HSS.\n\n**Rebuttals:**\n\n1. Response (1) is historically contingent: it may be the case now, but we can easily imagine a situation where it is not the case. For example, to avoid making others unhappy when killing someone, we can imagine an AI Overlord changing the others' memories or simply hooking everyone up to [pleasure-stimulation devices](http://wireheading.com) so that their happiness does not depend on relationships with other people.\n2. Response (2) changes the definition of classical utilitarianism, which here is a fallacy of [\"moving the goalposts\"](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts). Technically, accepting it concedes the point by admitting that the \"maximum happiness\" principle on its own is unethical.\n\n##3. [The tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).\nIf a group of people get more happiness from victimizing a smaller group than that smaller group loses from being victimized, then the larger group is justified. Without some concept of inalienable human rights, any cruel acts against a minority group are justifiable if they please the majority. Minority groups are always wrong.\n\nThe [\"organ transplant scenario\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ddpxl/i_believe_that_a_utilitarian_society_is_the_only/c9pbiz2) is one example:\n\n&gt;[Consider] a patient going into a doctor's office for a minor infection [who] needs some blood work done. By chance, this patient happens to be a compatible organ donor for five other patients in the ICU right now. Should this doctor kill the patient suffering from a minor infection, harvest their organs, and save the lives of five other people?\n\n**Response:**\n\nIf the \"organ transplant\" procedure was commonplace, [it would decrease happiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ovlew/cmv_the_organ_transplant_scenario_is_a_bad):\n\n&gt;**It's clear that people would avoid hospitals if this were to happen in the real world, resulting in more suffering over time.** Wait, though! **Some people try to add another stipulation: it's 100% guaranteed that nobody will ever find out about this. The stranger has no relatives, etc.** Without even addressing the issue of whether this would be, in fact, morally acceptable in the utilitarian sense, it's unrealistic to the point of absurdity.\n\n**Rebuttals:**\n\n1. Again, even if a situation is unrealistic, it is still a valid argument if we can imagine it. See rebuttal (2) to the utility monster responses.\n2. This argument is historically contingent, because it [assumes that people will stay as they are](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ovlew/cmv_the_organ_transplant_scenario_is_a_bad/cw0u222/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=changemyview):\n\n&gt;If you're a utilitarian, it would be moral to implement this on the national scale. Therefore, it stops being unrealistic. Remember, it's only an unrealistic scenario because we're not purist utilitarians. However, if you're an advocate of utilitarianism, you hope that one day most or all of us will be purist utilitarians.\n\n\n##4. The superfluity of people.\nIt is less efficient to create happiness in naturally produced humans than in some kind of mass-produced non-person entities. Resources should not be given to people because human reproduction is an inefficient method of creating happiness; instead, resources should be given to factories which will mass-produce \"happy neuroblobs\": brain pleasure centers attached to stimulation devices. No happy neuroblob will be a person, but who cares if happiness is maximized?\n\n**Response:**\n\nWe can specify that the utilitarian principle is \"maximize the happiness *of people.*\"\n\n**Rebuttals:**\n\n1. Even under that definition, it is still good for an AI Overlord to mass-produce people without characteristics that we would probably prefer future humans to keep: intelligence, senses, creativity, bodies, et cetera.\n2. The main point is that utilitarianism has an underwhelming, if not repugnant, endgoal: a bunch of people hooked up to happiness-inducing devices, because any resource which is not spent increasing happiness is wasted.\n\nSorry for making this post so long. I wanted to provide a comprehensive overview of the objections that changed my view in the first place, and respond to previous CMV posts supporting utilitarianism.

I kind of realized that when I could not come up with a better rebuttal to response (2) under the total/average objection. The utilitarian principle would probably have to be modified to accomodate negative utility.

Thanks for posting such a long and thoughtful prompt. I have been thinking/worrying about consequentialism lately, and you have given me the opportunity hone my thoughts. Also: never before have I been forced to transfer a Reddit post to my kindle so I could get through it! \n\nI've noticed that, so far, I have agreed with you over every commenter trying to cyv. I'll venture to say that they have learned much more from you than you from them. That doesn't say much for my chances, but let's throw my hat in the ring and see what happens. \n\n###Practical considerations and organ transplants \n\nAs far as I understand your final rebuttal in the organ transplant example, you are saying that utilitarians ought to have  the desire to shape society according to utilitarian principles. Thus, even if the example is unrealistic, utilitarians ought to want it to be more realistic. A quick reply here is that our current world features a perfectly realistic analog to this practice: military conscription. When drafted, a soldier is forced to take on a chance of dying for the greater good of his countrymen, much like the patient of the utilitarian doctor. This comparison also hints that, if the utilitarians really contrived to make forced organ transplants a reality, the end result would look more like honorable sacrifice than like psycho-killer victimization. \n\nBut maybe you think that conscription is wrong; or maybe you want to say that I am unfairly changing the example, that a utilitarian should be able to argue for forced organ transplants *as you have described them*. In your description you have stated that we must not fixate on practical considerations. Here, I think, we run into trouble; I want to make the case that practical considerations are not as separable from moral problems as we thought-experimentalists might hope.\n\nIn this connection, I want to mention Dennett's \"Philosophers' Syndrome\": mistaking a **failure of the imagination** for an **insight into necessity** (though, reflecting my own uncertainty, I would want to use a word far less loaded than \"failure\"). As I understand your argument, it does not matter that no real doctor would be able to sneak---completely undetected--- a patients' organs into the bodies of several others. This is because a utilitarian ought to approve of this outcome in principle, and encourage it to occur to the extent that it is feasible. The resulting conclusion, that utilitarianism supports horrible outcomes, is the mistaken insight into necessity. \n\nWhy mistaken? I think the mistake comes from asserting that the doctor has infallible superhuman abilities, but without really considering what the situation would look like if this were the case. This part is the failure of imagination. Let me expand a bit on the distinction between our super-doctor S and an ordinary doctor O:\n\n* S has the powers (perhaps from advanced technology) to spirit away bodies, to disappear paperwork, and to either blank the minds of his assistants or to perform surgery *without* assistants. O does not.\n* O, like the rest of us, can only be trusted so far. He can be swayed by greed, and he can fall prey to a narcissistic power-trip. We see that good utilitarian reasoning suggests that O, knowing his own fallibility, must never trust himself to make life-or-death gambles like in our example. Perhaps we would want him to gamble with, say, the fate of the world in the balance, but that is not the case here. But S does not need to gamble, because S cannot be wrong.\n\nIn short, S looks less like a human doctor and more like the medical workings of a benevolent superintelligence.  To me, the failure of imagination is thus \"fixed\": my intuitive revulsion at S's machinations has dissolved. It seems that S really knows what he's doing, and I would be a fool to  stand in his way (however impotently that might be). Do your intuitions change similarly? Maybe it doesn't matter! Perhaps the point is now moot: S would surely have better ways of helping people than unexpectedly chopping them up!

I think I have more to say, but I'm not sure if you're planning on engaging much longer with this cmv. It's best to leave it here for now, but please let me know what your level of involvement will be. I have recently come into my own doubts about consequentialism (different from what you have listed), but I'm having a hard time letting it go. Your post has encouraged me to keep trying to defend the moral system---thanks for that!\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skippable niceties&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, wow! Thanks for posting such a long and thoughtful prompt. I have been thinking/worrying about consequentialism lately, and you have given me the opportunity hone my thoughts. Also: never before have I been forced to transfer a Reddit post to my kindle so I could get through it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that, so far, I have agreed with you over every commenter trying to cyv. I&amp;#39;ll venture to say that they have learned much more from you than you from them. That doesn&amp;#39;t say much for my chances, but let&amp;#39;s throw my hat in the ring and see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Practical considerations and organ transplants&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand your final rebuttal in the organ transplant example, you are saying that utilitarians ought to have  the desire to shape society according to utilitarian principles. Thus, even if the example is unrealistic, utilitarians ought to want it to be more realistic. A quick reply here is that our current world features a perfectly realistic analog to this practice: military conscription. When drafted, a soldier is forced to take on a chance of dying for the greater good of his countrymen, much like the patient of the utilitarian doctor. This comparison also hints that, if the utilitarians really contrived to make forced organ transplants a reality, the end result would look more like honorable sacrifice than like psycho-killer victimization. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe you think that conscription is wrong; or maybe you want to say that I am unfairly changing the example, that a utilitarian should be able to argue for forced organ transplants &lt;em&gt;as you have described them&lt;/em&gt;. In your description you have stated that we must not fixate on practical considerations. Here, I think, we run into trouble; I want to make the case that practical considerations are not as separable from moral problems as we thought-experimentalists might hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this connection, I want to mention Dennett&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Philosophers&amp;#39; Syndrome&amp;quot;: mistaking a &lt;strong&gt;failure of the imagination&lt;/strong&gt; for an &lt;strong&gt;insight into necessity&lt;/strong&gt; (though, reflecting my own uncertainty, I would want to use a word far less loaded than &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;). As I understand your argument, it does not matter that no real doctor would be able to sneak---completely undetected--- a patients&amp;#39; organs into the bodies of several others. This is because a utilitarian ought to approve of this outcome in principle, and encourage it to occur to the extent that it is feasible. The resulting conclusion, that utilitarianism supports horrible outcomes, is the mistaken insight into necessity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why mistaken? I think the mistake comes from asserting that the doctor has infallible superhuman abilities, but without really considering what the situation would look like if this were the case. This part is the failure of imagination. Let me expand a bit on the distinction between our super-doctor S and an ordinary doctor O:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;S has the powers (perhaps from advanced technology) to spirit away bodies, to disappear paperwork, and to either blank the minds of his assistants or to perform surgery &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; assistants. O does not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;O, like the rest of us, can only be trusted so far. He can be swayed by greed, and he can fall prey to a narcissistic power-trip. We see that good utilitarian reasoning suggests that O, knowing his own fallibility, must never trust himself to make life-or-death gambles like in our example. Perhaps we would want him to gamble with, say, the fate of the world in the balance, but that is not the case here. But S does not need to gamble, because S cannot be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, S looks less like a human doctor and more like the medical workings of a benevolent superintelligence.  To me, the failure of imagination is thus &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;: my intuitive revulsion at S&amp;#39;s machinations has dissolved. It seems that S really knows what he&amp;#39;s doing, and I would be a fool to  stand in his way (however impotently that might be). Do your intuitions change similarly? Maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t matter! Perhaps the point is now moot: S would surely have better ways of helping people than unexpectedly chopping them up! From this perspective, the organ transplant example isn&amp;#39;t just unrealistic, it borders on self-contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking, I hope, shows that the question &amp;quot;what is practical?&amp;quot; is very deeply intertwined with the question &amp;quot;what is moral?&amp;quot;. For example, a very similar argument could be made for the practical choice of inaction in the trolley problem. I think everyone would be helped in their philosophical investigations if our thought-experiments came to us more fleshed-out, a first step towards treating Philosopher&amp;#39;s Syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Mop-up&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have addressed only one corner of one section of your post, and have already gone on too long.

All moral judgments are based on pre-existing moral intuitions which do not arise from reason, but rather are just inborn as a result of our biology.

I'll explain my objection in more detail below, but the short version of the answer is that utility monsters don't exist. If I lived in a world where utility monsters existed, my morality would be different, and I don't believe the objection of \"if the world was different then your moral system wouldn't be the same\" is all that interesting. Of course it wouldn't be the same - morality is derived reality.\n\nLonger explanation.\n\nThis is a very strange objection I have to admit I've never understood. \n\nFor the sake of keeping this simple, let's pick a specific form of utility monster, which is the rape monster. This is the monster which enjoys raping people so much that a utilitarian would be required to consent to it, because the utility of that monster is so great as to outweigh the suffering of the victims. This can be generalized to any utility monster, which asks us to privilege one individual at the expense of the suffering of everyone else.\n\nTake a step back and ask yourself why rape is wrong. From a secular, utilitarian perspective, why would rape be wrong? The answer is that in the real world, rape hurts people. It causes not just the victim immense pain and suffering, but it causes emotional distress to people who know the victim and causes ripples of insecurity out into society where people are afraid of rape. And that the benefit to the rapist is not worth the cost to all the victims.\n\nIn other words, rape is wrong because of the *real world fact* that it causes people to suffer, and humans have a natural, inborn aversion to suffering and causing suffering (mostly, some of us don't and that's a problem). And that there is no corresponding benefit.\n\nWhat you are essentially doing is to say \"why is rape wrong if you just assume there is a corresponding benefit\"? That doesn't really make any sense as a question. Rape is wrong because of its actual properties and consequences. To then ask \"would it be wrong if it didn't have those properties and consequences\" is to essentially be describing something other than rape. It's like asking \"would you like chocolate ice cream if it was 500 degrees hot\" - if chocolate ice cream was that hot, it wouldn't *be* chocolate ice cream. The question doesn't make sense.\n\nMy morality is built from from the real world. It's the result of evolutionary pressures that occurred in this world, in our actual universe with its currently existing rules. What you are essentially asking me to do is imagine a *different reality*, where things don't have the consequences they do in this reality, and then see if my morality would stay the same. Well, the answer is no, it wouldn't. Because my morality is suited for *this* reality, not a hypothetical different one. It's sort of like you asking me \"if we lived in a different universe where sugar tasted like feces, would you still like watermelon\"? I mean, no, I wouldn't. Luckily I don't live in that world.\n\nI guess my question to you is why *should* my morality need to be the same in a *different reality*? Why would we expect it to be? But perhaps more importantly, what possible alternative to utilitarianism *could* survive this kind of hypothetical?", "edited": 1492229954.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So your CMV is quite long, and I hope you&amp;#39;ll forgive me by focusing on just one of the objections, which is the utility monster objection. I&amp;#39;ll explain my objection in more detail below, but the short version of the answer is that utility monsters don&amp;#39;t exist. If I lived in a world where utility monsters existed, my morality would be different, and I don&amp;#39;t believe the objection of &amp;quot;if the world was different then your moral system wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same&amp;quot; is all that interesting. Of course it wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same - morality is derived reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Longer explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very strange objection I have to admit I&amp;#39;ve never understood. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the sake of keeping this simple, let&amp;#39;s pick a specific form of utility monster, which is the rape monster. This is the monster which enjoys raping people so much that a utilitarian would be required to consent to it, because the utility of that monster is so great as to outweigh the suffering of the victims. This can be generalized to any utility monster, which asks us to privilege one individual at the expense of the suffering of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a step back and ask yourself why rape is wrong. From a secular, utilitarian perspective, why would rape be wrong? The answer is that in the real world, rape hurts people. It causes not just the victim immense pain and suffering, but it causes emotional distress to people who know the victim and causes ripples of insecurity out into society where people are afraid of rape. And that the benefit to the rapist is not worth the cost to all the victims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, rape is wrong because of the &lt;em&gt;real world fact&lt;/em&gt; that it causes people to suffer, and humans have a natural, inborn aversion to suffering and causing suffering (mostly, some of us don&amp;#39;t and that&amp;#39;s a problem). And that there is no corresponding benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you are essentially doing is to say &amp;quot;why is rape wrong if you just assume there is a corresponding benefit&amp;quot;? That doesn&amp;#39;t really make any sense as a question. Rape is wrong because of its actual properties and consequences. To then ask &amp;quot;would it be wrong if it didn&amp;#39;t have those properties and consequences&amp;quot; is to essentially be describing something other than rape. It&amp;#39;s like asking &amp;quot;would you like chocolate ice cream if it was 500 degrees hot&amp;quot; - if chocolate ice cream was that hot, it wouldn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; chocolate ice cream. The question doesn&amp;#39;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My morality is built from from the real world. It&amp;#39;s the result of evolutionary pressures that occurred in this world, in our actual universe with its currently existing rules. What you are essentially asking me to do is imagine a &lt;em&gt;different reality&lt;/em&gt;, where things don&amp;#39;t have the consequences they do in this reality, and then see if my morality would stay the same. Well, the answer is no, it wouldn&amp;#39;t. Because my morality is suited for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; reality, not a hypothetical different one. It&amp;#39;s sort of like you asking me &amp;quot;if we lived in a different universe where sugar tasted like feces, would you still like watermelon&amp;quot;? I mean, no, I wouldn&amp;#39;t. Luckily I don&amp;#39;t live in that world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my question to you is why &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; my morality need to be the same in a &lt;em&gt;different reality&lt;/em&gt;? Why would we expect it to be?

But the admittedly subjective awfulness of its consequences convinced me otherwise. If you want to bite the bullet on all of them, that is fine with me, but as of yet I cannot. \n\n&gt;But as I said in my original post, this isn't a real objection. This is just you arguing that you don't like the conclusion, not that it's invalid or contradictory. Having to bite a bullet doesn't mean a ethical system is false.\n\nWhat is a \"real objection\"? I suppose that a contradiction would count, which is pretty cool. However, I am curious what you mean by showing a conclusion to be \"invalid,\" as distinct from \"contradictory.\" I have assumed that reduction to intuitive absurdity can invalidate an ethical system, but if it cannot, what else can?\n\n&gt;So your objection is no different than a homophobe getting upset that utilitarianism requires considering the happiness of gay people too. \n\nOn the basis of feelings alone, yes; on that of informed consent, no. \n\n&gt;See, first you argue that when following utilitarianism, a majority must acquiesce to the will of a minority (the utility monster). Then, you also argue that utilitarianism leads to majority rule. These two arguments are mutually exclusive. They cannot both be valid arguments. Either one is false, or both are false.\n\nIf everyone's happiness efficiency is the same, the majority is preferred; if the minority entity has a higher happiness efficiency than all members of the majority group combined, the minority is preferred. There is no contradiction here. \n\n&gt;Imagine two ant philosophers talking to each other about the same question \u2026 I think humans are such a being! \u2026 I could support my feelings on this issue by pointing out how much stronger feelings, preferences, and experiences humans have than ants (presumably) do.\n\nYes, that was response (5) in the utility monster section. I evidently did not rebut it well enough, so I will discuss it a bit further here. If I was an ant, then I feel like I would consider it unacceptable to sacrifice my colony to prevent a human's sprained ankle. As a human, I would disagree right now due only to practical limitations. Evolution designed us to be species-centric, but technology is slowly allowing us to grow out of it and giving us the opportunity to care for other species as we become dominant. For example, I had an ant problem in my apartment and had to use a spray to kill them, but I wish I had a technology which could just drive them away with pheromones or something. Maybe there is a contradiction here, and if you can show that it is fundamental to the utility monster objection, I'll either have to bite that bullet or give you a delta. \n\n&gt;If there really are some creatures far above us in terms of experience, but if such beings really exist, then we absolutely should sacrifice the whole of humanity to make sure their ankle doesn't get sprained \u2026 A true moral system shouldn't always be self-serving, right?\n\nWow. I guess a true moral system shouldn't always be self-serving\u2026but I would like to imagine that we are worth more than an alien god's sprained ankle. Maybe I have nothing more than intuition to go on here, but you are making utilitarianism a tough sell.\n\nAs an ironic tangent, under this reasoning divine command theory would logically follow from utilitarianism if theism was true. God is the ultimate utility monster. \n\n&gt;I think that one important consideration here is the heuristic-related one mentioned in 6.3 above: having a rule against killing people is useful, and what any more complicated rule gained in flexibility, it might lose in sacrosanct-ness, making it more likely that immoral people or an immoral government would consider murder to be an option (see David Friedman on Schelling points).\n\nI thought that the whole point of utilitarianism was not to have \"sacrosanct rules\" at all, but to do whatever produces the most happiness? Also, I said from the outset that I want to ignore practical considerations, which would include how immoral people or governments might misinterpret rules. If we can talk about practical considerations, several other objections to utilitarianism which I mentioned in my original post but have not defended here suddenly become relevant.\n\n&gt;Not having forced organ transplants, while it may cause some individual in happiness (to the people who want the organs), it will cause societal happiness because people in general don't have to worry about their organs being seized at any moment.\n\nI responded to that objection in my original post, specifically the claim that \"people would avoid hospitals if this were to happen in the real world, resulting in more suffering\" and that adding stipulations to prevent people from knowing about it would be \"unrealistic to the point of absurdity\":\n\n&gt;1. Again, even if a situation is unrealistic, it is still a valid argument if we can imagine it. See rebuttal (2) to the utility monster responses.\n\n&gt;2. This argument is historically contingent, because it assumes that people will stay as they are:\n\n&gt;&gt;If you're a utilitarian, it would be moral to implement this on the national scale. Therefore, it stops being unrealistic. Remember, it's only an unrealistic scenario because we're not purist utilitarians. However, if you're an advocate of utilitarianism, you hope that one day most or all of us will be purist utilitarians.\n\nThat should be sufficient.\n\n&gt;See, it's really convenient to just make up a fictional scenario where you can just incessantly stimulate the pleasure center of the brain, but in the real world, we know that's not possible. Humans have a hedonistic treadmill and develop tolerances \u2026 it's really easy to just make up some imaginary machine that violates our current understandings of psychology.\n\nReally? My understanding was that [the brain does not acclimate to direct pleasure stimulation](http://wireheading.com). Maybe I was misled by utilitarian philosopher David Pearce:\n\n&gt;Unlike food, drink or sex, the experience of pleasure itself exhibits no tolerance, even though our innumerable objects of desire certainly do so. Thus we can eventually get bored of anything - with a single exception. Stimulation of the pleasure-centres of the brain never palls. Fire them in the right way, and boredom is neurochemically impossible. Its substrates are missing. Electrical stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system is more intensely rewarding than eating, drinking, and love-making; and it never gets in the slightest a bit tedious. It stays exhilarating. \n\nAdmittedly, Pearce cites no sources, and I could not find any relevant ones in a quick Google search.

That is why I used the language \"that we would consider unethical.\"\n\nBut how does that make any sense? What basis are you using to determine the immorality?\n\nThe whole point of an ethical system like utilitarianism is to buck our (faulty) intuitions in favor of a more neutral &amp; objective system of moral principles. So your objection is no different than a homophobe getting upset that utilitarianism requires considering the happiness of gay people too. Some people find homosexuality naturally perverse &amp; obscene, but it's through utilitarian reasoning (being gay doesn't actually hurt anyone) that we realize our moral perception of homophobia is flawed and we must actually embrace gay people and treat them justly.\n\n&gt;utility monster\n&gt;The tyranny of the majority deals with priorities under utilitarianism; that the happiness of a majority is prioritized over the human rights of a minority.\n\nI'm going to group these two together becaysw they're really just opposite sides of the same argument.\n\nSee, first you argue that when following utilitarianism, a majority must acquiesce to the will of a minority (the utility monster). Then, you also argue that utilitarianism leads to majority rule. These two arguments are mutually exclusive. They cannot both be valid arguments. Either one is false, or both are false.\n\nSo again, my arguments is as follows:\n\nFirst, the concept of a utility monster is that their preferences make our own mere human preferences trivial, meaning we must sacrifice ourselves to their wishes since, for example, a utility monster eating ice cream would get a trillion times more pleasure than a human would. But as I said in my original post, this isn't a real objection. This is just you arguing that you don't like the conclusion, not that it's invalid or contradictory. Having to bite a bullet doesn't mean a ethical system is false. To quote the consequentialist FAQ:\n\n&gt;&gt;7.6: Wouldn't utilitarianism mean if there was some monster or alien or something whose feelings and preferences were a gazillion times stronger than our own, that monster would have so much moral value that its mild inconveniences would be more morally important than the entire fate of humanity?\n\n&gt;&gt;Maybe.\n\n&gt;&gt;Imagine two ant philosophers talking to each other about the same question. \u201cImagine,\" they said, \u201csome being with such intense consciousness, intellect, and emotion that it would be morally better to destroy an entire ant colony than to let that being suffer so much as a sprained ankle.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;But I think humans are such a being! I would rather see an entire ant colony destroyed than have a human suffer so much as a sprained ankle. And this isn't just human chauvinism either - I think I could support my feelings on this issue by pointing out how much stronger feelings, preferences, and experiences humans have than ants (presumably) do.\n\n&gt;&gt;I can't imagine a creature as far beyond us as we are beyond ants, but if such a creature existed I think it's possible that if I could imagine it, I would agree that its preferences were vastly more important than those of humans.\n\nIn my view, this is really no different than the homophobia example. Utilitarianism does not give humans a special status. If there really are some creatures far above us in terms of experience, and such beings really exist, then we absolutely should sacrifice the whole of humanity to make sure their ankle doesn't get sprained. Just because your personal, irrational bias in favor of humans makes you think this conclusion is horrible doesn't mean it's false. Sorry, but that's the reality. A true moral system shouldn't always be self-serving, right?\n\nAnd again, for the issue of majority rule, I'll quote the FAQ once more:\n\n&gt;&gt;7.2: Wouldn't utilitarianism lead to 51% of the population enslaving 49% of the population?\n\n&gt;&gt;The argument goes: it gives 51% of the population higher utility. And it only gives 49% of the population lower utility. Therefore, the majority benefits. Therefore, by utiltiarianism we should do it.\n\n&gt;&gt;This is a fundamental misunderstanding of utilitarianism. It doesn't say \u201cdo whatever makes the majority of people happier\", it says \u201cdo whatever increases the sum of happiness across people the most\".\n\n&gt;&gt;Suppose that ten people get together - nine well-fed Americans and one starving African. Each one has a candy. The well-fed Americans get +1 unit utility from eating a candy, but the starving African gets +10 units utility from eating a candy. The highest utility action is to give all ten candies to the starving African, for a total utility of +100.\n\n&gt;&gt;A person who doesn't understand utilitarianism might say \u201cWhy not have all the Americans agree to take the African's candy and divide it among them? Since there are 9 of them and only one of him, that means more people benefit.\" But in fact we see that that would only create +10 utility - much less than the first option.\n\n&gt;&gt;A person who thinks slavery would raise overall utility is making the same mistake. Sure, having a slave would be mildly useful to the master. But getting enslaved would be extremely unpleasant to the slave. Even though the majority of people \u201cbenefit\", the action is overall a very large net loss.\n\n&gt;&gt;(if you don't see why this is true, imagine I offered you a chance to live in either the real world, or a hypothetical world in which 51% of people are masters and 49% are slaves - with the caveat that you'll be a randomly selected person and might end up in either group. Would you prefer to go into the pro-slavery world? If not, you've admitted that that's not a \u201cbetter\" world to live in.)\n\nBut more specific to your objection, again, you're assuming the falsehood of utilitarianism go argue against it. Minorities don't have human rights anyways. Bentham famously said, natural rights are nonsense upon stilts. So your argument is basically that \"utilitarianism is wrong because it violates such &amp; such non-utilitarian principle\". Well, duh, of course utilitarianism is going to violate your non-utilitarian principle. That's the whole point! How is that an argument against it???\n\n&gt;I addressed this in my original post. See the rebuttal in the \"tyranny of the majority\" section.\n\nSee the FAQ once again:\n\n&gt;&gt;7.5: Wouldn't utilitarianism lead to healthy people being killed to distribute their organs among people who needed organ transplants, since each person has a bunch of organs and so could save a bunch of lives?\n\n&gt;&gt;We'll start with the unsatsifying weaselish answers to this objection, which are nevertheless important. The first weaselish answer is that most people's organs aren't compatible and that most organ transplants don't take very well, so the calculation would be less obvious than \"I have two kidneys, so killing me could save two people who need kidney transplants.\" The second weaselish answer is that a properly utiltiarian society would solve the organ shortage long before this became necessary (see 8.3) and so this would never come up.\n\n&gt;&gt;But those answers, although true, don't really address the philosophical question here, which is whether you can just go around killing people willy-nilly to save other people's lives. I think that one important consideration here is the heuristic-related one mentioned in 6.3 above: having a rule against killing people is useful, and what any more complicated rule gained in flexibility, it might lose in sacrosanct-ness, making it more likely that immoral people or an immoral government would consider murder to be an option (see David Friedman on Schelling points).\n\n&gt;&gt;This is also the strongest argument one could make against killing the fat man in 4.5 above - but note that it still is a *consequentialist* argument and subject to discussion or refutation on consequentialist grounds.\n\nOnce more, your argument seems to just be \n\n1. Assume non-utilitarian moral value.\n2. Utilitarianism violates that moral value.\n3. Therefore utilitarianism is false.\n\nAnd again, utilitarianism is evidence-based since it requires assessment of consequences. Can you actually show, with evidence, that a world where people's organs are randomly or systematically taken away from them to give to others would actually result in maximizing happiness? Because I'm not seeing it. I think that would be a very fearful society. Not having forced organ transplants, while it may cause some individual in happiness (to the people who want the organs), it will cause societal happiness because people in general don't have to worry about their organs being seized at any moment.\n\n&gt;Correct. Stimulating the pleasure center of the brain can cause intense euphoria whether or not the person has the personal traits that I mentioned, which shows that those traits are not necessary for maximizing happiness. In some situations they help increase happiness, but in others they do not.\n\nSee, it's really convenient to just make up a fictional scenario where you can just incessantly stimulate the pleasure center of the brain, but in the real world, we know that's not possible. Humans have a hedonistic treadmill and develop tolerances. The best way to combat this is to obtain happiness from a variety of sources, not just shooting up heroin. Eventually, the amount of heroin required to get the same high as your first hit will kill you.\n\nSo it's really easy to just make up some imaginary machine that violates our current understandings of psychology. But I don't see how that has any relevance to the actual world we live in.\n\n", "edited": 1492274200.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I described in the beginning of my post and several comments, my use of &amp;quot;reducing to the absurd&amp;quot; presupposes that you would find certain situations (e.g. enslaving humanity to a brain factory, saying that rape is justified, etc) immoral. That is why I used the language &amp;quot;that we would consider unethical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how does that make any sense? What basis are you using to determine the immorality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole point of an ethical system like utilitarianism is to buck our (faulty) intuitions in favor of a more neutral &amp;amp; objective system of moral principles. So your objection is no different than a homophobe getting upset that utilitarianism requires considering the happiness of gay people too. Some people find homosexuality naturally perverse &amp;amp; obscene, but it&amp;#39;s through utilitarian reasoning (being gay doesn&amp;#39;t actually hurt anyone) that we realize our moral perception of homophobia is flawed and we must actually embrace gay people and treat them justly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;utility monster\nThe tyranny of the majority deals with priorities under utilitarianism; that the happiness of a majority is prioritized over the human rights of a minority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to group these two together becaysw they&amp;#39;re really just opposite sides of the same argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, first you argue that when following utilitarianism, a majority must acquiesce to the will of a minority (the utility monster). Then, you also argue that utilitarianism leads to majority rule. These two arguments are mutually exclusive. They cannot both be valid arguments. Either one is false, or both are false.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So again, my arguments is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, the concept of a utility monster is that their preferences make our own mere human preferences trivial, meaning we must sacrifice ourselves to their wishes since, for example, a utility monster eating ice cream would get a trillion times more pleasure than a human would. But as I said in my original post, this isn&amp;#39;t a real objection. This is just you arguing that you don&amp;#39;t like the conclusion, not that it&amp;#39;s invalid or contradictory. Having to bite a bullet doesn&amp;#39;t mean a ethical system is false. To quote the consequentialist FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7.6: Wouldn&amp;#39;t utilitarianism mean if there was some monster or alien or something whose feelings and preferences were a gazillion times stronger than our own, that monster would have so much moral value that its mild inconveniences would be more morally important than the entire fate of humanity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine two ant philosophers talking to each other about the same question. \u201cImagine,&amp;quot; they said, \u201csome being with such intense consciousness, intellect, and emotion that it would be morally better to destroy an entire ant colony than to let that being suffer so much as a sprained ankle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think humans are such a being! I would rather see an entire ant colony destroyed than have a human suffer so much as a sprained ankle. And this isn&amp;#39;t just human chauvinism either - I think I could support my feelings on this issue by pointing out how much stronger feelings, preferences, and experiences humans have than ants (presumably) do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine a creature as far beyond us as we are beyond ants, but if such a creature existed I think it&amp;#39;s possible that if I could imagine it, I would agree that its preferences were vastly more important than those of humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my view, this is really no different than the homophobia example. Utilitarianism does not give humans a special status. If there really are some creatures far above us in terms of experience, and such beings really exist, then we absolutely should sacrifice the whole of humanity to make sure their ankle doesn&amp;#39;t get sprained. Just because your personal, irrational bias in favor of humans makes you think this conclusion is horrible doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s false. Sorry, but that&amp;#39;s the reality. A true moral system shouldn&amp;#39;t always be self-serving, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, for the issue of majority rule, I&amp;#39;ll quote the FAQ once more:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7.2: Wouldn&amp;#39;t utilitarianism lead to 51% of the population enslaving 49% of the population?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument goes: it gives 51% of the population higher utility. And it only gives 49% of the population lower utility. Therefore, the majority benefits. Therefore, by utiltiarianism we should do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental misunderstanding of utilitarianism. It doesn&amp;#39;t say \u201cdo whatever makes the majority of people happier&amp;quot;, it says \u201cdo whatever increases the sum of happiness across people the most&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suppose that ten people get together - nine well-fed Americans and one starving African. Each one has a candy. The well-fed Americans get +1 unit utility from eating a candy, but the starving African gets +10 units utility from eating a candy. The highest utility action is to give all ten candies to the starving African, for a total utility of +100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A person who doesn&amp;#39;t understand utilitarianism might say \u201cWhy not have all the Americans agree to take the African&amp;#39;s candy and divide it among them? Since there are 9 of them and only one of him, that means more people benefit.&amp;quot; But in fact we see that that would only create +10 utility - much less than the first option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A person who thinks slavery would raise overall utility is making the same mistake. Sure, having a slave would be mildly useful to the master. But getting enslaved would be extremely unpleasant to the slave. Even though the majority of people \u201cbenefit&amp;quot;, the action is overall a very large net loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(if you don&amp;#39;t see why this is true, imagine I offered you a chance to live in either the real world, or a hypothetical world in which 51% of people are masters and 49% are slaves - with the caveat that you&amp;#39;ll be a randomly selected person and might end up in either group.

Utilitarianism is itself an ethical view. So from where are you getting the idea that an AI would act in a way considered unethical? Unethical based on what?\n\nAs I described in the beginning of my post and several comments, my use of \"reducing to the absurd\" presupposes that you would find certain situations (e.g. enslaving humanity to a brain factory, saying that rape is justified, etc) immoral. That is why I used the language \"that we would consider unethical.\"\n\n&gt;The utility monster Is not a real thing that we know of.\n\nSee the rebuttals in my original post: 1) yes, it is; 2) it doesn't need to be because we can imagine what it would be like if a utility monster with fixed happiness did exist; 3) realistic utility monsters with changing happiness efficiencies are still a problem.\n\n&gt;Now, if we had a 6th person who is unhappy, then that person gets a -1 to contribute to the total.\n\nYou're right that negative utility is a good counterargument to the repugnant conclusion, as [I admitted in another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/65fjm3/cmv_classical_utilitarianism_is_an_untenable_and/dga83b4).\n\n&gt;But is that actually maximizing happiness? Wouldn't it result in more happiness if everyone's preferences were maximized, not just a mere majority?\n\nThe tyranny of the majority deals with priorities under utilitarianism; that the happiness of a majority is prioritized over the human rights of a minority.\n\n&gt;Would you really think people would be more happy in a world where their organs could be seized at any moment? I don't think so. \n\nI addressed this in my original post. See the rebuttal in the \"tyranny of the majority\" section.\n\n&gt;this assumes that those other traits you mentioned aren't necessary for maximizing happiness.\n\nCorrect. Stimulating the pleasure center of the brain can cause intense euphoria whether or not the person has the personal traits that I mentioned, which shows that those traits are not necessary for maximizing happiness. In some situations they help increase happiness, but in others they do not.\n\n&gt;Intelligence is not necessary for happiness? If instead argue that greater intelligence can serve as a catalyst for more happiness than lesser intelligence. \n\nActually, in many cases it is counterproductive to happiness. Some studies have [linked intelligence to depression](http://brainblogger.com/2014/12/18/does-high-iq-increase-the-risk-of-depression-and-mental-disorders) and [mental illness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ending-addiction-good/201503/is-there-link-between-intelligence-and-mental-illness). Also, [\"depressive realism\"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201206/depressive-realism) is a phenomenon where depressed people think more realistically than normal people. Even if these studies do not represent the body of research, one can at least acknowledge that intelligence is not *necessary* for happiness. If you want a more commonsense view and have the time, Desiderius Erasmus wrote a satirical book called [*The Praise of Folly*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Praise_of_Folly) which explains how intelligence can make people unhappy.\n\n&gt;Again, more generally, a lot of your scenarios seem to involve some super powerful AI that can manipulate our society in ways that we know today would require incredible amounts of power and energy.

Unethical based on what?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I described in the beginning of my post and several comments, my use of &amp;quot;reducing to the absurd&amp;quot; presupposes that you would find certain situations (e.g. enslaving humanity to a brain factory, saying that rape is justified, etc) immoral. That is why I used the language &amp;quot;that we would consider unethical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The utility monster Is not a real thing that we know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the rebuttals in my original post: 1) yes, it is; 2) it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be because we can imagine what it would be like if a utility monster with fixed happiness did exist; 3) realistic utility monsters with changing happiness efficiencies are still a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if we had a 6th person who is unhappy, then that person gets a -1 to contribute to the total.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right that negative utility is a good counterargument to the repugnant conclusion, as &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/65fjm3/cmv_classical_utilitarianism_is_an_untenable_and/dga83b4\"&gt;I admitted in another comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But is that actually maximizing happiness? Wouldn&amp;#39;t it result in more happiness if everyone&amp;#39;s preferences were maximized, not just a mere majority?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tyranny of the majority deals with priorities under utilitarianism; that the happiness of a majority is prioritized over the human rights of a minority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Would you really think people would be more happy in a world where their organs could be seized at any moment? I don&amp;#39;t think so. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I addressed this in my original post. See the rebuttal in the &amp;quot;tyranny of the majority&amp;quot; section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;this assumes that those other traits you mentioned aren&amp;#39;t necessary for maximizing happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Correct. Stimulating the pleasure center of the brain can cause intense euphoria whether or not the person has the personal traits that I mentioned, which shows that those traits are not necessary for maximizing happiness. In some situations they help increase happiness, but in others they do not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is not necessary for happiness? If instead argue that greater intelligence can serve as a catalyst for more happiness than lesser intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, in many cases it is counterproductive to happiness. Some studies have &lt;a href=\"http://brainblogger.com/2014/12/18/does-high-iq-increase-the-risk-of-depression-and-mental-disorders\"&gt;linked intelligence to depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ending-addiction-good/201503/is-there-link-between-intelligence-and-mental-illness\"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201206/depressive-realism\"&gt;&amp;quot;depressive realism&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; is a phenomenon where depressed people think more realistically than normal people. Even if these studies do not represent the body of research, one can at least acknowledge that intelligence is not &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for happiness. If you want a more commonsense view and have the time, Desiderius Erasmus wrote a satirical book called &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Praise_of_Folly\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Praise of Folly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which explains how intelligence can make people unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, more generally, a lot of your scenarios seem to involve some super powerful AI that can manipulate our society in ways that we know today would require incredible amounts of power and energy. Do you honestly believe there is not better way to harness/utilize that energy &amp;amp; power to maximize happiness other than the specific methods you describe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the AI Overlord is a helpful tool for explaining the scenarios, it is by no means necessary for the objections to hold.

Utilitarianism is itself an ethical view. So from where are you getting the idea that an AI would act in a way considered unethical? Unethical based on what?\n\nThis is a common thread I've noticed in many criticisms of utilitarianism. It's almost as though the person making the argument basically assumes that utilitarianism is already false, and then shows examples of how utilitarianism goes against their own (undeclared) ethical view, then concludes that utitarianism is false. Do you see the problem with that?\n\nSo let's go through your objections:\n\n&gt;The utility monster\n\nIs not a real thing that we know of. But even so, it fails because of what I mentioned above. If maximizing happiness requires pleasing some monster, then such is the conclusion of utilitarianism. Why does that make it false? Because you don't like the conclusion?\n\nBut again, I stress that there's no evidence of actual utility monsters existing.\n\n&gt;The mere addition paradox\n\nYou say both of your conclusions are bad, but according to who/what?\n\nIn any case, I would argue that utilitarianism is not about hypothetical worlds that you have specifically designed to \"disprove\" utilitarianism. Instead, it is an ethical view based on what to do in our actual, real world. Maximizing happiness in our current world is obviously going to require a very different strategy when compared with some hypothetical world. So lets discuss the problems with both of your conceptions (total vs average).\n\nSo for total happiness, remember that utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness, not simply producing a marginally better world.\n\nSo let's say we have a world of 5 people and they are all unhappy. Maximizing happiness would mean all 5 are happy. Let's assign 1 unit of happiness to each one. So the total world happiness is +5. Now, if we had a 6th person who is unhappy, then that person gets a -1 to contribute to the total. So we'd actually only end up with +4 total net happiness even though we increased the population. I would argue that like money, there is marginal utility when it comes to happiness. Let's say a room only has 5 beds. 1 person would be happy, 2 people would be happy... all the way up to 5. But once you get 6 people, someone has to share a bed. Let's say sharing a bed makes someone less happy than if they sleep solo. So the basic idea behind this is that **resources are finite and we have a carrying capacity**. So eventually we get to the point where resources allotted to each person become so little that it passes over the hump of minimum sustainability. It's kinda complicated so let me use food as an example. If you have good to distribute, then each person needs a minimum amount of food to avoid starvation. Beyond that, the marginal happiness of increased food sharply declines. So the graph would look kinda like a chi squared distribution, with a big rise in utility at first, peaking, and then a decline in utility. I'd argue that food behaves in this way, where if you decrease the amount of food a person receives past the hump, their happiness starts decreasing tremendously.\n\nBasically, I'm trying to say that happiness has marginal utility and eventually there will be an optimal point where, say there are enough resources for n people, but n+1 people would result in a total decrease in happiness because the happiness gained from that extra person would not offset the happiness lost from the other people because they go past their peak and dip very far.\n\nAs for your average happiness scenario, let me put it this way. Think really carefully about the implications of a world where half the population is slaughtered. Is that really **maximizing** average happiness? Or is that simply producing a marginally better one? And how exactly are you killing half the population? With what means? If someone had the power to somehow measure exactly the half of the population that is below average, wouldn't they also have the power to make a much better average world without killing a bunch of people?\n\n\nRemember, utilitarianism is about opportunity cost too. Let's say I have many kids, and one of them is hungry. It's true that I could spend a thousand dollars to hire a hitman to murder the hungry one, and my (remaining) children's average happiness would go up. But it would go up even further if I had invested that thousand dollars to in food to give my hungry child instead to increase the average happiness. \n\n&gt;The tyranny of the majority\n\nBut is that actually maximizing happiness? Wouldn't it result in more happiness if everyone's preferences were maximized, not just a mere majority? \n\nWould you really think people would be more happy in a world where their organs could be seized at any moment? I don't think so. Often, these nightmare scenarios that people think of don't actually maximize happiness. The important test to always consider is \"would i really prefer to live in such a world? Would most people prefer to live in such a world?\" If the answer to both is no, I'd argue that the world isn't actually maximizing happiness. \n\n&gt;The superfluity of people\n\nAgain, this assumes that those other traits you mentioned aren't necessary for maximizing happiness. Is that true? Intelligence is not necessary for happiness? If instead argue that greater intelligence can serve as a catalyst for more happiness than lesser intelligence. And again, try out the test I described above. If most people would be unhappy if the switch from our world to the unintelligent one, can we really be maximizing happiness?\n\nAgain, more generally, a lot of your scenarios seem to involve some super powerful AI that can manipulate our society in ways that we know today would require incredible amounts of power and energy.
