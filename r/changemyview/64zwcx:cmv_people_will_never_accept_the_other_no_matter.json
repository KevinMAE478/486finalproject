When norms conflict with laws, laws win out (or are changed). This means that laws can definitely change norms; for example, look at the difference between rape now and rape a hundred years ago. Nowadays consent is a key component - in the past, it wasn't a consideration in some situations (like when married).\n\nWhich brings me to the second point: norms can be changed. Heck, even religious norms change - if you're a Christian you should be familiar with the concept of usury and how it is decried in many places throughout the Bible. But how many Christians refuse to take loans or use credit cards with interest terms? The passages are still the same (well, although translated), but the norm completely flipped.\n\nThird, norms are definitely not based solely on human nature - I would argue that they are based primarily on tradition. And tradition can be updated or discarded. Heck, that's prized in our society; justifying an action \"because that's how we've always done it\" is viewed as a sign of inefficiency and laziness in most workplaces.\n\n&gt;We can always be more accepting people, but society is not an individual and will always need someone to blame\n\nIf individuals make up society, and individuals can become more accepting, why can't society? Even if tribalism is part of our nature, we've built civilization around the concept that we can overcome our nature. We're *homo sapiens*, and that \"sapiens\" part notes our sapience -  the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight.\n\n&gt;We were trying to fix it for centuries and still haven't taken a single step\n\nYou literally just said\n\n&gt;We can always be more accepting people\n\nand\n\n&gt; We are succeeding with eliminating racism to a degree\n\nSo how can you claim we haven't taken a single step forward? Judging people based on their hobbies or political views has been a problem in the past and continues to be now. But we've made clear strides in stopping race-based prejudices compared to years ago.\n\nNow, on a completely different tact: you claim that tribalism (not accepting others outside of our group) is human nature. Surely that means that you consider it part of our genetic makeup. But with CRISPR and the mapping of the human genome, genetic workshopping on the horizon.

When norms conflict with laws, laws win out (or are changed). This means that laws can definitely change norms; for example, look at the difference between rape now and rape a hundred years ago. Nowadays consent is a key component - in the past, it wasn&amp;#39;t a consideration in some situations (like when married).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the second point: norms can be changed. Heck, even religious norms change - if you&amp;#39;re a Christian you should be familiar with the concept of usury and how it is decried in many places throughout the Bible. But how many Christians refuse to take loans or use credit cards with interest terms? The passages are still the same (well, although translated), but the norm completely flipped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, norms are definitely not based solely on human nature - I would argue that they are based primarily on tradition. And tradition can be updated or discarded. Heck, that&amp;#39;s prized in our society; justifying an action &amp;quot;because that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ve always done it&amp;quot; is viewed as a sign of inefficiency and laziness in most workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can always be more accepting people, but society is not an individual and will always need someone to blame&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If individuals make up society, and individuals can become more accepting, why can&amp;#39;t society? Even if tribalism is part of our nature, we&amp;#39;ve built civilization around the concept that we can overcome our nature. We&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, and that &amp;quot;sapiens&amp;quot; part notes our sapience -  the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We were trying to fix it for centuries and still haven&amp;#39;t taken a single step&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally just said&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can always be more accepting people&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are succeeding with eliminating racism to a degree&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how can you claim we haven&amp;#39;t taken a single step forward? Judging people based on their hobbies or political views has been a problem in the past and continues to be now. But we&amp;#39;ve made clear strides in stopping race-based prejudices compared to years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, on a completely different tact: you claim that tribalism (not accepting others outside of our group) is human nature.

Taking their cue from Tajfel's finding that in-group favouritism emerges with minimal prompting, Hammond and Axelrod decided to try to emulate this in a simple computer model. Imagine a population of individuals, interacting in pairs at random, and engaging in some activity where both would benefit from cooperation, but each was also tempted to cheat - getting more for themselves at the other's expense. With no insight into the likely behaviour of others, individuals in such a world would have no way - besides pure guesswork - to maximise the outcome of their interactions. But add one simple element, colour, and everything changes.\n\n&gt; People in Hammond and Axelrod's world come in four colours, assigned randomly at birth. When interacting with others, they might now adopt one of several basic strategies. An individual might act randomly, as before, ignoring colour - which would make sense as the colours say nothing about how an individual is likely to behave. Alternatively, a person might always cooperate or always cheat, regardless of the other's colour. Another option would be to follow a groupist \"ethnocentric\" strategy - cooperating with anyone of the same colour, but always trying to cheat those of another colour. Finally, agents might be anti-groupist - only cooperating with someone of another colour. The researchers randomly assigned one of these strategies to each agent. They also gave all agents the ability to learn from one another, so that any strategy that did well would tend to be copied and so spread.\n\n&gt; What happened then, they discovered, was that agents of each particular colour began to gather together.

Taking their cue from Tajfel&amp;#39;s finding that in-group favouritism emerges with minimal prompting, Hammond and Axelrod decided to try to emulate this in a simple computer model. Imagine a population of individuals, interacting in pairs at random, and engaging in some activity where both would benefit from cooperation, but each was also tempted to cheat - getting more for themselves at the other&amp;#39;s expense. With no insight into the likely behaviour of others, individuals in such a world would have no way - besides pure guesswork - to maximise the outcome of their interactions. But add one simple element, colour, and everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People in Hammond and Axelrod&amp;#39;s world come in four colours, assigned randomly at birth. When interacting with others, they might now adopt one of several basic strategies. An individual might act randomly, as before, ignoring colour - which would make sense as the colours say nothing about how an individual is likely to behave. Alternatively, a person might always cooperate or always cheat, regardless of the other&amp;#39;s colour. Another option would be to follow a groupist &amp;quot;ethnocentric&amp;quot; strategy - cooperating with anyone of the same colour, but always trying to cheat those of another colour. Finally, agents might be anti-groupist - only cooperating with someone of another colour. The researchers randomly assigned one of these strategies to each agent. They also gave all agents the ability to learn from one another, so that any strategy that did well would tend to be copied and so spread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened then, they discovered, was that agents of each particular colour began to gather together. At first, a few groupist agents of the same colour might find themselves together by chance. Within such a group, cooperative interactions lead to good outcomes, causing others nearby to copy their strategy, swelling the group. In the model, Hammond and Axelrod found that strongly ethnocentric groups of different colours came to fill the world, at the expense of others. Anyone who did not follow the groupist strategy tended to suffer. Even someone ignoring colour - and remember colour initially signified nothing about an agent&amp;#39;s behaviour - would also get wiped out.
