So you&amp;#39;re correct in saying that fewer players smurf because there aren&amp;#39;t that many aren&amp;#39;t the higher ranks, but the fewer players that do smurf make up aren&amp;#39;t larger portion of the higher ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) you&amp;#39;re taking it out of context, a waste of time as far as video games go. If you consider that it is an &lt;em&gt;entertainment&lt;/em&gt; medium, then getting pubstomped by players who are better effectively wastes time that you could use getting more entertainment out of a game, a close match is more entertaining than one team getting stomped. As for the higher level players, it wastes the time that they could spend practicing to get better, which is often the reason higher level competitive players play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) that went along with the wasting of time part, because all it does is prevents players from climbing, and eliminates the whole reason of doing it in the first place, to play with lower level players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) you&amp;#39;re Correct that people should be playing games for enjoyment, but isn&amp;#39;t it selfish to ruin the enjoyment of many others just so you can get a few kicks?
