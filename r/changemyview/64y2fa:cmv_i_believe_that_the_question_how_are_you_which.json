And when they replied that they were not doing well, or could have been doing better, they were &amp;#39;corrected&amp;#39; into answering that they were &amp;#39;fine&amp;#39;. These have fit my own experiences as well, of people asking me how I was, to which I answer honestly, and they say something along the lines of &amp;quot;Oh my god I don&amp;#39;t care.&amp;quot; In which case, I assert they shouldn&amp;#39;t have asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m okay&amp;quot; has become the default, expected response to the question of &amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot;, and I believe that it is not only lacking in any type of social empathy, but actually detrimental to mental health in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question &amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot; was introduced as genuine inquiry. &amp;quot;How are you in health?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How do you?&amp;quot; were optional greetings that involved a sincere question, separated from the traditional greetings of &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot;. In this manner, the addition of &amp;quot;How are you&amp;quot; as a more commonplace greeting is an extension of empathy. Its more commonplace adoption was people actually caring about the response, which was not yet rigidly defined into &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m okay&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further than this, however, I believe that the question - particularly when asked insincerely, but perhaps even the question itself, by the social stigma that has now developed around it - is detrimental to mental health. If someone is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fine, they are presented with a choice. Are they going to answer a social custom &amp;#39;incorrectly&amp;#39;, and thus have the social pressure and expectation be a burden upon them to correct (shame and embarrassment), or are they going to falsely state that they are &amp;quot;Fine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Okay&amp;quot;, even though social psychology shows us that stating something aloud hardens the mind against other concepts. If someone says &amp;quot;My favorite color is blue&amp;quot;, they are less likely to change their mind later. This social effect is a large reason why people have such strong reactions to hypocrisy. So, in saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m okay&amp;quot;, when someone isn&amp;#39;t actually fine or okay, it is, in effect, painting over a crumbling wall and insisting to themselves that the problem has been solved. The slight reinforcement of that belief that they are okay is a veneer of polish over crumbling support in a country where there is still a massive stigma against admitting that someone has a mental health problem, much less actually getting help for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that an insincere &amp;quot;How are you&amp;quot; does, therefore, is drive people further into denial, and further away from help, ultimately harming them in the long run, and hardening them from the belief that anyone actually does care. As such, &amp;quot;How are you&amp;quot; should only be asked by people who legitimately care about the answer, and if someone doesn&amp;#39;t have the necessary empathy to care or talk about the issue, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be asked at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am willing to consider alternatives to &amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot; for more legitimate inquiries (In the hopes that slight modifications to the question would elicit more genuine results), but I am firm in my belief that the insincere version must be removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To clarify, since everyone thinks I must be just &amp;#39;too detailed&amp;#39; about things, and talking to everyone &amp;#39;as though they were my therapist&amp;#39;: I have had &amp;quot;Hanging in there&amp;quot; rebuked as being &amp;quot;More than they wanted to know.&amp;quot; I have had &amp;quot;Not so good&amp;quot; replied to as &amp;quot;The answer is &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m fine&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; These are people asking the question in an insincere, formulaic manner, and, in my experience, it&amp;#39;s rather rampant.

In the moment, this reinforces a belief - that they will get over it. This is a good thing, but it's fleeting. Later on, thinking back on it, with both the passage of time dulling pain, and memory recollection focusing on the statements more than feelings, it will be easier to picture themselves as having no real problems at all.\n\nThe issue comes in through repetition, however. Bad events are whitewashed with this response, and further decision making is altered by what was deemed normative in the past. Grief can become a new 'normal' over the course of a few weeks, and continue in its ignored state because they have convinced themselves that they are fine.

Bad events are whitewashed with this response, and further decision making is altered by what was deemed normative in the past.

Or it could go:\n\n*\"How are you doing?\"*\n\n*\"Fine, thanks.\"*\n\nThe end - if the asked person doesn't feel like chatting.\n\nWhile this effectively means sometimes it's used the same as \"hello\" it adds that extra option. Consider how this doesn't work to trigger casual conversation:\n\n*\"Hello.\"*\n\n*Oh hi! I just got back from a trip!\"*\n\n\"...? Uh, ok.\"*\n\nOr consider how direct questions to someone  you would only have a casual conversation with seems rude:\n\n*\"Hey, there! Tell me the most interesting going on in your life right now.\"*\n\n*\"Uh...I don't know you that well.\"*\n\nThe casual, \"How are you doing,\" solves all that. It allows the original greeter to invite light conversation without being to pointed, and it allows the respondent to either engage naturally or politely decline with no one getting ruffled either way.\n\nHaving any sort of social IQ at all allows a person to know the difference between someone close to them genuinely asking how they are and stranger or casual acquaintance offering small talk. Common sense says that your best friend is probably happy to empathize with you if you got dumped, fired and had your dog die all in the same week - but a acquaintance or stranger realistically has enough going on in their own life - and doesn't know you well enough for any advice or comfort to really matter - to spend time on your problems.\n\nFor the small amount of the population dealing with mental illness or depression the answer isn't completely altering societal norms to have strangers have to listen to you tell them how Nancy at the office is being a backstabbing bitch making your life hell again on the off chance you're going to also admit you're suicidal. It is to normalize seeking proper help from proper people in a position to help if you're experiencing true depression of mental illness.\n\nAfter all, if a stranger told you they were dealing with severe depression would/could you realistically do? If they said they were suicidal you might call the police or give them the number to your pastor or something. But if they told you, \"I'm just so depressed and need a psychiatrist but don't have the money are you personally going to walk this person, who has admitted to mental problems, to a mental health facility and pay for it? \n\nMoreover, the scenario where the person with severe depression recognizing it and admitting it is unlikely. In an honest answer they're more likely to just say, \"I've just been really down for a while...(etc).\" Are you really equipped to tell the difference between the person who is dealing with a normal run of bad luck / the blues but ultimately is going to be just fine and someone with true mental illness? I doubt most people are. Better to just reinforce seeking qualified help if you need it.\n\n**TL;DR: \"How are you doing?\" has advantages of politely opening up the possibility for small talk that other greetings don't. Whether it's an invitation for small talk or a genuine inquiry is obvious to the vast majority of people in context. People with genuine depression or other issues wouldn't receive any benefit from everyone wearing their emotions on their sleeves because to most people their complaints would be indistinguishable from persons just having a bad week. If you want to help people with mental illness / depression you advertise how to recognize the difference between mental illness and a normal run of the blues and normalize seeking help if you have the former.**\n\nEdit: typos ", "edited": 1492059355.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an invitation to make small talk - if the other person wants to.

Tell me the most interesting going on in your life right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Uh...I don&amp;#39;t know you that well.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The casual, &amp;quot;How are you doing,&amp;quot; solves all that. It allows the original greeter to invite light conversation without being to pointed, and it allows the respondent to either engage naturally or politely decline with no one getting ruffled either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having any sort of social IQ at all allows a person to know the difference between someone close to them genuinely asking how they are and stranger or casual acquaintance offering small talk. Common sense says that your best friend is probably happy to empathize with you if you got dumped, fired and had your dog die all in the same week - but a acquaintance or stranger realistically has enough going on in their own life - and doesn&amp;#39;t know you well enough for any advice or comfort to really matter - to spend time on your problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the small amount of the population dealing with mental illness or depression the answer isn&amp;#39;t completely altering societal norms to have strangers have to listen to you tell them how Nancy at the office is being a backstabbing bitch making your life hell again on the off chance you&amp;#39;re going to also admit you&amp;#39;re suicidal. It is to normalize seeking proper help from proper people in a position to help if you&amp;#39;re experiencing true depression of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, if a stranger told you they were dealing with severe depression would/could you realistically do? If they said they were suicidal you might call the police or give them the number to your pastor or something. But if they told you, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just so depressed and need a psychiatrist but don&amp;#39;t have the money are you personally going to walk this person, who has admitted to mental problems, to a mental health facility and pay for it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the scenario where the person with severe depression recognizing it and admitting it is unlikely. In an honest answer they&amp;#39;re more likely to just say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve just been really down for a while...(etc).&amp;quot; Are you really equipped to tell the difference between the person who is dealing with a normal run of bad luck / the blues but ultimately is going to be just fine and someone with true mental illness? I doubt most people are. Better to just reinforce seeking qualified help if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: &amp;quot;How are you doing?&amp;quot; has advantages of politely opening up the possibility for small talk that other greetings don&amp;#39;t. Whether it&amp;#39;s an invitation for small talk or a genuine inquiry is obvious to the vast majority of people in context. People with genuine depression or other issues wouldn&amp;#39;t receive any benefit from everyone wearing their emotions on their sleeves because to most people their complaints would be indistinguishable from persons just having a bad week. If you want to help people with mental illness / depression you advertise how to recognize the difference between mental illness and a normal run of the blues and normalize seeking help if you have the former.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: typos &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg737mk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492083569.0, "created_utc": 1492054769.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y2fa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y2fa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6svq7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Recognizant", "parent_id": "t1_dg6noh4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Where I am, we use \"What's up\" for that function.
