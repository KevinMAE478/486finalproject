I haven't seen this brought up on this sub before and if it has I still think some new information and thought processes can be brought to life. Let's begin. \n\nTo begin, my **thesis**. The wage gap does not exist as it is frequently described and the only way in which it does exist is irrelevant to the majority of situations in which it is applied.\n\n1. To **define** what I mean **how it is represented**. More aggressive feminists like to advocate for their various causes by saying men and women are not treated equal in the sense that for every dollar a man makes a woman makes 77 (or somewhere around this conversion rate) cents, and that in all its simplicity is true, but it is also misleading. \nOnto how I think it is misleading.

I truly believe harping on this outdated disproved statistic hinders everything else feminists have to say, because it makes them look as if facts and legitimacy are not a priority.\n\n3. I believe this **topic is mishandled** very frequently when people reason participating in [the day without women](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/03/06/day-without-woman-what-you-need-know/98690692/) by saying they are fighting against the wage gap.

The 1950s were guilty as fuck of this, as society openly encourages (i.e., pressured) women to get married, be a housewife, and pop out a few babies. Work and most of the financial decision making was left to the husbands, up until the 1960s/1970s when women started to experience a surge of independence. Women then started to enter the workforce in droves, and as such expectations for women changed. They were no longer expected to be just housewives, but they were still expected to be mothers.\n\nThus, opinions exist that most women want to prioritize motherhood because that's the societal stereotype of women that has plagued working women for decades. Women are often passed up for promotions or jobs simply based on assumptions that they'll just be a waste of resources since they'll just resort to popping out babies and eventually leave. That's a flawed expectation, since many women nowadays are delaying motherhood because they want careers first. However, so long as employers expect them to leave, there will be a discrepancy between advancements in male professionals than female professionals. \n\n&gt; As I'm sure many of you here have heard before the truth of the matter is that women tend to choose lower paying jobs and/or plan their lives around being a mother first and foremost.\n\nWe have women in the workforce, but the stereotypes and images about women still affect who takes what jobs. Yes, some women choose to be mothers, but that should have no more bearing over the jobs they take/salaries they receive than it should for the fathers. Ideally, whatever career they have will accommodate for paid family time off for *both* mom and dad, because parenthood falls to both parents. Indeed, more fathers are requesting paternity leave, which would put them in a similar boat as mothers. Yet we don't see employers passing up promotions or jobs for males on the assumption of \"He's going to have a baby and need time off, so we won't hire him/promote him.\"\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me first start with a bit of gender history, and then discuss how it still has effects nowadays. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that women back in the day were see as housewives, rather than workers. The 1950s were guilty as fuck of this, as society openly encourages (i.e., pressured) women to get married, be a housewife, and pop out a few babies. Work and most of the financial decision making was left to the husbands, up until the 1960s/1970s when women started to experience a surge of independence. Women then started to enter the workforce in droves, and as such expectations for women changed. They were no longer expected to be just housewives, but they were still expected to be mothers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, opinions exist that most women want to prioritize motherhood because that&amp;#39;s the societal stereotype of women that has plagued working women for decades. Women are often passed up for promotions or jobs simply based on assumptions that they&amp;#39;ll just be a waste of resources since they&amp;#39;ll just resort to popping out babies and eventually leave. That&amp;#39;s a flawed expectation, since many women nowadays are delaying motherhood because they want careers first. However, so long as employers expect them to leave, there will be a discrepancy between advancements in male professionals than female professionals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;m sure many of you here have heard before the truth of the matter is that women tend to choose lower paying jobs and/or plan their lives around being a mother first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have women in the workforce, but the stereotypes and images about women still affect who takes what jobs.

The Wage Gap doesn't take into account different jobs, education, experience, seniority, amount of hours worked, or maternity leave.\n\n\n2. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it illegal to pay a man and a woman differently for the same job.\n\n\n3. When including for all of the factors above, the gap is only 3-4 cents, which can be accounted for by men asking for raises more often than women.\n\n\n\nSources: (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/28/fact-checking-the-2014-state-of-the-union-address/?utm_term=.baff093b62fb)\n\n\n\n(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm)\n\n\n\n\nPAGE 4: (http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.99257.1346412310!/menu/standard/file/anna_sandberg.pdf)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not changing your view, I have the same view and would like someone to comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wage Gap doesn&amp;#39;t take into account different jobs, education, experience, seniority, amount of hours worked, or maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it illegal to pay a man and a woman differently for the same job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When including for all of the factors above, the gap is only 3-4 cents, which can be accounted for by men asking for raises more often than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources: (&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/28/fact-checking-the-2014-state-of-the-union-address/?utm_term=.baff093b62fb\"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/28/fact-checking-the-2014-state-of-the-union-address/?utm_term=.baff093b62fb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm\"&gt;https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PAGE 4: (&lt;a href=\"http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.99257.1346412310!/menu/standard/file/anna_sandberg.pdf\"&gt;http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.99257.1346412310!/menu/standard/file/anna_sandberg.pdf&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgcywpc", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424634.0, "created_utc": 1492395834.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ql5q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ql5q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcguyt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mage_x", "parent_id": "t1_dgcfqvg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would like to reiterate and also thank you for your reply.
