She flew back during Thanksgiving. She made it back just in time to see her mother one last time before she died.\n\nShe wasn't bounced for this flight, but had she been in the plane and asked to leave, I can guarantee that she would have at least asked to stay because she was traveling for something time-sensitive (her mom was dying within a day or so), and it's possible that something similar would've happened to her had the company gone down the same path then.\n\nI don't know about *you*, but I know that *I* would've poured every bit of energy into ruining that airline, had they bloodied my girlfriend and made her unable to see her mother during her final hours.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People are bumped from flights often, and as a frequent flyer myself it is within reason to be bumped from a flight to make room for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I frequent this board, and in the last week as far as I saw, every single person who&amp;#39;s made a similar thread has mentioned somewhere in the comments that they are a frequent flier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I think you and they need to understand is that you are in the &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; minority of people.

I have been on more commercial flights than all of my closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while you may see it all the time, keep in mind that this isn&amp;#39;t the perception of the average flier, who may be going on his one vacation in 10 years, or the one business conference he&amp;#39;s ever been to because the company he worked for for 20 years is merging with another company and they&amp;#39;re having a big event for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For most people, whose majority of business transactions are not with airlines, it is not an intuitive idea that you can pay for a service, get to the very last step of the service having already paid for it, and then have the service reneged on, particularly when it&amp;#39;s something that can be very time-sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a bit of an anecdote: My girlfriend flew back to her mother&amp;#39;s home halfway across the country because her mother was in the hospital and wasn&amp;#39;t likely to pull through. She flew back during Thanksgiving. She made it back just in time to see her mother one last time before she died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t bounced for this flight, but had she been in the plane and asked to leave, I can guarantee that she would have at least asked to stay because she was traveling for something time-sensitive (her mom was dying within a day or so), and it&amp;#39;s possible that something similar would&amp;#39;ve happened to her had the company gone down the same path then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, but I know that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would&amp;#39;ve poured every bit of energy into ruining that airline, had they bloodied my girlfriend and made her unable to see her mother during her final hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg7mxbf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123359.0, "created_utc": 1492094559.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7745m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thatguyunknoe", "parent_id": "t1_dg73em4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not a lawyer and would prefer to not get into the weeds of a legal arguement but the second to last paragraph makes the adhesion arguement fall apart.

Were they legally in the okay? Most likely. The minute they called the police it became a legal issue and out of their hands. At that point, legally, an airline has the right to bounce anyone off a place for any reason. It&amp;#39;s just the principle; they chose to call the police, who came in and dragged a man off a plane, because they didn&amp;#39;t want to take another 10-15 minutes to further negotiate with the passengers. It&amp;#39;s a lack of human decency. And so for that, I absolutely believe the airline is deserving of all the crap they&amp;#39;re receiving from social media. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg73p03", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084286.0, "created_utc": 1492055486.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652poz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8b5el", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anonoman925", "parent_id": "t3_652poz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Let's not confuse overreaction to cacophony. \n\nAnd overreACTION would probably entail...action.
