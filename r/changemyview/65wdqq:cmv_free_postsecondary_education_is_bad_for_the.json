I spent a couple of weeks in Trinidad and Tobago a few years ago, and upon speaking to locals I learned that their post-secondary education is free.  When I suggested unemployment must be really low, they told me the opposite; they told me that because education was free, everyone had a degree, and you needed multiple degrees just to get a decent job.  I live in NA and we can see this already.  Good jobs that at one time required no degree are becoming harder to get as education gets cheaper.  For example (sort of anecdotal again), a family friend used to work at Enterprise Rent-a-Car, and told me that they only hire people with university degrees.

Assuming that&amp;#39;s true, which from my experience it isn&amp;#39;t, once education is free, you&amp;#39;re going to see the kids who didn&amp;#39;t care in high school and only went because they were forced to do the same in universities.  Because it&amp;#39;s free, their parents will make them go, and because they don&amp;#39;t care, they&amp;#39;re going to slack off and waste their time and taxpayer money.

Tuition is free? All costs are covered? I believe most \"free college\" plans do **not** include room and board, which is a non-trivial cost for most college students. Also, what are the limitations? Can you just stay in school indefinitely, changing majors or adding degrees every few years? Not sure any proposed plans are for *unlimited* free tuition. The ones I've see described are for two or four years, which implies that if you take more time (either due to taking a lighter load or repeating some classes), you're on the hook for tuition for the additional semesters. And maintaining acceptable academic performance seems likely to be included as well, though I have not seen specifics on that.\n\nTo address your first point, the number of jobs available is not likely to be affected by the number of potential applicants with degrees, so free college should really not be a factor there.\n\nAs to your second point:\n\n&gt; you have nothing on the line. Fail? Take it again, its free\n\nThis assumes there are no costs, but room and board often make up more than half the cost of higher education. Plus, there will probably be at least as many, if not more/higher fees. It also assumes there is no penalty for poor academic performance. Even if the government-paid tuition program does not address it, in most schools flunking out will still be a thing. In fact, reducing the cost to the student might make schools more academically competitive.\n\n&gt; you're going to see the kids who didn't care in high school and only went because they were forced to do the same in universities.\n\nIf cost is less of a barrier, won't that make admissions more competitive? Smart, hardworking kids who would not even bother applying to some schools due to the high tuition cost will be less financially limited, while the slacker kids will likely have even fewer options because there will be a larger applicant pool competing for a similar number of spots.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, what does &amp;quot;free post-secondary education&amp;quot; mean? Tuition is free? All costs are covered? I believe most &amp;quot;free college&amp;quot; plans do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include room and board, which is a non-trivial cost for most college students. Also, what are the limitations? Can you just stay in school indefinitely, changing majors or adding degrees every few years? Not sure any proposed plans are for &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; free tuition. The ones I&amp;#39;ve see described are for two or four years, which implies that if you take more time (either due to taking a lighter load or repeating some classes), you&amp;#39;re on the hook for tuition for the additional semesters. And maintaining acceptable academic performance seems likely to be included as well, though I have not seen specifics on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To address your first point, the number of jobs available is not likely to be affected by the number of potential applicants with degrees, so free college should really not be a factor there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to your second point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you have nothing on the line. Fail? Take it again, its free&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This assumes there are no costs, but room and board often make up more than half the cost of higher education. Plus, there will probably be at least as many, if not more/higher fees. It also assumes there is no penalty for poor academic performance. Even if the government-paid tuition program does not address it, in most schools flunking out will still be a thing. In fact, reducing the cost to the student might make schools more academically competitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;re going to see the kids who didn&amp;#39;t care in high school and only went because they were forced to do the same in universities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If cost is less of a barrier, won&amp;#39;t that make admissions more competitive? Smart, hardworking kids who would not even bother applying to some schools due to the high tuition cost will be less financially limited, while the slacker kids will likely have even fewer options because there will be a larger applicant pool competing for a similar number of spots.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgdx4cz", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492483715.0, "created_utc": 1492454915.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wdqq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdstn2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "three-one-seven", "parent_id": "t3_65wdqq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Good jobs that at one time required no degree are becoming harder to get as education gets cheaper.\n\nEducation isn't getting cheaper, it's gotten disproportionately more expensive over the last few generations.
