As someone born and raised in England, but having come from families far, far away from here - and therefore having a non-English name - I think I'm pretty qualified to answer this. I don't know your personal circumstances i.e. your ethnic background and nationality, but I reckon you can only know what its like to be the child of a migrant family or 2nd/3rd gen migrant in a new culture and nation if you *are* one. \n\nI think your big mistake is that you refer to the coworker as Chinese. He doesn't speak Mandarin/Cantonese, only English, and I'm guessing acts American culturally in every facet of life. He is clearly *American* . There is a big grey area when it comes to people of ethnic minority backgrounds born in a new country about \"what\" they are. The answer is, they are whatever they feel they are. Regardless of him being American and presumably holding American citizenship, if he embraced his Chinese heritage and lived his life based on Chinese culture he could definitely claim to be Chinese. But he's clearly adopted the culture of the country he was presumably born and raised in. Similarly, I was born and raised in London (as you might gather from my username) and am proud of it. I don't know my grandparents mother tongue bar a few dozen words and phrases, I know what my name means and how to pronounce it but I feel as English as scones, changeable weather and penalty shootout disappointment. I know a fair bit about my family heritage i.e. food, culture etc etc, but it's not my own, as I was raised as English, despite being taught all this by my family. I respect it, but don't accept it - it would be false to claim it. \n\nIt just leads onto how far back you want to go to in claiming that's \"what\" you are. My grandparents came here in the 50's in their late twenties, and my parents for the most part grew up here; how far back should I be going to claim \"non-English-ness\"? Would it be weird for my future kids to consider themselves English if they were born and raised here? Grandkids? Eventually, somewhere down the line people assimilate into the culture around them. If I married an Aussie and moved there, my kids or at least grandkids would be Australian. It'd kill me, sure, but they would be. For instance, perhaps you're an American with German or Irish ancestry? Do you claim to be either? Do you know much about those cultures beyond superficially? Can you speak German/Gaelic? \n\nAs for specifically the names, firstly, parents choose those. They wouldn't know if their child would grow up to accept or reject or respect or ignore their heritage at the time of naming. I've grown to love the fact that I have a pretty unique name with an interesting history and meaning and its something I'm happy to have as a link to my heritage. But its not who I am, its just what I'm called. Ironically, my parents and grandparents generation, on both sides, all have English/western names but that's a whole other issue.\n\nSecondly, names are realistically chosen for what they sound like in relation to whom they're addressed and what they mean. I gather from what you say, you have a western name, but I guarantee its roots are a lot older than you might think and probably have a fairly complex root and meaning, most likely not tied to America.
