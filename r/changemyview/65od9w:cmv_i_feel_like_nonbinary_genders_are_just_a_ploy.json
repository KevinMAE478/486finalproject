I love citing this one particular video clip from Jackson Katz's Tough Guise, a documentary on toxic masculinity (though it predates the development of that term).

And while Katz's documentary focuses on masculinity, during the same period you can see an equal trend of hyper*feminization* in women's fashions, girl's toys, etc.  This is the same period in which \"waif chic\" developed, the same period that saw the pinkification of girl's toys, the rise of \"Princesses,\" etc.\n\nI think I have identified the \"something\" that Katz keeps going on about, and understand why Katz himself can't see it:  The something going on is *feminism*, and more specifically it's *genderqueering.*\n\nWhile genderqueering wasn't identified and labeled as such until Butler published Gender Trouble in 1990, the trends Butler sought to support were already very active in culture and had been for a good twenty years or more, as can be seen in the androgynous fashions of the 70s, and the masculinization of women's fashion in the 80's (in which the pseudo-masculinity of shoulder pads became the fad du jour).\n\nWe all know about gender *dysphoria*, but we rarely stop to consider it's necessary opposite: gender *euphoria*.  A rough definition of gender euphoria would be \" is an affective state in which a person experiences pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness stemming from the successful performance of gender.\"\n\nGenderqueering, by attacking and dismantling gender signifiers, complicates gender euphoria.  The less masculine and feminine signifiers there are, the harder and harder it becomes to successfully perform gender.\n\nIn the 1950s, all it took to perform masculinity successfully was to wear a suit, have a job, and keep your hair trimmed short.  Boom, easy peasy, no need to work hard at displaying your masculinity.\n\nBy the 1980s, women were wearing suits, working jobs, and trimming their hair short, which meant that a male person who did these things was not necessarily performing masculine gender -- he was performing gender neutrality, he was androgynous.\n\nSo where is the cisgendered person in this increasingly androgynous society supposed to turn for that sense of gender euphoria that makes him feel he is successfully performing as a man?  In *hypermasculinity*, which notably consists of a collection of traits that women cannot easily co-opt for themselves.  Huge, swollen muscles come much more easily to men than women.  Litheness comes more naturally to women.  Thus those with a strong tendency towards cisgender identification engage in increasingly harmful and counter-productive displays of gender *because these are the only options remaining*.\n\nIt almost seems to suggest that the optimal happiness of society would be best served by the authoritarian imposition of *trivial* gender signifiers.  Allow women to work for equal pay, but make it a criminal offense to wear slacks.  Allow men to be stay at home dads, but make it a criminal offense to grow your hair out more than three inches.  Women have equal rights to men, but mustaches are now mandated by law!\n\nI believe this would tamper the excesses of hypermasculinity and hyperfeminity.  Men would be able to point to their lip and say \"Obviously I'm a real man, I have a mustache!\" instead of living in constant state of anxiety over whether or not they are successfully performing gender.\n\nThat's why I think genderqueering is inherently wrong headed.  If gender is performative, then gender is also necessarily *communicative*, and if gender is communicative, then gender is a form of *language*.  And if some group of activists declared themselves *against language* and said that they were going to deliberately \"delimit the boundaries of human expression\" by \"queering\" language -- i.e. calling dogs \"cats\" to challenge the orthodoxical categorization of house pets -- you wouldn't call them \"language anarchists,\" you'd call them \"useless idiots who are just making everyone's lives more confusing and miserable.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does queer politics adequately describe gender, but fail to meaningfully disrupt it? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the question I find most interesting.

I can use analogies, but... I can tell. It's something I feel. I may not notice when I'm sliding back and forth between genders, but when I'm feeling more feminine, for example, I'm more likely to feel dysphoria about my body, because it's not feminine. I'm missing the 'right' plumbing, and I *expect* it to be there, so that can be a little jarring. I also write more when I'm tired, and that's supposed to be a more feminine trait as well.

It's a shift in expectation and perception, and that affects how I act and react to things.\n\nIt's like... suppose someone tossed a ball at you from your right side and if you were right handed, you'd probably catch it with your right hand. But if someone tossed that same ball at you from the left side, it might be awkward to catch it with your right hand, so you might use your left instead.\n\nThat's sort of how it goes with me. Whichever I feel is more or less how I act. Either way, I'm still myself. Oh, and interestingly enough, when I'm feeling more feminine, I know exactly what *size* my body is supposed to be, too... Unfortunately, joke's on me, I'm actually a bit taller than female me expects myself to be, so buying clothes to suit is often a hassle. It's like... I implicitly know my size and I keep trying to get things that fit myself, but then I have to remember to go up a size because der-herp, I'm actually a size bigger than that.\n\nAnd then I get home and I put my awesome, comfortable, soft new shirt on and I remember awww, crap, my shoulders are actually too broad for this or I'm gangly and too long for it and I feel like I look all weird. I feel right, it's just... Our bodies are containers for who we are, and when I'm feeling more feminine, I'm simply in an ill-fitting container.\n\nThat really bothers me sometimes, but I had to come to peace with the fact that I can never really transition; if I did, I'd be out a ton of money and a lot of effort to find myself male half the time and stuck in a female body, the opposite of where I am now. That wouldn't solve anything. The best I can shoot for is accepting that I will never have the right body, and maybe working for a vague androgyny. I figure if I can be sort of in the middle somewhere, maybe my dysphoria won't bother me so much.\n\nAgain, it can be kinda really frustrating, but it's the way I am, so I do the best I can. I'd really love it if it were safe for me to go out jogging in a skirt regularly, because they're so comfortable and convenient for walking or jogging, but it's just not safe around here to do that.

I implicitly know my size and I keep trying to get things that fit myself, but then I have to remember to go up a size because der-herp, I&amp;#39;m actually a size bigger than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I get home and I put my awesome, comfortable, soft new shirt on and I remember awww, crap, my shoulders are actually too broad for this or I&amp;#39;m gangly and too long for it and I feel like I look all weird. I feel right, it&amp;#39;s just... Our bodies are containers for who we are, and when I&amp;#39;m feeling more feminine, I&amp;#39;m simply in an ill-fitting container.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That really bothers me sometimes, but I had to come to peace with the fact that I can never really transition; if I did, I&amp;#39;d be out a ton of money and a lot of effort to find myself male half the time and stuck in a female body, the opposite of where I am now. That wouldn&amp;#39;t solve anything. The best I can shoot for is accepting that I will never have the right body, and maybe working for a vague androgyny. I figure if I can be sort of in the middle somewhere, maybe my dysphoria won&amp;#39;t bother me so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, it can be kinda really frustrating, but it&amp;#39;s the way I am, so I do the best I can. I&amp;#39;d really love it if it were safe for me to go out jogging in a skirt regularly, because they&amp;#39;re so comfortable and convenient for walking or jogging, but it&amp;#39;s just not safe around here to do that. I&amp;#39;m not hurting anyone, I just want to feel comfortable, but that&amp;#39;s not safe here. Hopefully things will be better in a few more years, maybe, or maybe I&amp;#39;ll finally be able to move somewhere better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgcbhsl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393413.0, "created_utc": 1492364613.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgca57q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "randomboutsof", "parent_id": "t1_dgc6cs9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can you elaborate on what you define as being male and being female?

Take the working class for example, shifts in workplaces and culture lead to an entire class of people with their own story, practices, culture and values.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgbwxqe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492367906.0, "created_utc": 1492339106.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od9w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcm5nd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "legallyhomo", "parent_id": "t1_dgclz35", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;You see the problem though?\n\n\n\nI do.

Trans person here :) Being transgender, at its core, is about gender dysphoria. This can be roughly split into physical and social dysphoria: physical is discomfort from the body (ie, having breasts makes me unhappy and uncomfortable), social is discomfort from social aspects of gender (ie, being called a man feels wrong and makes me feel out of place).\n\nA binary transgender person usually will both physically and socially desire to look, be treated as, and at their core /be/ the opposite gender from what they were assigned at birth. That one is pretty straightforward.\n\nNow to change focus for a second-\n\nSex is a combination of characteristics about the body: hormones, genitalia, chromosomes, gonads, secondary sex characteristics.

Trans person here :) Being transgender, at its core, is about gender dysphoria.
