I&amp;#39;m not saying that someone needs to feel pain to be a victim of violence, but I also find it difficult to equate actions outside the womb with the actions inside. For example, if you cut off oxygen to a fetus, it shuts down to conserve energy. If you cut off oxygen to a living baby, they thrash to try to open up the airway. I therefore find it hard to call something that would be clearly violent (dismemberment, etc) on a living person the same for a fetus that likely does not register the action&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg4tc9z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969130.0, "created_utc": 1491940330.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64snfj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vyed", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tualatin", "parent_id": "t1_dg4vn4m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; By the scientific definition of an organism, a sperm is most certainly an organism.\n\nUh, no.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the scientific definition of an organism, a sperm is most certainly an organism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uh, no.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dg4vyed", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972042.0, "created_utc": 1491943242.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vn4m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "garnteller", "parent_id": "t1_dg4qjzo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well what's the point then?
