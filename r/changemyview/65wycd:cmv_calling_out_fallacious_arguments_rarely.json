So what purpose is there in you repeating it? I don't disagree with it.\n\nYour view did seem to be just that.  In a lengthy set of comments, you've only generally alluded to your obligation to explain your reasoning behind declaring a fallacy.  Setting that aside, I've made the point  that the problem rests in the actual declaration of a fallacy - and that problem persists whether you explain or not.\n\nMaybe this will clarify: saying \"this is fallacious, here's why\" is an inherently combative, self-centered approach to a discussion that often precludes fully understanding an argument or position.  It's better to question specific ideas (as opposed to declaring them wrong) or make arguments for alternative positions.\n\n&gt;in my experience the contentious nature of the debates I'm participating in the fallacies are transparent, and after a few back and forths it is possible to know if a person is worth the charity.\n\nThat's also not how the [principle of charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) works.  It can and should be extended in any discussion where participants are hoping for mutual benefit.  A discussion without it turns into a pointless, partisan slapfight.\n\n&gt;I think this obscures the actual steps you laid out.\n\nI'm not sure how.  You seem to labor under the idea that when I'm talking about premises, I'm somehow referring to a flawed or fallen condition where a person believes that a fallacy is not actually a fallacy, but that's not the case.  I'm saying they believe something that changes the way you and they see the world.\n\nExample 1: over the course of Bob's life, he's been fairly successful attributing correlation to causation ~50% of the time.  Your rate of success had been much lower...say ~20%.  You and Bob discuss a topic and you see that he's much more comfortable attributing something to a correlated event.

In a lengthy set of comments, you&amp;#39;ve only generally alluded to your obligation to explain your reasoning behind declaring a fallacy.
