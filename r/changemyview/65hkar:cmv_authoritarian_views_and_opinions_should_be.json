But you can&amp;#39;t just psychically tell that authoritarianism is wrong. So really it&amp;#39;s that A: you personally think authoritarianism is wrong, and B: authoritarianism often wins in the marketplace of ideas. If you ban anything that follows these rules, you&amp;#39;re banning anything that&amp;#39;s not already popular from becoming popular. For all intents and purposes, you have completely abandoned the marketplace of ideas and have adopted authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do argue that it&amp;#39;s different because they&amp;#39;re perfectly okay with taking away your rights, but I don&amp;#39;t think that will really hold up. Suppose someone argues that you shouldn&amp;#39;t own slaves. You decide that if they&amp;#39;re okay with taking away your property, it would be fine for you to respond by taking their property and silence them by destroying everything owned by abolitionists. Someone argues that there is no god. You decide that if they&amp;#39;re okay with damning people to hell, then it&amp;#39;s fine if you take a comparatively minor action and murder them. Someone argues that Communism is bad. You decide that if they&amp;#39;re okay with abandoning the government, then the government should be free to abandon them, so it stops giving them food and they starve to death.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgb2bb6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492313679.0, "created_utc": 1492284879.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hkar", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagl59", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SegoliaFlak", "parent_id": "t3_65hkar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't understand your position\n\nFrom what I follow - you believe every person has some set of inalienable rights, among which is (presumably) the right to maintain and act upon their own opinions and views without fear of institutional persecution - arrest, censorship etc. (i.e free speech).
