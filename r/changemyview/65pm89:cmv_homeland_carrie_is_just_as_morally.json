We could interpret Carrie's choice as a sign that she loved him. Maybe, in her own way, she did. But, looking back, I think this could actually be considered a selfish act. Dar basically told her that Quinn's worst nightmare was losing his mind or suffering from brain damage. Some of Quinn's greatest strengths were his intelligence and keen foresight. Carrie knew that he would suffer from major brain damage if she fought to keep him alive, yet she did it anyway. What goal did she seek by saving him? For all she knew, he would never work alongside her in the CIA again or have the life he wanted. What she told the therapist was key: she couldn't let another one (like Brody) die. By waking him up prematurely and prompting his near-fatal stroke, she was leading another person close to her to his death. She felt guilty, and maybe she loved him. But, if she loved him, then it's interesting that she never told him that. You'd think that would be something that would come up at some point after he woke up, or maybe after he was living with her, or maybe at that flag house. Although he was clearly under duress and was perhaps trying to convince Quinn to spare his life, Dar had no problem telling Quinn he loved him in episode 9, and it's interestingly the last thing he ever told him.\n\nRegarding Dar's part in the conspiracy, I do not think he was knowledgeable of or on board with the plan to assassinate Keane. He told Saul in prison that he had never intended for things to get so dark. Plus, I actually don't think he hated Keane as much as the other conspirators did. For instance, he hesitated for a bit when O'Keefe first showed him the edited video of Keane's son. Dar initially mentioned that he was confused/concerned because Keane's son wasn't running away; he was running to help people. A small moment, but this was the first instance in which I thought he wasn't as diabolical as the others. Dar's main objective, in my view, was for Keane to back off of her pacifist demilitarization plan that was largely hostile to the CIA. I think they framed Sekou Bah for the bombing and staged the whole thing so that they could convince Keane that Islamic terrorism was still a threat to Americans and to her specifically. Furthermore, the point of the Mossad plan was for the conspirators to convince Keane to impose sanctions on Iran and to maybe start making plans to revisit or axe the deal.

I especially got this sense after seeing the viewer responses to 6.12. Some were upset that Carrie \"let Quinn go\" and did not mourn him in a way that seemed genuine or necessary.
