Originally, anti-abortion laws were less about protecting unborn life and more about prohibiting what was viewed as impermissible sex.  In Victorian times, the only sex that was morally permissible was sex for procreation.  Having sex just for fun was considered to be a sin (even if you were married!).  So laws against abortion were in the same vein as laws against birth control: if you weren't having sex for the purpose of making a baby, you were sinning and this should be prohibited.  If you did have sex for fun and got pregnant, there should be consequences.\n\nThis tradition was sexist because the burden and blame of prohibited sex fell more onto women than men, both in the sense that women received more difficulty and struggle from unplanned pregnancies and faced more social stigma, and also in the sense that it was viewed as more of a sin for a woman to have impermissible sex than a man.  The moral burden of stopping bad sex fell more onto women than men.\n\nWhile these Victorian ideals have died to a certain extent, many remnants are still present in our society.  For example, having sex for fun / before marriage is generally accepted in our society, but there's a question of degree that punishes women more than men (ie, man having a lot of casual sex is a player, woman having a lot of casual sex is a slut, etc).\n\nThe idea that a fetus or even a zygote was a human being did not really exist in these times.  In many traditions in many cultures, babies were not considered human until some time *after* they were born, for example I believe in the Jewish tradition babies were not considered to have a soul until they had been born for a year.  This is because used to babies died early on often, and therefore you weren't considered a full person until you had passed a certain threshold.\n\nSo originally, the anti-abortion laws weren't about the fetus being a human life, they were about proscribing impermissible immoral sex, which punished women much more than men.\n\nFast forward to today - many people earnestly believe that the fetus is  a human being.  I'm sympathetic to this position, though I have a hard time understanding to a certain point - I think a fertilized embryo is pretty clearly not a \"human being\" or  \"baby,\" but I understand that many people earnestly believe this to be true. \n\nThe modern religious anti-abortion movement is tied to these original Victorian ideals about sex.  The mainstream anti-abortion movement is against birth control and sex ed just as much as it is against abortion.\n\nI think abortion is something that should be limited.  An abortion is a sad event.  But, the best proven way of decreasing abortion rates is providing easy access to birth control, combined with accurate sex education information.  Making abortion illegal does not really decrease abortion rates; it just increases the rate of unsafe, at home or black market abortions.\n\nIf someone today is \"pro-life\" but also supports providing affordable birth control and accurate sex education to people of reproducing age, then I don't think that's problematic.  I still believe abortion should be an option for people who make mistakes, but if someone earnestly believes the fetus is a life and wants to protect fetuses, I think that's ok and not \"sexist\" if they are ok with the most effective means of achieving that end: birth control and sex ed.\n\nHowever, when people are \"pro-life\" but also against birth control and sex education, I think these views are inherently sexist.  The individual person might not think of it as a gender issue, and I can grant that they sincerely believe that, but to be anti-abortion and also anti-BC is participating in a long sexist tradition of punishing people, but especially women, for having sex. \n\nIt also makes me question the sincerity of the \"abortion is murder\" belief - if you really thought people were being murdered, and you knew that the best way to prevent the murder was to give men and women access to birth control, why wouldn't you?  Even if you think non-procreative sex is immoral, surely it's better than murder? Unless you think non-procreative sex is the big issue to begin with, which again I think is sort of an inherently sexist idea since women are almost always punished more than men. \n\nSo that's how I feel about it - being \"anti-abortion\" in itself I don't think is sexist, but I think the history of the movement and also many people who support the mainstream movement are sexist.

Even if you think non-procreative sex is immoral, surely it&amp;#39;s better than murder? Unless you think non-procreative sex is the big issue to begin with, which again I think is sort of an inherently sexist idea since women are almost always punished more than men. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s how I feel about it - being &amp;quot;anti-abortion&amp;quot; in itself I don&amp;#39;t think is sexist, but I think the history of the movement and also many people who support the mainstream movement are sexist.  But it is possible I think to be &amp;quot;pro-life&amp;quot; and not sexist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dgcaeol", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492391979.0, "created_utc": 1492363179.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jy88", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jy88", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbji6u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Grunt08", "parent_id": "t1_dgb8e16", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry weakbackhanderer, your comment has been removed:\n\n&gt; Comment Rule 1\\. \"Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP\u2019s current view (however minor), unless they are asking a clarifying question.
