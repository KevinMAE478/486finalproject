And the best sentence for such an individual would be to grant them a greater awareness of the suffering they cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where I do see clear connections between animal abuse, and relatively dangerous crime-prone people -- there is an even subtler realm to acknowledge of people who commit suffering to non-sentient things like the environment as a whole, or non-expressive living entities like trees. They too should be considered lacking of some pivotal aspect of being a living being because they can&amp;#39;t see the world outside of themselves. They live an illusion where pain doesn&amp;#39;t exist outside of their own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is such a subtle nuance, and one that is extremely difficult to explain to people in general because most people have never been educated to see the world outside of their own suffering. The &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way I&amp;#39;ve discovered is to teach awareness.
