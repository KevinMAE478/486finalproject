That seems to fit what I&amp;#39;m hearing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After Googling rhotacism, I found this, which seems to fit better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is the sound you&amp;#39;re making for most of them (the labiodental approximant). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, when speaking Spanish, I&amp;#39;ve had native Spanish speakers struggle to understand, which could be just my poor pronunciation, but I suspect they would find it easier to understand the standard English r,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Spanish &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; (both of them) and the English &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; (all of them) have nothing to do with one another.  They are not related sounds, they just use the same letter when writing.  Your speech impediment has nothing to do with Spanish Rs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;80-90% of the Rs in Spanish are NOT trilled.  It is an alveolar tap, identical in every way to how a North American pronounces the &amp;quot;t&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;d&amp;quot; in latter/ladder.  But even in your dialect it is still closer to a &amp;quot;t&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;d&amp;quot; than it is an &amp;quot;r.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to say a word like &amp;quot;caro&amp;quot; with an English &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; is going to be hard to understand for a Spanish speaker (even if your English r&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;impeded.&amp;quot;).  If you pronounce it closer to &amp;quot;cado&amp;quot; it will be easier to understand.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.
