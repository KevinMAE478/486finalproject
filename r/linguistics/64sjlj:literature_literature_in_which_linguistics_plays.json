Read this book. A linguistics professor of mine recommended it to me when I was at university. It&amp;#39;s fascinating. It&amp;#39;s very Burgess, and uses linguistics as a framework for the storytelling. I don&amp;#39;t want to give too much away, of course, but it feels like this thread is made for this novel.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: while we&amp;#39;re here, there&amp;#39;s a good deal of Burgess and also Nabokov which uses linguistics either as a theme or a framework. They both were interested in language and in linguistics (Burgess being a linguist proper and Nabokov a philologist and polyglot) and it comes across in their work. Just dive in beyond their big novels (A Clockwork Orange and Lolita respectively) and you&amp;#39;ll find a whole new world of words and language. Fascinating stuff by masters of the craft. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linguistics", "name": "t1_dg5bm2l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491992129.0, "created_utc": 1491963329.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sjlj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5caih", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "everything_is_still", "parent_id": "t3_64sjlj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linguistics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"The Telling\" by Ursula K.
