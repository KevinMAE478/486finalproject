In modern Finnish it's just \"Uusi Testamentti\".\n\nExample of his translation from The New Testament:\n\nToinen Lucu.\nMatt 2:1 Cosca sis Jesus syndynyt oli Bethlehemis Judea' maalla/ Kuningan Herodesen aica' / Catzo / silloin tulit Tieteijet idheste Jerusalemijn / Ja sanoit\nMatt 2:2 Cussa ombi se esken syndynyt Judain Kuningas?

The southwestern dialects of Finnish drop the final N in many words, so &amp;quot;h\u00e4nen&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Juudean&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aikaan&amp;quot; in modern southwestern Finnish would be &amp;quot;h\u00e4ne&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Juudea&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aikaa&amp;quot;. The influence of southwestern dialects has since greatly decreased in the way Finnish is written.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Stemming from this old way of writing Finnish, modern Finns sometimes write w instead of v to humorously emphasize something is old.
