They may switch to a certain language to mark a change in tone or in topic. They may switch to maintain a level of privacy. They may switch because a joke only makes sense in the other language or because a switch at the right moment provides a bilingual pun.

It's also more common for a stretch of words to be code-switched if they form a constituent than if they don't (that is, looking at the last sentence, it's much more likely that *form a constituent* would be a switch into another language than *than if they*). And it's much more common for conjunctions, tag questions, interjections, and discourse markers (that is, things that stand outside or on the edge of clauses) to be code-switched than any other parts of the sentence.

Our language has 19 initial consonants (all voiceless except sonorants), 54 (+6) rimes and 6 tones, which don\u2019t quite map with the English sound inventory; we corrupt the pronunciation and borrow the words anyway. Take a look at the following example and its pure-Cantonese equivalents:\n\n\n    * CALL (vt) [k\u0254:\u02e5] to phone someone\n    Derived from the English verb \"to call\", in the sense of calling someone on a phone call.\n    \n    \u9072    \u5572        CALL  \u8fd4    \u4f60   \u5440\n    late  adv-COMP  call  back  you  FP_ASS\n    \"I'll call you back later.\" (6 syllables)\n    \n    Compare:\n\t\n    \u9072    \u5572        \u6253    \u8fd4   \u96fb\u8a71       \u4ffe        \u4f60   \u5440\n    late  adv-COMP  call  back telephone  ACC.PART  you  FP_ASS\n\t(9 syllables)\n\t\n    \u9072    \u5572        \u6253-\u8fd4-\u4ffe             \u4f60   \u5440\n    late  adv-COMP  hit-back-ACC.PART   you  FP_ASS\n\t(Abbreviated from the above; 7 syllables)\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n    hou2ci5  tung4  keoi5   DEBATE  gam,\n    seems    P      he/she  debate  PRT\n    'beibei' haa5 doul  mou5  sam1geil\n    debate   ASP  ADV   NEG   mood\n    (reduplication, phonologically assimilated)\n    \"It seems like I was debating with him.\n    I was in no mood to debate with him.\" (Chan, 1998)\n\n\nThe book chapter \"How Does Cantonese-English Code-Mixing Work?\" (see references) has an in-depth analysis on the code-mixing techniques used in Hong Kong Cantonese. As a native speaker, though, I say we code-mix instead of using the native words basically because of these reasons:\n\n* Some words are much clunky than their English counterparts... or at least what is left of the counterparts after serious corruption in pronunciation (and perhaps meaning).\n* We find prepositions and relative pronouns to be easy getaways with complicated sentence structures.\n\nClunkiness and sentence structures aside, there are sociolinguistic factors at work here. Hong Kong was a British colony; the city itself is considered bilingual, while in reality it is a disglossia: English is the high variety, while Cantonese is the low variety (sometimes both). English is taught in education, and dominates the realm of tertiary education. But since English is regarded as a tongue for the elites, professionals and the learned, most students are unable to use English proficiently, but are still able to use English to some extent, and understand code-mixed English words. Slipping English words and sentence structures in your daily speech is a way to show off (which doesn't remotely correlate with proficiency; also overdoing that shows arrogance), although this has been less so since more and more of the populace are taught English as part of their education. The populace being half-proficient at English is one of the reasons why code-mixing happens in Hong Kong.\n\nRecently there have been questions on the identity of Hongkongers (which is a political minefield that I dare not step into), and code-mixing has become something to identify ourselves with. Although English is the high variety in diglossic Hong Kong, nearly everything seen in public is bilingual; every Hongkonger grows up in contact with both Chinese and English, and taught both languages - such extensive degree of exposure to English, and the resulting intensive use of code-mixing, is what makes Hong Kong stand out from other regions: we don't speak like other Cantonese-speaking regions. In fact, if you encounter a Cantonese speaker speaking Cantonese with a great deal of English words popping out here and there, they are most certainly from Hong Kong. And that ultimately means code-mixing is something to identify ourselves and to be part of the local culture.\n\nIn all, we code-mix because we want to speak fluently; because we want to borrow their meaning; because we want to prove ourselves to be able to speak it; and - transcending all other reasons - because that's what make us Hongkongers.\n\t\n\nREFERENCE\nChan, B.H.S.

Take a look at the following example and its pure-Cantonese equivalents:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* CALL (vt) [k\u0254:\u02e5] to phone someone\nDerived from the English verb &amp;quot;to call&amp;quot;, in the sense of calling someone on a phone call.\n\n\u9072    \u5572        CALL  \u8fd4    \u4f60   \u5440\nlate  adv-COMP  call  back  you  FP_ASS\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll call you back later.&amp;quot; (6 syllables)\n\nCompare:\n\n\u9072    \u5572        \u6253    \u8fd4   \u96fb\u8a71       \u4ffe        \u4f60   \u5440\nlate  adv-COMP  call  back telephone  ACC.PART  you  FP_ASS\n(9 syllables)\n\n\u9072    \u5572        \u6253-\u8fd4-\u4ffe             \u4f60   \u5440\nlate  adv-COMP  hit-back-ACC.PART   you  FP_ASS\n(Abbreviated from the above; 7 syllables)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hou2ci5  tung4  keoi5   DEBATE  gam,\nseems    P      he/she  debate  PRT\n&amp;#39;beibei&amp;#39; haa5 doul  mou5  sam1geil\ndebate   ASP  ADV   NEG   mood\n(reduplication, phonologically assimilated)\n&amp;quot;It seems like I was debating with him.\nI was in no mood to debate with him.&amp;quot; (Chan, 1998)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The book chapter &amp;quot;How Does Cantonese-English Code-Mixing Work?&amp;quot; (see references) has an in-depth analysis on the code-mixing techniques used in Hong Kong Cantonese. As a native speaker, though, I say we code-mix instead of using the native words basically because of these reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some words are much clunky than their English counterparts... or at least what is left of the counterparts after serious corruption in pronunciation (and perhaps meaning).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We find prepositions and relative pronouns to be easy getaways with complicated sentence structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clunkiness and sentence structures aside, there are sociolinguistic factors at work here. Hong Kong was a British colony; the city itself is considered bilingual, while in reality it is a disglossia: English is the high variety, while Cantonese is the low variety (sometimes both). English is taught in education, and dominates the realm of tertiary education. But since English is regarded as a tongue for the elites, professionals and the learned, most students are unable to use English proficiently, but are still able to use English to some extent, and understand code-mixed English words. Slipping English words and sentence structures in your daily speech is a way to show off (which doesn&amp;#39;t remotely correlate with proficiency; also overdoing that shows arrogance), although this has been less so since more and more of the populace are taught English as part of their education. The populace being half-proficient at English is one of the reasons why code-mixing happens in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently there have been questions on the identity of Hongkongers (which is a political minefield that I dare not step into), and code-mixing has become something to identify ourselves with. Although English is the high variety in diglossic Hong Kong, nearly everything seen in public is bilingual; every Hongkonger grows up in contact with both Chinese and English, and taught both languages - such extensive degree of exposure to English, and the resulting intensive use of code-mixing, is what makes Hong Kong stand out from other regions: we don&amp;#39;t speak like other Cantonese-speaking regions. In fact, if you encounter a Cantonese speaker speaking Cantonese with a great deal of English words popping out here and there, they are most certainly from Hong Kong. And that ultimately means code-mixing is something to identify ourselves and to be part of the local culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all, we code-mix because we want to speak fluently; because we want to borrow their meaning; because we want to prove ourselves to be able to speak it; and - transcending all other reasons - because that&amp;#39;s what make us Hongkongers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REFERENCE\nChan, B.H.S.
