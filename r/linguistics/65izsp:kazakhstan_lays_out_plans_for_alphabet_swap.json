It has the massive added advantage of being almost entirely uniform across all major Indian languages.\n\nHere's an example - http://sseas.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/faculty/files/wentworth_chapter_7.pdf", "edited": 1492326012.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could easily use a modified form of IAST for Tamil.

It&amp;#39;s not taught as part of the Tamil script nor does anybody use it in day to day writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plus \u0bb9\u0bcd represents /h/ even if it&amp;#39;s not in native Tamil words. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True. IAST&amp;#39;s dots underneath retroflex consonants would work in Tamil just fine. It&amp;#39;s the transliteration scheme I&amp;#39;ve seen used in academic works. Also, /h/ might not be native to Tamil but it&amp;#39;s pretty commonly used, at least in Chennai, because many Tamil people have names that begin with the sound, and because plenty of English loanwords and cultural terms use it too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally think using &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; to distinguish dental sounds from retroflex sounds is pretty inefficient, plus more importantly, it breaks the otherwise completely pan Indic transliteration uniformity of IAST/modified IAST, something that includes other Dravidian languages like Kannada and Malayalam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, modified IAST is already used as the de facto standard in Indic transliteration when it comes to stuff like grammars, some linguistic works (Masica&amp;#39;s book on IA languages uses this), and even works on Indology (works written and edited by Sheldon Pollock) and history.
