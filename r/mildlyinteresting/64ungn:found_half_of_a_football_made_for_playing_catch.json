I had no intention of writing a novel about this silly game, but, here we are. The gist of the game is, the ladder is set up like a target with different areas counting as different amounts of yards. I have to hit the targets to score touchdowns.**\n\nI will preface this by saying that this game was born out of necessity. For years I have played flag football on the weekends, but in July I ruptured my calf muscle and haven't been able to run fully since. So, after I was off my crutches, I invented this game to pass the time. And now, I just play it because I legitimately have a good time. I come in and recap the game for my girlfriend. I tell her about my last second heroics, or a crushing loss. She frankly, couldn't care less. But she is nice and humors me anyway. \n\n**Onto the game.** \n\nI set up the ladder about 15 yards away. It is a 5 rung step ladder that tapers from the bottom to the top. I have 4 footballs that I start with that range in quality. I have one standard Wilson \"The Duke\" football and three others of different sizes and weights. (This is just because these are what I had lying around, but I actually like having to throw them all differently).  \n\nI have two versions of the game. One where I set my timer for 30 minutes (this game was also born out of the fact that after hobbling around on crutches, I needed to get my heart pumping again) and score as many touchdowns as possible, and then a quick one where I have 2 minutes to score a touchdown (for a quick game). \n\nI'll explain the 30 minute game, because after knowing how it works, the 2 minute drill is self explanatory. \n\nMy scenario changes from time to time, but typically, I am a back up quarterback getting my big break. Our team has played horribly in the first half, and we are down 35 to nothing. The coach puts me in at halftime and I have to lead my team to victory. (I like to add a bit of drama to the game). \n\n**Offense** \n\nI start off on the 20 yard line and start tossing the balls. If I hit any rung or the front edges of the ladder, that is 5 yards (and it has to make solid contact, a graze is incomplete), and passing it through any rung earns you a designated number of yards (see the [picture](http://imgur.com/a/Uj9HY) for details). Like in football, I have 4 downs (because why would I punt?) to move 10 yards. And eventually I have to throw a touchdown. \n\n**Scoring**\n\nPretty simple so far, but the game has become more complex as I have played over the months. For example, I have to throw the touchdown the exact right number of yards. So, if I am on the 15 yard line, I can\u2019t throw any of the targets that are worth more than 15 yards. I have to throw a 10 and a 5, or three 5\u2019s etc. I figured that was fair because in real football offense gets harder when you\u2019re in the red zone. Your available field gets smaller and smaller. If I and on the 15 yard line and I accidentally make it in the 20 yard line rung, it is an incomplete pass, loss of down. \n\n**Penalties**\n\nThere are a couple of areas right outside the ladder that, if I hit them, it counts as a penalty. 5 yard loss, repeat the down. There are also a couple areas that count as interceptions (again, see the pic for details). You can also be penalized for delay of game. Once you throw your 4 balls you have 40 seconds to run across the yard and gather all 4 balls, and adjust the ladder if need be (it gets knocked closed a lot), and make it back to start your next play. \n\n**Hail Mary**\n\nThe top number of yards you can score on one pass is 50, which is the top rung of the ladder, but there is always the opportunity for a Hail Mary. The particular ladder I have has one of those \u201cpaint bucket\u201d steps at the top. It acts a basket and if a ball lands perfectly in there without falling out, it counts as an automatic touchdown. \n\n**Broken plays**\n\nThe last weird little quirk is, if you hit the ladder and it bounces back across the line of scrimmage (for me, its the edge of the cement on my patio where I throw from, it is a broken play. I have 5 seconds to pick the ball back up and throw it again. For this play you get to add your first and second throws together and move that many yards down the field. \n\n**Defense**\n\nOk. Let\u2019s say you score a touchdown, or turn the ball over. Well, now it\u2019s time for the defense to take their stand. You play the same way you play offense, but you have four downs to hit the ladder four times, or any other combination that equals 20 yards. I have no idea why I added these rules, but there they are. If you don\u2019t get 20 yards, that means they got a first down and you have to add the number of yards you missed by to your next 4 balls. \n\nExamples 1: You throw 4 balls and only hit the ladder 3 times totaling 15 yards. So, now you add 5 yards to your next round, so you have 4 balls to total 25 yards. Once you surpass your goal, that counts as a defensive stop and you get the ball back. If you don\u2019t stop them in 4 rounds, they score. \n\nExample 2: On your first ball you go through the 20 yard rung, so it only took 1 ball to make your defensive stop. That counts as an interception and you get to use the remaining 3 balls to see how far you return it. How ever many yards you accumulate, you add those to 20 (where you would start normally) and thats where you start your next offensive possession. \n\nI think that\u2019s it. Other than that, I always do like to have a two minute drill at the end, so my first possession after the clock rolls past 28 minutes, starts the two minute drill. I have whatever time is left to come down and score. If I do it with fewer than 20 seconds on the clock, I win the game. If I leave more than 30 seconds on the clock, I have to make one more defensive stand to win. This is what leads to those stories that my girlfriend loves hearing when I come back inside. \n\nI know this game is needlessly complicated, but it has honestly been a lot of fun and a lot more challenging than just tossing the ball at a target. having the ability for the other team score adds one more layer of challenges and adding penalties lead to some 3rd and 25 situations that you have to find a way out of. It brings this fella a lot of good times. \n\n\n**edit** I forgot one more scenario. If there is a discrepancy, like if I can't tell which rung the ball went through or if the pass was completed, I can call for a **booth review**. Basically I have to throw whichever ball onto the roof and let it roll back down. I can't see where the ball is until it rolls back off, so I have a split second to react and try to catch it. If I catch it, I win the challenge. If not, I lose.  Ok, I'm pretty sure that's it. ", "edited": 1491990767.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: I\u2019m adding this at the top because there are many people who have no interest in reading the ramblings of a weirdo, and that\u2019s ok. I had no intention of writing a novel about this silly game, but, here we are. The gist of the game is, the ladder is set up like a target with different areas counting as different amounts of yards. I have to hit the targets to score touchdowns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will preface this by saying that this game was born out of necessity. For years I have played flag football on the weekends, but in July I ruptured my calf muscle and haven&amp;#39;t been able to run fully since. So, after I was off my crutches, I invented this game to pass the time. And now, I just play it because I legitimately have a good time. I come in and recap the game for my girlfriend. I tell her about my last second heroics, or a crushing loss. She frankly, couldn&amp;#39;t care less. But she is nice and humors me anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onto the game.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set up the ladder about 15 yards away. It is a 5 rung step ladder that tapers from the bottom to the top. I have 4 footballs that I start with that range in quality. I have one standard Wilson &amp;quot;The Duke&amp;quot; football and three others of different sizes and weights. (This is just because these are what I had lying around, but I actually like having to throw them all differently).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have two versions of the game. One where I set my timer for 30 minutes (this game was also born out of the fact that after hobbling around on crutches, I needed to get my heart pumping again) and score as many touchdowns as possible, and then a quick one where I have 2 minutes to score a touchdown (for a quick game). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll explain the 30 minute game, because after knowing how it works, the 2 minute drill is self explanatory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My scenario changes from time to time, but typically, I am a back up quarterback getting my big break. Our team has played horribly in the first half, and we are down 35 to nothing. The coach puts me in at halftime and I have to lead my team to victory. (I like to add a bit of drama to the game). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offense&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start off on the 20 yard line and start tossing the balls. If I hit any rung or the front edges of the ladder, that is 5 yards (and it has to make solid contact, a graze is incomplete), and passing it through any rung earns you a designated number of yards (see the &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Uj9HY\"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; for details). Like in football, I have 4 downs (because why would I punt?) to move 10 yards. And eventually I have to throw a touchdown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple so far, but the game has become more complex as I have played over the months. For example, I have to throw the touchdown the exact right number of yards. So, if I am on the 15 yard line, I can\u2019t throw any of the targets that are worth more than 15 yards. I have to throw a 10 and a 5, or three 5\u2019s etc. I figured that was fair because in real football offense gets harder when you\u2019re in the red zone. Your available field gets smaller and smaller. If I and on the 15 yard line and I accidentally make it in the 20 yard line rung, it is an incomplete pass, loss of down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penalties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of areas right outside the ladder that, if I hit them, it counts as a penalty. 5 yard loss, repeat the down. There are also a couple areas that count as interceptions (again, see the pic for details). You can also be penalized for delay of game. Once you throw your 4 balls you have 40 seconds to run across the yard and gather all 4 balls, and adjust the ladder if need be (it gets knocked closed a lot), and make it back to start your next play. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hail Mary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The top number of yards you can score on one pass is 50, which is the top rung of the ladder, but there is always the opportunity for a Hail Mary. The particular ladder I have has one of those \u201cpaint bucket\u201d steps at the top. It acts a basket and if a ball lands perfectly in there without falling out, it counts as an automatic touchdown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken plays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last weird little quirk is, if you hit the ladder and it bounces back across the line of scrimmage (for me, its the edge of the cement on my patio where I throw from, it is a broken play. I have 5 seconds to pick the ball back up and throw it again. For this play you get to add your first and second throws together and move that many yards down the field. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. Let\u2019s say you score a touchdown, or turn the ball over. Well, now it\u2019s time for the defense to take their stand. You play the same way you play offense, but you have four downs to hit the ladder four times, or any other combination that equals 20 yards. I have no idea why I added these rules, but there they are. If you don\u2019t get 20 yards, that means they got a first down and you have to add the number of yards you missed by to your next 4 balls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Examples 1: You throw 4 balls and only hit the ladder 3 times totaling 15 yards. So, now you add 5 yards to your next round, so you have 4 balls to total 25 yards. Once you surpass your goal, that counts as a defensive stop and you get the ball back. If you don\u2019t stop them in 4 rounds, they score. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example 2: On your first ball you go through the 20 yard rung, so it only took 1 ball to make your defensive stop. That counts as an interception and you get to use the remaining 3 balls to see how far you return it. How ever many yards you accumulate, you add those to 20 (where you would start normally) and thats where you start your next offensive possession. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that\u2019s it. Other than that, I always do like to have a two minute drill at the end, so my first possession after the clock rolls past 28 minutes, starts the two minute drill. I have whatever time is left to come down and score. If I do it with fewer than 20 seconds on the clock, I win the game. If I leave more than 30 seconds on the clock, I have to make one more defensive stand to win. This is what leads to those stories that my girlfriend loves hearing when I come back inside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this game is needlessly complicated, but it has honestly been a lot of fun and a lot more challenging than just tossing the ball at a target. having the ability for the other team score adds one more layer of challenges and adding penalties lead to some 3rd and 25 situations that you have to find a way out of. It brings this fella a lot of good times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot one more scenario. If there is a discrepancy, like if I can&amp;#39;t tell which rung the ball went through or if the pass was completed, I can call for a &lt;strong&gt;booth review&lt;/strong&gt;. Basically I have to throw whichever ball onto the roof and let it roll back down. I can&amp;#39;t see where the ball is until it rolls back off, so I have a split second to react and try to catch it. If I catch it, I win the challenge. If not, I lose.  Ok, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that&amp;#39;s it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "mildlyinteresting", "name": "t1_dg5o47w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492017960.0, "created_utc": 1491989160.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 135}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5mea6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IsYouWitItYaBish", "parent_id": "t1_dg5m183", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mildlyinteresting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Please explain the 2 minute drill game!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please explain the 2 minute drill game!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "mildlyinteresting", "name": "t1_dg5mea6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492012582.0, "created_utc": 1491983782.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ti4h", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ungn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5srwv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xixi2", "parent_id": "t1_dg5m183", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mildlyinteresting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The number of tennis balls I lost as a kid into the neighbor's yard was ungodly.... like they'd go over there, I'd climb the fence and the ball was just gone :|", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of tennis balls I lost as a kid into the neighbor&amp;#39;s yard was ungodly.... like they&amp;#39;d go over there, I&amp;#39;d climb the fence and the ball was just gone :|&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "mildlyinteresting", "name": "t1_dg5srwv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492029429.0, "created_utc": 1492000629.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ti4h", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ungn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ti4h", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ungn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6q9c6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jerrymeyers11", "parent_id": "t1_dg5w1sq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mildlyinteresting", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Murdaball\"?

I came here to describe it, but you basically already did lol. The main difference was that ours involves throwing at different heights on a brick wall, and special \"save catches\" that could be made on the bounce back when you missed the target. Our game rules were made around this random ball we found one day.

Yeah, I don't expect anyone to get this. Anyway, we have to play this game for millions of fans around the world who watch us play for our lives, sort of like blade runner, but on a basketball court. It's actually incredibly difficult and physically demanding. \n\nThe game itself is taxing enough. But it's the scoring system that kills you. Each possible point starts with one player shooting a 3. If he makes it, great. 1 point. If he misses, you have a chance to make a shot as long as it doesn't ever touch the paint, or roll out of bounds. Airballs are instant death. Put-backs are allowed, but you can never stand in the paint with the ball. Everything in the paint must be airborne. Passing is only allowed in the form of a fake air ball that must be caught while you are airborne and released before you hit the ground. This forces some pretty wonky and acrobatic shots at times, and you're constantly scrambling with just two people to cover the entire court. Getting a hot hand from the 3-point line is extremely useful, not only for scoring, but to give your team much needed rest. Sometimes when it bounces into a corner, you'll play a sort of hot-potato with it where you take turns hopping and tossing it back to each other until you make you way back to the goal for a shot.\n\nThe scoring works like this... As you advance in rounds, you require more points to advance, and you are allowed to mess up (have a booboo) more times per round. Any \"booboos\" you don't use carry over to the next round. All made shots are worth 1 point each until the final round when 3's are worth 2.\n\nRound 1: 7pts (no booboos)\n\nRound 2: 10pts (1 booboo)\n\nRound 3: 20pts (2 booboos)\n\nRound 4: 40pts (3 booboos)\n\nRound 5: 80pts (4 booboos and 3-pointers are now worth 2 points)\n\nIn almost 5 years of playing this game regularly, we've only gone the distance 3 times. And it has felt like a championship each time. You're utterly exhausted when you complete it. If you fail, you start back over at round one and switch the three point shooter. So sometimes we complete it after attempting and failing 3-4 times.. When you go out to \"murdaball\" it's not like you can keep trying until you succeed. You shooting percentage doesn't matter that much. The hustle is what saves you in the end. If you miss that one that boinks out of bounds, you're toast. If you manage to desperately throw it back in bounds before it goes, you're still alive to shoot again. You keep trying until you succeed, or you're too exhausted to continue, and you're forced to stop trying. We only allow ourselves water breaks after round 2 and 4.\n\nWhenever we have a dispute over a ruling on the court (was that actually in the paint or not. Were you still off your feet when you released it? etc...) we appeal to the imaginary warden of the jail, only known as \"the commish\", to give us a final ruling. We take turns playing \"commish\" when we have to make a ruling on a close call. For some reason the commish has a thick German accent. Maybe that's why he's so strict on the rules. 99% of his rulings end in execution. There's very little leeway. Occasionally, when we fail spectacularly, but show great effort, he'll grant us one half court shot. If we make it, we get a redo. No free points. Ever. If you miss the half court shot, you're \"killed,\" and we assume the identity of the next two condemned men.\n\nAgain, we're in our thirties. I don't expect anyone to understand any of this. But I thought you might kinda get it. We've been making stupid games like this up since we were kids. Why stop now?\n\ntl;dr: My nephew and I have created, and continue to play into our thirties, an overly elaborate basketball game that's a combination of hot potato, 21, and 'don't touch the lava on the floor' which, in our heads, takes place in something like a Nazi gladiator death camp.\n\nEdit: This game is in no way based on [Escape from LA,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGjfoVHFAuM) but to be honest, that's pretty much what it's like in my head when we play.
