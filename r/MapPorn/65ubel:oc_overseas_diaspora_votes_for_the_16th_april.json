Most of them did only come for a year or two and then went back, but the Turkish economy was not doing well in the 70s, so the Gastarbeiter in Western Europe at the time stayed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it was originally a temporary idea, no need for integration was presumed (the idea was-- you don&amp;#39;t need to speak German to paint a house or work in the factories). Couple the temporary nature with the fact that the people that came were by-and-large already lower-educated, poorer and conservative, you&amp;#39;re likely not going to see a personal need to integrate either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course it ended up being a problem when they couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs back in Turkey and decided to stay here; and by that time, they were already living in neighborhoods and communities built by and around other Gastarbeiter where everything was conducted in Turkish, so there was still no real need from their perspective to integrate. The idea to handle this was to wait for the next generation kids to come, but now we&amp;#39;re seeing them identify more as Turkish than as German, even though they were born here-- with many reluctant to accept citizenship because they don&amp;#39;t feel German. At least they speak the language and grew up going to school in an integrated setting, but there still needs to be more work done on both sides. The idea of Germany/Netherlands as a &amp;quot;melting pot&amp;quot; is still really new and it&amp;#39;ll take time to accept that a German can be named Mehmet and be a Muslim. This attitude also hinders integration, but from the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, this is a very complicated issue, and it&amp;#39;s clear that both sides have made mistakes. Some progress has already been made, and Germany at least is now sending nearly every foreigner that wants to stay here to an integration course regardless of how long they are planning to be here. It could also be that in subsequent generations the attitude will shift even more multi-cultural and Turkish-descendant children won&amp;#39;t feel marginalized and excluded in school. Until that time though, we&amp;#39;ll continue to see pockets of Turkish communities that will operate more-or-less self-sufficiently and continue to identify closer with their former identity and be involved in the only politics they therefore understand-- those in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "name": "t1_dgdj1zt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467454.0, "created_utc": 1492438654.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2si92", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubel", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2si92", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubel", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdk0zv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dippofix", "parent_id": "t1_dgdj5dh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MapPorn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In my experience, it's not true.
