Those closer to Latin/Catholic/Western Europe eventually became the core of what are now called Croats, while those closer to Orthodox/Greek/Eastern Rome became Serbs. The use of Latin or Cyrillic and which church people belonged to simply reflected that influence. Bosniaks are more contentious. Many claim they're more recent than the other two because they are thought to be South Slavs who became Muslim and were Turkified under the Ottomans. Others yet claim Bosniak identity is even older and that they're descendent from people who followed a different Christian sect, called heretical by many, which would mean they were different even before the arrival of Islam.\n\nWhat I cannot say though is how exactly the identities evolved over time and how the modern divisions came to be. Most of what I've read claims that such things weren't really written upon in the past since people didn't really think of themselves as \"nationals\" but that it is implied that the modern ethnicities evolved from what used to be regional identities, and that there were more than 3 but they coalesced into the 3 ethnicities we know today. To clarify, there is more to the ethnic/national identities than just religion (for example, there are a minority of self-identified Serbs who aren't Orthodox). Just like all national identities, Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian identities are tied with certain symbols, literature, histories, etc. I assume the modern situation sprang from the advent of nationalism in the 1700s and 1800s and people converting pre-existing identities to fit the context of nationalism.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention Montenegro. They're Orthodox so you would think they're just a sub-group of Serbs. In reality, Montenegro had existed as its own unique entity for a long time and there is such a thing as a Montenegrin identity. However, the borders weren't always the same. Those who live in the more recent territory closer to Serbia are more likely to identify as Serb than those who live in the old core of Montenegro.

Those closer to Latin/Catholic/Western Europe eventually became the core of what are now called Croats, while those closer to Orthodox/Greek/Eastern Rome became Serbs. The use of Latin or Cyrillic and which church people belonged to simply reflected that influence. Bosniaks are more contentious. Many claim they&amp;#39;re more recent than the other two because they are thought to be South Slavs who became Muslim and were Turkified under the Ottomans. Others yet claim Bosniak identity is even older and that they&amp;#39;re descendent from people who followed a different Christian sect, called heretical by many, which would mean they were different even before the arrival of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I cannot say though is how exactly the identities evolved over time and how the modern divisions came to be. Most of what I&amp;#39;ve read claims that such things weren&amp;#39;t really written upon in the past since people didn&amp;#39;t really think of themselves as &amp;quot;nationals&amp;quot; but that it is implied that the modern ethnicities evolved from what used to be regional identities, and that there were more than 3 but they coalesced into the 3 ethnicities we know today. To clarify, there is more to the ethnic/national identities than just religion (for example, there are a minority of self-identified Serbs who aren&amp;#39;t Orthodox). Just like all national identities, Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian identities are tied with certain symbols, literature, histories, etc. I assume the modern situation sprang from the advent of nationalism in the 1700s and 1800s and people converting pre-existing identities to fit the context of nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention Montenegro. They&amp;#39;re Orthodox so you would think they&amp;#39;re just a sub-group of Serbs. In reality, Montenegro had existed as its own unique entity for a long time and there is such a thing as a Montenegrin identity. However, the borders weren&amp;#39;t always the same. Those who live in the more recent territory closer to Serbia are more likely to identify as Serb than those who live in the old core of Montenegro.
