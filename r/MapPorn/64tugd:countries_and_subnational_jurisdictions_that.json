They often additionally claim the genocide was continuous from 1915-1923. Maybe Ataturk committed genocide against Armenians (although I personally disagree), but in that case it is two separate genocide as the government collapsed and left armenians alone for a year or so.  Or that they claim it was against all armenians throughout the empire rather than focused on eastern anatolia (the reasons for this granted might be for political considerations) or at worst greater anatolia, ignoring places like palestine. It is more of a feel, but that feel is either the historians rely exclusively on western and Armenian sources, or deny it only use turkish sources.\n\nA good way to kind of get into the kind of criticisms I am talking about is to read the well criticisms section of Vahakn Dadrian on wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vahakn_Dadrian#Criticism).

Whether or not these are genocide ultimately is not super important, they certainly are either on the extreme end of ethnic cleansing or the low end of genocide, but they feel close enough for Turks to feel like there is being a double standard applied.
