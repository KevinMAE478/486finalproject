And unlike in Britain, farmers owned their own land instead of renting it from the gentry. The country was (and is) full of forests just waiting somebody to til it. No reason to stay a rent slave if you wanted to be a master of your own destiny (the crown also rewarded founding a farm with tax breaks). \n\nAs such, pretty much everybody (male) who had any education and could be thought to be interested in voting could vote. Further, the rule was devolved to the municipalities (as it is today) so farmers voted on things they wanted to do and see. Nobles were few and had limited rights that had more to do with personal tax freedom than taxing others. Most of the decisions  on local level was made by the local university trained priest, who was also the state official and the local teacher.\n\nFun fact about the north: we're so far up that the land can't support garrisons, only few soldiers per county. If a rebellion came, they would die during the first hour. During an uprising the king would have to gather an army around the kingdom and send it to the rebelling county, in effect invading it. This was expensive and tiresome, and it was generally just easier to let municipalities do what they wanted as long as the roads stayed upkept and some money flowed into the treasury for the needs of the state. If you look at where the castles are in the North, there's only few and they were built near the borders, not on the heartland as they were in the British Isles. There simply wasn't men or money for such a large expense.\n\nThe eastern part was poorer, but this was due to Novgorod/Russia invading and burning everything every couple of decades and not because the land would have been administered differently.\n\nSomething should tell that when Russia made us into an autonomous grand duchy, they got the estates loyalty by promising that nothing would change, the king would just be replaced by a grand duke. Later when we gained independence, the grand duke was just replaced by a president. \n\nAll in all, the position that we were in worse situation is ridiculous. The only real difference between a subject in Svea and one in H\u00e4me was that in H\u00e4me the farmers spoke Finnish. But so did the priest, and most people learned Swedish during their daily lives anyway.

And unlike in Britain, farmers owned their own land instead of renting it from the gentry. The country was (and is) full of forests just waiting somebody to til it. No reason to stay a rent slave if you wanted to be a master of your own destiny (the crown also rewarded founding a farm with tax breaks). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As such, pretty much everybody (male) who had any education and could be thought to be interested in voting could vote. Further, the rule was devolved to the municipalities (as it is today) so farmers voted on things they wanted to do and see. Nobles were few and had limited rights that had more to do with personal tax freedom than taxing others. Most of the decisions  on local level was made by the local university trained priest, who was also the state official and the local teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun fact about the north: we&amp;#39;re so far up that the land can&amp;#39;t support garrisons, only few soldiers per county. If a rebellion came, they would die during the first hour. During an uprising the king would have to gather an army around the kingdom and send it to the rebelling county, in effect invading it. This was expensive and tiresome, and it was generally just easier to let municipalities do what they wanted as long as the roads stayed upkept and some money flowed into the treasury for the needs of the state. If you look at where the castles are in the North, there&amp;#39;s only few and they were built near the borders, not on the heartland as they were in the British Isles. There simply wasn&amp;#39;t men or money for such a large expense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The eastern part was poorer, but this was due to Novgorod/Russia invading and burning everything every couple of decades and not because the land would have been administered differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something should tell that when Russia made us into an autonomous grand duchy, they got the estates loyalty by promising that nothing would change, the king would just be replaced by a grand duke. Later when we gained independence, the grand duke was just replaced by a president. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the position that we were in worse situation is ridiculous.
