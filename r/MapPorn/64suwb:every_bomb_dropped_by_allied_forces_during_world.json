Very different from sending cruise missiles to a specific military base in Syria from where allegedly chemical weapons are used: that is a legitimate military target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to mention the bombing of Rotterdam in the Netherlands by the Nazis at the start of WW2: they just dropped unaimed bombs from planes, destroying the center of Rotterdam, which was not a military target. It was purely &amp;quot;aimed&amp;quot; at civilians, in the hope that the Netherlands would surrender if one of their major cities was destroyed. And they did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s what we see in Syria: just people dropping unaimed barrel bombs at a civilian population. That&amp;#39;s not very expensive. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "name": "t1_dg6p2ea", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065787.0, "created_utc": 1492036987.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54fyg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KedaZ1", "parent_id": "t3_64suwb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MapPorn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So if the Syria cruise missiles cost $62M a pop, what did this ordinance cost the allies?
