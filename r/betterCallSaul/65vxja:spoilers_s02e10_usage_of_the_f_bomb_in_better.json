I&amp;#39;m American and when I lived in Germany that was the biggest difference I noticed: my language was peppered with &amp;quot;fuck&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;shit&amp;quot; all the time (when speaking English), and the Germans would sometimes say &amp;quot;fucking&amp;quot; whether they were speaking German or English, but swearing clearly wasn&amp;#39;t treated like a flavoring particle like I used it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every person I&amp;#39;ve met from the UK and Australia meanwhile curses even more, and in dirtier ways. Canadians not so much, but alas. Basically every person I&amp;#39;ve met from USA/UK/AUS uses &amp;quot;fuck&amp;quot; to fill space in language, other cultures don&amp;#39;t seem to do that, even with their own language&amp;#39;s version of &amp;quot;fuck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "name": "t1_dge7o6o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492495930.0, "created_utc": 1492467130.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vxja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vxja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vxja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vxja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vxja", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgei5a8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ingebeastly", "parent_id": "t1_dgdwz9z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/betterCallSaul", "controversiality": 0, "body": "you're entitled to your opinion", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;re entitled to your opinion&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "name": "t1_dgei5a8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492509224.0, "created_utc": 1492480424.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdwz9z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sucidalstreet", "parent_id": "t1_dgdvz7y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/betterCallSaul", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would argue you are part of the minority there.
