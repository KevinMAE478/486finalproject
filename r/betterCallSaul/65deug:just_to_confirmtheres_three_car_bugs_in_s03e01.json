The people tracking him expect him to get rid of his throwaway car and wouldn&amp;#39;t find that suspicious at all, since they provoked this anyways and they know that he would act upon getting found. So bug one was in car one, he destroyed it and they expected that to happen. But two in car two which they didn&amp;#39;t expect him to find because of how cleverly they hid it and because they are thinking that maybe he felt safe driving car two. He drains bug two and replaces it with bug three. They take bug three and replace it with bug four.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "name": "t1_dg9do55", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216801.0, "created_utc": 1492188001.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65deug", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65deug", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rzx2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thetransportedman", "parent_id": "t1_dg9oqxx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/betterCallSaul", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I forgot he already owned that second car since it'd been a year", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I forgot he already owned that second car since it&amp;#39;d been a year&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "name": "t1_dg9rzx2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233871.0, "created_utc": 1492205071.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9oqxx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "djf33", "parent_id": "t3_65deug", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/betterCallSaul", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't understand the general confusion about the trackers.
