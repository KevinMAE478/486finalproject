Point well taken about the cars and bombs. But here's the thing...\n\nYou need slow parts to appreciate fast parts. I think that's the subtlety you guys in the \"too slow\" camp are missing. BCS has a multiple-season plot arc that parallels Jimmy's character arc. And each individual season has it's own plot arc out of necessity. The plot and characters are also anchored to a certain end point re Saul Goodman. With all that plot infrastructure in place, the hard, cold reality is that a certain amount of \"pace\" is necessary if you want a coherent, quality show that will eventually thrill you with a \"payoff.\" This is the \"no free lunch\" theory in practice. For many people, you just can not physically have a thrilling payoff without a slow build up. Again, I point to my sex analogy.\n\nI also enjoyed the slow pace of BCS-S03E01 on it's own merit. For example, the last segment of trying to figure out what Mike was doing\u2014then when he pulled up his tracker monitor as the mystery car drove off and the music kicked in, perfectly timed. This is just one example how within even a single episode a slow pace can have a payoff at the end.\n\nNice job pointing out our experience with BB. Many people consider BB-S4 and BB-S5 the best television seasons ever. Many of those same people point to BB-S1 and BB-S2 and complain \"too slow.\" My point is, you can't have one without the other. If you think so, show me where that has happened before and you can change my mind on that point. But until then, I am happy to enjoy the slow parts as anticipation of what's to come based on VG/PGs track record. They did you properly with BB, so I say sit back and let them do you properly with BCS too. These two are highly skilled professionals.

But here&amp;#39;s the thing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need slow parts to appreciate fast parts. I think that&amp;#39;s the subtlety you guys in the &amp;quot;too slow&amp;quot; camp are missing. BCS has a multiple-season plot arc that parallels Jimmy&amp;#39;s character arc. And each individual season has it&amp;#39;s own plot arc out of necessity. The plot and characters are also anchored to a certain end point re Saul Goodman. With all that plot infrastructure in place, the hard, cold reality is that a certain amount of &amp;quot;pace&amp;quot; is necessary if you want a coherent, quality show that will eventually thrill you with a &amp;quot;payoff.&amp;quot; This is the &amp;quot;no free lunch&amp;quot; theory in practice. For many people, you just can not physically have a thrilling payoff without a slow build up. Again, I point to my sex analogy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed the slow pace of BCS-S03E01 on it&amp;#39;s own merit. For example, the last segment of trying to figure out what Mike was doing\u2014then when he pulled up his tracker monitor as the mystery car drove off and the music kicked in, perfectly timed. This is just one example how within even a single episode a slow pace can have a payoff at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nice job pointing out our experience with BB. Many people consider BB-S4 and BB-S5 the best television seasons ever. Many of those same people point to BB-S1 and BB-S2 and complain &amp;quot;too slow.&amp;quot; My point is, you can&amp;#39;t have one without the other. If you think so, show me where that has happened before and you can change my mind on that point.
