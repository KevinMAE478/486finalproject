Or, which might be fairer I would put as evil but not as evil as most in the evil category. More in the entry point category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how so many of the fanbase agree with Mike&amp;#39;s bullshit about not being a bad guy even though you are a criminal if you keep your word, with the implication of him being part of that. I think he hides behind professionalism and a code of ethics to justify himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that someone breaking a law by disagreeing in a dictatorship is evil because they are a criminal?  Or that any kind of small crime makes a person irredeemable? Nope, but we should acknowledge that there are definitely laws that are about things that should be illegal and are pretty immoral to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t see Jimmy as chaotic good either and I talked more about that here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/64wc9a/jimmy_and_chuck_are_perfect_couterpoints_to_good/dg6luth/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/64wc9a/jimmy_and_chuck_are_perfect_couterpoints_to_good/dg6luth/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kim sometimes goes along with Jimmy and his shady actions , I would put her as more neutral. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dunno about Ernesto, I would put him neutral leaning to good, because he seems like a decent dude, but I don&amp;#39;t remember much about him. Don&amp;#39;t have a problem with him being in the good category because he does seem like a good person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, the way I see it, I see the neutral category as the biggest one, with people leaning in either directions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "name": "t1_dg6odxs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492064955.0, "created_utc": 1492036155.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z6qn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6p87i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "livingdeadgrrl", "parent_id": "t3_64z6qn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/betterCallSaul", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree that Jimmy McGill is Chaotic Good.
