Chuck had nothing to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Chuck&amp;#39;s a bit of a hypocrite. And the thing about this hypocrisy is that it&amp;#39;s self-reinforcing. He is so convinced that people don&amp;#39;t ever fundamentally change, that he can&amp;#39;t or won&amp;#39;t see the cases where they gradually are, thanks to a change in their circumstances or experience impacting their behavior; meanwhile, his own attempts to hamstring any changes those close to him might be making means they can&amp;#39;t actually get their genuine growth to stick. Yet, because he goes out of his way to successfully put roadblocks in their path, he can convince himself they never would have managed it, anyway \u2014 see, they failed the test of character, like they always do. It&amp;#39;s one of the most twisted forms of blame-deflecting imaginable. I imagine that Kim and Jimmy aren&amp;#39;t the only ones Chuck has sidelined over the years, simply because he jumped to conclusions about their character or those of the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "name": "t1_dgbph3a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347476.0, "created_utc": 1492318676.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2os7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "j-fernandez", "parent_id": "t1_dgb1ftw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/betterCallSaul", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah his jealousy and disdain of his brother is pushing him.
