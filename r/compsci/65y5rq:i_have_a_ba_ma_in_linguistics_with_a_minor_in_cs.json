Off the top of my head, I only know of one college that doesn't require majors degree plans per se, and even there students complete a \"field of study.\" Most schools don't require their students to go through the curriculum as a cohort, at least not at the undergraduate level.\n\nMost colleges and universities also have processes in place for students to transfer credit from another university. This can be anything from a person or team in Admissions or the Registrar's Office making course equivalency decisions based on course descriptions, (like the large public institutions I've worked for processing transfer credit), to courses being evaluated by the faculty who teach them, (like at my tiny liberal arts alma mater), with most schools falling somewhere in between (like at the medium-sized public university where I was a transfer advisor; there, the Registrar's Office evaluates lower-level courses from in state, and the deans evaluate upper-level courses and courses from out of state). In a growing number of states, courses, especially at the lower level, use standardized state-wide course numbers with somewhat standardized course descriptions, and with them, an expectation that curricula will be reasonably similar across institutions (even if there's a huge difference in quality between Prof. Droningbore from Podunk State College at Nowheresville, and David Malan's public university doppelganger at Flagship State).\n\nIn addition, most states have standardized general education curricula that transfer either en bloc or course-by-course, no matter where you go in the state. Some universities even go so far as to waive general education requirements altogether for second bachelor's students. That's roughly a year cut off right there, maybe more.\n\nGenerally, at middling public universities, you'll have a pretty good leeway in what transfers, at least at the lower level; this varies a good deal from state to state, though. The middling public universities on the one hand are under budget pressure from the state, and on the other hand assume that if you've covered something approaching the material, then you're smart enough to have completed their version of the class and are ready to move on to whatever comes next. Private, top-tier public, and bottom-of-the-barrel public universities tend to be exceptions. Private schools can do just about whatever they want (within the confines of Department of Education regulations and accreditation requirements), so a lot of the time they'll try to be a bit more innovative than their public university counterparts. Top-tier public universities are a bit pickier about transfer credit because they go into more depth or a faster pace than lower-prestige schools. The bottom tier schools, at least the three I can think of off the top of my head in my state, either cater to less well-prepared students and assume the worst of their students and are extremely picky about transfer credit in order to make sure their students actually learn the material, or their curriculum isn't quite in line with the curriculum at other universities, and they use deprecated courses that don't really fit with the courses you'll take elsewhere.\n\nSo with gen ed/core/basics/whatever trendy name the faculty have decided to come up with out of the way, that cuts the time from four years to three.
