My method was to read through each section once, then go back and write down (in my own words) everything I thought was important onto paper (notebook). Then I'd do the exercises on paper as well, but in a different section to keep them separate. Once I finished a chapter I would pull the pages from the notebook and store them permanently in a binder, with the notes organized under one tab and the practice problems under another. \n\nWriting everything out by hand has always been my preferred method for learning a topic, and choosing my own words forces me to parse the information so that I know I understand what I'm writing down. As others have mentioned, writing my notes by hand gives me a better sense of relational memory (if that's a thing), so that if I know that I read about a topic but can't quite recall all of the minute details, I have a pretty good idea where I can find them in my binder.\n\nOh, I would also watch the relevant lectures from MIT's OCW on discrete math [6.042J](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/) and ArsDigita's old [videos](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6pCe7tRct-hEgOxlFzXxQRba_I4zIP4j) (warning: there's a missing video or 2 which you can't access even if you go to their old website \ud83d\ude14).\n\nBest of luck to you!
