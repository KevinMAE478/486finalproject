I guess it kind of makes for neat pictures, and explains why epicycles worked, but it seems like it just makes everything else *more* confusing. IMO that should be saved for once the student has a better understanding of the simple, 1D case (your link didn't have the epicycle gifs, but someone else posted one, and yours started talking about \"spinning a function\").\n\nHere's some increasingly sophisticated ways to understand Fourier transforms:\n\n1. It splits a function into it's component \"frequencies\". There's an integral that tells you how much of each frequency is present. This is good to do because lots of systems have simple descriptions in terms of waves.\n\n2. It represents your function using an orthogonal basis of waves, indexed by frequency. To find the projection at frequency omega (nitpick to your article: it's the component, not the energy. The \"energy at that frequency\" is the absolute value squared),  you take the inner product of your function and the basis wave. This is great for linear, shift invariant systems (also called time invariant by electrical engineers), because this basis diagonalizes convolution and differentiation. i.e. those things become multiplication.\n\n3. Given a system with a symmetry such that the associated group is locally compact and abelian (roughly, it's close enough to finite-looking to be able to define complex-valued functions and do integrals on them (particularly convolution and inner products), and the symmetries don't get tangled up in crazy ways), there is a representation of that symmetry as a product of 1-d symmetries. In this representation, convolution and (I think something like) the infinitesimal version of the symmetry are diagonalized. This unifies the different Fourier transforms along with things like the Mellin transform. You project the function representing your system onto this representation by taking the inner product with \"characters\" of the representation, which are basically basis functions.\n\nI'm not 100% up on the details of #3, and that's basically the starting point of a huge dive off into the land of representation theory, but my point is the lens that someone really should strive to understand this stuff through is linear algebra, not trigonometry. #2 is the level that most engineers think about Fourier-like transforms. Then you can go back and see how that applies to epicycles by choosing a convenient coordinate system or whatever.\n\nEdit: and if you want something to visualize, I'd suggest looking at how two waves add and multiply. i.e. how interference and modulation work. This will serve you better in understanding what those integrals do.", "edited": 1492012283.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never understood why people are so obsessed with talking about circles and spinning things around, and why they make pictures of circles spinning around while attached to other circles, etc. when describing Fourier transforms. I guess it kind of makes for neat pictures, and explains why epicycles worked, but it seems like it just makes everything else &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; confusing. IMO that should be saved for once the student has a better understanding of the simple, 1D case (your link didn&amp;#39;t have the epicycle gifs, but someone else posted one, and yours started talking about &amp;quot;spinning a function&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some increasingly sophisticated ways to understand Fourier transforms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It splits a function into it&amp;#39;s component &amp;quot;frequencies&amp;quot;. There&amp;#39;s an integral that tells you how much of each frequency is present. This is good to do because lots of systems have simple descriptions in terms of waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It represents your function using an orthogonal basis of waves, indexed by frequency. To find the projection at frequency omega (nitpick to your article: it&amp;#39;s the component, not the energy. The &amp;quot;energy at that frequency&amp;quot; is the absolute value squared),  you take the inner product of your function and the basis wave. This is great for linear, shift invariant systems (also called time invariant by electrical engineers), because this basis diagonalizes convolution and differentiation. i.e. those things become multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a system with a symmetry such that the associated group is locally compact and abelian (roughly, it&amp;#39;s close enough to finite-looking to be able to define complex-valued functions and do integrals on them (particularly convolution and inner products), and the symmetries don&amp;#39;t get tangled up in crazy ways), there is a representation of that symmetry as a product of 1-d symmetries. In this representation, convolution and (I think something like) the infinitesimal version of the symmetry are diagonalized. This unifies the different Fourier transforms along with things like the Mellin transform. You project the function representing your system onto this representation by taking the inner product with &amp;quot;characters&amp;quot; of the representation, which are basically basis functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not 100% up on the details of #3, and that&amp;#39;s basically the starting point of a huge dive off into the land of representation theory, but my point is the lens that someone really should strive to understand this stuff through is linear algebra, not trigonometry. #2 is the level that most engineers think about Fourier-like transforms.
