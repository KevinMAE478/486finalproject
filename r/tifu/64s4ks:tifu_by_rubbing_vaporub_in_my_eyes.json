It&amp;#39;s got to be the same, right? Stupid mistake #1: Assuming that a tear stick invented specifically for this purpose will have the same effect as Vaporub, just because they share an ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I went to my school&amp;#39;s theatre for the dress rehearsal, and I made sure include the Vaporub in my makeup bag.

Before my second scene (the one where I have to cry) I used my fingers to apply the cream just below my eyes. And when I say &amp;quot;just below my eyes&amp;quot;, I mean it. I smeared it right across my bottom eyelids, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that a bit of it actually got onto the inside of my eyelids. Stupid mistake #3: I applied it way too close to my eyeballs, and the second I blinked, I felt a burning sensation in my eyes. They began to water, but not as if I was about to cry in an emotional way, more like I&amp;#39;d just rubbed lemon juice all over them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to panic, realising that I was due on stage in minutes. Not thinking, I filled up the sink and splashed some water on my face as quickly as I could, before rushing on stage. The water didn&amp;#39;t help, though. I just felt the burning spread further across my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The burning sensation was very distracting, causing me to do a somewhat sub-par performance while on stage, to the confusion and embarrassment of my teacher and classmates. Things got even worse as I exited the stage, as a few other cast members began to give me strange looks. I wondered why, baffled as to how they could&amp;#39;ve realised about my situation, since I was alone in the bathroom when it was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran back upstairs to the bathroom, desperate to try and wash my face properly, now that I actually had some time to spare. I glanced in the mirror, and I finally saw what what my classmates saw. The tips of my hair were slightly damp, and, even worse, the edges of my eyes were bright red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - I needed to cry for a scene in a play, decided to rub &lt;a href=\"http://vicks.com/en-us/shop-products/vaporub/vaporub-topical-ointment\"&gt;Vaporub&lt;/a&gt; in my eyes instead of buying a specially made &lt;a href=\"http://www.extrememakeup.co.uk/Kryolan-Tear-Stick\"&gt;tear stick&lt;/a&gt;, put it way too close to my eyes, it was painful.
