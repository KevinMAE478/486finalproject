I changed onto my last train and decided I could relax a bit now. I was about twenty minutes from my destination (a tiny village), and was exhausted and thought I would rest my eyes. I didn&amp;#39;t realize but I had fallen asleep and woken up in an absolute fright and realized I missed my stop. I had no idea how long I was asleep for. The train was slowing to a stop and I rushed up, got my stuff, and got off the train. I was the only person to exit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped off the train, turned around, and was greeted with literally fields. Fields and fields of sheep, and a sign &amp;quot;Dent&amp;quot;. There was a small shack, which I immediately run into, as it was raining sideways. I get my phone out to call my boyfriend, and saw I had been asleep for thirty or forty minutes. There is no signal. Nothing. In my panic I began to cry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I walk down this gravel road, no idea which direction to go, and try to get help? What if the closest town is miles away?
