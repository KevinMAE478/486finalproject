I&amp;#39;ve been lurking here a long time, but I never thought I&amp;#39;d have anything to share.  But here we are, so let me tell you about one of the worst nights of my life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s last night.  I had gotten an invite to go hang out with a sweet, wonderful girl that I&amp;#39;ve been talking to on and off for a few weeks.  We had only met in person once prior, but we know a lot of the same people.  So she invited me over to her house to hang out and bullshit with her and some of her friends.  I&amp;#39;d been waiting for this visit all week.  So around 8:30 last night she messaged me and said to be there in an hour.  So I made sure I was wearing all of my favorite clothes, had a bag full of fun shit to bring along, picked up some beer, and off I went.  The drive was smooth, listened to some good music on the way there with my sunroof open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get to her place at 9:30.  Beautiful house.  She looks great.  I&amp;#39;m feeling great.  By any measure I could have made at that point, last night was going to be a great night.  I join the small group on the back patio.  Six people, including me and the host girl.  Two already established couples, and us.  So I sit close to her, share my beer.  Make small talk for a while.  One of the couples leaves.  So now it&amp;#39;s a smaller group, and I ask if they want to listen to music.  Everyone agreed, so I pulled out a bluetooth speaker and started playing some music.  We were all taking turns making suggestions while we talked.  It was genuinely a good night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, I&amp;#39;d say maybe 11:30?, I&amp;#39;d had three beers, and I figured I was going to have to drive home at some point, so I stopped.  Didn&amp;#39;t want to get sloppy in front of this girl.  After a few more songs, I was kinda thirsty, so I asked my lovely host where her kitchen was so I could go get a glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the last complete memory I have until about 12 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I half sputtered to consciousness on the floor some time later.  Covered in blood, in so much pain, confused, I couldn&amp;#39;t open my left eye.  A man was telling me not to move.  Then I blacked out back into my blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, after some more time, I briefly woke up part of the way.  Couldn&amp;#39;t talk or look around, but I could tell we were moving.  I put together that I was in an ambulance.  I blacked out again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember little flashes after that.  Bits and pieces of a hospital interior.  With blackouts interspersed.  A CT scanner.  Lots of questions.  Lights.  I was getting stitches in my face.  More pain.  Blacked back out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At around 4am I finally came around enough to open my eyes and speak.  A doctor was telling me that I had a very severe concussion and a bad laceration around my left eye.  Was there somebody who could come get me?  I got ahold of my  brother.  He&amp;#39;d be there in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now that I was awake-ish, I had to ask, what the hell was going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctor assured me right away that i wasn&amp;#39;t\u200b intoxicated.  My BAC was as low as I&amp;#39;d expected it to be.  And that there was no indication I had gotten sick or anything.  That the most likely explanation was that I had simply tripped and fell.  In addition to the concussion and the split open face, I have a bruised hip bone, a sprained ankle, and my hands are all busted up.  Indicating that I had tried to stop my fall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then I realized where I had been.  In that girls house.  My heart dropped so hard I thought it might come out of me.  Picked up my phone.  And, well, it was about what you&amp;#39;d expect.  A very unhappy young lady.  Telling me about how she had been interrogated by police in her home, and how she had to spend over half an hour cleaning all of my blood off of her floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never experienced anything like this.  I kinda wish I would&amp;#39;ve just died so I didn&amp;#39;t have to live with this deep, horrible shame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my brother comes and gets me and takes me home.  I don&amp;#39;t\u200b remember going to bed, but I woke up some time after 12 this afternoon.  And I&amp;#39;ve been up and conscious since then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted the girl back.  I told her I was so sorry and so embarrassed and that I had no excuses or explanations.  Offered to help in any way that I could with any damages I had caused.  She assured me it would be best if I didn&amp;#39;t do that.  And as it stands, I have been effectively told that I won&amp;#39;t be getting a return invite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#39;s how my weekend was.  And I&amp;#39;ve completely ruined any chance I had to form or enjoy a relationship with a girl I really liked.  Which is just a nice bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I was hanging out with friends and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Woke up in a hospital four hours later with some pretty bad injuries.  Don&amp;#39;t\u200b really remember what happened.  I&amp;#39;m told I just slipped and fell and split my head open on the kitchen floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everybody.
