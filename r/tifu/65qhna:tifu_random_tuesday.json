We will say their names are Dora and Jay. By this time it&amp;#39;s about 8pm. Our friends&amp;#39; kids are already in bed and asleep. It&amp;#39;s just us 4 adults with nothing to do except put a dent in the three cases of beer sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay starts our visit off with showing his new taser on steroids. It&amp;#39;s got a flashlight on one end and weighs enough to knock a man out if hit hard enough. Safe to say he&amp;#39;s proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proceeding on, we pop in a movie, Project X. Before the previews are finished, it was decided to make it a drinking game. Liven up the impromptu party. Why not? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of reasons why not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not too far in to the movie, we&amp;#39;ve killed one full case of beer. My brother, the non-drinker of the bunch, is clearly feeling the effects of alcohol. By the time the movie gets to the end, we&amp;#39;ve drank to the dog, the garden gnome, and the dealer with the flame thrower, and so much, much more. We have now finished the second  case. Yes, just like that. Again, why not? My brother&amp;#39;s famous words, sounded like a good idea. And the night is still early. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being mildly drunk, we turn on the webcam on my brother&amp;#39;s laptop. Bad, BAD, idea. We start cheering the webcam, drinking to the webcam, treating the webcam like a real person and telling Mr. Webcam to fuck off. Like it had anything to do with anything. And finally, we all moon the webcam. Why not? We are all waisted and every thing is a good idea when alcohol is involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting bored being in the house on a wonderful night (sorry to the neighbors) we start to play in the backyard. Brother wants to climb their massive tree out back. Why not, he&amp;#39;s drunk. He gets on the first branch and reasons it was not a good idea through his drunken state. He&amp;#39;s only six inches off the ground. He gets scared and me, being the good baby sister I am, says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll catch you!&amp;quot; Just before he plops to the ground to squish me like a pancake, Dora grabs me by the collar and pulls me to safety while my brother hits the ground like a ton of bricks. Don&amp;#39;t worry, he was fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly there after, we go back inside, have a water fight in the kitchen. Not sure who started it, but I ended up getting the short end of that as Jay holds me like a human shield to soak up the water his wife is aiming at him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, remember the taser mentioned earlier? Yes, the home defense taser. That one with 1000 watts of electricity pouring through it, enough to knock a man out cold if held for long enough. Brother wants to be tasered. After we all say no, he takes it upon himself to tase himself. No, we never once thought about stopping him. If he was going to do it, he could do it by himself. And it&amp;#39;d be fun to watch. Silent justice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heart pumping, anxiously waiting, he held the taser up, connects it to his body, and there he is, being held by electricity pulsing through his body for what seemed an eternity. Finally, FINALLY, contact is broken as he falls to the ground. Don&amp;#39;t worry, he&amp;#39;s fine. He gets back up and wants to do it again! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time around, we go out to the front yard, don&amp;#39;t want to break any thing and more importantly, don&amp;#39;t want any one to bash their head on a desk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are all now standing outside, Dora and I stand together as Jay approaches Brother and tases him. Just at that moment, that horribly, yet perfectly timed moment, the new neighbors pull into the drive next door as Jay is holding the taser to Brother. Hurriedly, the new comers rush into the safety of their home, I&amp;#39;m sure thinking what the Hell is wrong with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the night cools down and we are ready to pass out, Brother and I crash on our friends couch. Moments later Brother gets up, rushes to the bathroom to noisily vomit. When he&amp;#39;s done, he sings &amp;quot;I feel better,&amp;quot; then goes back to the couch to lay down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember Mr. Webcam? We never turned it off. Webcam recorded everything. As we watched the video the next day we realized  not all good ideas are good ideas, Brother was blinded by seeing too much of Dora&amp;#39; s lady parts when she mooned the camera, and I went flying across the room 17 times thanks to a random push or Jay picking me up and yelling &amp;quot;fly away!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:\nRandom Tuesday being bored with friends turns to drinking to movie, Brother falling out of tree and then tasing himself, all caught on his webcam. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is not so recent, though still gives a good laugh on bad days... \n\nOn this particular Tuesday, my brother and I had nothing better to do, so we pack up his laptop and cart off to our friends place across town.
