Some friends of mine were celebrating their anniversary at this nice restaurant with different function rooms, inside a hotel. I didn&amp;#39;t know too many other people there, so I started slamming down drinks and having some fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started getting a little tired after a while, so I sat down in this separate lounge area otuside the function halls, and wound up falling asleep. I have no idea how long I slept, but I was really embarrassed for falling asleep like that. So I briskly tried to shake it off, and went back into the function room, not paying attention to what room I was going into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in the room, the crowd was way more lively, and the music was different - kind of ethnic sounding. Instead of questioning this, I just thought to myself &amp;quot;Huh, things really picked up!&amp;quot; and headed for the bar. I started knocking back a crazy amount of alcohol, and started flirting with the ladies at the bar. Things were really hopping at this point. I started talking to the girl next to me. I asked &amp;quot;How do you know Dave and Karen?&amp;quot; (the couple celebrating their anniversary). She looked at me kind of funny, and after asking again, she replied in a thick European accent &amp;quot;Oh, he&amp;#39;s my little cousin.&amp;quot; I briefly thought to myself, huh, that&amp;#39;s weird. Dave&amp;#39;s 40, and this gal is like 26 or so. Weird that she&amp;#39;d call Dave her &amp;quot;little cousin&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She starts getting a little nervous, and points to a guy in the corner and says to me &amp;quot;See him? That&amp;#39;s Brad.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m thinking, Brad? Why the fuck do I care who Brad is? So I&amp;#39;m thinking Brad must be her ex-boyfriend or something, so I take her our to the dance floor and start dancing with her. She obliges, and we dance for a bit. Because I&amp;#39;m an arrogant prick, I decided, hey, why don&amp;#39;t I rub it in Brad&amp;#39;s face that I&amp;#39;m dancing with his girl? So I start waving to Brad while I&amp;#39;m trying to grind with her - and started flapping at her ass like I was pretending to slap it and making dick waving motions. And what do you know, Brad sees me and starts marching over. She grabs me by the arm and says &amp;quot;Are you crazy! That&amp;#39;s Brad!&amp;quot; -- then it hit&amp;#39;s me. She&amp;#39;s not saying &amp;quot;Brad&amp;quot; she&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s her &amp;quot;DAD&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s at this point, I went cold, looked around, and realized I was at the wrong fucking party.

I ask the guy at hotel desk, and he says it&amp;#39;s an Albanian kid&amp;#39;s birthday party. My friend&amp;#39;s anniversary party finished cleaning up over an hour ago in the room next to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the fuck out of there, and made for the parking lot. As I&amp;#39;m getting into my car, &amp;quot;Brad&amp;quot; and another guy come running after me and yank me out of the car. I tried putting my hands up and apologizing, but &amp;quot;Brad&amp;quot; squarely hit me in the gut, and handed my ass to me. After giving me a quick boxing lesson, he tosses me back in the car, and (thank god) walks away. There&amp;#39;s no way I was driving like that, so I moved my car to a nearby lot, and called for a cab home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day looking like I got mauled by wild animals. And at that point, I realized I&amp;#39;m on the verge of a bad alcohol problem, and started sobriety that week.
