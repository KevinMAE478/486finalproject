I washed with the best soap I had (in retrospect I&amp;#39;ve been picturing the glorious bottle of tecnu I have at home) and call it a night, thinking that whatever I may have been exposed to--chiggers, ticks, poison ivy---would all have been washed off and down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ha.Ha ha. Hnnnng. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple hours since my shower have passed and I&amp;#39;ve gotten ready for bed. I&amp;#39;ve got no itchiness on my skin anywhere at this point.

I went through with my deed and slept like a rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wake up the next morning already feeling the woeful tightness and itch on my right hand. I&amp;#39;m lying in bed still when I am thinking of this itch, and feel the slightest tickle on my face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get up and go to the bathroom mirror, and sure as shit, see a small patch of the devils goddamn gonorrhea on my cheekbone. I look at my right hand, and see the all too-familiar blisters between my index, middle and ring fingers. And on my left hand. And on my right forearm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find some calamine lotion and take stock of all the spots I find, and treat them accordingly, use my best jedi mind tricks to keep from scratching and hope for the best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get back to the house yesterday afternoon and do my best again to NOT SCRATCH ANYTHING. The poison spread a little bit, but not too badly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wake up this morning, and lo and behold, the spot on my cheekbone has spread to the greater part of my cheek and is flirting with the corner of my eye. And, I&amp;#39;ve got an itch. This time it&amp;#39;s not that kind that one should scratch at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A further visual inspection confirms that I&amp;#39;ve got poison ivy on worst fucking place I&amp;#39;ve ever gotten it. Right on the outer lips of my vagina. And I&amp;#39;m afraid not even a Yoda-level midichlorian count in my bloodstream would help me distract myself from the most irritating, cringe-inducing, and utterly unscratchable itch that I&amp;#39;ve now got to ignore and treat for probably 2 weeks. Even typing at the computer makes me cringe because of how I have to spread my fingers and hold my right arm off the table and computer because of where the rash is on my forearm. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wear your gloves, kiddos. Or at the very least, wash like you&amp;#39;re about to scrub into brain surgery, because this is going to be a long exercise in mindfulness and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I feel like it takes a solid exposure like this every few years to remind myself that YES I should wear gloves and YES I should carry the right soap in my vehicle with me at all fucking times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Got into poison ivy.

I do a lot of camping and my parents used to live on a ranch with tons of poison oak.   When I was in high school I could walk right through patches and not feel any effects.   I started to react to it when I was in college and a few years later I became ultra sensitive.  At this point riding in a car that my ex used for field work or touching the arm rest in a park visitor center are things that have produced rashes bad enough that I had to go to a doctor.   And if I wear a long sleeve shirt over my rash afterwards, that shirt will cause irritation even after being washed three or four times.   I wonder at that point how many molecules are still there if I can still be affected after multiple washings of a shirt (some with Tecnu).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tifu", "name": "t1_dgd8sg5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492442396.0, "created_utc": 1492413596.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbkcik", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hing-LordofGurrins", "parent_id": "t1_dgb4lck", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tifu", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Another fun fact: If you've never been exposed to the chemical in poison ivy (urushiol) before, then you do not have an allergy for it yet, and it can take over two weeks for the rash to develop for the first time.

I was told that if you think you might have touched poison oak, **wash with COLD water** and lots of soap. I was told that hot water ~~spreads the oils~~ opens up your pores, so you are more susceptible to absorbing the oils\\*, so taking a hot shower should be avoided if you think you've been exposed. So wash the affected area with lots of soap and cold water before you shower, and then, for safe measure, take as cold of a shower as you can.  \n2. If you end up with a rash (particularly on the face) it's possible that the oils that got you transferred to your sheets/pillow case, so wash that stuff ASAP.  \n  \n3. I've never tried this, so I don't know how well it works, but when I was young, someone's mom taught us that in a worst-case-scenario, if you *know* you just walked into poison oak and have it on your arm/etc, but you are far from soap and cold water, you can cover the area in dirt, and it will absorb some of the oil. \n  \nBut OP got it right, folks, wear gloves and long sleeves if you're going to be clearing out brush in an area with poison oak/ivy.   \nMake sure to put any exposed clothes straight into the wash, and wash any potentially exposed skin with soap and cold water ASAP.    \n  \n\\*I've heard both.
