I was off tomorrow and was going out this night to see an artist with a couple friends. Prior to seeing this artist we decided we were going to pregame some. Now NORMALLY I don&amp;#39;t ever drink before going to a concert, however this night Me and my friend decided to. So I decide to drink shots of peach vodka the hour that we&amp;#39;re waiting for our ride/pregaming. This vodka was so smooth that I ended up actually taking about 8-10 shots within the hour we were pregaming. Our ride arrives and 5 of us cram into our friends car. We get down, get through the line, and into the concert and everything is going great. The main artist comes on and I tell my friend I want to preform a move we dubbed &amp;quot;The Lawn Mower&amp;quot; or I believe more commonly known as &amp;quot;the scorpion&amp;quot;. I would provide a video if I was able to find one. The only way that I can describe it is, two people form into a wheelbarrow like position and one person is thrown up into the air (the motor) while the other person flails their arms around going up and down (the blades). Now I&amp;#39;ve done this in the past, and have had no issues with it. People usually back up and I end up having a pit forming around me. However being that both me and my friend were drunk, I was not able to maneuver my body to prepare for coming down towards the floor, and my friend wasn&amp;#39;t able to throw me back up in time. I felt my chin smack the floor, but went back up about 4-5 more times. I was immediately stopped by a mutual friend who told us that I was bleeding heavily. I looked down at my shirt &amp;amp; mouth and was absolutely cove in blood. We went to a Cop who proceeded to direct us toward the back room of the venue where the medics were on standby. While back there a venue employee asked me questions on what I could only assume was her filling out an incident report while medics essentially told me I needed to go to the ER to get my chin (source of the bleeding) stitched up. They told me to clean up prior to getting in the ambulance. It was at this point I realized the front portion of my front left central tooth had split into essentially two. So the night ends with the ER stitching me up and sending me home telling me to see my dentist. After the first few i am told I need a dental implant as I have cracked the root of my tooth. My dentist says that the tooth itself belongs in a history book from how it split. Many appointments and $5000 dollars of dental work later and I now the proud owner of a permanent fake front left central tooth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Went to a concert smashed, attempted to drunk lawnmower, face planted, dentist told me I&amp;#39;ll go down in history at his office. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello Reddit!\n\nLong time lurker here but decided I would post this after a friend suggested I should. \n\nObligatory \"this didn't happen today but a year ago\" post. \n\nIt was the end of February and I had just got done with work for the day.
