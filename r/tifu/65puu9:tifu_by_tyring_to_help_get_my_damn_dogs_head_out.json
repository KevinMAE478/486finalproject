It takes me a good 15 minutes to realize that this can is STUCK af on my dog, its hot, im sweating and I really want to get this over with, I was squatting and bent over the whole time so my back really hurts, in frustration and get up reallllll quick and decide to get some vaseline or something, and in the 3 seconds I get light headed and the blood rushing to my brain completely sets my footing off, its pretty chill, casually trying to maintain balance, but i miss footing and actually am falling backwards. First thought is ill just put my hands to support my fall. WRONG. The fall is taking longer than expected and im now falling backwards into the hole with my hands stretched out to support my fall, bam, just like that i hear some nasty cracks with my right arm taking the full weight of my body. in panic, my undivided focus is now to pull back my right arm so it takes no more weight, which made my left arm fall in a ragdoll motion and my left thumb slams against the back of the shovel in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im laying in the hole, in pain, my dogs head is still in the watering can, i messed up real bad. I get up, struggle to get my body out of the hole and assess the damage. I look at the right wrist and immediately its swelling, and its huge!! I cant move my right wrist. Cant move my left thumb at all. So im sitting by the hole and the doge is still flailing around the yard. My brothers come out and look at me, they laugh at the dog, I tell them what happened, they laugh at me. Eventually we got the damn dog out and I had to go to surgery, fractured my right wrist in 2 places and dislocated my left thumb.
