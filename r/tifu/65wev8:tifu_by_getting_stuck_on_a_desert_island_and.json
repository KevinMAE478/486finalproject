First time posting (and on mobile) so play nice kids&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a little back story, my family used to rent this little cottage type deal by the beach, with their two married (to each other) best friends. i guess they were like family friends, but i digress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every summer, they would force me and my younger sister to join them in this little family holiday (the parents friends had a five year old son who needed free baby sitters while all the adults got drunk/high). This particular trip, I had begged my parents to let me bring my best friend at the time, telling them that it would mean another set of eyes on the lil boy, and stop me from being a moody teenager forced to spend time with the family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first couple of days were okay. They&amp;#39;re weren&amp;#39;t enough beds in the cottage, so me and my best friend were staying in a caravan in the front yard and pretty much refused to leave or be interrupted at anytime. And me being me, one afternoon i was starting to get annoyed by my best friend, and decided we needed to get out and go for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to go for a walk across the beach and just waste some time. When we got the beach, we saw a pretty high up &amp;#39;island&amp;#39; looking thing, and decided to follow the path to sit on top of the rocks to watch the sunset. To get to the island, you needed to walk along a tiny concrete path, that was barely above water height, and being stupid teenagers we thought that it didn&amp;#39;t matter if our shoes got wet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We made it to the top of the little island, took beautiful tumblr-esque photos of the sunset, talked about life, and kept moving up the rocks as the waves started to crash higher and closer to the top. eventually it started to get too dark and cold, and we decided that we should probably get home before my parents started to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we started climbing down the rocks, before realising our fuck up. the path had disappeared. For anyone who is about as smart as we were at the time, the waves getting closer and closer to us was simply the tide coming in... the same tide that had now made the concrete path about 1m (or ~ 3ft) underwater.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we freaked out. we had no clue what to do, and started to succumb to the fact we were either going to drown trying to get off, or die of hypothermia waiting for the tide to recede.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we see a man wearing hi vis clothing start to walk towards us, yelling at us, asking on how we planned to get off. Obviously we had no idea, and he yelled at us to just stay in sight. Next thing we know, a group of about 5-6 others wearing the same bright orange jumpsuit come out of nowhere, and somehow mange to cross the path. They tell us to grip on tight to them, while they grab our shirts and make us walk in single file through waist height water that is breaking waves across our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we made it back to dry(ish) land, we were carted off into the back of a ute type thing, given blankets, and told they need to watch us for awhile before we gave them our contact details and were sent on our merry way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, for some reason my parents and their friends never believed us about what happened. Why we would lie about something that made us look like complete idiots, and come home with soaked shoes and jeans up to our boobs i would never understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tldr; best friend and i were stranded on an island (she wouldn&amp;#39;t have been my first pick of thing to take) and was rescued by state emergency service who were running training exercises and couldn&amp;#39;t believe how stupid we could be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;photos I took for anyone interested &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/H9C1l5g\"&gt;http://imgur.com/H9C1l5g&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/eJiRZ0d\"&gt;http://imgur.com/eJiRZ0d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So as they say, this fuck up was not actually today, but about 5 years ago.
