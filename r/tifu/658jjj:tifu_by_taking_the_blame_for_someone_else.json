Like most this f up occured quite a few years ago. Almost 9 to be exact, the day before my 16th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i decided to hang out with my younger sister, and her two friends, one of which was a guy about her age. She is only a few years younger than me. We decided to head to this wooded part of a subdivision down the road the road from our house on bikes, its almost right acrossed the road from our local BMX track and there was a race going on at the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being the younger rebels that we were, most of us had already picked up the habit if smoking so i always had a lighter on me. So not thinking about what could happen or the consequences that could happen after that. We started usong the lighter to light some pine needles on fire, i used it the first time and lit a small fire, seeing how quickly it spread i put it out. I was the oldest in the group and had more common sense than the other 3 even though it wasnt very much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my sisters guy friend had asked to see my lighter, and of course being the dumbass i was, i let him use it. Well he used it on a small fallen pine tree that happened to have a bunch of dead needles on it. The fire started to get pretty big so when i went to put it out he had stopped me and said wait a couple more seconds. I have no clue why i listened to him because in that couple seconds the fire became so unmanageable. Our first instinct was to throw dirt on it, well thats wasnt quite working. Next thing you know this fire is spreading acrossed this pine wooda quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we did the next logical thing, because we didnt want to see any nearby homes catch fire, we called 911. At this point, this kid is panicking, talking about how he will get in so much trouble blah blah blah. I felt bad for him, he was a few years younger than me so i told him to take his bike and head home and i would deal with the police and firefighters even though mind you, he is the one who started that fire. I was already on juvenile probation at the time so i figured what else could it really hurt. Later, did i find out it really couldve hurt alot. So he takes off for his house as quick as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know the police and firefighters show up and while the cops talking to me filling out a police report, the firefighters put out the fire. I told the cop that i had started the fire. He takes me and my sister home and tells my mom that I was lucky that i wasnt a day older or he would&amp;#39;ve taken me straight to juvenile detention.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost got hit with a felony arson charge for that but my probation officer helped me get it down to a misdemeanor of unability to contain a fire and extended probation for six more months and i also had to take a couple fire safety courses courtesy of the fire department. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr Tifu by taking the wrap for someone else after they had started a fire and ended up getting extra probation for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster.
