It\u2019s kind of a double fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In High School I was president of several clubs: Chemistry Club, Rocket Club, etc, all the good nerdy stuff. Being the president of Chemistry Club and Rocket Club of course meant that I had access to some of the most volatile chemicals and substances in the school. Additionally I was highly trusted by the school district and advisor for the club (I had done a lot of volunteer work for the school/clubs). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Junior to Senior year I became obsessed with the manufacture of solid fuel rocket motors. Using a combination of 65:35 grams KNO3 (Potassium Nitrate) to Sucrose (Table Sugar), my club tried again and again to produce a successful motor. For the entire first year we failed, creating useless smoke bombs one after another. Our school is in the middle of nowhere in the midwest, so we could do these experiments relatively safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Senior year, I finally realized that we were failing to combine the KNO3 and Sucrose completely, our method previously was as such:\nCrush KNO3 and Sucrose utilizing separate mortars and pestles\nHeat 10mL of water to boiling\nAdd KNO3 and Sucrose to crucible and heat on hot plate, adding boiling water\nPour R-Candy into old motor casing and hope for the best\nAfter doing some research, I found that it might be simpler and more effective to use a \u201cdry mix\u201d of R-Candy. This is where things get janky (if boiling oxidizers wasn\u2019t janky enough). In order to create the proper R-Candy dry mix, we began by using a food blender to crush and mix the KNO3 and Sugar (thank god the friction didn\u2019t heat the blend). Next an engine was packed with kitty litter (bentonite clay), and the fuel was packed in by pounding on it with a hammer and dowel. The first time with this mix, we performed a static test, and it worked flawlessly, so we decided to strap some PVC pipe to a stick, and fill the pipe with rocket fuel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we left for the fields, walking through the school with a pipebomb looking device, other students and teachers joined us. At last it was time, we lit the fuse and waited. The \u201crocket\u201d (if you could call it that) shot off, and immediately went horizontal (we had no fins as it was literally just a pipe), and went straight into a neighborhood. I sprinted over to the fence, hopped it, and ran into the neighborhood just in time to see our pipe crash into a driveway 5 feet from a house and explode. I grabbed the still burning rocket, and threw it over the fence, where we hit it with fire extinguishers. The crisis was averted, despite some homeowners being put under the belief that missiles were being launched against their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not the end of the story. As no-one had been hurt, and no property had been damaged during our last launch, we proceeded with our experiments with only slightly more caution. After a few more successful launches, I decided that it was time to move on to black powder rockets. It was at this point that the jankiness of my experimentation methods finally got me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For weeks we had been producing slow burning black powder using KNO3 as the main oxidizer, and were disappointed time and time again by poor quality pyrotechnics. Later I would realize that the low quality of our black powder was due to the fact that we were not using a ball mill. At the time, I thought that a good solution would be to use potassium chlorate. I had done no research on the chemical, all I knew was that it was far more reactive than potassium nitrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the day started like any other, the engine was cored and capped with kitty litter, and I started to fill it with our new black powder mix. With everyone standing in a circle, one of the members of my club held the engine while I pounded on it with a dowel. For the first two fill layers, nothing happened, and we got the engine \u00be of the way full. After three fills, I pulled out the dowel partially, and then everything bad that happened did. The dowel shot out of the engine, denting the ceiling of the room, and a 5 foot high flame full of pressurized gases shot out of our engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, I immediately grabbed the engine with my bare hands, and threw it away from my friends and I, who had already been thrown back (some jumped away from the explosion). As the room filled with smoke, I glanced at my right hand, which I had grabbed the engine with. Dumbfoundedly I stared as my flesh was melting away from the combination of a chemical, heat, and friction burn. Feeling no pain, I walked calmly over to the sink, thinking \u201cI should probably cool this down with some water\u201d, as I ran my hand under the water, the advisor was frantically making sure that everyone was ok, and clearing the smoke out of the room. He then approached me, and asked if I was ok. I responded \u201cYeah Professor, I just got a little burned but I\u2019m alright\u201d. He asked to see my hand, and upon seeing it, stated something like \u201cOh fuck, shit shit shit shit fuck\u201d, which I thought was hilarious at the time, being in a slight state of delirium, and due to the fact that the never swore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother Steve walked over and his first words were \u201cWoah that\u2019s cool!\u201d, which was honestly not that far off from my perception of the situation. Then the professor informed me that I would be going to the hospital, as I walked to the nurse with my hand in an old container of NaOH, my main thought was \u201coh shit what are my parents going to do\u201d. They walked in the to school with their faces a mixture of disappointment, concern, and \u201cwe know you do crazy stuff Jack, but why did you have to blow yourself up\u201d, the ride to the ER was fun to say the least. I waited for 3 hours to get my hand checked out, the ER was dealing with a big car crash. When the doctor saw my hand, he wrapped it, tested it for nerve damage, did some other stuff which I can\u2019t remember at this point, and sent me on my way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No disciplinary charges were drawn against myself or the professor, as this was done under the knowledge and approval of the school, and it was an unforeseen accident. However I was referred to as \u201cThe Mad Scientist\u201d for the rest of my senior year by teachers and students alike. Our club was then banned from the manufacture of thermite from this point forward, which was strange considering there was no thermite in any of our rocket fuel. Had there been, it would  have been much harder to type this one-handed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone is wondering why the black powder went off prematurely, potassium chlorate reacts explosively with sulfuric acid (I did not know this at the time), the sulfur we were using was presumably old, and there was likely a small amount of acid in the chemical. Pounding on the fuel with a dowel likely caused a reaction between the minute amounts of H2SO4 and KClO3, and the mixture went through a process called \u201cspontaneous deflagration\u201d, which is the subsonic combustion propagating through heat transfer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Tried to be a rocket scientist, failed, blew up a classroom and my hand.
