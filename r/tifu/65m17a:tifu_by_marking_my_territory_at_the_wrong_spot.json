Decided to post for your entertainment so enjoy.\n\u00a0\nLittle bit of context: was a year 9 student (Grade 8 for you Americans out there) and it was a beautiful summers day. The wind was just right, sun was beaming down, so me and the lads decided to go and play some football on our school fields. Had to take the opportunity at hand since we were only allowed to go on the field during summer. Note that the canteen where everyone eats, students and teachers alike, is facing the field.\n\u00a0\nSo, we have a kick-about for about 40 minutes then me and my mate, we&amp;#39;re going to call him Matty for this story&amp;#39;s purpose, decided that we both needed to take a piss.\n\u00a0\nThis is where the fuck up started.\n\u00a0\nNow you need to understand my schools lay out. Closest toilet to the field was a solid 3 minute walk and lets just say we were feeling a bit lazy. That&amp;#39;s when we noticed it. There it stood in all its glory, glistening in the sun, swaying in the wind; the tree that would change our lives forever. We had to grasp the opportunity at hand. Matty and I waltzed over to the beauty, unzipped out trousers and held our manhood with no shame in the world, pouring our contents out onto the soil below. We were the Alphas. We were the top dogs. That is until, we saw her. Ms Betty.\n\u00a0\nDeputy head mistress and chief enforcer at the time, she was your classic old fashioned teacher. Squeaky high pitched voice, but with a subtle dominance behind it. Catching her out of the corner of my eye storming towards us, I whispered &amp;quot;Matty, look&amp;quot;. What once were faces of pure joy and delight were replaced with fear and dropped jaws of horror. We quickly zipped up and tried slowly walking away as if nothing had happened, heads down. But it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You two, come over here right now!&amp;quot; She exclaimed. We meekly scampered over before she continued &amp;quot;get to my office straight away, and wash your hands before you get there&amp;quot;. There started the long walk of shame to her office. To make matters worse, as we walked across the field there was a line of teachers lined up outside the canteen, all staring and shaking their heads in dismay. They didn&amp;#39;t look angry, just disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we realised soon after is that good old Ms Betty was sitting there having her lunch and must have spotted us cock-in-hand halfway through a mouthful of food. Not the most appealing thing to see while eating right? This only added to her anger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we walked over to her office and she made us write a statement of what happened. Coincidentally (and very luckily), me and Matty both wrote the same bullshit lie about not wanting to be late to form on our statement so our story held together nicely, even though we hadn&amp;#39;t spoken about our cover up story prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Betty apparently wanted to give us a 2 week suspension for our offence. However, the headmaster at the time, being male and more sympathetic, and after speaking to both of us and calling our parents in, decided to get us in for 2 hours of &amp;quot;community service&amp;quot; for the school which consisted of us scraping chewing gum off the bottom of tables after school from 7:00-9:00.
