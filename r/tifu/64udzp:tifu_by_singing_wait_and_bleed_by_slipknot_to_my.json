My friend who was a bit weird, as in, like the kid who looked like he would gut you unless you showed him your best metal screams/growls. He introduced me to Slipknot and I fucking love Slipknot, still do. My jam in the 8th grade was Wait and Bleed, possibly thee most edgy song a rebellious middle schooler could listen to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day I was sitting at lunch with my group of friends, I normally would talk for a bit then the last 15 minutes listen to music. Well, our lunch room had a assistant moderator.

The whole time I&amp;#39;m increasing in volume the lunch room is dead quite because the moderator silenced us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it is me, one skinny pale boy, slowly getting louder and louder while singing butchered lyrics to a song I didn&amp;#39;t know fully. I&amp;#39;m looking down at the table singing, and I feel my friends hand tapping me, trying to get my attention. I keep singing despite this, thinking he&amp;#39;s trying to tell me a dumb story and my favorite part is about to come on, which is the loudest part. Now, I didn&amp;#39;t know this part but I&amp;#39;ll be damned if my little prepubescent body didn&amp;#39;t try its best to understand, then repeat the words. So as it comes on, I begin to yell and by yell I mean YELL. Finally after about 25 seconds of making this song my dirty bitch,I hear an adults voice bleed through my headphones, and it wasn&amp;#39;t Corey Taylor&amp;#39;s voice, it was the lunch moderator. She asked me what I was singing and why it was so important to interrupt her. I couldn&amp;#39;t fathom what just happened, that I just did a teen Idol performance to my whole middle school at lunch. So what do I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cry like a baby back bitch, that&amp;#39;s what I did&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was then given detention and couldn&amp;#39;t live it down for a year.
