I also wanted to back up my code on the cloud and the best way to do this is to upload the code to a website called GitHub. GitHub allows you to upload as much code as possible to their site but the only condition is that the code is public and can be seen by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where the FU happens. I was checking through my code making sure there wasn&amp;#39;t any sensitive information that could be seen by the public and I thought there was none, but I was wrong. The sensitive information I had was enough to access my Amazon Web Services account and create a shit ton of EC2 instances. Basically, EC2 instances are computers that run in the cloud, and because it takes a lot of infrastructure to run computers in the cloud, Amazon Web Services charged the user hourly to compensate for infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I uploaded my code to GitHub, and someone must have seen the sensitive information on my account. This person created hundreds of EC2 instances that costed $1.7/hour. I went to bed just after the hacker created all these EC2 instances and woke up to a notification from Amazon Web Services. They told me that there was suspected fraudulent activity and initially I thought it was just some super-paranoid security system that thought one of my actions was fraudulent activity, but I looked at the billing report and saw that AWS had billed me $369!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at what was causing this influx in billing (since I normally spend from $0 - $20 per month on AWS) and saw that 19 EC2 instances costing $1.7 /month had been running overnight. I started deleting all these EC2 instances and I thought everything was over, I just had to contact AWS Customer Support for a case on fraudulent activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I knew I had fucked up with my carelessness of posting sensitive information to a public forum, but I had another fear. You see, I am 15 years old, I only have $24.13 (I literally counted my parents coins merely weeks ago and after counting and telling them how much they had in coins, they gave me the money), and my parents are extremely frugal to the point where they get suspicious if I buy 30 pencils for $7.00. I had no idea how I was going to break to them that this happened and I was rushing my way to contact AWS Customer Service in order to convince them that this was fraudulent activity and I (my dad actually) don&amp;#39;t want to pay $369 in shit I didn&amp;#39;t want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AWS Customer Service were really helpful, they told me that I had a huge chance of getting compensated since $369 is such a small amount to them, and so Monday afterschool, I recheck the amount AWS had billed me and see that the number increased dramatically to $1700! I thought I had deleted everything the hacker created but I forgot to do one thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How Amazon Web Services works is that they have servers all around the world, in Mumbai, Northern Virginia, London, et cetera. And what users can do is they can create EC2 instances in different locations. The thing that AWS doesn&amp;#39;t do is tell all the EC2 instances in every single region. Meaning if you&amp;#39;re settings are on the Virginia region, you don&amp;#39;t know if any EC2 instances had been created in London if you don&amp;#39;t change the settings. So I changed the settings of my region and saw that the hackers created even more EC2 instances that I had not known at all (about 20 in each other region). Because there were about 80 instances running for about 8 hours, the bill grew from $369 to $1700.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to delete all the instances, I checked everything everywhere to make sure nothing would increase the cost, and decided to contact Amazon Web Services and they said $1700 isn&amp;#39;t too big to compensate so I was fine. But the story doesn&amp;#39;t end there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slept Monday night thinking everything was sunshines and butterflies, wake up knowing I will be compensated for my carelessness (even though I believe it to be one honest mistake), and see that the bill rose to $2433.02! (&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/C14ZY6I\"&gt;http://imgur.com/C14ZY6I&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is this even possible???! I decided to contact AWS Customer Service again and they kept telling me everything is fine and I will be compensated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while AWS Customer Service will get back to me in what they told me would be a week, I am worried that this won&amp;#39;t happen by the end of the month (post was written April 12 2017). The reason is because AWS doesn&amp;#39;t send the invoice automatically, they send the invoice at the end of the month. And if the invoice is sent before AWS Customer Service gives back the refund for all the unauthorized EC2 instances, then I will have to face a huge confronting with my parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this post is interesting enough, I may give an update on my situation, but as of right now, my life seems extremely shitty as I forgot to remove sensitive information before uploading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The day after I submitted this post, a customer service person from Amazon Web Services must have seen my post (&lt;a href=\"http://image.prntscr.com/image/36d8e8724060425bbb050d8c59a986ac.png\"&gt;http://image.prntscr.com/image/36d8e8724060425bbb050d8c59a986ac.png&lt;/a&gt;).
