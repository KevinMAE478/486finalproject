All is well for a week or more until one day I&amp;#39;m driving home and it tips over on it&amp;#39;s side. (Despite this story I&amp;#39;m not usually a complete idiot. I&amp;#39;m well aware of the dangers of battery acid.) Within minutes I arrive home, immediately open the back, and turn the 12v right side up again.

One day I notice a faint &amp;quot;sweet&amp;quot; smell when entering the car but can&amp;#39;t find the source (honestly I didn&amp;#39;t really try.) At one point I even opened the back for something else entirely. Standing inches away from the battery I eyeballed the area around it for any leaking, saw nothing, but still didn&amp;#39;t turn it right side up (???!!!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can guess what happened. Days later I have an interview for my dream job and decide to clean my car the day before (maybe I&amp;#39;ll find the source of that smell!) The second I tilt the battery right side up again and see the slightly damp patch under it I understand. I&amp;#39;d been inhaling the refreshing scent of battery acid slowly leaking into the carpet and hatchback area. Remember, this is directly atop that steel box of &lt;em&gt;really fuckin&amp;#39; important electrical stuff.&lt;/em&gt; I peeled back the carpet praying that was all but with each layer the trail of acid continued. I finally traced it to the very bottom where the spare is kept. Guys, there was about a half cup of battery acid pooled in the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gloved up and went through every bit of baking soda in my house trying to clean this up. I removed anything fabric, which was saturated in acid, soaked it in a baking soda solution. The back of the car looked a mess with baking soda, tools, and the still partially acid-soaked carpeting but I did the best I could and moved everything I could into the front passenger area. Miraculously, I opened the steel box and none of the hybrid components seem to have been touched! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuck Up #3:&lt;/strong&gt; I put off power-washing the carpet for some other day because I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk interviewing with chemical burns all over my body.

Feeling awesome I come back to a shattered car window (Not sure if nearby tree or random person did it.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I have baking soda, remnants of battery acid, and an astonishing amount of glass strewn about the interior. My car is old so replacement windows are: 1) insanely expensive 2) must come straight from the manufacturer. I&amp;#39;ve now waited almost a week for a company to receive and install the window but that\u2019s the least of my problems. Cut too\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; head to the carwash to power-wash that carpeting. Freak out yet again when I find several new corrosion spots from where I missed acid on the carpet that rests against the metal.

I rush home to shower immediately using garbage bags to carry the wet carpet home. I&lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; I protected the passenger seat too.
