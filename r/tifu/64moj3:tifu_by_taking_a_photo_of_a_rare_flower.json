My GF is a really keen hiker and as I need to clear my head from time to time we agreed that we will go for a hike on Sunday. She said she knew about beautiful place that was not so well known. It was only around a 20 minute ride by a train so we decided to go there. On Sunday, we got on a train a rode there, enjoying our little trip. When we got out of the train she mentioned that to that place leads no official rout, so we need to improvise a little bit. I didn\u2019t like the idea of improvising in the wild as I prefer the safer way of doing things but what could I do at that point. We went the way she felt was right. The slope got steeper and steeper, her pace was so fast i could barely keep up with her. I replaced everything I could from my pockets to my backpack so I would have more comfort while walking, including my wallet and our return tickets. After around an hour we we got to the top. I was panting heavily with sweat all over me while she looked as fine as she did down there. We decided (more like I forced her) to take a rest and enjoy the view. We sat down, we drank a little from the water we brought and enjoyed the scenery for a few minutes. After that she said that she got an idea of look around wether there isn\u2019t a better view. I wasn\u2019t very happy about it but i agreed. We got up and walked a little bit. Then i noticed something. In my language it\u2019s called Poniklec (Pulsatilla slavica for those wondering) and it\u2019s kind of a rare flower growing only on some places. I grows around the cliffs and rocky hills. I decided to take a photo. This grew on a slope that was getting steeper, so I decided to put down my backpack so it wouldn\u2019t restrict my hand while taking the photo with my mobile. This was a fatal mistake. As i placed it on the ground and turned around to take a photo, it rolled down the slope and dropped right off the cliff. We couldn\u2019t do anything but to watch it disappear with my wallet which included ID, driving licence, credit card, keys from my apartment, return tickets and all the money we had with us. We searched for it from both on and under the hill but after two hours of searching we had to catch the next train because it was the last one and leave there. We got on that train without any ticket so we could only pray so train personnel wouldn\u2019t catch us. Luckily they didn\u2019t. So in the end I got into my apartment by borrowing the keys I gave to friend of mine and then I spent the rest of the day in the police office announcing the loss of ID and driving licence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My backpack rolled off the cliff because I wanted to take a photo of a flower, so now I will spend following days by getting new cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Some of you asked for a photo so here it is: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/sj7dRCk\"&gt;http://imgur.com/sj7dRCk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "As I do not want to lie, i would like to say that this actually happened yesterday.
