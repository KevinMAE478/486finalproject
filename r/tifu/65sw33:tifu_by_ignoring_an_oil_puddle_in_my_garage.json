The old girl has a head gasket leak and throws oil on the outside of the engine, and I had just replaced the fuel petcock because it was leaking fuel.

I figure I was just running out of fuel and change the petcock to reserve; but I&amp;#39;m still losing power. I figure I&amp;#39;m just pushing her too hard and let off the throttle, since sometimes I&amp;#39;ve gotten more power out of her like that. Nothing. Still losing speed. I&amp;#39;m near the exit so I make my way over. Now I&amp;#39;m going dangerously slow for the highway and make my way over to the shoulder. I start braking in the lane because the shoulders around here are covered in gravel, and the last thing I need to do is to take a spill on the highway. During my braking, the rear tire starts to slide about, and I&amp;#39;m wondering if I popped my tire. As I get to the side of the road, the bike stalls out when I pull my clutch in. I look under me as I get off the bike and there&amp;#39;s shit loads of smoke pouring out of the engine area. I look behind me and see streaks of oil running down the road in the exact path that I took. There&amp;#39;s a huge puddle of oil and a good stream coming from the drain hole in the oil pan. I took a picture with my phone and sure enough, the drain bolt is missing! It fell out a mile ago, and I just lost all of my oil! I call my dad, who lives in the area for help. He takes me to an auto-parts store that&amp;#39;s still open on Easter. We find a drain bolt that fits, and some oil. We stop by my place to pick up some tools, shop rags, and gloves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back at the bike, before we even put oil in it, we try to crank it to see if it&amp;#39;s seized. A huge wave of relief meets me when it moves with no problem. We load it up with oil and limp it home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There, I break out the dish soap and the hose and start washing the oil off the brake, tire, and chain. As of now, it seems to run just fine.
