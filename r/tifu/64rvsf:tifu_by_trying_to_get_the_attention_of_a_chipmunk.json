In the winter, we put orange fiberglass stakes along our driveway so that the plows can see where the edges are through the snow. I was picking these up on a fine 60 degree day, at about 6:30pm, when I saw something out of the corner of my eye run behind a tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured this may be a chipmunk, but was curious, so I gave one of the stakes a whack into the remaining snow to get him to move so I could give him a look. Well, little did I realize, fiberglass stakes have a tendency to splinter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I picked my hand up from the stake, the stake came with it. I looked, and lo and behold, a splinter sticking out of the stake had gone through the pads of the ring and middle finger of my right hand, and was holding them together. The thought crossed my mind to pull it out, but I gave it a nudge and with it came agonizing pain, so I decided against that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked back to my house as quickly as the fiberglass through my fingers would allow, and gave the door a good kick. My mom came to the door, and I said, &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ve got a bit of a problem&amp;quot; as I watched the color drain from her face. She booked it to the car, and I followed, three foot stake and all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What followed was one of the worst car rides I&amp;#39;ve experienced. Of course, in my mother&amp;#39;s panic, she&amp;#39;s driving about 30 over, and is doing everything she can to get me to the nearest assistance (which happened to be a local quick care, important detail) as quickly as physically possible. Every bump she hit (which was quite often thanks to shitty Maine roads at the end of winter), the damn stake sticking out of my hand got jostled around, either hitting the ceiling or floor of the car, which didn&amp;#39;t feel particularly great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we arrive at the quick care, and the secretary goes and gets a doctor. Who goes to get another doctor. Who says we need to go the ER without even coming out to the waiting room to look. So, we make the executive decision to call an ambulance to come get me, in the hopes that they can do something about the pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy were we wrong. They cut down the length of the stake a little bit at least, so it didn&amp;#39;t hit anything after that. But that ride was WAY more bumpy, and I got jostled around quite a bit. At this point the adrenaline was beginning to wear off as well, so the pain was slowly getting worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We arrive at the hospital, and it is PACKED. Like something you&amp;#39;d see in a movie. In the waiting room there were kids screaming, a few burly men who seemed to have just gotten out of a fight, a basketball player with a broken arm, and a few dudes vomiting. Thankfully, since I had recently been &amp;quot;impaled,&amp;quot; as they put it, I got pretty high priority and got to skip the waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were so full there were no rooms available, so I got thrown in a hallway under a numbered plaque on the wall. There I sat for about an hour, until a doctor came along. On my way there, one of the EMTs moving me asked how I was doing. I looked him in the eye, &amp;quot;oh you know, Mondays man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a doctor comes along, and gives me four lidocaine shots in each impaled finger, which numbs them up pretty quickly. However, the doctor clearly has no clue how to best get this thing out, so he goes for backup. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He comes back with another doctor, who tells me &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no science to this, we&amp;#39;re just gonna have to pull this thing out.&amp;quot; Joy. So I prepare myself, and they begin to pull this thing out of my fingers. What I experienced during this was the worst pain of my life, its indescribable. They could see I was in quite a bit of pain (I was pale, shaky as hell, and had just about passed out at this point), so they have a nurse inject me with some sort of pain medicine. I wasn&amp;#39;t questioning it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They kept pulling, and at this point, I began to black out a little bit. My mother tells me I was screaming. But finally, what seems like eons later (about ten minutes) this thing is completely out. I get x-rays, which come back good, wash myself off, and go on my merry way. The whole ordeal only took about four hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I saw a chipmunk, tried to get its attention with a fiberglass stake. Wound up in the ER with two fingers pinned together by a large splinter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: pictures of the wounds, for those interested: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/rOsAC\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/rOsAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So, this happened yesterday, and was a wonderful way to top off my Monday evening. \n\nI live in Maine, and as such the snow is finally starting to melt.
