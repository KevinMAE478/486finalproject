This is my first post in tifu and it happened a couple of hours ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was cleaning my room because it is a horrible mess when I found my e-reader. Part of the sleep case that holds my e-reader in place was broken. My e-reader is a kobo e-reader from at least a generation before the current one and I haven&amp;#39;t seen any of these cases in stores lately so I figured that if I wanted it I needed to fix it. All I needed was the superglue from the living room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I grabbed the superglue which was a bottle with two mini super glues in to. I sat down put the case in front of me and randomly grabbed one of the two tubes. We hadn&amp;#39;t used the superglue in a long time so I wasn&amp;#39;t even sure if one of them was open. By chance I grabbed the previously opened one. When I squeezed it nothing came out. I checked the cover and I thought I saw one of those pointed tips that might relieve the blockage so I squeezed the cover on really tight, unscrewed it, and tried squeezing the bottle again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Superglue exploded everywhere. It went on the case about where I wanted it, on my bed around where I was siting, on any exposed skin, on my chin (luckily it didn&amp;#39;t get on my glasses or in my eyes), all over my clothes, and in my hair. The fumes were pretty bad and initially I thought I had somehow gotten some in my eyes too. Quickly I smeared the glue where I wanted it and scrapped off where I didn&amp;#39;t want it then made my way to the bathroom to see the damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hair was glued together in places, my skin grew hard in some places, my fingers were completely coated, my eyes were fine, and my clothes had little droplets all over them. Quickly I stripped and since I was scared to touch anything and get it stuck to me I asked my fiance for help to make a dish soap and salt scrub. I then scrubbed any spots that I could find and after my fiance checked I  scrubbed any spots that he had found. Then I had to deal with my hair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried brushing it out but it was stuck together too well and it just hurt to do it. So I cut my hair instead. My hair looks a little uneven in my mind but at least it is out and if I have to pay a professional to fix this then that is okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then took a bath to wash off all the salt and any little pieces of hair that were cut but didn&amp;#39;t come out. My skin feels a little raw in some places where I rubbed off the superglue and in some places I can&amp;#39;t remove the glue. On the bright side at least my case is fixed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR\nI randomly picked an opened and blocked tube of superglue to fix my e-reader case.
