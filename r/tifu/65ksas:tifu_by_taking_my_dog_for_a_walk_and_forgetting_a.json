The path we took was basically a large circle just under 4km in circumference. I Even made sure to let him outside before the walk to do his business. The walk started out fine, both of us at a good pace. The sun was shining, the air was warm, and trees are starting to bud new leaves. About Halfway through I noticed my dog was sniffing more than usual. &amp;quot;Crap.&amp;quot; I thought to myself. After checking my pockets I realized that I had forgotten to grab the plastic bag that was set out earlier in anticipation. This is an issue because in these suburbs there are no sidewalks, the houses are so close together that It was a wall-to-wall front lawn on either side, and the homeowners are all snobs. Obviously leaving dog poo on someone&amp;#39;s front lawn is a total dick move, and I do feel the shame of my the actions to follow, so I lightly tugged at the leash and urged my dog get a move on. On the last kilometer stretch, I knew it was happening. My dog hunches over right in the middle of a lawn and drops less than 70 cubic centimeters, and it is even worse because the house sits on a corner. It couldn&amp;#39;t make me feel any worse and it couldn&amp;#39;t be more obvious to anyone who may have seen. I saw a bed of pine needles a the base of a nearby evergreen and got it in my head that it would be better to use a fist full of pine needles and try to pick it up and bury it back in the bed of pine needles. The plan does not go well. Heat has made the poo difficult to pick up and it smears all into the grass and through my makeshift barrier onto my right hand. With the amount I now have one my hand, I go back in and try to get most of it off the lawn. I don&amp;#39;t do a very good job. I walk back to the base of the evergreen with my tried, oblivious dog in shame and bury everything I&amp;#39;ve carried beneath the other needles. Wiping my hand on the grass and the pine needles I try to get most of the poo off my hand, but I can&amp;#39;t. There were brown marks on my hand and a distinct smell wafting through the air whole kilometer walk back home. I even passed three people on bikes that were at some point downwind of me, so they definitely got a whiff. feelsbadman&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you live in that house, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;DR forgot to grab a plastic bag, got poo on my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Formatting&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\nIts a beautiful day in The midwest so I decide to take my dog for a pleasant walk through the suburbs.
