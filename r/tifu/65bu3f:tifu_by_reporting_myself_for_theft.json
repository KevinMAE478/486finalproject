We&amp;#39;d been out a fair while when we went to a bar that used to be a student favourite but had over time become a locals&amp;#39; pub popular with the residents of a nearby council housing estate. Most of the guys didn&amp;#39;t really fit in, with their skinny jeans and fancy shirts. I&amp;#39;ve always been a scruffbag so I didn&amp;#39;t stand out too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After one drink (my round by the way), everyone decided they wanted to get out of there and try another bar so we left quite quickly. About 10 metres out the door I realised I&amp;#39;d left my leather jacket behind. When I went back in to grab it, someone was picking it up off the seat it was on. I said &amp;quot;Oi, that&amp;#39;s mine&amp;quot; and he apologised saying he thought it was his because it looked similar. I slipped it on and caught up with my mates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the next bar we didn&amp;#39;t stay long enough to get back to my round. And we headed to a club. I Agreed to pay the lads way in instead of a round but when we got to the door I found I didn&amp;#39;t have my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously the guy going through my jacket in the Court Inn must have nicked it. This club was on the same road as the police station so I said to the lads that I was going to report it stolen and then I&amp;#39;d catch up with them in a bit. I went to the police station and there were about 4 policemen in the car park so I called one of them over and told him the tale. When they asked for a description of the guy I gave it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where I should have thought harder. He had hair about the same length and colour as me, beard about the same length as mine. He had eyes the same colour as me. He was about my height. He was wearing a t-shirt about the same colour as mine, Jeans like I was. And he&amp;#39;d said he had a leather jacket like mine so I told them he might be wearing a leather jacket. I told them all this, and that he was at the court, gave them my phone number and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the court inn wasn&amp;#39;t far and would be close to kicking out time I thought it would be a good idea if I went back and confronted the guy. So as I was wandering back I wanted to text the guys to let them know what was going on. I couldn&amp;#39;t find my phone. I was confused by this because I thought I remembered checking it in the queue for the club. Turns out the inside pocket of my leather jacket had a tear in the lining. As I&amp;#39;m almost at the pub I find my phone, my wallet and an old work ID in the lining of my jacket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relieved I turn around to head back to the club right as two police officers are stepping out of a car behind me. I walk towards them thinking I&amp;#39;ll tell them I reported a crime and that I wanted to cancel the report. They came over and said they were investigating a theft and I suspect I wasn&amp;#39;t very clear in my explanation because when I said something like &amp;quot;no, I&amp;#39;ve got the wallet back&amp;quot; they asked to see it. Saw it had my ID in it. Saw I matched the description of the thief and started arresting me. I don&amp;#39;t think it helped that on my driving licence I had no beard and at this point I had quite a full beard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they got me back to the station they had my phone and rang it to try and get in touch with me. When it rang they thought I must have taken that as well. I tried to explain that I was me and I was mistaken when I said my wallet was stolen but I was nervous, drunk and rambling so they didn&amp;#39;t really get it. But they did say if it was my phone, could I unlock it. I was shaking nervous and drunk and I got my pin wrong three times and that was that. They processed me and tossed me in a cell overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the morning, a sober me was easily able to explain that I was me and that this was all a big misunderstanding and in the clear light of day they could see that I matched my ID and I was let go with a warning about wasting police time and filing false police reports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Thought I&amp;#39;d had my wallet nicked.
