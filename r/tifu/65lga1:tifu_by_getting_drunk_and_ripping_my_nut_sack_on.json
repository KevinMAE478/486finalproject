Long story short I&amp;#39;m a small town guy that lives in Colorado. I picked one of my best friends up and headed down to Denver to party and possibly get laid. We get down there and start drinking really really fast. I blacked out and woke up with blood all over me just fucking soaked in blood from head to toe. Apperently me and my friend got into a fight and he bit me on my chest and almost broke my nose! I did give him a black eye so I felt better about the situation. OK so I wake up and my boy tells me that my truck is somewhere on the highway broken down! I&amp;#39;m like wtf!! Y?!! He told me he was driving my truck back to the hotel from the bar when my truck started to smoke. OK fml! I&amp;#39;m super hungover and drenched in blood and start walking to my truck that was broken down on the freeway. I get there and start my truck up. It starts!!! OK cool. I try and put it into gear because it&amp;#39;s a 1998 Toyota tocoma and it does not go into gear. Fuck!! My friend sucks at driving standard but he was a lot sober then I was so that&amp;#39;s Y he drove but he told me he stalled the truck a lot and grinded the fucking gears! OK so he leaves for his GFS house and I&amp;#39;m alone. Thank god I had tripleA and called then for help. An hour later he shows and asks Y I&amp;#39;m soaked in blood lol. I give him the run down and tell him i live in Fairplay which is like 2 hours away from Denver. I also ask him to get me more beer from the store because I needed to get this hangover done and over with plus I was just depressed and wanted to get drunk again so he happily obliges. I&amp;#39;m drinking in the triple A tow truck and headed back home. 2 hours later I&amp;#39;m back home safely with my broken down truck in the driveway. I&amp;#39;m drunk as Fuck and my front door is locked and I left my key in the house!! Fml again! My back door is always unlocked.OK.....I have jumped this fence a million times..... when I was sober. It&amp;#39;s a chain link fence with a weird pointy metal piece on top. I try and jump over and I slip and my pant leg gets caught up and i land face first on the other side of the fence. I have a big hole near my crotch of my pants and a stinging pain on my nutsack. I look and more blood is coming from my groin area. I look at my nut sack and there is a major cut. I could actually see my bloody nut! I&amp;#39;m drunk so I don&amp;#39;t feel much pain. I slowly get up and limp to my neighbors house. OK by this time I&amp;#39;m bloody from head to toe with torn ass pants! I knock on my neighbors door and he starts to freak!! It looked like someone tried to murder me lol. He calls my mom and she rushes home to take me to the hospital which is a hour away from Fairplay. I was fine the whole way there because I was drunk and just did not give a fuck. Singing and rapping all the way to the hospital in salida. I get there and the Doc said I came very close to damaging my nut but everything looked good I just tore my nut sack skin wide open. He gives me a shot to numb the pain and stitches me up. I could not feel shit anyways but whatever. I&amp;#39;m finally done in the ER and head home to finally drink myself to sleep. 2 big bottles of wine. I wake up the next day and it feels like I got my nuts stomped on. Thank god for vicodin! Anyways I have not jumped that fence drunk or sober!! TL;DR So 5 years ago I got drunk in Denver, fought with my best friend who bloodied me all up and almost broke my nose ummm called triple A and got drunk coming back home from Denver. Left my keys in my house so I could not get into the front door and jumped my fence and tore my nutsack! Yep 5 years ago I fucked up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "OK this happened like 5 years ago but I feel like I must share.
