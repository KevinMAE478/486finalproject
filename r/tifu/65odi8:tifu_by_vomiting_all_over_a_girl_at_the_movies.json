Somehow two of those meetings cancelled on me at the last minute so I was stuck with about two hours to kill before the show started and I didn&amp;#39;t want to go back home.

There is a park in the middle of the city where I live so I decided to go there and drink while I wait. I must have been drinking really fast because I was almost done with the whole bottle by the time the guys I was going to the movie with showed up. There were four of us,two guys and two girls and I had been flirting with one of the girls for a while and she was into it so I decided to sit next to her during the movie.

I turn towards her and as I&amp;#39;m about to say yes all this vomit shoots out of my mouth all over her legs and feet. I remember her screaming out loud and then she was insulting me and then I passed out. I woke up in the bathroom surrounded by a group of people and the only one I could recognise was my guy friend. He told me that after I passed out I was carried out of the cinema by security and they were splashing water on my face to wake me up. I had to pay the equivalent of $20 to the guy who cleaned up the mess I made. I was told the girls left right after I passed out.
