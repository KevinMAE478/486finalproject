One of my friends (let&amp;#39;s say his name is Carl) had a bit too much tequila and basically had blacked out before the night started. None of us realized how drunk he was because we were all a bit drunk and having a good time. As we were walking down the strip, Carl thought it would be a great idea to give this girl in our group a piggy-back ride. She hopped on his back and not three steps in, Carl fell forward, face-planting into the sidewalk. When the girl got off and Carl stood to his feet, his mouth was bleeding and he had chipped his front tooth in half. Luckily his insurance is covering it so it will be fine in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to last night. My friends and I went out to the bars like any other Friday night. We went to one of the more trashy nightclubs in our area which is known to get people quite drunk. This was the first mistake. We left at about midnight and were planning on going to another bar not too far away. A girl we were with (let&amp;#39;s call her Sarah) decided she wanted a piggy-back ride and my drunken self figured I was sober enough to give her one. She got on my back and for whatever reason, I tried to sprint as fast as I could with her on my back. Even in my drunken state I knew this was a bad idea. The memory of Carl face-planting a couple weeks before was on my mind, but apparently I don&amp;#39;t learn from past mistakes. As I gained more and more speed, I could sense that it wasn&amp;#39;t going to end well. Our center of gravity shifted forward and I ended up toppling over just like Carl. The difference from the Vegas incident was that this time, it was the receiver of the piggy-back ride who face planted with full force into the sidewalk. Instantly, I felt horrible and was afraid to see the damage when Sarah rose to her feet. Lo and behold, her mouth was bleeding and she had chipped three different teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes this story slightly funny is that Carl and Sarah are basically dating and for the moment they have matching chipped teeth. It&amp;#39;s couple goals for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I drunkenly gave a girl a piggy-back ride which ended in her chipping 3 of her teeth on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This happened last night but as a precursor, I'm going to need to go back a couple weeks.\n\nOn the last day of our spring break, we spent the night in Las Vegas.
