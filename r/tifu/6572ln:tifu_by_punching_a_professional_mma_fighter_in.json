The crowd was a little older and my sister knew a lot of them since she worked at a nearby golf course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister gets up to the bathroom and after awhile I decide I need to go pee too. As I&amp;#39;m walking to the bathroom my sister comes up to me in hysterics, crying telling me someone followed her in the (single stall) bathroom. She said it was an older guy and he pushed the door open and said some nasty shit to her and threatened her. I won&amp;#39;t go into details, but I was pissed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my drunken state, I made her point him out to me. Unfortunately, due to some extra beers I had, I didn&amp;#39;t see exactly who she was pointing at and picked the wrong guy. I run up to the guy who I thought did this to her and ask what the fuck he was thinking. The guy looked surprised. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I decide it&amp;#39;s a good idea to punch this huge motherfucker square in the left eye. I got him good and left a mark (found out the next day I gave the poor guy a shiner). I then realize I am an idiot and fully expect to be punched back. I feel no matter who hits you, man or woman, you should defend yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next thing I know, he&amp;#39;s holding me in a headlock so tight I can&amp;#39;t breathe. People are telling him to let go because my face is turning red. He finally lets me go and I run away in defeat and embarassment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cops are called and I fully expect to be arrested. I deserved it.

I told them I&amp;#39;d never go back there and I was sincerely sorry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a bit sore for a few days after on my neck, but I deserved it. I&amp;#39;m never punching anyone again. It was my first fight and my last. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the guy who did that to my sister got off too, but she was happy I stuck up for her, despite getting the wrong guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: my sister got threatened in a bathroom, I got drunk pissed and punched the guy who I thought did it, but was wrong and endes up punching the owner of the bar who is also an MMA fighter.
