So the curious mind in me started taking the pen I should have been taking notes with apart, just to see how it worked. After I got it apart I decided to try and write with just the stick of ink. Finally after a fair amount of doodling I end up snapping the tip of the ink cartridge straight off!

So there was the end of my fun. Now this was a warm spring day and this room didn&amp;#39;t have AC so it was quite warm in the room. My teacher goes to wipe her brow with her hand, and ended up wiping most of her face when suddenly the whole class burst into hysterical laughter as her face turned blue! Meanwhile I shrunk into a corner realizing what had happened. The ink from my pen had gotten all over her hand and she smeared it all over herself.
