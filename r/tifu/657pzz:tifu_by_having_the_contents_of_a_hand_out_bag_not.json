I went to check the contents of the bag, and I found a few handouts for college readiness and a pencil. &amp;#39;Fine addition to my collection,&amp;#39; I thought to the pencil.

As I stepped down a bit of stairs, one of the papers in the bag hit the back of my right leg, causing the point of collision to call out &amp;quot;nerve&amp;quot;ously. I thought nothing of it until I went to feel the point of collision, and I saw blood. Fearing the worst, I went to look at the wound, and blood was streaming down my leg.

I let my guard down and the bag hit the left side of my right knee, and what do you know! The pencil stabbed me this time! Adredaline rushing, about 2/3 of the pencil tip was stuck in my leg. I pulled it out, and blood started streaming from my leg. Bonus: the 2/3 of the pencil tip was still in my leg! Not knowing of it yet, I had to wait till I got to the cafeteria to get the medical supplies to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, on the way, I had to get a bandaid for the new wound, plus one for the old wound because it came off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bandaid count: 3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got to the cafeteria and found one of the maids.
