PS your getting downvoted cos you said u like BF1.  xD\nWhat i say below are the absolute basics, some may disagree or agree. \n\nSpotting Q key, is your ultimate friend. Spot THEN fire at the target. Meaning if you die, hopefully from your spot, he will die anyway. Spot any jets (Especially enemy ones flying in ur base. The base gun will shoot at any jet SPOTTED) also, say im flying around in a jet. If you need my help getting rid of a vehicle, a spotted one draws my attention! If you want to drive/fly, to get the hang of various vehicles, use the TEST RANGE available like the campaign is. Its a small map with pretty much all the weapons and vehicles ready to jump in and use. Practice away.  ;)\n\nGamemodes : You will be lucky to find more than TDM, RUSH and CONQUEST. Also *mostly* US and Euro servers. They are just whats popular.  :)\n\nRoles: These were changed from BF4 to BF1, so they will have a different role than what you are used to, but not majorly. Different name, same job, also 1 different selection of main weapons per class, but then the 3 default other classes of weapon choice.\n- **Assault Class = BF4 Medic** : So everything basically Medics have in BF1 but nothing for Anti-tank.\n- **Pilot + Tanker = BF4 Engineer** : Basically the same thing, but the main class for Anti-tank. There is no vehicle class.\n- **Support = BF4 Support** : Actually doesnt change much from BF1.\n- **Recon/Scout = BF4 Recon** : Again basically the same, just different gadgets appropriate to the Era.\nOh and make sure you are in a large squad. You select squad perks in the customization area. This will get the squads perk points needed to get those perks from assisting each other in some way. If you all die, you lose those points and have to gain them again.\n\n**Planes/jets** : Obviously different speeds, different turning circle, everything you would expect. Practice is your friend. If you hate them, avoid any maps without an MAA or no cover like the Naval DLCs.\n**Heli's** : Awesome if you know how and fun. Siege of Shanghai is a heli's dream. So if u hate them DO NOT GO ON THAT MAP! lol\n**Tanks/Vehicles** : Can provide awesome cover on the ground for infantry, but as infantry can be your most hated enemy.\n\nLearn to adapt and change to engineer, to combat ground or air threats. So many do not and just sit and bitch and moan about a vehicle/heli/jet that is dominating them instead of trying to take it down in any way they can. I might go 1 - 100 (i dont care about my KD ratio) to make sure a heli on SoS map doesnt rape all game.\n\nAs for weapon/loadout choices. Then as you say, it really is up to you. What i can say is basically lights are useless, laser sights for extra hipfire accuracy can give you away. All attachments have at least 1 negative side-effect, for example \"Muzzle Break\"  -10% upwards recoil, but +12.5% spread increase per shot. You can use symthic.com to give you the stats of each weapon, attachment, etc to help you choose or use what feels best to u.\n\nBut for the love of god, do not use lock-on weapons on the ground as infantry or vehicles, except for Anti-Air no one can blame u for that. It just has ZERO skill and makes u look even more nooby lol. Try using a SRAW, UCAV, TOW or TV missile. They are impressive kills to see! Also in an aircraft/heli i dont blame the use of lock-on weapons, its hard enough to fly, never mind aim, unless ur pro at it.\n\nMaybe this was useful, maybe not... but have fun learning.  ;)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR   Was thinking about this last night, was too tired lol.
