Most of the decent undergrad programs require portfolios (that goes for other design fields as well), and building that portfolio through coursework and practice is important. Look for summer architecture programs geared towards High Schoolers where you take a four-six week course to introduce you to architecture. It could also be an effective way of confirming whether you want to actually pursue a degree, since if it doesn&amp;#39;t appeal to you you can easily pivot when it comes time to apply to schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "architecture", "name": "t1_dg812pa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138519.0, "created_utc": 1492109719.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhae", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652osn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhae", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652osn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgctwtb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jacka10pe", "parent_id": "t1_dgctuhg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/architecture", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh wait, just read your GPA and SAT, never mind ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, just read your GPA and SAT, never mind &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "architecture", "name": "t1_dgctwtb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492417924.0, "created_utc": 1492389124.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgctuhg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jacka10pe", "parent_id": "t3_652osn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/architecture", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://architecture.rice.edu", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://architecture.rice.edu\"&gt;https://architecture.rice.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "architecture", "name": "t1_dgctuhg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492417837.0, "created_utc": 1492389037.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhae", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652osn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdy91y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YoStephen", "parent_id": "t3_652osn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/architecture", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ignore the rankings.
