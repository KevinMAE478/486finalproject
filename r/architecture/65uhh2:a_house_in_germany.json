The closest it comes to either is the formwork in the concrete, and the use of concrete, itself.  Sadly, that's not enough to qualify it as neo-anything. \n \nThis house is in Stuttgart, where the temperatures are middling. This alone refutes your point about heat and cold to a great degree, without even considering that coatings on windows, in this century, go a long way to mitigate solar gain and its chilly counterpart. Furthermore, half of these big windows are on the north face of the building (should I condescend you by presuming that you don't know what this means?). As to the windows' transparency, the half of the home you're seeing is the *public* side of the home. The private areas of the home are not glazed (They're quite opaque, actually). Furthermore, there is a strong tradition in northern european homes of transparency of common spaces toward the outside. It is a source of pride for people to be able to see into the more public spaces in your home. This is assuming that the house is as visually accessible as you seem to want it to be... but it's not. It's on a hillside, and far from any public thoroughfare.\n\nYou do realize that glazing during the day basically acts as a mirror on the exterior of a building, especially in circumstances where the glass is designed for such purposes? Curtains aren't necessary during the day. Curtains at night (to provide privacy) do no harm to the \"sought-after\" aesthetic (which you also presumed), as the windows act like a mirror to the *inside* of a home at nigh.

The closest it comes to either is the formwork in the concrete, and the use of concrete, itself.  Sadly, that&amp;#39;s not enough to qualify it as neo-anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This house is in Stuttgart, where the temperatures are middling. This alone refutes your point about heat and cold to a great degree, without even considering that coatings on windows, in this century, go a long way to mitigate solar gain and its chilly counterpart. Furthermore, half of these big windows are on the north face of the building (should I condescend you by presuming that you don&amp;#39;t know what this means?). As to the windows&amp;#39; transparency, the half of the home you&amp;#39;re seeing is the &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; side of the home. The private areas of the home are not glazed (They&amp;#39;re quite opaque, actually). Furthermore, there is a strong tradition in northern european homes of transparency of common spaces toward the outside. It is a source of pride for people to be able to see into the more public spaces in your home. This is assuming that the house is as visually accessible as you seem to want it to be... but it&amp;#39;s not. It&amp;#39;s on a hillside, and far from any public thoroughfare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do realize that glazing during the day basically acts as a mirror on the exterior of a building, especially in circumstances where the glass is designed for such purposes?
