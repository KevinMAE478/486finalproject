It&amp;#39;s not offending people; it&amp;#39;s offending (a very small minority of) culinary artists, cooks, and chefs who appreciate szechuan cuisine and the szechuan sauce used in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions I have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the McDonald&amp;#39;s szechuan really that bad? I can&amp;#39;t see it being any worse than a local Chinese takeout establishment&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What gives the Chinese takeaway place the privilege of producing szechuan sauce, and not a chain such as McDonald&amp;#39;s?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that it is acceptable for a Chinese takeout establishment to produce and distribute szechuan sauce, what if all members of the staff are white? Does the authority to produce szechuan sauce lie in the name of the establishment, or those who work there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who has a greater authority to produce szechuan sauce: a, African-American chef with a culinary degree and years of experience, or a Chinese man who has no experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course my premise could be entirely wrong and there is another reason why it&amp;#39;s deemed offensive. If that is the case PLEASE inform me. However, as of right now with the information I have, I am going to say the McDonald&amp;#39;s production of szechuan sauce is &lt;strong&gt;not offensive or &amp;quot;racist,&amp;quot; and should proceed should the demand for it stay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CringeAnarchy", "name": "t1_dgdn63q", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472592.0, "created_utc": 1492443792.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35j1r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v6kw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdxw3v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rebelicious49", "parent_id": "t3_65v6kw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CringeAnarchy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Give me my delicious racism!!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give me my delicious racism!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CringeAnarchy", "name": "t1_dgdxw3v", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484584.0, "created_utc": 1492455784.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35j1r", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v6kw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdsokn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ArgonBorn", "parent_id": "t3_65v6kw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CringeAnarchy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heatstreet?
