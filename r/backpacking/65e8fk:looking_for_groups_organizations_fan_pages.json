Also if you know traveling organizations anywhere on the world (Europe would be awesome but anywhere is fine) that is making traveling to destinations such as catacombs, fortresses, maybe even ancient and forgotten towns. Would love if you could help me find ANY of them (it can be really anything, small organization with like 15 people in it that care about small ruin of some type of castle or anything). Also would appriciate very much if you could direct me to some subredits (if there is any that you know) that discuss topics like this.
