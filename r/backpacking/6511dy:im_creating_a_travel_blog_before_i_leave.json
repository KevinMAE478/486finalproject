Even then, if you don&amp;#39;t have solid content or give up on building an audience, your blog will fall apart. It is about persistence and making this a priority every single day. That is why starting your own venture can end up taking up all of your time. Just don&amp;#39;t go into this thinking that you&amp;#39;ll be making good money right away. Otherwise, everyone and their dog would be doing the same exact thing. Save up money, start your blog, and produce good content. In a few years, you might be able to thank yourself now for starting it when you did. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "backpacking", "name": "t1_dg6ywvk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077898.0, "created_utc": 1492049098.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6511dy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6511dy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6511dy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6511dy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb5k4x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sportbackpacker", "parent_id": "t1_dgadekr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/backpacking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can see but any comm nuts are great I'm beginning to like it a little here so far.
