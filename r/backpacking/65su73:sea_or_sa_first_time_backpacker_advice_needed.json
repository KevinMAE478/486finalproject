But I want to go where I can stretch my money most, learn about culture and spirituality, and really dive into travel to get inspire to write and take pictures. Also, how does the SEA rail system work between countries? Thank you!! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi. I am planning to go backpacking next year in April.
