This will be my first attempt at true backpacking. I am going on a solo trip(for the most part). I will have friends from college meeting me up in a couple of the cities for a reunion. I wanted to mention this as it somewhat explains why my backpacking route is illogical in a sense(it doesn&amp;#39;t follow the shortest path). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways I am going start my trip in Barcelona, staying there for 4 nights and catching a game at Camp Nou. Then planning to travel to Milan(just a stop over) and catching a train to Cinque Terre. I plan to spend a day or two there and hike across the 5 villages. I want to explore Florence, Rome, and Venice within that week, maybe 10 days and if time permits then Pisa. After that head to Verzasca Dam to do the Goldeneye Bunjee jump. From there head to Amsterdam, Budapest, Prague, Berlin(in that order and for this part I will have my friends visiting me, thus I am not too flexible with this portion of my trip. We plan to visit those 4 cities over a 2 week period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this I am left with 17 days. I wanted to fly back to Spain to explore Granada, Madrid, and of course party in Ibiza. My return flight back to the States is from Paris. I have kept the trip loosely planned so as to allow myself the flexibility to go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted suggestions regarding some cities I could visit on the way or bucket list items that I should totally not miss out on while in Europe from fellow travelers who are experienced with backpacking in Europe. I am open to visit other countries or change routes. Only parts of my trip which aren&amp;#39;t flexible are the 4 cities with my friends, the bungee jump, and game at Camp Nou. Barcelona play Villareal so I am super excited. Let me know who you support and how you feel about the game if you follow soccer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also like suggestions on things to do in the cities that I am visiting. I engage in smoking trees(fellow Ents) and exploring the world around me via magic mushrooms. Needless to say that I am really excited about the Amsterdam bit. If anyone has experience with these activities in Amsterdam or anywhere else in Europe, please let me know as I would be totally interested in receiving advice regarding how to engage in these activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my post.

You should probably buy a metro ticket, but keep in mind that the tickets are only checked by attendants on cars and very sporadically at that, so if you shut up and keep your head down and look/act Czech, you should be cool. I you like art, the Czech Narodni Galerie is one of the finest in the world and you could spend a week just in there. It's near Strossmayerovo Namesti. Definitely check out Vaclavske Nam and Wenceslas Square as well as Old Town. Everybody is going to make a big deal about the clock tower in Staromesta Nam, but it's shit. It's mildly interesting, lasts ~10 seconds, and is uber crowded. Definitely go to a few coffee shops (not costa or any of the big chains, they're essentially starbucks). My personal favorite is a little place call Alchemista in Praha 7 right next to the Sparta stadium. As for bars, there are a million in Prague. If you're looking for a club, go to Lucerne as it's big and fun and usually has good (sometimes live) music. If you're looking for a place that has the club atmosphere but feels a lot more real and local, there's this place called Vozorkovna or something right next to Narodni Divadlo or Narodni Trida. It's a surprisingly big place and you can dance with super rad live acts or chill in a lounge area or sip cocktails on a catwalk, plus they have a giant dog who just kinda wanders around. Zly Casy (Czech for Evil Time) is a three story craft beer bar with some of the best beer selection in Prague, but it's definitely out of the way out in Nusle. If you take the tram from the center to Namesti Bratri Synku it's a one minute walk, but about a half hour outside the center.
