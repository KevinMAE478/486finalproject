Here's a list of places and my person take on each (everyone likes things differently, so keep that in mind).\n\nMedellin - I've been working here for a month. There is plenty to do, the city is beautiful and clean, good wifi (for me important), and you can find any kind of food in the world (chinese, sushi, thai, indian, medeteranian) which is harder in other areas\n\nareas\npoblado\nparty hostel - happy buddha\nchill hostel - bambu glamping\n\nGuatape - must go. Google pictures and you can see why. It's a day trip from Medellin\nCartegena - I didn't like it. To me it was a mix between Dubruvnik and Lisbon, but not impressive as either. There are a shit ton of prostitutes as well and it's a bit expensive. A lot of people go here because they want beaches, but I lived on a beach for two years so I didn't care for it. That being said, I would still go, it's a very popular place and most people work there way east from here. \nBarranquilla - east of Cartegena, a total shit hole. The only reason I went was for Carnival. \nSanta Marta - when I was there it was hot as living hell (35/40C or 100+ F). There isn't much to do in the city, but it's the biggest city near taganga/tayrona/minca so you will have to pass through it. \n\nthe party hostel right outside of santa marta (closest to Tayrona park) is the Dreamer Hostel. It's great, they have a pool, which you need with the heat. It's two blocks from the main road where you can get a bus to Tayrona. \n\nTaganga - a small interesting little town. I liked it because they have some good diving, but there isn't too much going on. \nTayrona Park - a must see in the North. Great beaches, just be prepared to hike in :)\nLost City Trek - met a number of people who did this, but I opted out because I'm doing Machu Pichu. Everyone had good things to say about this. \nCosteno beach - skipped because I don't like beaches (and the sand flies are apparently horrible)\nPalamino - see costeno beach \nBogota - I don't plan on going because people say it's just a big city with 6million people or something. A bit big for me. \nSolento - going in two weeks. Super pumped. They apparently have the best mountain biking trek in Colombia, and I like green and I'm pumped to see some coffee plantations (this is coffee region)\nCali - a much more local city than Bogota or Medellin. It is known for salsa, so I imagine it will be a great way to learn salsa and improve my Spanish (going in three weeks)\nLeticia - most southern city in Colombia. I only include it because I did a bunch of research around this area. You can take a boat down the Amazon to Iquitos, the largest city in the world without road access. You can only fly or boat here. I'm going to end up taking a boat through Peru here instead based on my schedule. \n\nOther notes to help with budgeting. \n\nBudget ~10/day on hostels, even though you can generally find hostels for 7-8, that's 300/month 900 in three months. Leaves you 2100. The lost trail is ~200, flights and buses up to the North are ~30usd one way from Medellin and similar from Bogota. Meals will range depending on where you are. You can find standard local meals in non-populated areas for 2-3, but you are generally going to pay anywhere from 3-10 (the upper range for this is really only in Poblado area of Medellin as far as I've seen) for a meal. \n\nIf you make your way down to Peru, which I highly recommend from what I've heard, buses from Medellin to Lima take 4 days and cost ~220, flights the last time I looked are about 400, but I haven't done too much research. The Inca Trail costs an insane ~500, so if you want to do Machu Pichu, there is an adventure tour that costs 150-200 depending your haggling skillz where you white water raft, mountain bike, and spend a day hiking in. People who have done it RAVED (plus its the cheapest tour to get there) and you don't spend 4 days in the Peruvian jungle. \n\nAny questions about anything more specific let me know. \n\nEDIT: I forgot all about Minca. Go. It's absolutely beautiful, you get there from Santa Marta. /u/TucoTheUgliest mentioned casa elemento. This seems to be a pretty popular place. They do family dinners and they have hammocks (massive like 10-15 person hammocks) that look out over mountains. At nighttime you can see Santa Marta in the distance. I only was able to spend a day here, but I could easily spent a week. Problem is most places have absolutely shit wifi. \n ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need three months just for Brazil, to do it semi extensively. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in Colombia for about two months now and I&amp;#39;ve done most of the North.

If I ever showed up in the morning at a hostel and they told me that the place was closed from like 10am-2pm for cleaning and whatnot, I&amp;#39;d put my luggage in the luggage room and lock it to something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a great chain/lock, it&amp;#39;s more so that a potential thief will skip over your bag in favor of an unlocked on. In my experience, if someone is gonna steal from the luggage room they&amp;#39;re not gonna stick around rooting thru bags but instead will just grab a bag and leave \u2014 note I traveled a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; and heard about it happening after the fact like once or twice so it&amp;#39;s a pretty rare occurrence. If there&amp;#39;s nothing to lock your bag to but you&amp;#39;re traveling with someone else, you can also lock your bags together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It couldn&amp;#39;t hurt to book beforehand, but I normally just showed up. You increase your chances of getting a bed at a busy hostel if you show up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wait until you get there without reserving a spot, have a backup plan even if it&amp;#39;s just &amp;quot;sleep in the bus station for the night&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small chain and lock might be useful for luggage rooms. I&amp;#39;ve never heard about someone losing their backpack from the room they&amp;#39;re staying in (although I&amp;#39;m sure it happens once in a while), just, on extremely rare occasions, from the luggage room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "backpacking", "name": "t1_dgbdroj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492329691.0, "created_utc": 1492300891.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga6j50", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "badasstrvlwrtr", "parent_id": "t1_dg8ogul", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/backpacking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey!
