The military bags tend to forgo comfort. Looking at close up images, I suspect that the shoulder straps are a bit on the thin side, the buckle and strap on the hipbelt seem a little small (huge amount of strain on that buckle!), the tubing frame, although light looking, is going to be hell to customize to you back shape (a nice feature to have on internal packs) and the back padding itself seems a little limited. On the plus side, the spindrift collar on the opening is great, and the fabric looks like it&amp;#39;s good quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "backpacking", "name": "t1_dg68n8j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047964.0, "created_utc": 1492019164.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65o5v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Quillox", "parent_id": "t1_dg64ulx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/backpacking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We are talking of a 1kg difference right ?
