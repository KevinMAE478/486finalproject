", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey! I just finished backpacking through SE Asia for two months. I will agree with others that a loose plan is the best one. I had a rough idea of the route I wanted to take, but nothing was set in stone. Things change, you might meet people and travel with them for a bit, you might get a great recommendation on a little town to visit, etc. I knew there were a few cities I really wanted to visit and I had a general idea of the order I&amp;#39;d visit each country in. Really the most important thing to plan ahead is visas, however in places like Cambodia you can get them on arrival. Just make sure you have the proper documentation, cash, and extra passport photos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheap flights are fairly easy to book a week in advance. However I wouldn&amp;#39;t limit yourself to only flights. Look into trains and buses as other ways to get around.
