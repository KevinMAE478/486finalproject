You&amp;#39;re done!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With 3 days around 4,500 feet of climbing, this will not be easy, and the 1st day requires some good route-finding and a head for heights. Feel free to play around with it, the only big view you&amp;#39;d be missing would be the Aiguillette des Posette ridgewalk, which is quite scenic but you&amp;#39;ll get most of the view from Col du Balme and Lac Blanc. Also keep in mind, the Fenetre d&amp;#39;Arpette on Day 1 may be impassable without micro-spikes depending on how early in July you&amp;#39;re going and how May is for snow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask me more questions, I love talking about the TMB!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "backpacking", "name": "t1_dg65hzx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492044786.0, "created_utc": 1492015986.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yzuo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yzuo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ta00", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cherlanda", "parent_id": "t1_dg67ziw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/backpacking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks I'll check them out!
