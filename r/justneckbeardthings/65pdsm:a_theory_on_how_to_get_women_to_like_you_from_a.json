The meathead-image-Chad usually describes very simple-minded people. However, simpletons are usually very nice and friendly people. The frat-boy image is the one that usually comes to mind. Those people rarely ever succeed in this world without nepotism. Real &amp;quot;Chads&amp;quot; are usually intelligent. Especially when it comes to social-intelligence. Typically, more intelligent than the neckbeards (who tend to think of themselves as the most intelligent). I&amp;#39;ve known a few &amp;quot;Brogrammers&amp;quot; in my SE careeer. Mate selection for humans is, typically, the same as animals. Shelter, safety, support, symmetry. Symmetry is also considered the science of beauty. If your face and body are not at least mostly symmetrical, you won&amp;#39;t be considered attractive.
