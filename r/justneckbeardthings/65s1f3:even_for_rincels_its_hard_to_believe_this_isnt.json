She was pretty clear about her, uh, extensive experience. I was clear about my complete lack of experience. The date went fantastically well, we went back to my place, made out, she wanted more, I said I wasn&amp;#39;t ready, she left it at that and I took her home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our next date she came over to hang out, and I decided I was done with the virgin thing, and was trying to get her to sleep with me. Well, meanwhile she decided she wasn&amp;#39;t sure if she wanted to be my first, and just wanted to date. So I did the asshole, &amp;quot;C&amp;#39;mon, you&amp;#39;ve been with a bunch of people, why does it matter? Blah blah blah&amp;quot; crap. Also, sidenote, girl was a rape survivor and there&amp;#39;s my dumbass trying to pressure her into having sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I got us dinner and she&amp;#39;s super quiet and stuff, but I was too oblivious to realize there was anything wrong. After dinner she texts a friend asking her to call her pretending there was a car accident, and bolts out of there, and I didn&amp;#39;t hear from her again...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until two months later when she randomly texted me out of the blue to tell me that by crazy random happenstance, she and some friends were moving into the apartment next to mine. A couple weeks after she moved in, she invited me over and we chatted and got drunk, and I&amp;#39;d lost my virginity and pulled my head out of my ass by then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We cleared the air and I apologized profusely. And then we became fuck buddies for a couple months before she moved again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2013 was a crazy year for me, it was seriously like something out of a coming of age movie or something. Especially because it has a happy ending; during that time I met my girlfriend of three and a half years who I intend to marry some day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "justneckbeardthings", "name": "t1_dge3v5x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492491304.0, "created_utc": 1492462504.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdefql", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Menial_Tasking", "parent_id": "t1_dgd76ik", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/justneckbeardthings", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can't say that and NOT give us the story.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t say that and NOT give us the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "justneckbeardthings", "name": "t1_dgdefql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492459638.0, "created_utc": 1492430838.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xp02", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s1f3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnmv1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RockFourFour", "parent_id": "t1_dgd76ik", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/justneckbeardthings", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Typical nicegirl.
