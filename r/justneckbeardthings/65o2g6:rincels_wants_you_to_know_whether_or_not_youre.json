Somehow it seems though, it's a trade off between intelligence and social normalizing skills.\n\nSo he was tortured. Hit, kicked, punched, daily, in every class, constantly. \n\nWhen he fought back, he was in trouble. The notion that this was happening to him because of his size and appearance dawned on him. \n\nThe torture, the peer cruelty, the adults acting as authority, they were all treating him like shit! \n\nFirstly because of his looks.\n\nSecondly, because of our family's odd arrival in an other wise \"small town\" (very weird last name that couldn't be denied as not being from around there) \n\nCoping was unreal for him, and I see it now. I understand it now. \n\nThe pretty girls tortured him while he was maturing and coming to his own. He never had a place to fit in, and he didn't have the one person who made this all ok in the first place, my dad.\n\nHe was horrible to me as a kid. At that point, I didn't know I was getting all the anger at every one else directed at me because he wasn't ALLOWED To express it. I hated him for it. Sometimes he was physically abusive towards me for it. I'm not excusing it, I'm explaining it. I've forgiven it. \n\nMy brothers found a few friends over the years, we had LAN parties A LOT, instead of TNG, we watched DS9/voyager as a family. \n\nAs we got older, we watched (and bought as they came out) the entire Dragon Ball Z series. \nI've seen tons of anime and still wouldn't hate to play an RPG. \n\nBut I was careful not to light the short fuse that would bring past transgressions of SO many others to the surface. \n\nFast forward he's now an engineer and living well in an area that welcomes engineers.\n\n (btw if you read this bro, thanks for the advice about intelligence in my current locale. I get it).\n\nIt wasn't until I nearly died and I saw the truest most beautiful, most disgusting colors of humanity, that I really understood everything, him, them, the anger....\n\nI fell for A self described incel in my undergrad. \nHe helped me study for my LSATS, he was insanely smart, and he picked to be friend zoned by a Stacey over me. \nA Stacey who, while I was incredibly sick, screwed me over royally. \nYounger, prettier I suppose, and obviously healthy. \n\n\nI actually went to meet up with him one day hoping to come clean and maybe start something together when he told me that he picked her and we couldn't ever even be friends. \nI believe the terms were hers.\n\nI never told him I loved him.\n\nI never told him how much it destroyed me. \n\nI never talked to him again....though i did fb stalk him once or twice. \n\nTo say CRYSTAL clear would be a gross understatement to my revelation that day. \n\nI instantly forgave my brothers, I instantly forgave this guy whom I loved and picked some dumb bitch....\n\nI became a better person. \n\n\nFast forward, I met my husband while still very sick. A pseudo incel of a different type.  \n\nHe isn't the smartest, he is beyond socially awkward,  he is terrible at showing emotion, his nickname was skinny, he has a birthmark on his face (which I love) we work on his appearance and self love constantly.\n\nHe is perfect. \n\nWe have motorcycles in common, and for the first three years of our relationship, I made more money than him so I could help him pursue his dreams. \n\nBut he loves me, he accepts me, he embraced me for a week, month, year or years even though I was VERY sick. Because I won't abandon him, he won't abandon me. \n\nI'm not an ugly specimen, I exchanged brains for beauty though.\n\n(Shit trade considering looks fade SOOOO much faster).\n\nWe commonly hear \"she's your wife, dude WTF, she's so out of your league, he says I know, smiles and we walk away. \n\nI owe him my life and I'll never ever be able to pay that debt, I'll never forget what he is done. And it is a cornerstone of our love. \n\n\nWhat they don't know is this: he embraces all my weird girly things, my weird nerdy things, and I've never felt judged when I fart and need to pick my nose around him and trust me that's not the grossest thing we women do.\n\n(Let's be real every one does it) \n\nHe is my absolute best friend and closer to me than any one I've ever dated in the past. \n\nIncels, neck beards, whomever might be reading this, it does happen. \n\nFind the girl from the family of engineers that has/had incel family members... \n\nFind the girl who understands but not excuses why you are what you are.\n\nstart there. \n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492433157.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to briefly tell you about one of these two people whom o love so dearly....\nActually to be honest, they are both my brothers, so much of the two stories are the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I come from two brilliant parents. \nEngineering (in three disciplines) biology, chemistry, all are features of their combined pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As any child of an engineer knows, they are the highest paid group of vagrants.

Hit, kicked, punched, daily, in every class, constantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he fought back, he was in trouble. The notion that this was happening to him because of his size and appearance dawned on him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The torture, the peer cruelty, the adults acting as authority, they were all treating him like shit! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly because of his looks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, because of our family&amp;#39;s odd arrival in an other wise &amp;quot;small town&amp;quot; (very weird last name that couldn&amp;#39;t be denied as not being from around there) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coping was unreal for him, and I see it now. I understand it now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pretty girls tortured him while he was maturing and coming to his own. He never had a place to fit in, and he didn&amp;#39;t have the one person who made this all ok in the first place, my dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was horrible to me as a kid. At that point, I didn&amp;#39;t know I was getting all the anger at every one else directed at me because he wasn&amp;#39;t ALLOWED To express it. I hated him for it. Sometimes he was physically abusive towards me for it. I&amp;#39;m not excusing it, I&amp;#39;m explaining it. I&amp;#39;ve forgiven it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brothers found a few friends over the years, we had LAN parties A LOT, instead of TNG, we watched DS9/voyager as a family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we got older, we watched (and bought as they came out) the entire Dragon Ball Z series. \nI&amp;#39;ve seen tons of anime and still wouldn&amp;#39;t hate to play an RPG. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was careful not to light the short fuse that would bring past transgressions of SO many others to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward he&amp;#39;s now an engineer and living well in an area that welcomes engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(btw if you read this bro, thanks for the advice about intelligence in my current locale. I get it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until I nearly died and I saw the truest most beautiful, most disgusting colors of humanity, that I really understood everything, him, them, the anger....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fell for A self described incel in my undergrad. \nHe helped me study for my LSATS, he was insanely smart, and he picked to be friend zoned by a Stacey over me. \nA Stacey who, while I was incredibly sick, screwed me over royally. \nYounger, prettier I suppose, and obviously healthy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually went to meet up with him one day hoping to come clean and maybe start something together when he told me that he picked her and we couldn&amp;#39;t ever even be friends. \nI believe the terms were hers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never told him I loved him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never told him how much it destroyed me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never talked to him again....though i did fb stalk him once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To say CRYSTAL clear would be a gross understatement to my revelation that day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I instantly forgave my brothers, I instantly forgave this guy whom I loved and picked some dumb bitch....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became a better person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, I met my husband while still very sick. A pseudo incel of a different type.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He isn&amp;#39;t the smartest, he is beyond socially awkward,  he is terrible at showing emotion, his nickname was skinny, he has a birthmark on his face (which I love) we work on his appearance and self love constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is perfect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have motorcycles in common, and for the first three years of our relationship, I made more money than him so I could help him pursue his dreams. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he loves me, he accepts me, he embraced me for a week, month, year or years even though I was VERY sick. Because I won&amp;#39;t abandon him, he won&amp;#39;t abandon me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not an ugly specimen, I exchanged brains for beauty though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Shit trade considering looks fade SOOOO much faster).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We commonly hear &amp;quot;she&amp;#39;s your wife, dude WTF, she&amp;#39;s so out of your league, he says I know, smiles and we walk away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I owe him my life and I&amp;#39;ll never ever be able to pay that debt, I&amp;#39;ll never forget what he is done. And it is a cornerstone of our love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they don&amp;#39;t know is this: he embraces all my weird girly things, my weird nerdy things, and I&amp;#39;ve never felt judged when I fart and need to pick my nose around him and trust me that&amp;#39;s not the grossest thing we women do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Let&amp;#39;s be real every one does it) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is my absolute best friend and closer to me than any one I&amp;#39;ve ever dated in the past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incels, neck beards, whomever might be reading this, it does happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the girl from the family of engineers that has/had incel family members... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the girl who understands but not excuses why you are what you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;start there. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "justneckbeardthings", "name": "t1_dgcrxvv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415246.0, "created_utc": 1492386446.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcoc50", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DonHilarion", "parent_id": "t1_dgcl1ey", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/justneckbeardthings", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But of course, genetics are not everything and attitude plays a big role. \n\nThis is not exactly a direct answer to you, but another perspective, I hope:\n\nI can understand several of their frustrations, I felt them during years.

Maybe it's a cultural thing, I don't know (I'm not american, but southern european) but around here women generally are more open than men.
