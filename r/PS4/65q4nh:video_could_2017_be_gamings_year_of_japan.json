I totally get how unfair it is, but does that make someone&amp;#39;s preferences any less &amp;quot;correct?&amp;quot; There are some Japanese games I LOVE even despite the art style, like Ni No Kuni or FFX, but when I see some games like Estival Versus or Nitroplus Blasterz, I have absolutely 0 interest in trying them. I get that games like Persona and such are GOTY contenders, and I&amp;#39;m not going to deny it. It&amp;#39;s just that I see the art direction and it&amp;#39;s really not my cup of tea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can agree that someone putting a game down because of simply being Japanese is pretty ridiculous, but putting it down because of a certain aspect of the game present at all times is pretty fair in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dgd1399", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427706.0, "created_utc": 1492398906.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q4nh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q4nh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdcko5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "randomgamerfreak", "parent_id": "t1_dgdaot4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What if I think games with realistic graphics look dumb?
