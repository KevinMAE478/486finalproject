Gaming was my everything and so I&amp;#39;d saved for a PS1 and later ps2 where I played Spyro and crash and Ratchet and clank (all through blockbuster rentals) but never got to experience banjo kazooie as no one I knew spoke of it and I hadn&amp;#39;t heard of the game until after the death of the genre. I&amp;#39;ve replayed Spyro on an emulator not long ago and know that the genre is dear to me and I know what to expect with the experience. Help me fill in the gaps of my youth. Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg3nzpl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904470.0, "created_utc": 1491875670.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mnjo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3o5h7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Swoose", "parent_id": "t3_64mnjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't need the game, I just wanted to say that you are awesome for doing this.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need the game, I just wanted to say that you are awesome for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg3o5h7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904676.0, "created_utc": 1491875876.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mnjo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3o9ac", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chetcommandosrockon", "parent_id": "t3_64mnjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I never really got to play Banjo Kazooie back in the day, Looks fun.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never really got to play Banjo Kazooie back in the day, Looks fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg3o9ac", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904808.0, "created_utc": 1491876008.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mnjo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3ohea", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zeldaisaprude", "parent_id": "t3_64mnjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's not many games out like this now and I'm poor so yeah.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not many games out like this now and I&amp;#39;m poor so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg3ohea", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491905069.0, "created_utc": 1491876269.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mnjo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3oo2f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Darkhatchet500", "parent_id": "t3_64mnjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I would absolutely love this , I used to play jack and daxter all the time on PS3 ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah I would absolutely love this , I used to play jack and daxter all the time on PS3 &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg3oo2f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491905267.0, "created_utc": 1491876467.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mnjo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3op8r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bnnyblncofromdabronx", "parent_id": "t3_64mnjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey thanks for doing this!
