In fact, I actually  played the intro of UC1 up to the first few platforming segments with Nate and Sully in the jungle, just to check the game out and meet the main characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be quite honest, I think that if I had skipped UC2 entirely it would not make &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; of a difference for my UC4 playthrough, since the plot is pretty similar to UC3. Also, all of the main characters have a much better/fully-fledged arc in UC3. Especially Nate and Elena&amp;#39;s relationship, which is far more interesting and relevant for their story in UC4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, IMO, UC3 is essential, UC2 not so much (maybe for the upcoming Lost Legacy?) and UC1 not at all (even though it might be nice to play the intro just to meet the characters for the first time).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg58edb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491987917.0, "created_utc": 1491959117.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s07h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s07h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s07h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s07h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s07h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5p9ed", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "asvprvre", "parent_id": "t1_dg5hmvr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you :) that sounds amazing and I'll get back to you for sure.
