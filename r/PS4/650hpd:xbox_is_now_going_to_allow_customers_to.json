I downloaded games at the speed I pay my ISP for. I played Black Ops 2 and bought Red Dead Redemption on back compat today. The UI is faster, smoother, and cleaner. Games Pass makes me hate PS Now even more. Got a month of EA access because &amp;quot;Fuck it, why not. Its $5&amp;quot;. Bought some games and it turns out I can play them on my gaming PC too. Now refunds. Not to mention Scorpio coming, which after seeing what industry people say about it, makes me kinda regret getting a Pro and not just sticking with my OG. They really put effort into it - it doesn&amp;#39;t look half-baked at all. (Looking at you - boost mode. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;whichIlove)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, before tweens freak out. I got everything except a Switch (not my cup-o-tea). Competition is good. It drives industry in a way in which consumers win. You also have to give credit where credit is due. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, I got this sinking feeling in my stomach, with PS Now - Watch the PS5 not be backwards compatible. Mark my words. Meanwhile MS is saying things like &amp;quot;People buy a new phone or tablet and expect their apps to come with them and run better.&amp;quot; I like being able to boot games I bought 10 years ago on Steam. Why not. Also, please don&amp;#39;t say dig my old PS4 out of the closet. Hardware dies and no one wants to go through all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg716de", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492080757.0, "created_utc": 1492051957.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650hpd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6zqc9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Soulrakk", "parent_id": "t3_650hpd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Completely consumer friendly.
