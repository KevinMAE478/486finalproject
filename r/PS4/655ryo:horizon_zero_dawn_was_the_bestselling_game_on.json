If you do that, you can disable a particular weapon, lose an ability, or cause it to fall on its side.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally each critical point will have a weakness of some sort, to direct damage or fire for instance.  So matching up the weakness with an appropriate weapon is where much of the strategy comes from.  If you take out the right weakness, you can do tremdous amounts of damage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weapons-wise, you get a selection of bows and slings, bombs,  a rope caster for tying down the legs of big machines, and a trip caster for setting trip wires.  Each of which can be loaded with various types of ammo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stealth is also a critical component.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all the combat is incredibly rich, highly polished, and &lt;em&gt;in my opinion&lt;/em&gt; superior to the Witcher.  In a way it&amp;#39;s much like the Witcher + Far Cry.  It is definately fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The background story of the game world is amazing, as are the graphics.  But the characters and story &lt;em&gt;pales&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to the Witcher.  For me personally it was disappointing, and also annoying because of some of the particulars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Persona is not open world.  It&amp;#39;s structured like a classic jrpg like FFVII.  That is you basically have a &amp;quot;town&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;dungeon&amp;quot;.   You run through the dungeon fighting turn-based battles with monster types.  The uniqueness here is the ability to negotiate with the monsters instead of outright killing them, for money, items, or to claim them as a Pet you can use in battle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you go back to &amp;quot;town&amp;quot;&amp;#39; to do various other game tasks like crafting, increasing skills, pumping people for information, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both modes are interspersed with cut scenes which advance the story.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first Persona game, but far from my first jrpg.  It doesn&amp;#39;t do anything radically different in the genre, but the overall style and polish of the game is impressive.  Plus it has an actual story, rather than simply a plot like Horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg9qxzl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492232538.0, "created_utc": 1492203738.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655ryo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8lqn3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AhrixMercy69", "parent_id": "t1_dg8hr95", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "horizon combat, dialogue and exploration is somewhat similar to the witcher series except you use bows instead of swords. it also feels a lot like uncharted combat imo except with a lot less hiding behind cover.\n\npersona isnt open world, it more like hub worlds where you can go to some places thru a menu, and you play the game daily following the calendar for a whole school year. during the day you go to school, afterschool you either spend time with characters you like,go to part time job to make money, study in library to increase stats or  go to dungeons to kill monster in a turn based battle with elemental weakness and capturing mosters similar to pokemon.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;horizon combat, dialogue and exploration is somewhat similar to the witcher series except you use bows instead of swords. it also feels a lot like uncharted combat imo except with a lot less hiding behind cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;persona isnt open world, it more like hub worlds where you can go to some places thru a menu, and you play the game daily following the calendar for a whole school year. during the day you go to school, afterschool you either spend time with characters you like,go to part time job to make money, study in library to increase stats or  go to dungeons to kill monster in a turn based battle with elemental weakness and capturing mosters similar to pokemon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg8lqn3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492164406.0, "created_utc": 1492135606.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8hr95", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gainzAndGoals", "parent_id": "t1_dg8d5uk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I loved The Witcher for the story, characters, the map, side quests, etc. I could literally get lost in that game for hours.
