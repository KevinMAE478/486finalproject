I&amp;#39;ve just jumped into this series with all the praise Yakuza 0 was getting. I&amp;#39;m loving 0 right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this the first game in the series remade? Are they going through all the early games and touching them up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other question is are these severely delayed from getting to the US? It seems crazy that they can release another game this close to 0 coming out&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg5x1ox", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035497.0, "created_utc": 1492006697.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yb35", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5w8ia", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PraiseTheSun1997", "parent_id": "t3_64yb35", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Releases on August 29th ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Releases on August 29th &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg5w8ia", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034486.0, "created_utc": 1492005686.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yb35", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yb35", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65oij", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Setesu", "parent_id": "t1_dg64vu1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same.
