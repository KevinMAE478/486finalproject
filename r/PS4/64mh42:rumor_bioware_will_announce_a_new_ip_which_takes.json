A decent review about ubisoft recently was them using the same open world formula, change the design and characters for different \"titles\" but  the same experience and build up the hype and sell it for top dollar with micro transactions.\n\nDestiny 1 is in a good place right now, as good as it can be for essentially a winding down process. I feel Destiny 2 if it just expands on the current Destiny 1 formula, more stories, loot, community activities, etc,but similar fps controls, gameplay, it'll be a sure thing. It's like that one video by extra credits on YouTube, Destiny is like your comfort food, you know what you're getting and it's good enough in many cases.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear you about the trend, I bought into the division hype and after that experience I&amp;#39;ve sworn to ever only buy any ubisoft game after many in depth reviews, discounts upon sales upon discount.
