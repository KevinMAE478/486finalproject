My first couple hours with the game were played patchless and it was pretty irritating when I left a minigame and my camera decided it wanted to park itself directly under Yooka, stare straight up his butt, and basically refuse to move from that area no matter how much I struggled to adjust it. I&amp;#39;m pleased that the issue is fixed but it&amp;#39;s dumb that the game shipped with the camera controls performing as poorly as they did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This probably all sounded very negative but I am having fun exploring the worlds, solving the puzzles, and grabbing everything in sight. If anything Yooka-Laylee  makes me sad that the Banjo-Kazooie franchise up an died. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg80qhu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138159.0, "created_utc": 1492109359.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657cct", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657cct", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657cct", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657cct", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657cct", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvw0m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OsitoDaBurrito", "parent_id": "t1_dgcibwg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not sure how to describe it mechanics wise, but Jak and Daxter 2 really didn't have the same feel as the original game.
