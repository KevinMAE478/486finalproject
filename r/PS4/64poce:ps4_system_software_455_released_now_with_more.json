Realizing I didn&amp;#39;t actually download the update yet, I unplugged my ethernet so it wouldn&amp;#39;t connect to the internet.  After it rebuilt, my ps4 turned on normally without lag.  I then reconnected the ethernet, and a pop-up came up saying it failed to download the update.  Then updates for The playroom and media player downloaded.  Then it started to redownload all of the updates for Deus Ex Mankind Divided even though I had it all. Lastly, it say the ethernet conenction failed and won&amp;#39;t connect via ethernet now.  What the fuck is going on?  I can connect to the internet via wifi, but whenever I try to update the software it gives the error code SU-30625-6.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dg53y60", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982000.0, "created_utc": 1491953200.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64poce", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5r29h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chief_mojo_risin", "parent_id": "t3_64poce", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They need to put the option to delete messages/notifications in one of the next updates.
