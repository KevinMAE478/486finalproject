All of the gunmen in the opening area drop three bullets iirc, so there shouldn't be a shortage of those just yet. \n\nIf you're really struggling, you can cheese the two neanderbeasts or whatever the fuck (the difficult wolf like creatures, you get killed by one of them first thing in the game) by running past them on the bridge, turning left, going down the steps in the house, and then using ranged attacks to take them on at your leisure (after clearing the enemies from the top floor of the house, of course. I think there's two of them). I believe it's also in that house that you can unlock your first shortcut in the game. You open a door, run up a set of steps, and open the gate at the first lantern in Yarnham proper. So if you get this far once, you won't have to do most of this ever again (unless you want to to farm souls, bullets, etc.)\n\nAfter that, make use of everything you've learned so far to get to Cleric Beast.

All of the gunmen in the opening area drop three bullets iirc, so there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a shortage of those just yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re really struggling, you can cheese the two neanderbeasts or whatever the fuck (the difficult wolf like creatures, you get killed by one of them first thing in the game) by running past them on the bridge, turning left, going down the steps in the house, and then using ranged attacks to take them on at your leisure (after clearing the enemies from the top floor of the house, of course.
