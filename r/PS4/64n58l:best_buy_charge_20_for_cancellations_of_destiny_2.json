In the sense of ordering product in general, usually high ticket items come with some kind of caveats because of the cost that is associated with making that order. That could range from using resources to get the order together, storage, merchant fee per transaction etc. This isn't generally a problem for end-users because the items we buy are mostly cheap in comparison, so companies just eat this cost when people return, cancel after paying, exchange etc.\n\nWhat's happening now is that people are going in, making payments and the canceling them. Each electronic transaction costs the company money because they pay a fee to the bank just to get the transaction done. Again, this is probably cheap to eat, and cancels happen all the time. What's happening now is that purchase and cancel transactions are happening en masse with the pre order beta codes, so chances are actuarial got on it and someone up top at Best Buy decided that the costs were building up for nothing in return.\n\nI'm not really sure what will come of it, but what I'm trying to say to you is that it's not about placing value on the beta. This is about mitigating the cost of people takin advantage of the system by pre ordering with the intention of canceling so they can get a free beta code. The point is, it costs money. This whole thing sucks but we can't say that this is a completely malicious move on Best Buy. The point was to provide an incentive for people who pre ordered, but you'll always have someone ruining it for everyone else. If anything these people should have just pre ordered from Amazon.
