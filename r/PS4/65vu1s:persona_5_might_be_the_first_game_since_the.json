CDPR are just a humble measly Indie studio composed of 3 slavic homeless men and they DESTROYED the gaming industry. Do you know why there were so many celebrity deaths last year? It was because they played W3 and were overwhelmed by the reality that no experiences in their lives would ever match, so they ended it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why does any developer anywhere even bother? W3 singlehandedly finished gaming. Gaming is done. It&amp;#39;s over. Pack your bags. It&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you so much for your support everyone. It&amp;#39;s time the world learns who CDPR are because they are MASSIVELY underrated. Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=\"http://slavsquat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/187.jpg\"&gt;pic&lt;/a&gt; of them working on Cyperpunk 2077.

Witcher 3 (upon release) actually had pretty poor UI, but it&amp;#39;s world visuals were a technical masterpiece. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persona 5 uses the silent protaganist trope to help you immerse yourself as the MC. Witcher 3 has a fully fleshed out MC with his own thoughts and beliefs that you, the player, may or may not agree with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn based combat vs Real time combat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party members vs Solo (most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, both games are excellent. But they are just so polar opposite that I don&amp;#39;t even think it makes sense to use one as a benchmark for the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PS4", "name": "t1_dgdl4gp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470163.0, "created_utc": 1492441363.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 79}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vu1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vu1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vu1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vu1s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrlp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vu1s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdyfxe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Burdicus", "parent_id": "t1_dgdtqos", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PS4", "controversiality": 0, "body": "People find one aspect of the game that isn't as \"polished\" as the rest and tear into it like it's bad.

It's clear that you don't like my opinion, and therefore, have to attack the way I broke it down to its very basics *in a reddit comment*.  It's your love of The Witcher 3 that is getting in the way of meaningful conversation.  \n\n&gt; ME1-3, Bladur's gate, KOTOR1&amp;2, FO1-4, the entire Elder's Scrolls series  \n\nExcept, those games DO have more variety... Mage and Fighter and Theif/Hacker classes allow you to complete objectives in very different ways. In some of those cases, they also open up completely new missions and options during your playthrough.  \n\n&gt; Civilisation, XCOM...  \n\nThe strategy in Civ and XCOM games is vastly deeper than TW3s. Who's being dishonest now?\n\n&gt; COD, Battlefield  \n\nMP playerVplayer is a completely different beast than an RPG. And even still, weapon types and vehicles alone make them deeper GAMEPLAY experiences than TW3. \n\n&gt; Every single one of these can be broken down into simple tedious, boring steps. But it would be dishonest and objectively wrong to do so.\n\nYeah, sorry I didn't write a complete dissertation on the entirety of TW3 to make a comment on reddit - that wasn't even a top comment - but was a comment to someone saying it was overrated.
