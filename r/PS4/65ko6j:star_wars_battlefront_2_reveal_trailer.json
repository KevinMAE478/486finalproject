The droid is deployed from her back. Also she used something on a planet which looked like she was scanning for something)\n\u2022 Animal Creation\n(Various animals being created for the game, it seems the developers want to bring the game to life as much as possible which is great)\n\u2022 More planets\n(We saw planets not included in the trailer and one that I had not seen before, it may have been Felucia) \n\u2022 Inside of a hangar\n(It looked like there were ships flying in and out of a hangar a lot like the space battles from the old Battlefront, Sequel ships were being used, non-campaign)\nThis was all I can remember right now, feel free to ask me questions to see if you can spark my memory or if you just have any questions. \nThe gameplay we saw looked fantastic and if it plays the same as it looks... 10/10 IGN&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Taken from &lt;a href=\"/r/Starwarsbattlefront\"&gt;r/Starwarsbattlefront&lt;/a&gt;
