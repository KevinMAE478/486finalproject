Fact is Nintendo didnt under ship there just isn't as much demand for Nintendo as there is PlayStation. Nothing you can say will change that. There is a reason why PlayStation has outsold Xbox since day 1 2/1 worldwide and is on pace to outsell ps2. The best selling console of all time. And I bet you anything the big 4 multi platform games I mentioned will all sell better in PlayStation than they will in Xbox. Scorpio will be last in sales just like Xbox one.
