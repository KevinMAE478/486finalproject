It is still owned by a branch of the same family (the Eltz family) that lived there in the 12th century, 33 generations ago. \n\nThe castle is a so-called Ganerbenburg, or castle belonging to a community of joint heirs. This is a castle divided into several parts, which belong to different families or different branches of a family; this usually occurs when multiple owners of one or more territories jointly build a castle to house themselves. Only a very rich medieval European lord could afford to build a castle on his land; many of them only owned one village, or even only a part of a village. This was an insufficient base to afford a castle. Such lords lived in a knight's house, which was a simple house, scarcely bigger than those of his tenants. In some parts of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, inheritance law required that the estate be divided between all successors. These successors, each of whose individual inheritance was too small to build a castle of his own, could build a castle together, where each owned one separate part for housing and all of them together shared the defensive fortification. In the case of Eltz, the family comprised three branches and the existing castle was enhanced with three separate complexes of buildings.\n\nThe main part of the castle consists of the family portions. At up to eight stories, these eight towers reach heights of between 30 and 40 metres (98 and 131 ft). They are fortified with strong exterior walls; to the yard they present a partial framework. \n \nPlatteltz, a Romanesque keep, is the oldest part of the castle, having begun in the 9th century as a simple manor with an earthen palisade. By 1157 the fortress was an important part of the empire under Frederick Barbarossa, standing astride the trade route from the Moselle Valley and the Eifel region. \n\nIn 1472 the R\u00fcbenach house, built in the Late Gothic style, was completed. \nBetween 1490 and 1540, the Rodendorf house was constructed, also in Late Gothic style. It contains the vaulted \"banner-room\".\n\nThe Kempenich houses were finished around 1530. Every room in this part of the castle could be heated; in contrast, other castles might only have one or two heated rooms.\n  \nFrom 1965 to 1992, an engraving of Eltz Castle was used on the [German 500 Deutsche Mark note](https://i.imgur.com/wdMSxjd.jpg)\n\n[Here's an album with more high-res pictures](https://imgur.com/a/a0nnQ)\n\n\n           ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eltz Castle or in German: Burg Eltz is a medieval castle nestled in the hills above the Moselle River between Koblenz and Trier, Germany.
