If a crate is buried lower down in the cube, the robots &amp;quot;dig&amp;quot; down by moving all the higher boxes to different locations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember there being an IT issue one time where all of the robots suddenly burst into action at 3am and started randomly rearranging the cube. The system is optimised so that crates that are used often tend to be towards the top of the cube. Someone deployed an update to the optimisation algorithm that probably caused the night watchman to shit his pants at the sudden burst of robotic activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3X3r5UVtEM\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3X3r5UVtEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "name": "t1_dg4kvn6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959976.0, "created_utc": 1491931176.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ptg2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4l1g6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nickyjkim", "parent_id": "t3_64ptg2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/interestingasfuck", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is kinda cute.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is kinda cute.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "name": "t1_dg4l1g6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960151.0, "created_utc": 1491931351.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ptg2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ly4q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Industrial_Strength", "parent_id": "t3_64ptg2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/interestingasfuck", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Look at all these lil thangs, so busy!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at all these lil thangs, so busy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "name": "t1_dg4ly4q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491961139.0, "created_utc": 1491932339.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ptg2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4n6dr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Smokey_Circles", "parent_id": "t3_64ptg2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/interestingasfuck", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Another job for which [humans need not apply](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU) -&lt; CGP Grey one, not the google.io one", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another job for which &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU\"&gt;humans need not apply&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;lt; CGP Grey one, not the google.io one&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "name": "t1_dg4n6dr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962485.0, "created_utc": 1491933685.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ptg2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4pp9n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ISAMU13", "parent_id": "t3_64ptg2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/interestingasfuck", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What programming language(s) are used in programming these robots?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What programming language(s) are used in programming these robots?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "name": "t1_dg4pp9n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491965250.0, "created_utc": 1491936450.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ptg2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4rdar", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TurquoiseKnight", "parent_id": "t3_64ptg2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/interestingasfuck", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's cute.
