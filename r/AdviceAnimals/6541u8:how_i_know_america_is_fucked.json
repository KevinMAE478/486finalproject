In contrast, STAs can make anywhere from 25k-60k. Also, their income depends largely on the state in which services are provided. In Texas, they cut the state budget for Speech by 28% in December, and now they are looking to make an additional cut of 30% in July. My wife and I actually just got back from a trip to Austin where they held a public hearing so that people could voice their opposition. If they move forward with the extra 30% cut, my wife's home health company is going out of business. \n\nEdit 2: Also, SLPs have the ability to work with geriatric patients as opposed to strictly pediatric, like STAs. My wife works for a home health company and the population they serve is all on Medicaid. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission determines what the Medicaid reimbursement rate is for STA therapy sessions. It used to be lucrative to work as an STA making anywhere between 50-70k a year depending on experience. But now with these cuts, all home health companies in the state are having to cut pay to survive. It's not that they are profit hungry, it's that the overhead plus compensation is too much compared to how much they are getting reimbursed.

First, there are Bachelor-degree level &amp;quot;Speech Therapy Assistants.&amp;quot; I hate the label because they don&amp;#39;t just sit there and spectate, the actually provide full Therapy interventions to kids with disabilities. Then, there are Master-degree level &amp;quot;Speech Language Pathologists.&amp;quot; These people can make easily 80-100k depending on the setting (hospital, nursing home, home health/hospice, schools). In contrast, STAs can make anywhere from 25k-60k. Also, their income depends largely on the state in which services are provided. In Texas, they cut the state budget for Speech by 28% in December, and now they are looking to make an additional cut of 30% in July. My wife and I actually just got back from a trip to Austin where they held a public hearing so that people could voice their opposition. If they move forward with the extra 30% cut, my wife&amp;#39;s home health company is going out of business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Also, SLPs have the ability to work with geriatric patients as opposed to strictly pediatric, like STAs. My wife works for a home health company and the population they serve is all on Medicaid. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission determines what the Medicaid reimbursement rate is for STA therapy sessions. It used to be lucrative to work as an STA making anywhere between 50-70k a year depending on experience. But now with these cuts, all home health companies in the state are having to cut pay to survive. It&amp;#39;s not that they are profit hungry, it&amp;#39;s that the overhead plus compensation is too much compared to how much they are getting reimbursed. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg7gjaq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492114530.0, "created_utc": 1492085730.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 893}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6541u8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6541u8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6541u8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ig0a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 54, "report_reasons": null, "author": "i_smell_my_poop", "parent_id": "t1_dg7htwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And I believe an epic beard is also a requirement.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I believe an epic beard is also a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg7ig0a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492117625.0, "created_utc": 1492088825.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 54}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7htwo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DodgersOneLove", "parent_id": "t1_dg7gmz5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably craft, most large scale Brewers have chemE or chem degrees", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably craft, most large scale Brewers have chemE or chem degrees&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg7htwo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116696.0, "created_utc": 1492087896.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gmz5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 50, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jakehoodlum", "parent_id": "t1_dg7fyfo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you work at a craft brewery or on a larger scale?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you work at a craft brewery or on a larger scale?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg7gmz5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492114717.0, "created_utc": 1492085917.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 50}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6541u8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gvr7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Superflypirate", "parent_id": "t1_dg7fyfo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah no one tells you this in school.
