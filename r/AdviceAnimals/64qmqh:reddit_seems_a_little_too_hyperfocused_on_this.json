If they didn&amp;#39;t overbook then seats would go empty meaning that people who could&amp;#39;ve gone on that flight but didn&amp;#39;t get in fast enough are wasting time by waiting for another flight. But because they overbook that doesn&amp;#39;t happen and every flight is almost always full, and when they overbook and extra people show up, those extra people who are willing to wait can get refunds/free tickets and save a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overbooking is great for everyone except in the very rare cases where nobody is willing to give up their seat. In all of my numerous flights there has almost always been overbooking and immediately a huge line of people are willing to give up their seats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there are people who plan their flights in such a way that they are hoping to get overbooked and get a free ticket.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg4lg45", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960596.0, "created_utc": 1491931796.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4fzjj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "N8CCRG", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fb42", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean, I agree, but a large portion of the commentary I've been seeing is people raging against the practice of overbooking itself, and making comments like \"it's just airlines being greedy!\".", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I agree, but a large portion of the commentary I&amp;#39;ve been seeing is people raging against the practice of overbooking itself, and making comments like &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s just airlines being greedy!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg4fzjj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954627.0, "created_utc": 1491925827.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -27}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4fb42", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "subzerojosh_1", "parent_id": "t1_dg49gtz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The problem with united is how they delt with the situation not that it occurred  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with united is how they delt with the situation not that it occurred  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg4fb42", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491953875.0, "created_utc": 1491925075.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmqh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmqh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmqh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmqh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kbi5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KHSoz", "parent_id": "t1_dg4k03c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "According to a quick google search I did, they may not be refunded, or may be refunded but charged a re-booking fee, or anywhere in between depending on the airline.
