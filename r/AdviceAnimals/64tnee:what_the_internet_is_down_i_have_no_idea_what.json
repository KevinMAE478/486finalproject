Even worse - they're used to it.

Did those punishments do anything for me, or my sister, or my cousins, or the friends I know who had similar upbringings?\nNope, we went nuts as teenagers. Firewalls were met with proxies, \"I do everything for you\" was met with me doing it all for myself in a way they didn't like (I.E; spending 3 hours bussing it home from school and stopping off at he shops with friends, rather than letting them take me home in 20 minutes and doing my homework). Throwing me out of the house expecting me to whimper and beg to be let in was met with me disappearing and actually running away.\nI never got rewarded for anything, nor did any of the people who turned out like me as teenagers.

Think of it like training a pet dog; you don't yell and it or hit it every time it doesn't do what you say. That just confuses it and it doesn't learn. You also don't beg it to sit, as that won't do anything. You tell it to sit, maybe show it how, and give it a treat when it does it. Do this for a few months, and forever more when asked to sit, your dog will sit, treat or not.\nIf your dog shits on the floor, then you punish it.
