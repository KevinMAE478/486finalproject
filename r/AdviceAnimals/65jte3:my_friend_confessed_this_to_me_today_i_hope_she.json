Right now, I'm not sure how to communicate to a male co-worker who wants to be my friend a little too badly that I like him and want to be friendly, but not hang out outside of work except maybe in a group. This weekend he invited me to hang out at his house while his wife is not there. Now, he may really just want to be friends and that's cool, but he doesn't seem to be aware of how many red flags he has set off for me, not just in that example, as a female co-worker (who btw is a lot smaller than he is - I'm not afraid he'd assault me, more just that he'd come on to me or develop feelings, but the size difference does make that feel more intense in a way I don't think guys think about). \n\nIs he a creepy guy? On the surface, no. We get along at work, he seems to have normal relationships with other co-workers, we have some interests in common. \n\nBut I can't tell his intentions. He has made me uncomfortable on a number of occasions (ex, too many compliments). He doesn't seem to have an awareness of how certain things might come across to me or done anything to mitigate that (inviting me to go somewhere public or with people vs literally to his house to play games). He has handled a couple of situations in a way that felt a little manipulative (before asking me over, he was talking about how it's been hard for him and his wife to make friends in town, especially her - so why not invite me when she's there? Why make me feel bad about saying no because he doesn't have friends? I know he's friendly with other male co-workers, so why name me as one of his few social connections? Bullshit, I'm new to the org). \n\nI am not going to take a risk just because he might be everything he claims to be on the surface (a guy looking for friends). We also WORK together and I want to have a good working relationship. I don't want either of us to feel shitty. \n\nSo tell me, is he creepy? \n\nIf you define \"creepy\" as whether or not his intentions are good, it's a useless term.

I bet if I brought it up to other coworkers, I think they'd either dismiss my concerns (men) or immediately see the inappropriateness (women) in a way that would give him a bad reputation -- potentially an unfair one if he's really a good guy who doesn't realize how he's coming across.\n\nOne other thing. Whatever you think of this guy's behavior as described, know that I have had a ton of experiences that lead me to be nervous about giving this guy the benefit of the doubt. My bar for what constitutes creepy behavior as I have defined it here has been set by a lot of interactions with people who cross boundaries. I've gotten a lot better at navigating these situations as I've gotten older, but particularly for women, it can take some time to learn how to distinguish between \"crosses boundaries because of awkwardness and just needs a heads up\" vs \"doesn't care as much about my boundaries as their own comfort/desires/etc\" or even \"just doesn't give a shit about my boundaries.\" Normal awkward people (a group that includes most of us at least some of the time, and others most of the time) don't *want* to cross boundaries, but it can look the same from the receiving end sometimes. \n\nIf your only experience (like a lot of young women in particular) is that people who tend to ignore your boundaries sometimes cross waaay over the line, it's reasonable to group all of those experiences together as ones to be cautious of.
