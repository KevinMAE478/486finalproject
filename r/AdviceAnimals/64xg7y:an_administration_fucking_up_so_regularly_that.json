A lot of people also don&amp;#39;t think about how important institutional knowledge is for any job, particularly operating a government that has a GDP of over $16 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to term limit Congress, I think there is a rational argument to do so. But there still needs to be people who are there for 20-30 years, because you need to preserve that knowledge base. You need people to say &amp;quot;no, that won&amp;#39;t work, because X tried doing something like that 15 years ago, and it was a disaster.&amp;quot; The professional staffers don&amp;#39;t stick around long enough to provide that type of institutional knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you either need to accept that term limits will still be at least 2 decades long, or fundamentally alter the role of the professional bureaucracy (unelected policy professionals), which is just going to create an entirely different fight about how these people who don&amp;#39;t answer to the public are the ones with the most power and sway in the legislative process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg6cfm4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051833.0, "created_utc": 1492023033.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg7y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6jk05", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VROF", "parent_id": "t1_dg6aa8j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "California has term limits for our state legislature and what ended up happening is special interests \"help\" the politicians because everyone is new to the job.
