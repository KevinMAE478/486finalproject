The customer service has gone from \"above and beyond\" to \"say anything to get you off the phone, do nothing\".

Apparently a savings account has a negative balance and was last active 3 years ago, but I haven't had a savings account with them in over 8 years when I cleared it out to pay off a car loan with them.  When I had the Mastercard, it was \"compromised\" 3 times in 5 years and after the 1st time when they notified me, I had to prove that I did not make charges all over the world in a day 2 other times.  The third time I had to contest each and every charge and wait for investigation by their fraud department for the charges to be reversed INDIVIDUALLY!  They did not shut off the card as they were instructed, so random charges in South America and Russia were still appearing WHILE I was fighting for 6 months.  They would not close the compromised account while there was still a balance, the initial \"investigator\" stated that they would have it cleared up quickly and any interest would be credited back when it was resolved.  I made payments for 3 months and paid off what I had actually charged to the account.  Every time there was funds available, new bogus charges would appear and USAA offered little help, only reducing the credit limit from 18k to 8k.  They refused to close the account or reissue another card while they were still \"investigating\".  After the third month, the balance was all bogus charges and interest for charges they were still \"investigating\" and I refused to pay any monthly payments for charges that weren't mine.  \"Collections\" calls began and I referred them to the \"investigator\" that was supposed to be handling it, and eventually was told that that person did not work there and no one had \"my file\".  I had to fax them all of the documentation for the last 4 months and BEGIN AGAIN!  The newly assigned \"investigator\" contacted me 1 time when they were assigned the case, stating that \"I\" was doing it wrong from the beginning and they needed a statement.  When I called back, I was told that my account was past due and they \"couldn't work with me until it was brought current\".  All of the balance was charges that *they* were supposed to be investigating, interest charges on the reversed charges and now late fees and over the limit charges.  I refused to pay ANYTHING for charges that I didn't make, that should have been resolved by them over 6 months and they should have prevented new charges by closing the account, not just reducing the credit limit and putting a temporary 30 day hold on it's use.  \n\nA year later that credit card showed up on my CR as being closed by issuer for less than full payoff.  4 years ago I received a tax form stating that they were writing off a loss of $8k and change that I had to claim as income.  When I called to find out what it was about, I was transferred repeatedly.  What I did find out was that the Mastercard was serviced by a USAA affiliate in Nevada and the bank was \"bringing it in-house\" and all new cards were Visa.  No one could tell me who to contact to find out what was going on since \"that affiliate has ceased operation\" and they connected me to the new collections department whose \"solution\" was to pay the $8k over the phone and they would look into it!  WTF!?\n\nLast year, my car insurance went up (again!) I went online to find out why and I was locked out of my account (where I pay bills) so I called and was eventually forwarded to \"Uncollected account collections\" where I was told that I owed over $8k and was not allowed to access USAA services until it was paid including account services or policy changes.  I started telling him what happened and how USAA failed when he said \"I don't want to hear your stories\".  So I brought up the tax form that they FRAUDULENTLY filed with the IRS that stated that they (USAA FSB) wrote off the balance (that was not mine) 3 years prior and I had to claim as income.  He said it didn't matter, the balance was still due to USAA FSB since they bought the debts of whatever the USAA Nevada credit servicer was and that it was still due, even if it was \"previously\" written off as bad debt.  It was simple, all I had to do was pay them 8 thousand dollars and they would send an amended tax form, that I could refile my taxes from 3 years ago!  WTF?\n\nThis makes absolutely NO sense!  A USAA branded affiliate failed to do their job and failed financially.  The false debt was bought by USAA Federal Savings Bank (I'm sure at a discount), to which they wrote off the full amount to the federal government as a loss that I had to claim as income 3 years ago and claim that I still owe a debt currently from 8 years ago from a company that I have no way of contacting.  \n\nMy car insurance rates are going up \"due to credit history\", that other branches of USAA (FSB) are falsely claiming negative information for, which they will not discuss to resolve the issue... with me.  They (representative \"Tony\") told me to get a lawyer as soon as I said \"illegal\" and \"tax fraud\" and \"collusion\" and then hung up on me.  I have NEVER been hung up on before by USAA and thought they were unable to, LOL.  I was admittedly being a dick, because he was being a dick and his rude responses.\n\nAlso, I've never been at fault for an accident or had a ticket, was late 1 time in 7 years on the CC before the THIRD time it was compromised (internet rumors say that the card theft was occurring AT the USAA Nevada center since there were MANY \"members\" affected including my parents and brother) I truly felt horrible about being late, I was busy and simply forgot, it was like betraying a friend- that's how good USAA USED to be.  Car loan was paid off before term.  Had multiple bank accounts with them that were well funded, but no idea WTF is up with this $12 overdrawn savings account that they will not discuss with me, that did not show up in my online account overview and has a yahoo email address.  They can't discuss it with me since I can't verify the account that I know nothing about, but they can hold me financially liable for being overdrawn?!  That doesn't seem right.  I can't even pay the $12 and have them close the account since they won't give me the account #!  That's assinine!  Roadblocks instead of resolution seems to be their new motto.\n\nAs to the insurance division, I now live in Florida and was told that they will not insure the house here, and referred me to their affiliate who was 3 times more than GEICO per year.  That's some service from a company that used to promise rewarding long term \"members\" with discounts and exceptional service.\n\nTL;DR:  USAA brand (and it's many separate legally distinct entities) has gone to shit in their attempt to go mainstream.  1 CEO for all of these affiliates and separate businesses, yet can not be legally investigated as 1 organization.  How about organized crime? \nNo longer a respected brand.\n\n\n\n\n    ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had &amp;quot;USAA&amp;quot; for almost 25 years and I absolutely HATE the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; USAA!  They started going downhill about 7 years ago IME.  &amp;quot;USAA&amp;quot; is actually 100&amp;#39;s of separate legal entities grouped under the USAA brand umbrella which makes it extremely difficult to file complaints against them or seek legal remedy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve used many of their &amp;quot;products&amp;quot; from home and auto insurance, banking, credit, auto loans over the years without issue until the last 7 years when they started expanding.

Apparently a savings account has a negative balance and was last active 3 years ago, but I haven&amp;#39;t had a savings account with them in over 8 years when I cleared it out to pay off a car loan with them.  When I had the Mastercard, it was &amp;quot;compromised&amp;quot; 3 times in 5 years and after the 1st time when they notified me, I had to prove that I did not make charges all over the world in a day 2 other times.
