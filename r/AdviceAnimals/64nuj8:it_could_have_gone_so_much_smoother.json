It&amp;#39;s not the airline&amp;#39;s fault that you missed it. This way, the airline gets their money either way, but then the customers who do show up shouldn&amp;#39;t get penalized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Switching to the other side - overbooking then giving vouchers/cash makes business sense, but should still be limited for that exact reason. Volunteers should be volunteers. That&amp;#39;s it. The airline is taking a risk by overbooking, and pays for when the risk fails (everyone shows up) by giving the vouchers/cash. If no one volunteers, they should up the value or deal with it in some other way (e.g. pay for employees/customers on another airline).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg3v4hr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491914263.0, "created_utc": 1491885463.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nuj8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3sk58", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AriaTheTransgressor", "parent_id": "t1_dg3s1l6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I didn't say I wasn't against it.
