Sure, maybe people aren't willing to be delayed for $400, but you bet your ass they'll be jumping at the chance for $1500. This was all a logistics/decision making problem on United's behalf.\n\n2) Okay so they fuck up and fill the plane up, or maybe there's a last minute emergency where 4 crew need to fly to the destination and it came up after loading the plane. So you still follow the next step. Offer more and more money until 4 people volunteer to get off. Eventually 4 will leave.\n\n**In regards to both of these, I've heard the argument of \"well if people know they'll just keep raising the price, passengers will hold out for tons of cash\".** People are always willing to undercut. There wouldn't be much holding out. And even then, the cost is a fraction of a % of what United deals with in a day. Compared to the PR disaster, it's incredibly worthwhile.\n\n3) Have a better system than \"these 4 random passengers must leave\". As much as it sucks for *everyone*, it would have been more sensible from a business/PR standpoint to de-board the entire plane, add a 1-2 hour delay, then re-board the plane, but try and adjust capacity based on people who will miss connections and the like. Plus people are more willing to take a voucher when they're not in their seat waiting to leave.

Step one is to handle this at the gate. And it&amp;#39;s handled by offering more and more money for people to skip that flight. Sure, maybe people aren&amp;#39;t willing to be delayed for $400, but you bet your ass they&amp;#39;ll be jumping at the chance for $1500. This was all a logistics/decision making problem on United&amp;#39;s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Okay so they fuck up and fill the plane up, or maybe there&amp;#39;s a last minute emergency where 4 crew need to fly to the destination and it came up after loading the plane. So you still follow the next step. Offer more and more money until 4 people volunteer to get off. Eventually 4 will leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In regards to both of these, I&amp;#39;ve heard the argument of &amp;quot;well if people know they&amp;#39;ll just keep raising the price, passengers will hold out for tons of cash&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; People are always willing to undercut. There wouldn&amp;#39;t be much holding out. And even then, the cost is a fraction of a % of what United deals with in a day. Compared to the PR disaster, it&amp;#39;s incredibly worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Have a better system than &amp;quot;these 4 random passengers must leave&amp;quot;. As much as it sucks for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, it would have been more sensible from a business/PR standpoint to de-board the entire plane, add a 1-2 hour delay, then re-board the plane, but try and adjust capacity based on people who will miss connections and the like. Plus people are more willing to take a voucher when they&amp;#39;re not in their seat waiting to leave. Again - still shitty for customers, but from a decision making standpoint on United&amp;#39;s behalf, a move like this would never make the news. Just piss off a plane-load of people, which happens daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg4xuz0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491974249.0, "created_utc": 1491945449.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vinw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 946, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bmjunior74", "parent_id": "t1_dg4thps", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jacking off in McDonalds is illegal.

First of all, the CEO didn't even put any blame whatsoever on his employees. He didn't apologize for what they did and pretty much supported their actions.

Corporations are on the constant chase for profit, even going so far as overbooking and whatnot. I know it's a very normal thing to happen in the industry(it happens in the hotel industry as well) but that's exactly what's wrong with the whole situation. Somehow we're fine with corporations having this whole \"fuck the consumer, more profit\"-mentality and it leads to shitty situations like this. Obviously they're not entirely wrong since we as consumers support shitty business practices by paying to make use of their service and signing shitty terms of services.\n\nEither way, my point is that it's not just one manager that caused this problem.

You sign the order, which says I&amp;#39;ll make you a cake for tomorrow&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;BUT&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RESERVE&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;THE&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RIGHT&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;REDISTRIBUTE&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ALL&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CAKES&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;WHOMEVER&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CHOOSE&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;IF&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;DEEM&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;THERE&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;IS&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;NOT&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ENOUGH&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CAKE&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow comes along, you drive to my store and I show you the nice cake I made for you. It has your son&amp;#39;s name spelled correctly. It is the cake you ordered. You pay for the cake, and I hand it to you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#39;re walking to the door, my employee walks in from the back room. I notice that he has no cake and that yours was the last order for the day. I immediately hit the lock down button.  As you rattle the front door, to no avail, I explain that my employee needs your cake. You say that it&amp;#39;s your cake. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I say, &amp;quot;Sir, I&amp;#39;ve decided that you must give up your cake for my employee. It&amp;#39;s in the contract you signed&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of arguing that the promise of one free cake tomorrow doesn&amp;#39;t help you provide your son with birthday cake, you begin to notice that what you thought was the customer behind you in line is actually an armed man. He approaches, his Kevlar padded chest leading his elevated chin. &amp;quot;Sir, will you relinquish this cake without incident?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No! Jimmy wanted a fricken cake, he&amp;#39;s gonna get a.. &amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;WHAP&lt;/em&gt; the white light and searing heat emanating from in front of your face is blinding. What seems like a moment later you realize you&amp;#39;re crumpled against the door with three tasers pointed at you. Then you see that your cake, Jimmy&amp;#39;s birthday cake, is being eaten by my employee despite the visible blood. A wave of resignation and a boneweary ache wash over you. You finally turn your attention to the dark clad men behind the threatening stun guns, recognizing the fake customer and then noticing that the other two wear police badges over their anti-ballistic breast plates. Your hopes briefly rise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside,  after explaining the bizarre events to these uniformed officers, you are politely informed that after mutually agreeing to a contract with me, I was well within my rights to forcibly remove my cake from your possession since there was simply not enough cake for my employees. In fact, your resistance and noncompliance with police instructions created quite a disruption. You are quickly mirandized, and placed in the back seat of the cruiser. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Have your cake, eat it, and the taxpayer will protect your profits. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "name": "t1_dg4n9gi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962577.0, "created_utc": 1491933777.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ipxh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 122, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kenbw2", "parent_id": "t3_64rer1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I assume your use of \"corporations\" is supposed to create outrage, but it is their private property.
