This has never happened in the history of North Korea. We've seen over the last two decades of sabre-rattling behavior that they have never detained their tourists. Not in 2011, it isn't happening now, and it hasn't happened the other dozen times they've launched an inept missile into the sea of Japan and received a reprimand for it. They've asked tourists to leave, but they've never kidnapped them, and I think there's enough evidence to say that they have no interest in such a thing. Put simply, it's against their interests. North Korea has been investing heavily in tourism over the last several years and purposefully destroying that industry by kidnapping tourists is simply illogical. \n\n2. This is the once case where I'd say you're in trouble. But I'd venture to say that the current strings keeping the North Korea situation from collapsing are strong enough that going there on a trip is extremely safe. \n\n3. There's more leeway to your behavior than you might realize when you're over there. You won't get arrested for life for a slight slip up. You'd need to go out of your way to piss them off enough to get yourself arrested. If on a tour you accidentally wander away from the path you're supposed to be on, or if you make an off-color joke, you won't get arrested. If you bring and distribute Bibles to locals, sneak out of your hotel at night with a camera, or attempt to steal state property, you're going to have a bad time. \n\n4. You're not wrong that it's probably better to visit Japan, Norway, France, or the dozens of other lovely places on this Earth that you can see without worrying about ethical quandaries or being arrested, places where you can see real, authentic life. But if people want to see North Korea, for whatever reason, safety is not really much of a deterrent. Plus, North Korea is on a far different level of safety from any other country you listed (though I'd argue it's not fair to lump Indonesia and Turkey in with Afghanistan in terms of safety). North Korea's tour is so controlled that there is literally no risk of pickpocketing, mugging, extortion, or an of the other things that can happen in these countries. Your only risk is being arrested, and to be arrested you need to be breaking the law in a fairly serious way. If simple slip-up was enough to be arrested, we'd see lots of tourists being arrested. That has not happened. Refer to points 1 &amp; 3; in order to be arrested, you need to either egregiously violate the law of the tour or North Korean tensions need to escalate to armed conflict.

We&amp;#39;ve seen over the last two decades of sabre-rattling behavior that they have never detained their tourists. Not in 2011, it isn&amp;#39;t happening now, and it hasn&amp;#39;t happened the other dozen times they&amp;#39;ve launched an inept missile into the sea of Japan and received a reprimand for it. They&amp;#39;ve asked tourists to leave, but they&amp;#39;ve never kidnapped them, and I think there&amp;#39;s enough evidence to say that they have no interest in such a thing. Put simply, it&amp;#39;s against their interests. North Korea has been investing heavily in tourism over the last several years and purposefully destroying that industry by kidnapping tourists is simply illogical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the once case where I&amp;#39;d say you&amp;#39;re in trouble. But I&amp;#39;d venture to say that the current strings keeping the North Korea situation from collapsing are strong enough that going there on a trip is extremely safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more leeway to your behavior than you might realize when you&amp;#39;re over there. You won&amp;#39;t get arrested for life for a slight slip up. You&amp;#39;d need to go out of your way to piss them off enough to get yourself arrested. If on a tour you accidentally wander away from the path you&amp;#39;re supposed to be on, or if you make an off-color joke, you won&amp;#39;t get arrested. If you bring and distribute Bibles to locals, sneak out of your hotel at night with a camera, or attempt to steal state property, you&amp;#39;re going to have a bad time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not wrong that it&amp;#39;s probably better to visit Japan, Norway, France, or the dozens of other lovely places on this Earth that you can see without worrying about ethical quandaries or being arrested, places where you can see real, authentic life.
