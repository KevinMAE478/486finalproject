It's actually my first ever try at a gradient! I did that thing where you paint the colors onto the bottom of a makeup sponge.

I.e. I used one color application per hand. After I did all the nails I would go back and blend the thumb which got a heavier application. A smarter person would just dab off the excess on paper, but I used my thumb.\n\n-It doesn't look like it, but about 40% of the sponge area was the white color, 40% was the light pink and 20% was the bright orange/red/pink. You need waaaay more of the light colors to blend it evenly. Having very little of the brighter color allows you to dab the sponge around more without worrying about it getting overwhelmed by the brighter color. This lets you blend the bajeezus out of the lines.\n\n-So. many. layers. - there are like 4-6? layers on there I think. Lots of thin layers.\n\n-And it looks much less smooth of a gradient before the topcoat goes on, so it's a bit of a trust fall at the end\n\nI realize this turned into a really long post.
