It implies that the gun spawns the violence instead of just being the tool with which it is perpetrated. \"Gun violence\" is a red herring. Chasing \"gun violence\" instead of being honest with ourselves and going after the root causes is doing ourselves a huge disservice. In 2014, black Americans were just approximately 12% of the population but made up [51% of the murder victims and 37.2% of known murderers](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-offense).

It's completely tone deaf to the really big racial issues that this country faces. If you need an example of just how incredibly racist the gun control narrative is, just look at the fact that dozens of blacks can be murdered daily in Chicago but it takes a shooting at a school or college or in a predominately white neighborhood for the news to start screaming for more gun control. Just look at your own country's news coverage of murders in the US. Do you ever see anything about the daily murders in Chicago, Baltimore, or New Orleans? Well more people get killed in those places in a single week than even the absolute worse mass shootings, but yet you hear nothing about it.\n\nAnd going back to just the issue of gun control, the statistics simply do not add up. You can sit here all day long and tell us about how the UK or Australia reduced gun violence by banning guns but the reality is that you are talking about countries that had much lower homicide rates to begin with. [And that the United States also saw a drop in the homicide rate even as the number of guns exploded.](http://reason.com/archives/2016/01/05/you-know-less-than-you-think-a) \n\nYou can be flabbergasted all you want but the mantra that \"more guns = more violence\", that the US simply just needs to get rid of guns and we'll magically see a drop in the murder rate just isn't supported by the reality of the past couple of decades, a reality that we experience every day. In small-town America, guns are everywhere and are just an accepted part of everyday life yet there's no huge problem of gun fights or murders in the street. Your incredulity isn't going to change that.\n\nLook, I don't expect you to understand all the nuances of American society. That would be ridiculous to expect from someone who doesn't live here. But it is equally ridiculous for you and others to sit here and pass judgment and act like you have anywhere near an acceptably educated and nuanced understanding of what the situation is in the US and why it is the way it is.

If you need an example of just how incredibly racist the gun control narrative is, just look at the fact that dozens of blacks can be murdered daily in Chicago but it takes a shooting at a school or college or in a predominately white neighborhood for the news to start screaming for more gun control. Just look at your own country&amp;#39;s news coverage of murders in the US. Do you ever see anything about the daily murders in Chicago, Baltimore, or New Orleans? Well more people get killed in those places in a single week than even the absolute worse mass shootings, but yet you hear nothing about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And going back to just the issue of gun control, the statistics simply do not add up. You can sit here all day long and tell us about how the UK or Australia reduced gun violence by banning guns but the reality is that you are talking about countries that had much lower homicide rates to begin with. &lt;a href=\"http://reason.com/archives/2016/01/05/you-know-less-than-you-think-a\"&gt;And that the United States also saw a drop in the homicide rate even as the number of guns exploded.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can be flabbergasted all you want but the mantra that &amp;quot;more guns = more violence&amp;quot;, that the US simply just needs to get rid of guns and we&amp;#39;ll magically see a drop in the murder rate just isn&amp;#39;t supported by the reality of the past couple of decades, a reality that we experience every day. In small-town America, guns are everywhere and are just an accepted part of everyday life yet there&amp;#39;s no huge problem of gun fights or murders in the street. Your incredulity isn&amp;#39;t going to change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I don&amp;#39;t expect you to understand all the nuances of American society. That would be ridiculous to expect from someone who doesn&amp;#39;t live here. But it is equally ridiculous for you and others to sit here and pass judgment and act like you have anywhere near an acceptably educated and nuanced understanding of what the situation is in the US and why it is the way it is. All I ask of you is to be critical and ask questions when you&amp;#39;re presented with articles that proclaim to know what is going on in America and try to pin the blame on one definitive scapegoat or another.
