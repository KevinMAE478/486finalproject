I&amp;#39;m actually using this situation to spark a conversation about the misconception about nudes, expectations, and entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the man asked for nudes. It seems that everyone is assuming he is entitled to them. When he simply just asked a question and awaited a response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the definitions of entitlement is&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;the belief that one is inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which again is where I believe the miscommunication starts. He might have had past women who send him nudes so it might be a common behavior for him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;why are we all assuming everyone should act the same? When you meet new people you are exposed to different experiences. To blatantly call a person out for asking for nudes without asking why is presumptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It bothers me that everyone skips that part, and jumps to shaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;..now the latter part where he says. &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s 2017&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could actually be a teaching moment from the opposite party to say stuff like, &amp;quot;Yeah I know, but I&amp;#39;m different&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t send out nudes&amp;quot;. The conversation would be over, and both people would have learned something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you actually want change in the world, teach people to be better.
