Honestly, I was going to dump him after he said some questionable things, but was still sort of in the wake of all that \"liberals don't engage\" bullcrap and was trying to push against it.) As a result, I've been doing a little thinking about this lately.\n\nFor me, feminism means (1) acknowledging that our society has perpetuated and continues to perpetuate gender inequality in a variety of ways; and (2) working to eliminate those inequalities as much as possible. And - something that was perhaps a major sticking point with this ex - I don't think that we have to tailor our approach to gender inequality as if all genders experience gender inequality equally. The fact of the matter is that most of the gender inequality in this world arises out of social norms, institutions, bias, etc that places men as powerful/in control/subjects and women as property/powerless/objects. Terms like \"patriarchy\", \"internalized misogyny\", and \"toxic masculinity\" are useful and valid because they are a way of naming and describing these trends and patterns that tend to happen over and over again. I believe it's also possible to point out and recognize these trends as major defining characteristics of gender inequality within our society while also noticing and working against other smaller trends of gender inequality in our society that may affect men more than women.\n\nAdditionally, in my view, a lot of modern gender inequality in the US arises out of social norms and unconscious bias, so while I support certain government actions to combat gender inequality (e.g. minimizing restrictions on access to reproductive care; shoring up existing protections for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence; paid paternity leave) my feminism is also focused a lot more on changing cultural norms and addressing latent bias that we ourselves might not be aware of, but nonetheless has an impact. (For instance, if men are lauded for taking paternity leave or being minimally decent parents, but women are socially stigmatized for any small mistake in parenting, women are going to have a harder time balancing career, family, and social connections than men are. Part of feminism's job is to get people to think about why these trends occur, and to look at themselves and their actions critically so they try to avoid perpetuating these trends.) \n\nI do also believe that feminism often takes too narrow a scope, and often does so based on a privileged perspective. For instance, it really bothers me that the \"work-life balance\" conversation is restricted to how we can allow women to be mothers and work at the same time. If this is a question for women, it should be a question for men as well. But beyond that, this entire debate ignores the domestic workers (who are predominately women and often disadvantaged due to economic or immigration status, a language barrier or some other characteristic) who effectively permit this sort of dual-working-parent household to exist. Similarly, discussions about sexual objectification may not always consider how women of color experience objectification differently (and often more severely). In short, feminism should be intersectional.\n\nPeople I date don't have to consider themselves \"feminists\" (although I would give a woman I was talking to a second look if she didn't consider herself a feminist in some respect) but I do expect them to be generally culturally competent. That is, to understand that gender bias (and other biases!) exist even though they are often unconscious, and to understand that these biases in conjunction with historical trends can actually have a pretty significant impact on the way our world operates such that people of different genders (or races etc) in the same position often have different opportunities and receive different treatment. And if we talk about those inequities, we by no means have to have the same perspective about how to deal with them, but we need to be able to have that conversation without them butting in \"but what about the men\" \"but what about white people\" \"but what about straight people\" etc etc.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the last person I was seeing dumped me for being &amp;quot;too feminist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;too extreme&amp;quot;.

As a result, I&amp;#39;ve been doing a little thinking about this lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, feminism means (1) acknowledging that our society has perpetuated and continues to perpetuate gender inequality in a variety of ways; and (2) working to eliminate those inequalities as much as possible. And - something that was perhaps a major sticking point with this ex - I don&amp;#39;t think that we have to tailor our approach to gender inequality as if all genders experience gender inequality equally. The fact of the matter is that most of the gender inequality in this world arises out of social norms, institutions, bias, etc that places men as powerful/in control/subjects and women as property/powerless/objects. Terms like &amp;quot;patriarchy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;internalized misogyny&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;toxic masculinity&amp;quot; are useful and valid because they are a way of naming and describing these trends and patterns that tend to happen over and over again. I believe it&amp;#39;s also possible to point out and recognize these trends as major defining characteristics of gender inequality within our society while also noticing and working against other smaller trends of gender inequality in our society that may affect men more than women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in my view, a lot of modern gender inequality in the US arises out of social norms and unconscious bias, so while I support certain government actions to combat gender inequality (e.g. minimizing restrictions on access to reproductive care; shoring up existing protections for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence; paid paternity leave) my feminism is also focused a lot more on changing cultural norms and addressing latent bias that we ourselves might not be aware of, but nonetheless has an impact. (For instance, if men are lauded for taking paternity leave or being minimally decent parents, but women are socially stigmatized for any small mistake in parenting, women are going to have a harder time balancing career, family, and social connections than men are. Part of feminism&amp;#39;s job is to get people to think about why these trends occur, and to look at themselves and their actions critically so they try to avoid perpetuating these trends.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do also believe that feminism often takes too narrow a scope, and often does so based on a privileged perspective. For instance, it really bothers me that the &amp;quot;work-life balance&amp;quot; conversation is restricted to how we can allow women to be mothers and work at the same time. If this is a question for women, it should be a question for men as well. But beyond that, this entire debate ignores the domestic workers (who are predominately women and often disadvantaged due to economic or immigration status, a language barrier or some other characteristic) who effectively permit this sort of dual-working-parent household to exist. Similarly, discussions about sexual objectification may not always consider how women of color experience objectification differently (and often more severely). In short, feminism should be intersectional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People I date don&amp;#39;t have to consider themselves &amp;quot;feminists&amp;quot; (although I would give a woman I was talking to a second look if she didn&amp;#39;t consider herself a feminist in some respect) but I do expect them to be generally culturally competent. That is, to understand that gender bias (and other biases!) exist even though they are often unconscious, and to understand that these biases in conjunction with historical trends can actually have a pretty significant impact on the way our world operates such that people of different genders (or races etc) in the same position often have different opportunities and receive different treatment. And if we talk about those inequities, we by no means have to have the same perspective about how to deal with them, but we need to be able to have that conversation without them butting in &amp;quot;but what about the men&amp;quot; &amp;quot;but what about white people&amp;quot; &amp;quot;but what about straight people&amp;quot; etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OkCupid", "name": "t1_dgersrk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492522980.0, "created_utc": 1492494180.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfs7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdvvi4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dimeanddash", "parent_id": "t1_dgdvf3z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OkCupid", "controversiality": 0, "body": "they aren't. words have connotations and denotations, and connotations can vary according to experience. \n\ni don't really get how you can say that words are defined by usage and then be upset when not all usages necessarily align with yours- because there are a lot of different types of feminism, and they're labeled accordingly as they develop.\n\nquite frankly it seems like your attitude towards this basically boils down to 'everyone's opinions are dumb so discourse is a waste of time' which seems like you have a pretty educationally elitist bar for who should be included at the table", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;they aren&amp;#39;t. words have connotations and denotations, and connotations can vary according to experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t really get how you can say that words are defined by usage and then be upset when not all usages necessarily align with yours- because there are a lot of different types of feminism, and they&amp;#39;re labeled accordingly as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;quite frankly it seems like your attitude towards this basically boils down to &amp;#39;everyone&amp;#39;s opinions are dumb so discourse is a waste of time&amp;#39;
