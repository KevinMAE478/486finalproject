Not being understanding and supportive w/r/t my mental health is 100% a dealbreaker for me;\n\n* On the flip side, if they're the sort to be especially understanding and supportive, I'd also like to know that ASAP, because it's something I value quite a bit and knowing that about a new partner goes a long way toward making me feel comfortable opening up to them emotionally and allowing myself to be vulnerable around them;\n\n* In general, I think one of the main goals early on when dating someone new is to help them get a sense of who I am as a person - how I think and behave, what's important to me, etc. - and knowing about my experiences with anxiety goes a long way toward that goal. \n\nWhen I was younger, I used to take a very different approach, avoiding the conversation as long as possible. I basically thought of my anxiety as a personality flaw, something that objectively made me less desirable and that I wanted to avoid bringing up until I had enough time to demonstrate my positive traits and make the other person sufficiently attached/attracted to me that the revelation of my anxiety wouldn't be a dealbreaker. In hindsight, I think this was an unproductive and unhealthy way to look at it. My anxiety is part of who I am and how I relate to the world around me and the people in my life, and it can't be neatly separated from my personality as a whole. Rather than looking for people who like me enough to be with me despite my anxiety, I now look for people who understand, accept, and like me as a person, anxiety and all. That doesn't mean romanticizing anxiety or thinking it's a good thing that I experience the related symptoms, just that they don't look at my anxiety as a flaw they are magnanimously overlooking, and never make me feel less worthy of love/affection because of it.\n\nIn my current relationship, my anxiety was literally the very first thing we talked about in person. I was a bit of a nervous wreck for our first date (my social anxiety always flares up for first dates, and I was crushing pretty hard on her based on her profile and our pre-first date chats so I was even more anxious than usual), and she picked up on it immediately. She was very understanding and comforting, and she basically just talked me through what I was feeling anxious about until it began to subside. We proceeded to have a great conversation and really hit it off. It was probably the best first date I've ever had, and our next couple dates were a lot less nerve-wracking than usual for me because I knew that if I got anxious, I didn't have to hide it or be embarrassed about it, and she would be supportive and help me through it. Before long, seeing her became a far more effective treatment for my anxiety symptoms than all the CBT techniques and medications I've tried combined.\n\nNow, I wouldn't necessarily recommend bringing it up on the first date as a general rule - I think that depends a lot on how comfortable you are with each other and how quickly you start opening up overall - but I'd say that once you get to the point where you move beyond small talk and start telling each other private/personal things about your life experiences, I'd make anxiety one of the first things you talk about.

Not being understanding and supportive w/r/t my mental health is 100% a dealbreaker for me;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if they&amp;#39;re the sort to be especially understanding and supportive, I&amp;#39;d also like to know that ASAP, because it&amp;#39;s something I value quite a bit and knowing that about a new partner goes a long way toward making me feel comfortable opening up to them emotionally and allowing myself to be vulnerable around them;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, I think one of the main goals early on when dating someone new is to help them get a sense of who I am as a person - how I think and behave, what&amp;#39;s important to me, etc. - and knowing about my experiences with anxiety goes a long way toward that goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I used to take a very different approach, avoiding the conversation as long as possible. I basically thought of my anxiety as a personality flaw, something that objectively made me less desirable and that I wanted to avoid bringing up until I had enough time to demonstrate my positive traits and make the other person sufficiently attached/attracted to me that the revelation of my anxiety wouldn&amp;#39;t be a dealbreaker. In hindsight, I think this was an unproductive and unhealthy way to look at it.
