Like anything. Go to work, go exercise, see my friends, all within a 5 mile radius. Boring as watching white paint dry. My profile doesn't look like this at all, but that's the reality of it all. Profiles are giant ass lies that selectively pick what we want the world to see. \n\nSo how do you compare to that? Find your own passion. It honestly doesn't matter what that passion is (as long as it's not uber creepy like collecting vials of blood). Having a passion is a form of magnetism that draws people to you.\n\nPlus travel is just travel. If a person is superficially going places without actually expanding their knowledge or cultural appreciation, they're really just spending lots of money to see pretty things and then go home without really getting a feel for the world. \n\nFYI: South East Asia is alright. Hot and humid as fuck though during many of the months. Also, Macchu Pichu does not have a 15 lane highway and a 8 acre parking lot right next to it that people crop out of photos, despite seeming like it does.

How do I know? &lt;strong&gt;Because I&amp;#39;m one of them.&lt;/strong&gt; I can rattle off the countries (more than 20) and cities I&amp;#39;ve been to, the number of world wonders, the time we did this, that and almost got killed/kidnapped/shot at/burned alive in a weird exotic place, etc. I got a decent number of interesting hobbies and a decent job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of weeks I don&amp;#39;t do anything interesting. Like anything. Go to work, go exercise, see my friends, all within a 5 mile radius. Boring as watching white paint dry. My profile doesn&amp;#39;t look like this at all, but that&amp;#39;s the reality of it all. Profiles are giant ass lies that selectively pick what we want the world to see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do you compare to that? Find your own passion. It honestly doesn&amp;#39;t matter what that passion is (as long as it&amp;#39;s not uber creepy like collecting vials of blood). Having a passion is a form of magnetism that draws people to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus travel is just travel. If a person is superficially going places without actually expanding their knowledge or cultural appreciation, they&amp;#39;re really just spending lots of money to see pretty things and then go home without really getting a feel for the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FYI: South East Asia is alright.
