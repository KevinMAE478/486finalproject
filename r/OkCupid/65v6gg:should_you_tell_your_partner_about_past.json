I don&amp;#39;t know, it&amp;#39;s a grey area.

At the same time, you&amp;#39;re totally right, no one should dictate who you can talk to--so, I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OkCupid", "name": "t1_dgdxns8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484326.0, "created_utc": 1492455526.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdvy8p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LifelongNoob", "parent_id": "t1_dgdg5jf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OkCupid", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; recently it was pointed out to me ... that continuing to text and talk to guys I had hooked up with in the past was also not cool.\n\nI mean it's \"not cool\" with them.
