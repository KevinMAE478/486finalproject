However, I got a gut feeling that for some reason I intimidated him. I&amp;#39;m certain he has more experience dating than me and we compared notes on being ghosted and catfished.

He looks kind of nervous and rattles off &amp;quot;so I had fun. Hit me up if you want to hang out again.&amp;quot; No kiss.
