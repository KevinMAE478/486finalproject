I was with a friend and he just latched onto us and started hunting with us and it was odd but we started talking. I\u2019m a weirdo too and always up for an adventure so I gave him my number and told him to text me if he wanted someone to pick with in future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019d send me these bafflingly bad texts saying things like \u201cHi chilighter I\u2019m in [3 hours away] and will be here for another 45 minutes want to come mushroom picking like u said?\u201d and I\u2019d text back explaining time and space to him sometimes, otherwise I\u2019d just ignore. From time to time I\u2019d go camping with him and his girlfriend because they liked to go to a place near me in winter and I\u2019m all over winter beach camping and no one will go with me. J would always tell me he wished I had a girlfriend because he wanted to have a couple to camp with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day he sends me this text which I will try to relate as close to verbatim as possible: \u201chi chilighter your a real good dude and I love u a lot. I really want u to have grillfriend and I know a girl, very beautiful sensitive too. The kinda girl who will stare at a dew drop for hours. I really want you to b happy u want to meet her? If u do come on Friday to swiss chalet with me n [my girlfriend] we have 2 go there bc I have a coupon. I really hope this is it and we can celebrate your joys\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, I declined. I told him I\u2019d meet her but not at the swiss chalet on a coupon double date but some part of me kind of wished I had and she\u2019d been my soulmate so we could have had that text engraved on our wedding centrepieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OkCupid", "name": "t1_dg6qwez", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068070.0, "created_utc": 1492039270.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 42}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rct2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z94i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6l9u9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "g_squidman", "parent_id": "t1_dg6kzpa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OkCupid", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I hope this keeps going.
