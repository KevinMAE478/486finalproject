asymptomatic , 25% symptomatic and 30% no t having herpes percentages. Lets completely ignore how accurate they might be for arguments sake.\n\n\nScenario 1 - What you described and I agree 100% with.\nI see a guy on the street. Without any other knowledge there is a 45+25 = 70% chance that he has herpes, a 45% chance that he is asymptomatic and 25% chance that he is well aware that he has herpes.\n\n\nScenario 2:\nI have never had a herpes outbreak nor been tested, the probability of me having herpes is not 70% as that includes those who has gotten an outbreak and I haven't. It's not 45% that includes the sample space of people who have gotten outbreaks and I have never had an outbreak that means that I'm not in that set. It's 45/75 = 60%, the percentage of people that have asymptomatic herpes in the set that never had an outbreak (i.e. asymptomatic / (asymptomatic + herpes free))\n\n\nIf that isn't clear enough here are detailed calculations, including how to get to this number and back to 70% of people having herpes being asymptomatic.\n\n\nUsing the original rounded estimate (not using rousing after this example). Assuming 45% of the whole population being asymptomatic and 70% having herpes (includes symptomatic people)\n\nAs above, the probability of an asymptomatic person having herpes would be 60% as this can not include the symptomatic people.
