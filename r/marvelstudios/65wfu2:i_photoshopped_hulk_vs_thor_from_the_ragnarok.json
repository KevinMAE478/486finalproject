For Thor it&amp;#39;d be too petty, since human politics are beneath him (I imagine Asgard feels like it kind of owns Earth anyways, since it fancies itself the protectors of Midgard as a less developed realm. So any Earthly government claiming jurisdiction over an Asgardian prince&amp;#39;s actions would be considered asinine and invalid.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Bruce it&amp;#39;d be a case of pacifism and not wanting to step on anyone&amp;#39;s toes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they had to pick a side and fight, I think it&amp;#39;s clear they&amp;#39;d disagree with Tony. Bruce might understand the want for accountability but Secretary Ross&amp;#39;s involvement would have him suspicious as all hell since a government owned super is an exploitable super, which is what Ross wanted to do with Bruce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "marvelstudios", "name": "t1_dgdq9if", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476088.0, "created_utc": 1492447288.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdujvf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AVENGERGOTGDEFENDER", "parent_id": "t1_dgduf37", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/marvelstudios", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "marvelstudios", "name": "t1_dgdujvf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480828.0, "created_utc": 1492452028.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wfu2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeego3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AliveProbably", "parent_id": "t1_dge91z3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/marvelstudios", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If she wasn't over it I don't see why she'd be an Avenger at all.
