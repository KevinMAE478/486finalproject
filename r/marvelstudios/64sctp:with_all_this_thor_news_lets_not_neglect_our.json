Some uproar about the sanctity of tradition, or possibly about the risks that come with royalty being in the fight themselves, but a swift rebuttal by T&amp;#39;Challa about how Wakanda is a country of warriors, and how would he be fit to lead them if he is not willing to also fight? Everyone gets rightfully shot the fuck down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forward to the ceremony, the Black Panther is being coronated as the new king, so he arrives wearing in garb and has the amazing cape draped over him as he takes a knee and the oath.
