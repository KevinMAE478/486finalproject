They&amp;#39;re not trying to emphasize femininity/sexiness, so they give her a very practical look. Compare that to Cersei&amp;#39;s play armor, where she&amp;#39;s ONLY trying to emphasize femininity and her appeal to men, and &lt;a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f4/c6/9d/f4c69d73f2a2e0457c0608026420fd15.jpg\"&gt;goes with the most impractical shit ever.&lt;/a&gt; Which makes sense in this context, because she certainly isn&amp;#39;t a fighter, but you see similar styles on many female characters who are supposed to be warriors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most often it&amp;#39;s just completely unnecessary. The most hilarious to my is Gypsy on Flash where they seem to have taken a leather jacket, cut holes in it, and added random boob cups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "marvelstudios", "name": "t1_dgbw5xr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492365232.0, "created_utc": 1492336432.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbje3u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_Best_01", "parent_id": "t1_dgb3cp6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/marvelstudios", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wouldn't it be more comfortable, even though it has no practical purpose?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be more comfortable, even though it has no practical purpose?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "marvelstudios", "name": "t1_dgbje3u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492337807.0, "created_utc": 1492309007.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65knck", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uii8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65knck", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbkvl5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Baelor_Breakspear", "parent_id": "t1_dgbdnb2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/marvelstudios", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What about Thor 3?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about Thor 3?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "marvelstudios", "name": "t1_dgbkvl5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492339995.0, "created_utc": 1492311195.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbdnb2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheObstruction", "parent_id": "t1_dgb3cp6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/marvelstudios", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I'm so sick of boob armor.
