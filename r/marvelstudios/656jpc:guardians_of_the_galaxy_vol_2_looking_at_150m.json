Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came out, and Guardians moved to #2 at the BO for two weeks. But look what happened next, Guardians ended up being #1 at the BO for **THREE** weeks straight. That means, people didn't care to see TMNT anymore (mainly because it was strictly for children, and just plain sucked), and the only fun, family friendly film worth watching that was of high quality that was still in theaters....was GOTG. Since no other family friendly film was even remotely worth watching, GOTG was getting tickets by **default**, even a month after its release, and was the #1 movie families were going to that summer.\n\nThat won't be the case come this May. Alien: Covenant was initially scheduled to release in early August, but was moved to May, between GOTG 2 and Pirates 5. Do you know what that means? That means the studio is **massively** confident in the film. To move it out of its original slot, and put it in between two Disney mammoth blockbusters, shows Fox is damn confident the movie is good and people will go see it. \n\nThen you have Pirates 5. Yeah, the last one was shit, and it made a billion. There hasn't been a Pirates movie in six years, and Jack Sparrow is one of the most iconic characters of all time.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came out, and Guardians moved to #2 at the BO for two weeks. But look what happened next, Guardians ended up being #1 at the BO for &lt;strong&gt;THREE&lt;/strong&gt; weeks straight. That means, people didn&amp;#39;t care to see TMNT anymore (mainly because it was strictly for children, and just plain sucked), and the only fun, family friendly film worth watching that was of high quality that was still in theaters....was GOTG. Since no other family friendly film was even remotely worth watching, GOTG was getting tickets by &lt;strong&gt;default&lt;/strong&gt;, even a month after its release, and was the #1 movie families were going to that summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#39;t be the case come this May. Alien: Covenant was initially scheduled to release in early August, but was moved to May, between GOTG 2 and Pirates 5. Do you know what that means?
