Considering all the exposition in the shows about them, this seems to be a flaw in the writing and not an intentional thing to build up hype. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general I don&amp;#39;t like it when movie sequels push back information about key plot points and characters. It feels like another &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, a series of confusing character motivations and murky lore that people try to excuse because it&amp;#39;ll supposedly come up in a sequel.
