The lack of an official timeline is why there are some noteworthy debates when it comes to the placement of various films, because the dialogue and dating clues alone don't always line up within the movies.\n\n*Iron Man* may take place in either 2008 or 2010. The case for it being placed in 2010 is due to a retroactive ripple effect that starts with *The Avengers*, which is hard-set in 2012. *The Avengers* references the events of *Thor* and says that they happened \"last year,\" but we know that *Thor* took place at the same time as *Iron Man 2* (since that's why Coulson abruptly leaves in the middle of IM2). *Iron Man 2*, from there, establishes that the events of *Iron Man* took place six months ago, and that Tony's fling with Christine was \"last year.\" So if *The Avengers* is in 2012, then *Iron Man 2* must be in 2011, and *Iron Man* must be in 2010.\n\nHowever. *Civil War*, which is hard-set in 2016, refers to the events of *Iron Man* as having happened eight years ago, which would put it in 2008 (the film's year of release, which at one point in the film is also clearly visible on a TV screen). This is a flat-out inconsistency that has yet to be addressed in any official capacity.\n\nSame for the infamous *Iron Man 3* dating problem. Various news sources say that it takes place six months after *The Avengers*, which would mean Christmas 2012. But I have searched up and down for the origin of this claim and simply cannot find it. It's not stated within the film itself. And even the film isn't very clear. The opening scene takes place, frustratingly, on the very precipice of the year 2000.

Moreover, a brief shot of a newspaper is dated to December 2013. This could simply be a prop error, or it could indicate that the film is set in 2013, and if that were the case, then the references to 1999/2000 would be rounding. Also, at one point, Tony jokes to Maya about hoping there isn't a twleve-year-old kid waiting in her car, to which she responds, \"He's thirteen.\" Obviously this is just banter, but theoretically, if Tony *had* impregnated Maya in 1999, then she would have given birth in approximately September 2000.

He fell in 1945 (as confirmed in *The Winter Soldier*), but 75 years on top of that would put *Age of Ultron* in 2020. But that's purely insane. You could argue that he's rounding, but by five whole years? And when he's wasting the extra breath to say \"-five\" when just \"seventy\" would be both more concise and perfectly accurate?
