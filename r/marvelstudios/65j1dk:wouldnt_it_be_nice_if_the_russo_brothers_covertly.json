Take The Avengers, and insert a famous actress as the waitress and it becomes totally baffling and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is that a famous actor or actress draws attention to themselves when they show up in a movie. Claire Temple is Rosario Dawson, so you&amp;#39;ve automatically lost the ability to do a waitress-level sequence with the character. You have to explain who she is and why she&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if Rosario&amp;#39;s cameo would create questions, it&amp;#39;s easier to explain &amp;quot;nurse working with heroes&amp;quot; who happens to be in the right place at the right time than some blind vigilante or warrior with magic fists. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;#39;m inclined to agree. But that&amp;#39;s no argument for the ideas being thrown around for how to integrate Claire Temple as anything other than distracting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also I understand you expect something else, but for me movies recognizing that Netflix characters exist would be more than cheap thrill for fanboys.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, you&amp;#39;ve yet to make that case. The day I read a really great idea of how to integrate these characters, I&amp;#39;ll be happy to say, &amp;quot;Awesome!
