Its a scene that obviously builds to the conclusion of Peter finding out he was lied to and switching sides. I know my language in the post was a little too strong (&amp;quot;Tony is clearly in the wrong&amp;quot;), but really I appreciate the complexity of the issue surrounding the Accords. This isn&amp;#39;t a conversation about who we, the audience, thinks is right or who&amp;#39;s gay for who, but who Peter would agree with if he was given the full story. And that&amp;#39;s not my opinion, its right there in the scene I linked to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; suggest you calm down, but I really don&amp;#39;t care if you do.
