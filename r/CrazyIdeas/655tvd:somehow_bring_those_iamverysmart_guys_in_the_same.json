Ross knew everything about everything and was the worst kind of know it all, because while being very intelligent and capable in class, he lacked any kind of social grace.  He thought that being good in class meant that he should enlighted others so they too could be smart, forcibly if neccessary.  So he'd tell you something and if you disagreed, he'd argue you until you gave in, because you didn't know as much as him, clearly. Once, he argued my at-the-time girlfriend about makeup.  Guess what her biggest hobby was: yep, makeup.  This is the girl who got paid every year of highschool to do 15+ girl's makeup for prom, and for several years after she graduated, people still came to her because of her reputation.  And this clown still argued her, not for lols, but because he \"knew more than she did.\"\n\nThen we had **Owen**, who didn't think he knew everything, but was certain that the things he did know were true and could never be convinced otherwise.  He was also (in my oppinion) a hipster in the truest sense of the word.  He dressed the part not because it was a trend, but because he genuinely thought it was a good look on him.  He'd always be telling you about some band or show you'd never heard of (thankfully without being terribly elitist about it) and you could tell there was real exitment for sharing it with you.  But the problem comes back to him never being capable of thinking he was wrong.  If he knew he was right, his brain legitimately could not accept that he was wrong.  While others in this list might realize it, but try to hide it, Owen could not be wrong.\n\nNext we had **Jimmy** who, like many people do, tried on different personality quirks during middle and high school.  The problem is most of us realize the shit ones and move one, but not Jimmy, oh no.  Jimmy landed on the \"Indeed, good sir\" speech pattern and the \"lulz so randum\" personality and never let them go.  Unlike the others, he would back down eventually, not admitting defeat so much as being bored arguing with brick walls and giving a \"yeah, sure, whatever\" to leave the argument, which inevitably spurred them to argue harder, especially Ross.  And he got butthurt like noone I've ever met since.  He'd sulk for days sometimes, not showing up to the table, or even coming to school if he'd been slighted hard enough in his mind.\n\nAnd last, we had **John**, who was a \"hardcore MLG gamer.\"  He \"knew\" everything there was to know about gaming and being the best at it.  His idea of \"hanging out with friends\" was to invite 2 or 3 over to celebrate the launch of starcraft, then have them sit and watch as he played the campaign...so yeah.  Basically any time games came up in the discussion, he'd chime in with his wisdom.\n\nThese 4 personalities couldn't co-exist without arguing about something at least once a day.
