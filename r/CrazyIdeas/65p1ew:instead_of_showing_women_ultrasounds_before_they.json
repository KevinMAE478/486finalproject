Allowing women access to birth control / abortion improves not just their life but in turn many other peoples&amp;#39; lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, some women aren&amp;#39;t healthy enough to have a kid. Or sometimes ectopic pregnancies occur even to women who really want a child. In both situations the right thing to do is terminate the pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are even cases (this is rare) where parents will find out that the child has a rare disease at 23 and will not live for more than a day or two after being born. That child&amp;#39;s life out of the womb would literally be only suffering. The most humane thing to do would be to terminate it before it suffers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to answer your first statement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making abortion illegal doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily prevent deaths. If a woman really wants an abortion she&amp;#39;ll try unsafe methods which could potentially create more deaths than keeping abortion legal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when an abortion occurs, the fetus is under 15 weeks. It&amp;#39;s definitely not alive yet. It&amp;#39;s just a mass of tissue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CrazyIdeas", "name": "t1_dgcg751", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492399680.0, "created_utc": 1492370880.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 54}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2snxj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p1ew", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgch86d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VGLightning", "parent_id": "t1_dgcfn5m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrazyIdeas", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would like to pose a question/different viewpoint: How can something die if it is not yet considered alive?\n\nThis is an impossible argument, as it always comes down to the incredulously subjective question of \"When does life begin?\".
