The other factor with hand guns is the barrel length. Most handguns nowdays have short barrels to be easily concealed, so the rifling doesn&amp;#39;t get the bullet to spin as fast, therefore less impact on target. I think a 9mm to the center of your body gives you a better chance of survival than both a larger and smaller caliber bullet; smaller won&amp;#39;t have enough energy to exit so it&amp;#39;ll bounce around the body cavity, larger will cause too much tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg4g8ls", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954900.0, "created_utc": 1491926100.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4c21s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AWMSS", "parent_id": "t1_dg3v3io", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Who says 9mm is only lethal up to 150 feet?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who says 9mm is only lethal up to 150 feet?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg4c21s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491950192.0, "created_utc": 1491921392.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64od45", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4i3xi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ngdurh", "parent_id": "t1_dg3v3io", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; \u2713\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2713&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg4i3xi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956943.0, "created_utc": 1491928143.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64od45", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64od45", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64od45", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64od45", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64od45", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6nqz2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Physical_removal", "parent_id": "t1_dg6n1bm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\ud83d\udc4d", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\ud83d\udc4d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg6nqz2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492064155.0, "created_utc": 1492035355.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6n1bm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AWMSS", "parent_id": "t1_dg6kgpk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My thoughts exactly.

A handgun chambered in 9mm parabellum could easily produce a wound like this, the 9mm projectile weighs around 7.5 grams, whereas a baguette weighs around 250 grams,\n\n2. A 9mm round travels around 1,300 feet per second (ft/s.), with about ~580 J of energy. But the 9mm is only considered lethal up to about 150 feet, so the minimum would be around 1,300 ft/s, but considering the weight difference, it would need to have around 19,000 J to create the same result from about 150 feet away,\n\n3. but if the baguette were to be shot by a sniper, presumably at some distance, it would never reach the target at 19,000 J. So we need to examine a larger caliber, such as the .950 JDJ round, \n\n4. The .950 is almost an inch in diameter and weighs around 230 g, close to the baguette. This bullet travels with a velocity of around 2,200 ft/s, but it packs over 52,000 J of energy. It'll shoot clear through a tank or concrete wall, but is obviously available to the general public for sporting purposes. 52,000 J is about enough energy needed to propel a baguette through a German soldier's mouth from a few hundred yards away, but there are some other considerations that make me question the authenticity of the photo,\n\n5. I don't understand aerodynamics, but a bullet is far more suited for maintaining speed and accuracy during flight thanks to it's shape and density. Bullets do drop and are susceptible to wind and atmospheric conditions, so the sniper would most likely need to be at a seriously elevated position, perhaps on the fuselage of a UFO, on a sunny day with little to no humidity,\n\n6. I am not confident that the baguette would reach the target completely intact as pictured above since most baguettes are not very dense,\n\n7. The pathology of gun shot wounds tells us that when a bullet strikes tissue is creates a cavity around the path of travel. This is caused by the energy from the bullet and is made up of crushed tissue and cellular debris. In this particular case, the exit point of the wound (back of the mouth) would receive the most energy. A wound to the head doesn't allow much room for the cavity to absorb the energy, so pressure waves would likely would cause the head to explode from the jaw upwards. Additionally, the baguette would travel through the wall behind the patient and into the production line at your local Subway sandwich shop,\n\n8.
