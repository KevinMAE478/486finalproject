In terms of military power, current spending is absolutely a metric of raw power.  People are ~~not the main cost of the army, but weaponry~~ ~50% of our military budget, which means we're spending $300,000,000,000 training, educating, and then paying our soldiers.  The other 50% goes into weapons development and strategic defense maintenance.  The military industrial complex takes millions in federal funds into the hands of weapons companies to develop better technology all the time.  The Tomahawk Missiles recently fired cost about $742,000 a piece (~3500 missiles amounting to $2,600,000,000).  If we have the most spending, it's because we're buying the most cutting edge equipment, and even developing it.  If you're consistently spending the most, you're doing it to build up an arsenal.
