You can jump from as high as you want, but as soon as you get back near Earth, where the atmosphere is thick, you will end up traveling at terminal velocity, which depends primarily on your attitude and arm position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cliff divers that jump from nearly 150&amp;#39; only reach depths of 12-16 feet. From this height, they are traveling roughly 70 mph when they hit the water. Terminal velocity for a skydiver is around 200 mph, Felix hit 834 mph, but was going much slower when. He got to thicker atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I&amp;#39;d say 20-25 feet is going to be a max depth unless the skydiver is wearing a very aerodynamic suit that is intended to penetrate the water deeply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg7olkg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125227.0, "created_utc": 1492096427.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655fg3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8h5jg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nosecohn", "parent_id": "t3_655fg3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The same depth as if he were dropped from a few thousand feet, because of [terminal velocity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same depth as if he were dropped from a few thousand feet, because of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity\"&gt;terminal velocity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg8h5jg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492158089.0, "created_utc": 1492129289.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655fg3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655fg3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655fg3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8wd9f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "odnish", "parent_id": "t1_dg8vydt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was more interested in a sort of approximate answer, but other people might want to know the orbital mechanics.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was more interested in a sort of approximate answer, but other people might want to know the orbital mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg8wd9f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492184097.0, "created_utc": 1492155297.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8vydt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "singul4r1ty", "parent_id": "t1_dg8nk71", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the ISS has a mass of about 420 metric tonnes and is going at 7.67km/s.
