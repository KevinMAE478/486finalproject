The average human yells at about 88 decibels, which carries along with it about .001 watts, about a 100,000 times less than the energy needed to light a standard 100 watt bulb. If you were to focus this energy at the average 8 oz cup of coffee (we\u2019ll round up to .25 liters to make calculations easier), the average yell lasting a single second would warm the cup of coffee 0.00000095\u00b0 C.\n\nCalculating this is pretty simple to do once you have the raw data laid out. To find out how much energy it takes to change the temperature of a body, you use:\n\nQ = m \u00b7 c \u00b7 (Tf  \u2013 Ti)\n\nHere, m is equal to the amount of mass of the object (in kg) c is the object's specific heat capacity (a constant unique for any material, in J/kg/\u00b0C), the two Ts are the initial and final temperature, and Q tells us how much energy in joules is required. (Obviously this can also be down with other unit systems, but here we are in SI.)\n\nThere are a lot of implied assumptions when we do this \u201cback of the envelope\u201d calculation. We\u2019re assuming things like a perfect transfer of energy from your yell to the coffee, a perfectly insulated cup that will never let any heat escape, and an unending even stream of energy. Obviously creating such a perfect system is extremely difficult in real life, but as we\u2019ll soon see, there are lots of reasons why this method may not be terribly practical.\n\nNow let\u2019s start plugging numbers in. Starting out, say we wanted to raise the temperature of water from a tepid 25\u00b0C to a toasty 75\u00b0C. One quarter of a liter of water weighs .25 kg, and the specific heat of water is around 4200 J/kg/\u00b0C.\n\nQ = .25 kg \u00b7 4200 J/kg/\u00b0C \u00b7 50\u00b0C = 52,000 joules\n\nGreat! So what\u2019s a joule? A joule is a unit of energy. You can calculate the energy of a speeding bullet, or a gram of detonated TNT, etc. Power, the type of measurement for light bulbs and such, is simply a measure of energy per time. A watt is defined as 1 joule per second.\n\nPower = energy / time\n\nP = Q / t\n\nRearranging,\n\nt = Q / P\n\nt = 52000 / .001 = 52,000,000 seconds\n\n= 14,444 hours, 26 minutes and 40 seconds\n\n= 601 days and 20 hours 26 minutes and 40 seconds\n\n= 1 year, 7 months, 26 days, 20 hours, 26 minutes and 40 seconds\n\n**Edit:** to be perfectly clear, this assumes the cup is completely insulated from its environment, which is physically impossible.\n\nIf you consider cooling, you will find that even a very modest heat transfer coefficient with the surrounding air will dissipate heat at a higher rate than the 0.001 W heating rate, so it will not be possible to heat the liquid to any appreciable temp above room temp.\n\nThe heat transfer coefficient (h) is a function of the liquid temperature (as well as lots of other variables that I'm not going to delve into). As you increase the temp, the cooling rate will increase as well. Heating with such low power will produce a very small temperature increase above room temp, and then h will reach 0.001 W for the whole cup and the system is then said to be in equilibrium, with the temperature staying at some temperature slightly warmer than room temperature regardless of how long you shout at your coffee.\n\n**So the answer is either 1.7 years assuming a spherical cow in a vacuum, or never.**", "edited": 1492053167.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound carries a relatively low amount of energy while warming up a cup of coffee an appreciable amount takes much more. The average human yells at about 88 decibels, which carries along with it about .001 watts, about a 100,000 times less than the energy needed to light a standard 100 watt bulb. If you were to focus this energy at the average 8 oz cup of coffee (we\u2019ll round up to .25 liters to make calculations easier), the average yell lasting a single second would warm the cup of coffee 0.00000095\u00b0 C.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calculating this is pretty simple to do once you have the raw data laid out. To find out how much energy it takes to change the temperature of a body, you use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q = m \u00b7 c \u00b7 (Tf  \u2013 Ti)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here, m is equal to the amount of mass of the object (in kg) c is the object&amp;#39;s specific heat capacity (a constant unique for any material, in J/kg/\u00b0C), the two Ts are the initial and final temperature, and Q tells us how much energy in joules is required. (Obviously this can also be down with other unit systems, but here we are in SI.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of implied assumptions when we do this \u201cback of the envelope\u201d calculation. We\u2019re assuming things like a perfect transfer of energy from your yell to the coffee, a perfectly insulated cup that will never let any heat escape, and an unending even stream of energy. Obviously creating such a perfect system is extremely difficult in real life, but as we\u2019ll soon see, there are lots of reasons why this method may not be terribly practical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let\u2019s start plugging numbers in. Starting out, say we wanted to raise the temperature of water from a tepid 25\u00b0C to a toasty 75\u00b0C. One quarter of a liter of water weighs .25 kg, and the specific heat of water is around 4200 J/kg/\u00b0C.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q = .25 kg \u00b7 4200 J/kg/\u00b0C \u00b7 50\u00b0C = 52,000 joules&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great! So what\u2019s a joule? A joule is a unit of energy. You can calculate the energy of a speeding bullet, or a gram of detonated TNT, etc. Power, the type of measurement for light bulbs and such, is simply a measure of energy per time. A watt is defined as 1 joule per second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power = energy / time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P = Q / t&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rearranging,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;t = Q / P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;t = 52000 / .001 = 52,000,000 seconds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;= 14,444 hours, 26 minutes and 40 seconds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;= 601 days and 20 hours 26 minutes and 40 seconds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;= 1 year, 7 months, 26 days, 20 hours, 26 minutes and 40 seconds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; to be perfectly clear, this assumes the cup is completely insulated from its environment, which is physically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you consider cooling, you will find that even a very modest heat transfer coefficient with the surrounding air will dissipate heat at a higher rate than the 0.001 W heating rate, so it will not be possible to heat the liquid to any appreciable temp above room temp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heat transfer coefficient (h) is a function of the liquid temperature (as well as lots of other variables that I&amp;#39;m not going to delve into). As you increase the temp, the cooling rate will increase as well. Heating with such low power will produce a very small temperature increase above room temp, and then h will reach 0.001 W for the whole cup and the system is then said to be in equilibrium, with the temperature staying at some temperature slightly warmer than room temperature regardless of how long you shout at your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the answer is either 1.7 years assuming a spherical cow in a vacuum, or never.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dg6h86b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056769.0, "created_utc": 1492027969.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 715}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650e7z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650e7z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6zx81", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "John_Mica", "parent_id": "t1_dg6so90", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Neat approach.
