This would not necessarily require a bunch of balloons that had sufficient lift to raise a person.  It would also depend largely on the method of hanging, particularly the length of the 'drop'.  In this case maybe how long the balloons were able to raise a slack rope and gain velocity prior to putting force on the neck.\n\nSecond, note that many suicide 'hangings' are actually strangulations.  This could be accomplished with far less lift than the person's weight (for a typical adult, anyway).\n\nHappy Birthday :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mythbusters did a balloon-lift myth using party balloons of the type pictured (as compared to weather balloons or some such).  I am going to use their numbers, since they will be far more accurate than estimating.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They used 3500 balloons to lift a 20kg child, which is 175 balloons per kg, or 11375 balloons for a 65kg person.  There are diminishing returns though, as each additional balloon requires more string/rope/etc. to keep it as part of the bunch, and from a practical standpoint the balloons will lose helium over time, so the bundle would have to be assembled rather quickly.  Given the estimations and varying size and mass of balloons, I would say 10,000-20,000 is about as accurate as one could get.  (Mythbusters went for large balloons, and light string, to give best case.  They were also at close to sea level, with denser air than higher altitudes)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be plenty to lift oneself, and do a &amp;#39;proper&amp;#39; hanging of some sort, but there are some caveats. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s assume that a hanging is successful if the neck is broken.  This would not necessarily require a bunch of balloons that had sufficient lift to raise a person.  It would also depend largely on the method of hanging, particularly the length of the &amp;#39;drop&amp;#39;.  In this case maybe how long the balloons were able to raise a slack rope and gain velocity prior to putting force on the neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, note that many suicide &amp;#39;hangings&amp;#39; are actually strangulations.  This could be accomplished with far less lift than the person&amp;#39;s weight (for a typical adult, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "name": "t1_dgb6z2w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492320068.0, "created_utc": 1492291268.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 69}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x23b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k460", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgg64", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CatzPwn", "parent_id": "t3_65k460", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It took 72 balloons to lift a 5 pound Chihuahua. https://youtu.be/2AprNKQYx30\n\nSo yknow, just multiply that until you get the desired weight.
