But, as you pointed out it was still very much the vanity project of one insane man who sought to make movies by cobbling together ideas and homages of near everything he&amp;#39;d ever seen or liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TFA is a homage to Star Wars and Star Wars alone and thus feels creatively limited. The characters themselves barely feel as if they live in that world but are instead just fans of the original movies. The way Rey and Finn react to Luke&amp;#39;s name or Han Solo feels more like movie fanboys than individuals that lived through the fall of the Empire and Rise of the First Order. The movie also has a fear of tackling politics again for fear of boring the audience, even though politics were inherent even in the OT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m REALLY hoping Rian Johnson actually delivers a Star Wars film and not more fan-wankery because I&amp;#39;d really like to have an actual new SW film to like. And, don&amp;#39;t even mention Rogue One which manages to be even more soulless than TFA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PrequelMemes", "name": "t1_dgcb69z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392995.0, "created_utc": 1492364195.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3i60n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pjjj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3i60n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pjjj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd9gqa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AIMMOTH666", "parent_id": "t1_dgd2zx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PrequelMemes", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I think the prequels are too bad written to believe Palpatine is manipulating everyone.\n\nTFA has charm which prequels doesn't have and, for me, that's more Star Warsy.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the prequels are too bad written to believe Palpatine is manipulating everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TFA has charm which prequels doesn&amp;#39;t have and, for me, that&amp;#39;s more Star Warsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PrequelMemes", "name": "t1_dgd9gqa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492444368.0, "created_utc": 1492415568.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd2zx1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "piglet24", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9vas", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PrequelMemes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I disagree with the prequels not having a backbone.
