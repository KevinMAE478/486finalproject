I'll try and break down the most common ones:\n\nSake is not required. You can add more of the other liquid ingredients (careful with that soy or it will be super salty). If you do this, I'd add a bit of Orange Zest to it.\n\nCook over Medium heat\n\nIt's not identical to the McD's version. It's more of a tribute\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mince 6 cloves of Garlic and sweat (heat them up in a skillet)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;add 4 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;add soy sauce to taste (DO NOT USE LOW SODIUM SAUCE)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;add 2 tablespoon Plum Sake (Drink additional 3 oz Plum Sake)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reduce sauce slightly (Drink additional 1.5 oz Plum Sake)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 1/2 tablespoons cock sauce (Sriracha)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;add 2 tablespoon brown sugar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Red pepper flakes to taste&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minced Ginger to taste&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consume remaining Plum Sake&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simmer that shit for a solid 5 minutes, stirring pretty much constantly. The brown sugar helps it keep the proper consistency, so it&amp;#39;s important to use. Play around with the recipe to your taste. Might want more or less balsamic vinegar. Might want more or more Plum Sake. I&amp;#39;d definitely recommend you make it several times to figure out your own flavor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of questions.
