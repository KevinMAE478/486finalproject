And that's just the first step. Remember, United Airlines is like a giant octopus sprawling its slimy length over city, state, and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of self-created screen. United Airlines seizes in its long and powerful tentacles our executive officers, our legislative bodies, our schools, our courts, our newspapers, and every agency created for the public protection.\n\nIn no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law in order to strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature. That would lead to anarchy. Instead, I advocate seeking some structure in which the cacophony introduced by United Airlines's memoirs might be systematized, reconciled, and made rational, as doing so leads people towards an understanding of how in these days of political correctness and the changing of how history is taught in schools to fulfill a particular agenda, if five years ago I had described an organization like United Airlines to you and told you that in five years it'd enshrine irrational fears and fancies as truth, you'd have thought me parasitic.

If United Airlines's catty tractates became more widespread, it would spell the ruination of this country. That's the end of this letter.
