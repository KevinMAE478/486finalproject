Overall, there has been an extensive militarization of the police.  The police want the ability to deal with problems themselves. They want to have local SWAT teams and military grade equipment.\n\nThis does improve their ability to react to serious threats. However, only the best become SWAT.  So there is a drive to become militaristic there.\n\nYou have to remember that local SWAT teams are still a new-ish thing.  In the past, you really only had SWAT teams in major cities.  And they only dealt with serious problems. Like hostages, stand-offs, or raids on organized crime.  A lot of the time, the national guard would be called in for the real shit. As they were trained for real conflicts.  You didn't want soldiers policing the streets normally. Soldiers are trained to be combative. While police are supposed to serve and protect. To de-escalate problems rather than fight them.\n\nPrior to the war on drugs, US SWAT teams were deployed roughly 3000 times per year. Now we see SWAT being used over 50000 times per year.  Almost every city has a SWAT team these days, and they are deployed for any reason.  Most of the time a warrant gets served, or a situation is deemed risky, the SWAT team gets deployed.  This leads to more interaction between the public, and the arm of the police trained to be combative. Although, the training the police are using seems to be more combative year after year.\n\nThis is a problem. You can see it in the video. The officer reacts to an unarmed individual who is no real threat to him by slamming her to the ground like she is a terrorist with a gun in her hand.  We are supposed to use the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the goal.  To arrest this woman would have required very little force.\n\nSO why isn't more done to stop this behavior?  Because so much is being done to cause this combative behavior. We are giving small town police forces machine guns and tanks and military training on this military hardware.  Of course they are going to become very combative with the people they are supposed to serve and protect.  We are training them and equipping them to fight a war that isn't coming.  History tells is in very certain terms what happens when you have a large standing army.\n\nAs for your second question, \"Why isn't more done to punish these criminals with a badge?\"... well that one is much simpler.\n\nFirst, we're militarizing the police force.  So they are going to act more like soldiers.  Soldiers cover each other's backs. It is us vs them, and the only ones keeping you alive are the guys to your left and right.  In the army, you look after your buddy. Cover up for him if he makes a mistake. You want him to want to keep you alive. \n\nIn the army, this is good. In the police, it's probably a breach of ethics.\n\nFurthermore, when the police fuck up... It's the police who investigate the police.  And the police who decide the punishment.  I mean, that's like the textbook recipe for corruption. There just isn't enough external oversight.  \n\nWhen it  comes down to it, these sort of things are going to continue to happen, and at an increasing rate until we demilitarize the police, reduce SWAT teams to being a single state-wide department external to local police, and implement sweeping reforms to training, oversight, and punishment of police offenses.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a very complicated issue with many contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is the result of politics and the war on drugs.
