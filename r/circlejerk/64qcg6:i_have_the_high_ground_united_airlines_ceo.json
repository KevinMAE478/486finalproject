That is a seven-ten split, or &amp;quot;bed-posts,&amp;quot; when the only pins remaining are in the seven and ten positions (the farthest away possible for two remaining pins to be in, and the hardest position from which the bowler can knock down both of them). A spare, on the other hand, is simply when the bowler knocks down all ten pins and uses both balls to do so. The fact that this meme is reaching such popularity despite this glaring inaccuracy just means that this sub is going downhill fast, as fast as a bowling ball soaring down the lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "name": "t1_dg55rhq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984450.0, "created_utc": 1491955650.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpol", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qcg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4cwiv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "_CallMeCisMale_", "parent_id": "t3_64qcg6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/circlejerk", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fuck Drumpf!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuck Drumpf!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "name": "t1_dg4cwiv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491951174.0, "created_utc": 1491922374.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
