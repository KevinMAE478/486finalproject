Being pissed over my niece's sadness that you helped cause, I helped my bro find your rapeyverse video and he gave me a look that almost gave me a heart attack (it was his eyes more than anything) and calmly said \"Daniel, I'm sorry...but we'll have to cancel the turkey shoot. I have work to do.\" And he immediately started calling some old contacts...when he calls me 'Daniel' I know shit just got real. I honestly can't tell you what my brother will do when he finds you, and he WILL find you. He's the 'creative type' offline and while not a professional interrogator, he got some enemy combatants to talk during his tours and picked up some tricks on dealing VERY high volumes of pain to someone without leaving marks.
