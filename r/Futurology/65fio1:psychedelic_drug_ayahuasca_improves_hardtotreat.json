Try homemade fermented food, the paleo and/or weston price diet approach. Eat natural anti-fungi and antibiotics (e.g. herbs, spices, fermented food, etc.) because they seem to have antidepressant effects as well. Fast regularly. \n\n* sleep right: whatever happens stay in the dark between 10pm and 6am, no screens, no light. Among other things, darkness boosts melatonin levels in the brain. You want that because it's a powerful antidepressant and antioxidant.\n\n* keep your house well aerated, clean and dust free. Avoid pesticide and other chemicals indoors. If you used to be allergic to dust mites as a kid, you should use mechanical protection on your bed and sofas (no chemical protection).  For cleaning use basic soap and water.

Look at the DEA regulation and requirements of simple cannabis  and/or MAPS research to LSD for an example of the hurdles and costs. Even at the university levels. Couple this with a conservative government and those in the population that superficially labeling drugs as either &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; based on their negative connotation from news, DEA, view of drug addicts, or x horror story y street drug, instead of understanding that all drugs, regardless of type, should be viewed more delicately in regards of mechanisms of action and pharmacological profiles for further research and development then one can see this will take some time. Lots of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is kind of a self inflicted wound upon society that leads to endless suffering and health care costs. Why use SSRIs when they are not as effective?

Here's a [fictional treatment of shamanism](http://www.darksunbrightmoon.com/) as it was before the Spanish debased it, written by me and so a shameless advertisement. \n\nThe epicentre of shamanism in the Western Andes is at Huancabamba, city of shamans. I was there last year, for utterly distinct reasons. They tell me that a network of around three million come together in this little provincial town, with pilgrimages from as far as the Philippines. Shamans commute to Lima, Guayaquil and other centres to hold court. Drugs are a part but not a centre of the ritual, which consists of building a \"mesa\", a patterns of ritual objects on a sheet of cloth, with much spraying of aguardiente by the shaman and chanting. [Piece here contains a chant in progress](\nhttp://www.all-peru.info/english/peru/religion.html#shaman).\n\nNote to the impressionable: the book takes the cosmology as true, and then considers what that would mean. The outcome is worrying.
