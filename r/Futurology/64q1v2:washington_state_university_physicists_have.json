A powerful method is provided by spin-orbit coupling, which is currently at the center of intense research efforts. Here we measure an expanding spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate whose dispersion features a region of negative effective mass. We observe a range of dynamical phenomena, including the breaking of parity and of Galilean covariance, dynamical instabilities, and self-trapping. The experimental findings are reproduced by a single-band Gross-Pitaevskii simulation, demonstrating that the emerging features\u2014shock waves, soliton trains, self-trapping, etc.\u2014originate from a modified dispersion.

A powerful method is provided by spin-orbit coupling, which is currently at the center of intense research efforts. Here we measure an expanding spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate whose dispersion features a region of negative effective mass. We observe a range of dynamical phenomena, including the breaking of parity and of Galilean covariance, dynamical instabilities, and self-trapping. The experimental findings are reproduced by a single-band Gross-Pitaevskii simulation, demonstrating that the emerging features\u2014shock waves, soliton trains, self-trapping, etc.\u2014originate from a modified dispersion. Our work also sheds new light on related phenomena in optical lattices, where the underlying periodic structure often complicates their interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dg43zwd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491937061.0, "created_utc": 1491908261.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 54}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q1v2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q1v2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q1v2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q1v2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg519br", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tangerinetrooper", "parent_id": "t1_dg4vo3k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So a negative mass driver can kill Hitler?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a negative mass driver can kill Hitler?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dg519br", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978442.0, "created_utc": 1491949642.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q1v2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q1v2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5kbxr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TUSF", "parent_id": "t1_dg5k1ii", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's pretty much it.
