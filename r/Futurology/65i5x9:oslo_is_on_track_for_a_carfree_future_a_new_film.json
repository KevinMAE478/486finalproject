Speed and the ability to travel distances are the biggest reasons for them being almost necessary in today&amp;#39;s world. Simply putting an average automatic vehicle in &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; and letting off the brake will result in a faster pace than most people can walk for more than a few minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless they plan on putting more residential options nearby, all this will likely do is push the parking garages further out and make it so that people have to spend even more time commuting to work. Cities typically expand with residences on the outskirts, meaning people will be living further and further away from downtown, so more and more of them will pretty much &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to use a car to get into town to get on the public transport.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dgapj1x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492295958.0, "created_utc": 1492267158.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaokms", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hulqbuster", "parent_id": "t1_dgamp7n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Getting your populace to harden the fuck up thru exercise and wearing a coat isn't the worst idea.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your populace to harden the fuck up thru exercise and wearing a coat isn&amp;#39;t the worst idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dgaokms", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294404.0, "created_utc": 1492265604.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i5x9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i5x9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i5x9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb04a8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "h3st", "parent_id": "t1_dgazkk0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We plow and salt our roads, including the bike infra.
