It's a fundamental difference that typical mall stores are on the bad side of: ordering food necessitates paying for it. While people don't want to see the food being eaten, a poster has to buy it to \"show off.\" For clothes, no poster would simply take a pic of the clothes on the rack because they must show how good they look with the clothes on, yet they don't need to actually pay for them to get that pic.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great article. It discusses how department stores are mall &amp;quot;anchors,&amp;quot; where Macy&amp;#39;s, Sears, etc., would be used by other mall stores as lures. Places like Hollister and Abercrombie are losing sales from lack of people wandering around the mall because they &amp;quot;might as well look around as long as they&amp;#39;re here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a social element to this, too. Many young people are driven by the experiences that will make the best social media content\u2014whether it\u2019s a conventional beach pic or a well-lit plate of glistening avocado toast. Laugh if you want, but these sorts of questions\u2014\u201cwhat experience will reliably deliver the most popular Instagram post?\u201d\u2014really drive the behavior of people ages 13 and up. This is a big deal for malls, says Barbara Byrne Denham, a senior economist at Reis, a real-estate analytics firm. Department stores have failed as anchors, but better food, entertainment, and even fitness options might bring teens and families back to struggling malls, where they might wander into brick-and-mortar stores that are currently at risk of closing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; plenty of department store/clothing store Instagram posts; it&amp;#39;s just that you don&amp;#39;t have to buy the clothes to try them on in the changing room and post a pic. It&amp;#39;s a fundamental difference that typical mall stores are on the bad side of: ordering food necessitates paying for it. While people don&amp;#39;t want to see the food being eaten, a poster has to buy it to &amp;quot;show off.&amp;quot; For clothes, no poster would simply take a pic of the clothes on the rack because they must show how good they look with the clothes on, yet they don&amp;#39;t need to actually pay for them to get that pic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dg87xy7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146100.0, "created_utc": 1492117300.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7v68g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 92, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoName57Sauce", "parent_id": "t1_dg7unjd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Basically this.
