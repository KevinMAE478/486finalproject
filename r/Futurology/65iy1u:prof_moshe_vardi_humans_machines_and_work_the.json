Average household size declined substantially during the past 30 years, so household income is being spread across fewer people. The mix of household types\u2014married versus single, young versus old\u2014also changed considerably, so the \u201cmedian household\u201d in 2006 looks quite different from the \u201cmedian household\u201d in 1976. Finally, the measure of income used by the Census Bureau to compute household income excludes some rapidly growing sources of income.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Here is a preview of the key data issues that lead to the higher estimates of median household income growth.\n\n&gt;The price index used by the Census Bureau overstates inflation, and thus understates income gains, relative to a preferred price index.\n\n&gt;A changing mix of household types leads the overall median increase to understate the median increase of most household types.\n\n&gt;The Census Bureau measure of household income understates income growth by excluding some rapidly growing sources of income.\n\n&gt;The remaining difference between the 44 percent to 62 percent increase in median household incomes and the 80 percent increase in BEA personal income per person appears to be largely attributable to an increase in income inequality. The findings in this article are consistent with recent research showing that the largest income increases occurred at the top end of the income distribution. However, the findings here are not consistent with the view that the incomes of middle American households stagnated over the past 30 years.
