Wind/solar eat their own lunch which makes it hard for any company to make a profit. Let's say you have a town with a coal plant. The citizens want to increase renewables and build a wind farm.

All should be well right? \n\nHowever, the coal power plant turns around and lowers costs to $15 when the wind is blowing and increases costs when it isn't. Now we are at $15 per mWH, which didn't exist before we built two wind farms. Now the two wind farms are forced to try to get something...anything for their power.

Will the money saved from cheaper renewable generation and the possibility of closing other plants mean that the total amount of money spent on powering the grid will go down? Dunno, maybe, but don&amp;#39;t expect it to be as simple as the price falling as renewables become more popular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah.
