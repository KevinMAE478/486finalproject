(confirmed by Cassini) &amp;quot;Scientists ruled out a number of explanations for the hydrogen and concluded that it most likely formed from the interaction between warm water near a rocky core of the moon, akin to the hydrothermal vents in Earth&amp;#39;s oceans.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is even more exciting when you consider this. &amp;quot;Astrobiologists believe life as we know it requires water, chemical elements to make the building blocks of cells, and chemical energy. Saturn&amp;#39;s small moon, which is only about 500km in diameter, has all three.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is likely that this could also be the case for Europa. Astronomer Wiliams Sparks said that &amp;quot;new evidence from Hubble provides very strong evidence for plumes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europa is more than 4 billion years old, that&amp;#39;s a fair amount of time for life to have evolved there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NASA is planning to send both an orbiter and a lander to Europa during the 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dganexm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292362.0, "created_utc": 1492263562.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h55p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaosze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aloofsquirrel", "parent_id": "t3_65h55p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm slowly beginning to think the universe is teeming with life intelligent and otherwise since we are continually finding this much water in our own celestial backyard.
