Completely different industry and business model. The student competition came out of Elons personal funds (investors would not allow it) and did a great job of bringing hyperloop to the press.

This was the goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is this guy is saying &amp;quot;look, 20 yr old college kids couldn&amp;#39;t make it work, so it will never work!&amp;quot; There is no legacy tech that is quite like this, so we will only have a good idea of its effectiveness in the coming years when actual prototypes are tested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also have to stop and think from a business perspective, theres no way spacex can build the Hyperloop. Completely different industry and business model. The student competition came out of Elons personal funds (investors would not allow it) and did a great job of bringing hyperloop to the press. While theres about a half dozen takes on how it should be designed, i can assure you that the team that built the spaceX hyperloop does believe it will work.
