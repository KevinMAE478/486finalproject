However an electric power train is less efficient than a manual transmission due to conversion losses switching from mechanical energy to electric then back to mechanical energy. Diesel engines of needed horsepower also provide torque necessary to pull the loads commercial vehicles on the road carry with mechanical power trains (up to 18 gear manual). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR For extremely high torque applications diesel-electric power trains are better, commercial trucks fall below the switch over point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Futurology", "name": "t1_dg974cq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209058.0, "created_utc": 1492180258.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8z2bc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MildlyShadyPassenger", "parent_id": "t1_dg8v4um", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've always been curious as to why no one has tried this before now.
