Will you read it?\n\nFirst off, you need to understand [Representative Concentration Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways). Climate models _don't have all the data_. We don't _know_ what emissions are going to be like in X years or how much gas creates what result. We don't know a lot about how this works. We have to fill all this in with _guesses_. RCPs are different assumptions for the future, about how and when our greenhouse gas emissions will peak. \n\n * RCP 2.6 is a \"best case\" scenario assuming that emissions peak by 2020\n\n * RCP 4.5 assumes a peak by 2040\n\n * RCP 6.0 assumes a peak by 2080\n\n * RCP 8.5 is a \"worst case\" scenario assuming that they _don't peak at all_, and continue to rise for the rest of the century\n\nYou've already acknowledged that emissions have peaked:\n\nQuote [from you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/65luti/world_must_hit_zero_carbon_emissions_well_before/dgbmrql/):\n&gt;human carbon emissions have peaked, I will concede that, they are just flatlining, not actually going down\n\nRight. All RCPs assume that after the peak, they do go down. That hasn't happened. We have a flatline that's lasted roughly three years. But it's 2017 now. We have three more years until 2020. Sure, It might take more than 3 years. I think that's unlikely, but hey it could happen. How long do you think it will take? 4 years? 5? 10? Pick a number. To go from RCP2.6 to a RCP4.5 scenario, it would have to take _twenty three more years_ before emissions start dropping. RCP 6.0 and 8.5 are pretty much off the table. Emissions aren't likely to continue rising for another 60-80 years, because they've _already peaked_.\n\nSo we're looking at RCP 2.6 and 4.5.\n\nMissing RCP 2.6 doesn't mean BAM we're into 4.5. Yes, the models have hard breakpoints for simplicity, but you can agree, can't you, that very obviously it would be better if emissions start going down in say 2035, than in 2040, right? And if they start coming down by 2025 that would be better still, right? This isn't binary. It isn't 2.6 OR 4.5. We can land somewhere in the middle, and the closer we are to 2.6, the better off we'll be.\n\nSo between RCP 2.6 which is decline by 2020, and RCp 4.5 which is decline by 2040, where's it likely to land? Well, let's look at the emissions.\n\nUS emissions [peaked back in 2007](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions). Yes, there've been some upticks. It hasn't been exclusively down every single year after year. But the _trend_ has been downward for _ten years_ now. The EU is even better. They [peaked in the early 1990s](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Greenhouse_gas_emissions_%28including_international_aviation_and_indirect_CO2_excluding_LULUCF%29_trend,_EU-28,_1990%E2%80%932014.png).\n\nChina is the majority of the problem right now. They're the [biggest polluter in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions) and if it weren't for them we probably wouldn't even be having this conversation rigth now. \n\nWell, guess what? China is the [number one installer of solar in the world and has been every year since 2013 running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_China). This is what their [sky looks like](http://i.imgur.com/q0zPhxi.jpg). They know they have a problem and they've been trying very hard to fix it. They committed to peak by 2030, but so far they've consistently done [better than targets](http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/05/31/china-is-hitting-its-climate-targets-years-ahead-of-schedule/) and it's close enough already that there's speculation that they [might have already peaked](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/world/asia/china-climate-change-peak-carbon-emissions.html). That's not definite. They might still be rising. But it's close. \n\nEvery indicator is that RCP 2.6 is _still very possible_, and even if we don't make it, we'll probably be a whole lot closer to 2.6 than to RCP 4.5. Yes India is a wildcard. But they're [7% of the problem right now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions). When everybody else has their act together, you're going to need to come up with something more compelling than \"well, _maybe_ India will be so bad that they'll be worse the most of the rest of the world getting better!\" The _facts_ that we have, not wild paranoid speculation about worst case scenarios, the _facts_ suggest RCP 2.6 is still possible, and even if we don't make it we're much closer to RCP 2.6 than RCP 4.5.\n\nSo now, let's actually look at those scenarios.\n\nSorry, I'm going to go with IPCC here. I realize you don't like them, but I think they're a more dependable source than fictional novelists who make their money selling doom porn. Oh and by the way, even IPCC has historically _overestimated_ things. Measured data tends to be _better_ than what they've predicted. [Source 1](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/07/30/new-study-narrows-the-gap-between-climate-models-and-reality/) [Source 2](https://www.thenewamerican.com/images/2014-2015misc/figure1.jpg) [Source 3](https://skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=72). You'll love source 3 because it's actually _bashing_ \"climate deniers\" but nevertheless if you look at the chart and compare the black observations line to all four IPCC predictions in red, green, orange and pink, the observable reality has consistently been below three out of four.\n\nSure, sometimes they underestimate. They were [wrong about ice melt](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-ipcc-underestimated-climate-change/), for example. But overall, comparing actual measured data to IPCC projections, _generally_ they overpredict slightly. _Usually_, actual results are better than what they predict, by a little bit.\n\nHere's [IPCCs 5th Assesment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf). It's 167 pages. I obviously don't expect you to read all this. But check table 2.1 on page 60. This shows their summarized \"likely\" (we'll get to that in a moment) predictions for all four RCP scenarios.\n\n * RCP 2.6: temperature gain peak between .4 and 1.6 degrees of change by 2046-2065, .3 and 1.7 by the 2081-2100 range, with an average predicted rise of about 1 degree\n\n * RCP 4.5: temperature gain peak .9 and 2 degrees of change by 2046-2065, 1.1 to 2.6 degrees by 2081- 2100 range, with an average predicted rise betwen 1.4 and 1.8 degrees\n\nLet's make a couple observations:\n\n1) The RCP 2.6 scenario is well within our goals. Maybe as little as .4, worst case 1.7, average of about 1. And we've _already peaked_. We still have _three more years_ to start declining for that to be what's expected. Even if you ignore the fact that historically IPCC has tended to overestimate how bad things will be, the numbers here look pretty ok to me.\n\n2) Even the RCP 4.5 scenario is still probably not that bad. Yeah, the worst case 2.6 degrees isn't great, but the averages are 1.4 in 20-40 years, and 1.8 by the end of the century. That's well under 2, and right in the 1.5 range.\n\n3) As previously stated, even if we fail to reach the RCP 2.6 timeframe, we're probably a lot _closer_ to that than we are to RCP 4.5. If the reality falls somewhere between those two range, it's probably going to be close to the 2.6 than the 4.5 scenario. Even if it takes us 13 more years for emissions to start dropping, take the midpoint between the average of the two scenarios and that puts us at about 1.4 degrees.\n\nEven a \"moderately pessimistic\" case look reasonably ok. That looks pretty good to me.\n\nBut \"pretty good\" news _doesn't generate article click revenue_. So we get this \"some models predict\" nonsense. Yes, \"some models\" predict doom. Go ahead and look at the worst case IPCC scenarios. That same table on page 60, RCP 8.5's worst case scenario shows 4.8 degrees of rise.\n\nYes, \"some models\" predict bad stuff. But they're _not the models we think are likely_. \n\nRemember I said we'd get back to the \"likely\" thing? Emissions aren't the only thing we don't know. We don't know what the _results_ of emissions will be. There are a bunch of different models and not everybody agrees if there's X amount of greenhouses gases, what the result Y in temperature change will be. _Nobody knows_.There's a lot of guesswork here. That's why even in any given RCP scenario, there's still a range of predictions. \"Might be as little as .3 degrees, might be as much as .7 degrees, we don't know...but probably somewhere in that range.\"\n\nThe above table shows the various models they think are _likely_. Yes, there are other models that predict nasty things. Look at the [200 foot sea level rise scenario](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11092015/climate-change\u2019s-worst-case-scenario-200-feet-sea-level-rise-antarctica-ice-sheet-melt) for example. Even IPCC was [saying at one point](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms3.html) that some of their models put 4 degrees as a \"best guess\" and as much a 6.4 degrees \"likely\"  with maybe 30% of global coastal wetlands becoming submerged.\n\n Yes, \"some models\" predict all sorts of nasty outcomes. If you drive to the grocery store tomorrow, sure it's _possible_ that a meteor will strike and land on your head. But it's _not very likely_. Or maybe you might be in a car accident. That's a thing that could plausibly happen. But what's most likely? You'll go to he grocery store and it will be uneventful. You don't sit at home in terror cringing at the possibility that meteors or car accidents might mess up your day. \n\nThe climate models deemed \"likely\" might not generate much page click revenue, but they predict that things will basically be ok.", "edited": 1492385501.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to source the claims that you are making as to why we are so well-off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure! Will you read it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, you need to understand &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways\"&gt;Representative Concentration Pathways&lt;/a&gt;.

We don&amp;#39;t know a lot about how this works. We have to fill all this in with &lt;em&gt;guesses&lt;/em&gt;. RCPs are different assumptions for the future, about how and when our greenhouse gas emissions will peak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCP 2.6 is a &amp;quot;best case&amp;quot; scenario assuming that emissions peak by 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCP 4.5 assumes a peak by 2040&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCP 6.0 assumes a peak by 2080&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCP 8.5 is a &amp;quot;worst case&amp;quot; scenario assuming that they &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t peak at all&lt;/em&gt;, and continue to rise for the rest of the century&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve already acknowledged that emissions have peaked:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quote &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/65luti/world_must_hit_zero_carbon_emissions_well_before/dgbmrql/\"&gt;from you&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;human carbon emissions have peaked, I will concede that, they are just flatlining, not actually going down&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right.

I think we are decades behind schedule actually, remember how there were commitments to stop CO2 at 350 PPM, then 400 PPM, now we are at around 410 and there is no sign of stoppage. The reason why emissions have peaked is that renewables are adding to the energy needs of a growing economy and growing populations, not actually substituting them, which as it has been said in one previous article is not nearly enough to achieve a 2\u00b0C warming goal.
