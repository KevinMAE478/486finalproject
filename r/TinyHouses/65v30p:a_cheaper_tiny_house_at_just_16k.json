Hell, I am just a regular guy without contractor&amp;#39;s benefits and I can buy 2x4s at $3 a piece. Pressure treated for about $6-$10 a piece. What&amp;#39;s a pipe for plumbing cost? 5ft for $10 where I live. Now, electrical: copper wire is the most expensive part. $100 for 250ft.  Finally, I can furnish the entire interior at IKEA with self-closing drawers and much nicer, more modern style than hillbilly country slat wooden walls for about $4000 tops. $2000 if I want to pinch pennies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I get you guys want to score big on this because all you see it as is a trend, but arguing against low-cost is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TinyHouses", "name": "t1_dgdlqhw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470917.0, "created_utc": 1492442117.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rab5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v30p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rab5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v30p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rab5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v30p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rab5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v30p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeyeta", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MuthaFuckasTookMyIsh", "parent_id": "t1_dgdqjzo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TinyHouses", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You should tint them.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should tint them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TinyHouses", "name": "t1_dgeyeta", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492541559.0, "created_utc": 1492512759.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdqjzo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tonydiethelm", "parent_id": "t1_dgdikcv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TinyHouses", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not yet!\n\nMostly, they're just unnecessary.
