This material is ideal for a storage container or tiny home. A downside is that it is expensive. The industry runs on r-value code, which is extremely flawed. R-value is tested in a laboratory setting at a mean temp of 75 degrees f. It doesn't account for air movement, humidity, or (the factor you want to eliminate) thermal shorting. Your system should work if you get maximum resin coverage on the foam surface. \n\nFoam isn't a great fuel in and of itself, but it is a great insulator that keeps heat in. If there is fire to sustain it, it will be a very intense fire and fiberglass resin will also contribute. I built my tiny trailer into a haulmark cargo trailer and used spray foam and drywall on the walls. I have towed it about 3000 miles and nothing has fell off yet. I have a lot of shelving installed, though.\n\nSpray foam blowing agents are becoming less harmful for our atmosphere. Original formulations had a global warming payback period of about 80 years, meaning it would have to be in use for 80 years of energy efficient service to counterbalance the damage of freon blowing agents. Modern proprietary blowing agents are getting better. After 8 years of service modern cell foam it will pay itself back. The technology is always improving. I am a huge proponent of putting these oil based materials into solids like insulation, way better than burning it!\n\nSpray foam is difficult for a diy. It is an art to spray a liquid, that raises up 50 times it size, smooth. It can catch fire if applied too heavy in one pass, too. A foam board would work well if you had a solid air barrier to prevent condensation between the steel and foam board.

This material is ideal for a storage container or tiny home. A downside is that it is expensive. The industry runs on r-value code, which is extremely flawed. R-value is tested in a laboratory setting at a mean temp of 75 degrees f. It doesn&amp;#39;t account for air movement, humidity, or (the factor you want to eliminate) thermal shorting. Your system should work if you get maximum resin coverage on the foam surface. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Foam isn&amp;#39;t a great fuel in and of itself, but it is a great insulator that keeps heat in. If there is fire to sustain it, it will be a very intense fire and fiberglass resin will also contribute.

Original formulations had a global warming payback period of about 80 years, meaning it would have to be in use for 80 years of energy efficient service to counterbalance the damage of freon blowing agents. Modern proprietary blowing agents are getting better. After 8 years of service modern cell foam it will pay itself back. The technology is always improving.

And much better of course if you want a traditional look on the walls out of the box. But you are more limited to straight angles and measuring exactly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah ventilation with an airtight house lol... thanks for mentioning HRV/ERV! That makes total sense for a passive house of course, to try to exchange the heat from the cycled air of the house. I&amp;#39;ve had some ideas for a container house to have both inlets and outlets on the interior and exterior to regulate heat, but this is even more important if you really want to save on energy. Probably something like a heat exchanger would help already!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I guess this is a slight drawback of this foam core for tiny houses then. It only makes sense if you&amp;#39;re airtight, and if you want to be airtight you need more &amp;quot;fancy&amp;quot; technology like dehumidifiers or HRV/ERVs. Which probably doesn&amp;#39;t fit the philosophy of most tiny homers.
