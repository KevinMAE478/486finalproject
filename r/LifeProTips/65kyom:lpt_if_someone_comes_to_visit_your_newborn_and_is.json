Newborns have weak-ass necks that can't support their heads and a soft spot where their brain is practically exposed!  I don't want to be responsible for dealing with that.\n\nThis reminds me of a funny story.  First time I ever held a newborn was when I was 18 or 19. I went to a family friend's house to see their new baby.  Lots of people were there at the time and when I came in she immediately thrust the baby in my arms.  So I'm sitting on the couch, completely rigid, scared to move an inch, when someone let her deranged shelte (a dog like a small collie for those that don't know) in. Now me and this dog had a history, and it wasn't a good one, it was deranged after all.  It realized something had changed in the room and walked around checking things out and then it happened across me.  After sniffing me he remembered who I was and started barking like mad at me.  It was so close his nose was brushing my knee, and I couldn't move because I was holding that damned newborn kid. Eventually someone dragged it off and locked it away. \nAnd the kid never budged the whole time.  It was used to that deranged dog already and it's barking probably soothed it.

I went to a family friend&amp;#39;s house to see their new baby.  Lots of people were there at the time and when I came in she immediately thrust the baby in my arms.  So I&amp;#39;m sitting on the couch, completely rigid, scared to move an inch, when someone let her deranged shelte (a dog like a small collie for those that don&amp;#39;t know) in. Now me and this dog had a history, and it wasn&amp;#39;t a good one, it was deranged after all.  It realized something had changed in the room and walked around checking things out and then it happened across me.  After sniffing me he remembered who I was and started barking like mad at me.  It was so close his nose was brushing my knee, and I couldn&amp;#39;t move because I was holding that damned newborn kid. Eventually someone dragged it off and locked it away. \nAnd the kid never budged the whole time.
