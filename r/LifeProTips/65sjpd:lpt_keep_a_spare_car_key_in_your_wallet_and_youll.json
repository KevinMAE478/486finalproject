Locked myself out on a first date (we met at the restaraunt).  Luckily, my brother lived in the town, so he came and got me, used his truck to get  home.  Posted on a bronco forum &amp;amp; went to bed.  Had my answers when I woke up, vent window, 2 bent spoons (or other flat narrowish metal) bend 90 degrees, use one to hit the vent window lock &amp;amp; the other to release the latch.  Easy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward a few months, now carried a door key in my wallet.  Met with a vendor for a sales call in downtown Boston.  Locked the keys in the truck again :(  Found some items we could use in my briefcase and his trunk, finally opened the truck.  He was impressed with my McGyverism.  About 5 mi. down the road it hit me.  There was a key in my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "name": "t1_dgdk6o6", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468977.0, "created_utc": 1492440177.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sjpd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdk8vg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hugh_G_Rection91", "parent_id": "t3_65sjpd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LifeProTips", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I keep my wallet on my dash.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I keep my wallet on my dash.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "name": "t1_dgdk8vg", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469055.0, "created_utc": 1492440255.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sjpd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkpq8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "freediverx01", "parent_id": "t3_65sjpd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LifeProTips", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, instead you now have to worry about having your car stolen if you lose your wallet.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, instead you now have to worry about having your car stolen if you lose your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "name": "t1_dgdkpq8", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469653.0, "created_utc": 1492440853.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sjpd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdktoi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sorry4StupidQuestion", "parent_id": "t3_65sjpd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LifeProTips", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But if your wallet get stolen then your car might too", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if your wallet get stolen then your car might too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "name": "t1_dgdktoi", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469791.0, "created_utc": 1492440991.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sjpd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdku16", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GamerLackinSkilz", "parent_id": "t3_65sjpd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LifeProTips", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Great idea but my wallet spends 90% of its time in my cup holder lol.
