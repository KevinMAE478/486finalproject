Eldest gets green and yellow, Middle gets blue and orange, Youngest gets pink and purple. If you see an egg that&amp;#39;s not your color, you leave it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They know that I will always try to make things fair when I can , but they shouldn&amp;#39;t expect it from anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "name": "t1_dgbwy6v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492367947.0, "created_utc": 1492339147.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mwkk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxk2j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JFConz", "parent_id": "t3_65mwkk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LifeProTips", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have followed the tradition of my family, kids being several years apart and not in the same \"weight\" class.\n\nThere are two tiers of hidden eggs.
