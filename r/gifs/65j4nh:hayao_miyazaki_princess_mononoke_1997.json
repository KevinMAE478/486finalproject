The flinging of the bow has nothing to do with keeping the bow out of the way of the arrow and is actually just the result of shooting technique. Lastly, the amount of wobble in the arrow has nothing to do with which side of the bow the arrow is rested on and everything to do with bow construction and materials used to make the arrow itself. Ashitaka's resting of the arrow in this clip, oddly enough, has less to do with any of these things, and more to do with the region he grew up in. \n\nTo the first point, the image you linked shows a non-center shot bow. Every non-center shot bow on the planet suffers from the [Archer's Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7zewtuUM_0) and the issue doesn't go away just by changing which side of the bow the arrow is rested on. The wikipedia diagram shows the arrow resting on the left, but if the archer were to change the resting side, all that would do is flip the image. The shooter would still face the Paradox. Non-center shot bows solve the Archer's Paradox by not having the bow be \"in the way\" of the arrow's flight path. You can see in OP's clip that Ashitaka is using a \"primitive\" bow that is non-center shot. It's symmetric and the bow and string are in line with each other. Ashitaka doesn't draw on the right to avoid the Paradox because his bow design forces him to deal with it regardless of draw side. Bows like a [modern recurve](https://www.amazon.com/Samick-Sage-Takedown-Recurve-Bow/dp/B00IRBZPTU) and even the Japanese [Yumi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Yumi_name_of_parts.svg) have a center-shot design. In the Yumi image, you can see in the middle diagram that the bow string is actually offset to the right of midline of the bow. This simple construction feature is what helps archers using those bows to avoid the Archer's Paradox. Simply because of its design, the Yumi would be really difficult to shoot accurately if you drew the arrow on the left side.\n\nTo the second point, you can already see that it isn't any sort of flinging motion that moves the bow out of the way of the arrow because it's already out of the way thanks to its design. The real reason Japanese archers flip the bow around after a shot is because of how they grip and shoot. In the traditional [Kyudo Hassetsu] shooting technique, the archer grips firmly on the bow while it's at a slight angle away from their body. As they draw to full, they are actually placing torque on the bow in their hand. Apparently the bow flipping around to the front is the result of a phenomenon/technique called [Yugaeri](http://www.kyudo.com/kyudo-l.html), which that page states is incredibly difficult to truly master. It isn't about getting the bow out of the way of the arrow, it's just a result of having an incredibly well-practiced Kyudo shooting technique. Both of the shooters in OP's clip must have the technique down because neither of their bows slip down lower in their hands after they take their shots (which is apparently a dead giveaway that a shooter is faking the Yugaeri). \n\nTo the third point, I'll just reference an article about the [shafts of arrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow#Shaft). Basically, the amount of \"wobble\" an arrow experiences is the direct result of an interplay between the draw weight of the bow and how rigid the arrow is (known as the arrow's \"spine\"). Higher draw weight bows put more force on the shaft while accelerating it and so will produce more \"wobble\" but that effect can be compensated for somewhat by using more rigid materials.\n\nAll of this brings us to why Ashitaka drew his arrow on the right side of the bow instead of the left. As you can see, none of the above factors make his draw side mandatory. Not even the bow construction. One might say, well, he's drawing on the right because he's using a Japanese bow (a Yumi), but if you look closely, he's actually not. The samurai is definitely using a Yumi and you can tell because when the bow flips forward you can see that it's not a smooth arc but there's actually an angle change in its upper portion, which is characteristic of a Yumi. Ashitaka's bow is much shorter than the samurai's and you can see its curvature is \"smooth\" all the way from the top string attachment to the arrow rest. He's using a \"primitive\" or simple bow. Since he's not using a Yumi, he's not obligated to draw on the right side. So why do it that way?\n\nWell, after all this research, it really just boils down to how he draws the string. Turns out, Japanese archers draw the string with their [thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_draw#Thumb_draw_and_release), which is vastly different to the way Western archers draw (using the first three fingers). When using a thumb draw technique, a right-handed shooter must rest the arrow on the right side of the bow. It's as easy as that. A Japanese archer in a Japanese movie is animated to use a Japanese draw technique, so he uses his thumb to pull the string back and rests the arrow on the same side of the bow as his drawing hand. (You may have already known that part, but I've come this far and, who knows, maybe someone else will read this.)\n\nMan, I really enjoyed researching all this and learned a ton about Kyudo and archery in general today. Next time I'm out at the range, I'm going to try some new stuff!  If nothing else, maybe I helped you go from \"99% sure it has to do with the flip\" to understanding what Ashitaka is really up to in this clip. I know I learned a hell of a lot more about it than I thought I ever would from just a few-seconds-long gif.

The flinging of the bow has nothing to do with keeping the bow out of the way of the arrow and is actually just the result of shooting technique. Lastly, the amount of wobble in the arrow has nothing to do with which side of the bow the arrow is rested on and everything to do with bow construction and materials used to make the arrow itself. Ashitaka&amp;#39;s resting of the arrow in this clip, oddly enough, has less to do with any of these things, and more to do with the region he grew up in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the first point, the image you linked shows a non-center shot bow. Every non-center shot bow on the planet suffers from the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7zewtuUM_0\"&gt;Archer&amp;#39;s Paradox&lt;/a&gt; and the issue doesn&amp;#39;t go away just by changing which side of the bow the arrow is rested on. The wikipedia diagram shows the arrow resting on the left, but if the archer were to change the resting side, all that would do is flip the image. The shooter would still face the Paradox. Non-center shot bows solve the Archer&amp;#39;s Paradox by not having the bow be &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot; of the arrow&amp;#39;s flight path. You can see in OP&amp;#39;s clip that Ashitaka is using a &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; bow that is non-center shot. It&amp;#39;s symmetric and the bow and string are in line with each other. Ashitaka doesn&amp;#39;t draw on the right to avoid the Paradox because his bow design forces him to deal with it regardless of draw side. Bows like a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samick-Sage-Takedown-Recurve-Bow/dp/B00IRBZPTU\"&gt;modern recurve&lt;/a&gt; and even the Japanese &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Yumi_name_of_parts.svg\"&gt;Yumi&lt;/a&gt; have a center-shot design. In the Yumi image, you can see in the middle diagram that the bow string is actually offset to the right of midline of the bow. This simple construction feature is what helps archers using those bows to avoid the Archer&amp;#39;s Paradox. Simply because of its design, the Yumi would be really difficult to shoot accurately if you drew the arrow on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the second point, you can already see that it isn&amp;#39;t any sort of flinging motion that moves the bow out of the way of the arrow because it&amp;#39;s already out of the way thanks to its design. The real reason Japanese archers flip the bow around after a shot is because of how they grip and shoot. In the traditional [Kyudo Hassetsu] shooting technique, the archer grips firmly on the bow while it&amp;#39;s at a slight angle away from their body. As they draw to full, they are actually placing torque on the bow in their hand. Apparently the bow flipping around to the front is the result of a phenomenon/technique called &lt;a href=\"http://www.kyudo.com/kyudo-l.html\"&gt;Yugaeri&lt;/a&gt;, which that page states is incredibly difficult to truly master. It isn&amp;#39;t about getting the bow out of the way of the arrow, it&amp;#39;s just a result of having an incredibly well-practiced Kyudo shooting technique. Both of the shooters in OP&amp;#39;s clip must have the technique down because neither of their bows slip down lower in their hands after they take their shots (which is apparently a dead giveaway that a shooter is faking the Yugaeri). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the third point, I&amp;#39;ll just reference an article about the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow#Shaft\"&gt;shafts of arrows&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the amount of &amp;quot;wobble&amp;quot; an arrow experiences is the direct result of an interplay between the draw weight of the bow and how rigid the arrow is (known as the arrow&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;spine&amp;quot;). Higher draw weight bows put more force on the shaft while accelerating it and so will produce more &amp;quot;wobble&amp;quot; but that effect can be compensated for somewhat by using more rigid materials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this brings us to why Ashitaka drew his arrow on the right side of the bow instead of the left. As you can see, none of the above factors make his draw side mandatory. Not even the bow construction. One might say, well, he&amp;#39;s drawing on the right because he&amp;#39;s using a Japanese bow (a Yumi), but if you look closely, he&amp;#39;s actually not. The samurai is definitely using a Yumi and you can tell because when the bow flips forward you can see that it&amp;#39;s not a smooth arc but there&amp;#39;s actually an angle change in its upper portion, which is characteristic of a Yumi. Ashitaka&amp;#39;s bow is much shorter than the samurai&amp;#39;s and you can see its curvature is &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; all the way from the top string attachment to the arrow rest. He&amp;#39;s using a &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; or simple bow. Since he&amp;#39;s not using a Yumi, he&amp;#39;s not obligated to draw on the right side. So why do it that way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after all this research, it really just boils down to how he draws the string. Turns out, Japanese archers draw the string with their &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_draw#Thumb_draw_and_release\"&gt;thumb&lt;/a&gt;, which is vastly different to the way Western archers draw (using the first three fingers). When using a thumb draw technique, a right-handed shooter must rest the arrow on the right side of the bow. It&amp;#39;s as easy as that. A Japanese archer in a Japanese movie is animated to use a Japanese draw technique, so he uses his thumb to pull the string back and rests the arrow on the same side of the bow as his drawing hand. (You may have already known that part, but I&amp;#39;ve come this far and, who knows, maybe someone else will read this.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I really enjoyed researching all this and learned a ton about Kyudo and archery in general today. Next time I&amp;#39;m out at the range, I&amp;#39;m going to try some new stuff!  If nothing else, maybe I helped you go from &amp;quot;99% sure it has to do with the flip&amp;quot; to understanding what Ashitaka is really up to in this clip. I know I learned a hell of a lot more about it than I thought I ever would from just a few-seconds-long gif.

If you like fun adventure story&amp;#39;s check out Mamoru Hosoda&amp;#39;s works, specifically Summer Wars, Wolf Children, and The Boy and the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gifs", "name": "t1_dgb581b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492317640.0, "created_utc": 1492288840.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qt55", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j4nh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2la9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dovahkinmclean", "parent_id": "t1_dgaqd6q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "After watching this movie I got into anime.
