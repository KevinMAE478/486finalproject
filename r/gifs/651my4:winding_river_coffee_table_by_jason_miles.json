Take a look at the drawer detail on his website.  It's put together by dovetail joints.  That drawer probably has 8+ hours on it.  The tabletop also has a butterfly joint on it, which we'll call 3 hours.\n\nNow for the glass river. I'm not sure how he mapped out getting the glass cut so precisely as I've never done such a thing, but I can think of a few ways he could have done it.  The easiest way would be to space the slabs in their intended position and then map out where the glass would go on paper/on the wood in pencil.  I'm not sure how he had the glass cut, or if he even did it or outsourced it, but from there you'd probably want to make a CAD file of the outline to input into a computer for laser cutting.  After getting the cut glass back, I'd put it back on the table in the correct position, trace the outline, and then put the glass away and with a router route out the depression for the glass to sit in.  All in this is easily a 10 hour process I imagine.  \n\nAt this point we're at 54 hours and he probably has another couple for staining/final finishing.  So **56 hours total labor** to go from raw materials to finished product.  This is just my estimate, and if anything I'm erring on the conservative side to prove my point.  He could have spent much more time on this and I doubt he spent less time than what I'm suggesting.\n\nSo at this point let's look at where that $7,500 is going.\n\n$600 material (not counting tax) = $6,900 left.  \n\nIf we were to simply divide this by 56 hours we'd see he's basically charging $125/hr.  Whoa, this guy makes $125 an hour playing with wood?!  Not so fast.\n\nWe still haven't taken into consideration tools, wear and tear on said tools, and materials that get used up (sandpaper, stain, etc).  Figure another $100 - $150 for this project for this category.  Down to $6750 profit / $120/hr.\n\nHe also must pay rent/mortgage for a workshop space, which while hard to subtract from this project's potential profit...you can't forget will surely take away from some of his profit.  We have insurance on his business, workspace, and tools.  Don't forget he probably advertises and pays to have booths at festivals /art shows / design shows.  Finally, we can't forget this is his income and he must pay tax on his profits (that $6750 becomes $5400 / $96/hr assuming he lives in Denver and is in the 15% national tax bracket). \n\n**When all is said and done he's probably pocketed what we could call ~$3,000 in profit / $53/hr *at best* as I've been conservative with figures this whole time.**  Not bad at all, but hardly what I imagine you and a lot of people assume he's pocketing after \"two chunks of wood with some acrylic down the middle\".\n\nOne last thing, this isn't an instant $3000 in his pocket.  The table may sit for months before selling, so you always need to insure your most recent sale can carry you for awhile.  Some months may be good with multiple projects selling, while others you don't sell a thing while still paying all your expenses.  \n\n**EDIT:  Shit, forgot he pays commission to the gallery selling his work.  Galleries take pretty big commissions, 30% isn't uncommon.  That $3000 could become $2000 real fast.**", "edited": 1492131574.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love baseless comments that undermine the amount of time, money, and work something like this takes when the person clearly has no clue what they&amp;#39;re talking about and refers to it as &amp;quot;some wood and acrylic&amp;quot;.  Hopefully this comment enlightens a few.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a maple burl and walnut table, both of which are quite expensive.  I imagine in wood alone he already has spent at least $500.  Add in the drawer hardware is probably another $30-$50 depending on what he used.  The glass (it&amp;#39;s glass, not acrylic) is most likely another $50.  So before he&amp;#39;s even put his gloves on he&amp;#39;s spent $600 on materials.  Now let&amp;#39;s get into hours of work involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know what a burl is?  &lt;a href=\"http://www.wooden-box-maker.com/images/burl-on-tree.jpg\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s those cancerous looking parts of trees&lt;/a&gt;.  Ugly on the outside, &lt;a href=\"http://grabowoutdoors.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/woodgrain_burlwoodgrain4.jpg\"&gt;damn pretty on the inside&lt;/a&gt;. However, with that beauty comes the god damn most difficult type of wood to work with.  Unlike typical lumber where the grain is straight, burls look the way they do because the tree has literally grown in on itself in random directions.  The result of those beautiful patterns, is the freaking hardest, densest, most unpredictable wood to work on.  You&amp;#39;ll break saw blades, you&amp;#39;ll plane and sand forever without making a dent.  If he bought the burl looking like that photo I posted above, he&amp;#39;s got &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 30 hours alone to take it from that to the tabletop above.  I could be grossly underestimating that figure too.  I&amp;#39;ve spent 20+ hours planing and sanding much more forgiving slabs of wood and I doubt my final finish was as nice as his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The walnut legs probably have at least 6 hours on them, perhaps more depending on how he joined them and if any special joinery is involved.  Take a look at the drawer detail on his website.  It&amp;#39;s put together by dovetail joints.  That drawer probably has 8+ hours on it.  The tabletop also has a butterfly joint on it, which we&amp;#39;ll call 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the glass river.
