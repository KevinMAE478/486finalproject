Headlights seen approaching after the left turning vehicle clears the lane (which should have been visible to the bikers before the turning vehicle began its turn). Dashed line indicating passing zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bikes relied on agility and fast acceleration to pass multiple cars quickly and avoid the oncoming traffic, but in their haste overlooked that blinking light which demonstrated a clear and present intent to turn left. They may not have registered what may have been a small driveway or road to the left where a turn would be possible, once again in their haste to pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the end, the responsibility lies with those passing to avoid left-turning vehicles who properly slowed and signaled (AFAIK, entirely possible that jurisdictions differ in this area). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also: It appears that the cyclist had his left foot off the bike. This could make proper heavy breaking unstable. I also did not see &amp;quot;heavy breaking&amp;quot; occur based on my recollection of seeing motorcycles truly panic stopping. But once again, bikes differ.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gifs", "name": "t1_dgck1ko", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404651.0, "created_utc": 1492375851.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qt55", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qwbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgci1o9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "define_irony", "parent_id": "t3_65qwbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "OP's title game is on point!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP&amp;#39;s title game is on point!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gifs", "name": "t1_dgci1o9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492402082.0, "created_utc": 1492373282.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qt55", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qwbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcs77g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_First_Horseman", "parent_id": "t3_65qwbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, this person should not be riding a motorcycle.
