But Jordan Thomas, Jordan Parker, Steven Parker, and Parnell Motley seem to be pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best position battles will definitely be at WR (literally anyone could start, best bet is Badet/Mead/Andrews/?) and for the safety spot vacated by Ahmad Thomas (perhaps Haughton or Sylvie?).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dg4rssz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491967469.0, "created_utc": 1491938669.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4do8q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bweeek", "parent_id": "t3_64r3jo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Anyone watch the OU spring game?
