After a few bad years Arkansas was in the top 10, many of us thinking that we were ready to compete nationally. We&amp;#39;re hosting the defending national championships, and we get up in the first half by 2 scores. Then we scored just 3 points in the 2nd half. All made worse by the fact that my parents and I were watching it with our Alabama-fan extended family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Missouri 2016 - it&amp;#39;s hard to even comprehend this one still&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Texas A&amp;amp;M 2015 - basically 2014 on repeat, but this time after starting 1-2 and not really expecting much, we STILL got up and them, then blew it again.
