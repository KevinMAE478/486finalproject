I have always been worried about Adam&amp;#39;s effect on my other players because of his weak and conceited attitude.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam is the kind of person that makes excuses or blames people for things that go wrong in his life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two practices before Adam James claimed he had a concussion, Coach Leach and I were forced to discipline him for poor effort from the previous practice and poor effort during the early drills of that day.  This has been a common theme about Adam&amp;#39;s work ethic and attitude during his entire career.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam, along with two other receivers that were also unsatisfactory, was sent to run stadium steps with Bennie Wylie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the practice, Bennie made it very clear to Coach Leach and I that Adam was a complete &amp;quot;jerk&amp;quot; while he was being punished. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After talking with Adam after the practice, it was very clear to me that Adam did not agree with the punishment and believed that we were just mis-asessing his effort.  He complained to me that we were not doing our jobs as coaches and that his effort was just fine, all of which is very typical of him to say.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the other receiver that we punished agreed that his effort wasn&amp;#39;t his best and had a good attitude with Bennie and also in meeting with me after practice.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lincoln Riley&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dg7mwnp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123338.0, "created_utc": 1492094538.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 57}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655azu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655azu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655azu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7pdwv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gevanso", "parent_id": "t1_dg7p32f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the good ole 60+ to maybe 3 a week days.. and all we did was play ball behind the old fieldhouse ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the good ole 60+ to maybe 3 a week days.. and all we did was play ball behind the old fieldhouse &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dg7pdwv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126081.0, "created_utc": 1492097281.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7p32f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Misdirected_Colors", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ou1b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hell yea!

They threw that one to Joe Schad and he did his scientific best to make Auburn seem like it was run by Al Capone every single day on Twitter/SC. They stretched the truth often (pretty much daily), and any lack of remembrance of that fact by people at this point is either because they&amp;#39;re still salty and see things how they want to see it anyway (which is who ESPN pandered to) or it&amp;#39;s been so long they&amp;#39;ve just forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many lost statements that turned out to be completely untrue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;he guy was proven to be of(charitably) questionable moral character after UF&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wouldn&amp;#39;t be the first (or last) person to get kicked out of a school for doing something bad.
