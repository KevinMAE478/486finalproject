D-line will be the strength, with the linebackers 2nd.  Key will be quality depth on the line.  We have the bodies, and a few players breaking out (Kemp, possibly Reuben Jones and walk-on?! Carl Myers in the middle.)\n\nBush at LB is what we expected.  Fast and hard-hitting.  But Wroblewski and Furbush could provide good backups.  McCray should be just as good as last year.\n\nVIPER is looking good with Hudson.  He's just everywhere.  Hits hard, coverage seems to be better than average.  Most exciting player on D.\n\nSecondary looks to be in good shape for replacing every single starter.  Not worried about Kinnel at Safety.  CB's look athletic, so should just be a matter of refining technique.  Glasgow and Metellus look good at the other safety position.\n\nOffense Overall: \nThis is what will determine the outcome imo of this season.  Defense will keep us in every game, but the offense needs to make plays.  Right now, eh...possible.\n\nQB wasn't a question mark before.  But now, Peters has made a strong case for serious consideration.  Speight has leadership, experience, arm strength, and elusiveness in the pocket.  But his touch on the ball is inconsistent.  Peters on the other hand, seems to put the ball right on the money everytime.  Will be very interesting to see if Speight was hurt or if its the 1st unit D that made a difference.  Closer battle than previously thought.\n\nRB is the most stacked position on the field.  Evans, Higdon, Isaac and possibly Walker could all start.  But Evans has the inside track due to his versatility (such as playing the slot).  Higdon is the best all-around back, short range burst and good power.  Big contender for most snaps every game.  Isaac is agile and strong between the tackles.  Walker looks to have incredible balance and burst.  Like De'veon Smith, but faster.  Nothing but good news here.\n\nWR is also stacked.  Just lacking in experience.  DPJ and Tarik Black are excellent additions to the WR corp.  One or both may start.  McDOOOM may start in the slot (injury pending...pls no).  Just needs to work on his hands.  Same with Nate Johnson.  Plus, we'll add Nico Collins, Oliver Martin, and Brad Hawkins over the summer.  Lot of talent, plus veterans in Drake Harris and Moe Ways.  Should see little drop off from last year.\n\nTE is in good shape, just lacking experience (similar to the WR corp).  Eubanks, McKeon and Gentry stepping up to help fill the void left by Asiasi's early departure.  Nothing big from Bunting, but he and Wheatley Jr. are the likely starters (and rightfully so for now).\n\nOL is the biggest trouble spot.  Splitting the OL did the QB's no favor against our d-line.
