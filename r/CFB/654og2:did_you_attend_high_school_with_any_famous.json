Then here at State I had an organic chemistry lab over a summer with him. He had to drop it because he screwed up a few experiments since he was too tall to work in the laboratory fume hoods. He&amp;#39;s a great dude, becoming a pro hasn&amp;#39;t changed him much apparently. Still a goofball, and very smart - he&amp;#39;ll just go to Med School if he leaves the NFL. I really hope he gets to play for a team other than the Browns if that happens though...
