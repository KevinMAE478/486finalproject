EVER. The Browns won have won 8 championships, 4 in the AAFC and 4 in the NFL pre-super bowl era. 5 of those championships came in consecutive years.\n\nOnce Art Modell purchased the team, he pretty much instantly got into a bit of a pissing match with head coach Paul Brown and ultimately fired the guy who many rank as the greatest coach of all time and a true innovator of the game. Paul Brown later ended up coaching the newly-formed Bengals team, which is why they play Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nAnyway, after the Modell fired Brown, the team never relived the success of their early days, but largely remained competitive. The Browns won their conference in 65, 68, and 69, winning the division 5 times in the 80s, and going to the playoffs at least twice per decade through the 90s.\n\nWhere the train really went off the tracks was in 1995 when Art Modell moved the team. If you want a good idea how how much this fucked up cleveland, check out NFL Film's [\"Cleveland 95\"](http://www.nfl.com/videos/a-football-life/0ap1000000068372/Cleveland-95-A-Football-Life) and to a lesser extent [\"Beleiveland\"](http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=believeland).\n\nWhen the Browns were \"reactivated\" they had a handful of things working against them. First they had no team. They had to rebuild everything from scratch. They selected Tim Couch as the #1 overall pick in the draft that year and I maintain to this day that Tim Couch would have been a decent QB anywhere else, but we had no O-line to speak of. Our WRs weren't spectacular. Brady, Manning, and Rogers would have all busted in that environment. And from that bad start things just never improved. Every coach that came in tried to get a quick fix to right the ship. Whether they went for a first round QB, or some flashy FA pickup, they ALL wanted to turn the team around in a couple years. But the foundation of the team never really got to where it needed to be to let those newly acquired players thrive. Eventually, the coach would get canned and we'd move on to the next guy who would also try to bring in one or two stars to fix the problems.\n\nThis eventually led to us hiring Rob Chudzinski, a rookie HC for one year and then Mike Pettine, a coach who'd only ever really done High School coaching until working as a defensive position coach in the NFL.\n\nOnce the Pettine regime ended, Browns owner Jimmy Haslem went out and picked up our current front office and coach. For the first time in forever, we got our #1 preference in a coach. Our front office told Jimmy that this is going to take some time, and last offseason they cleaned house. They drafted a metric fuckton of young talent. We'll do it again this year, and we still probably won't be bringing in a star QB. It's not their style. They're building a foundation that they can use in the future. This is the first time since the new millenium this team is trying to rebuild the right way.\n\nSo, please. Don't move my team again.

EVER. The Browns won have won 8 championships, 4 in the AAFC and 4 in the NFL pre-super bowl era. 5 of those championships came in consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once Art Modell purchased the team, he pretty much instantly got into a bit of a pissing match with head coach Paul Brown and ultimately fired the guy who many rank as the greatest coach of all time and a true innovator of the game. Paul Brown later ended up coaching the newly-formed Bengals team, which is why they play Paul Brown Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after the Modell fired Brown, the team never relived the success of their early days, but largely remained competitive. The Browns won their conference in 65, 68, and 69, winning the division 5 times in the 80s, and going to the playoffs at least twice per decade through the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where the train really went off the tracks was in 1995 when Art Modell moved the team. If you want a good idea how how much this fucked up cleveland, check out NFL Film&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/a-football-life/0ap1000000068372/Cleveland-95-A-Football-Life\"&gt;&amp;quot;Cleveland 95&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and to a lesser extent &lt;a href=\"http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=believeland\"&gt;&amp;quot;Beleiveland&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the Browns were &amp;quot;reactivated&amp;quot; they had a handful of things working against them. First they had no team. They had to rebuild everything from scratch. They selected Tim Couch as the #1 overall pick in the draft that year and I maintain to this day that Tim Couch would have been a decent QB anywhere else, but we had no O-line to speak of. Our WRs weren&amp;#39;t spectacular. Brady, Manning, and Rogers would have all busted in that environment. And from that bad start things just never improved. Every coach that came in tried to get a quick fix to right the ship. Whether they went for a first round QB, or some flashy FA pickup, they ALL wanted to turn the team around in a couple years. But the foundation of the team never really got to where it needed to be to let those newly acquired players thrive. Eventually, the coach would get canned and we&amp;#39;d move on to the next guy who would also try to bring in one or two stars to fix the problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This eventually led to us hiring Rob Chudzinski, a rookie HC for one year and then Mike Pettine, a coach who&amp;#39;d only ever really done High School coaching until working as a defensive position coach in the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the Pettine regime ended, Browns owner Jimmy Haslem went out and picked up our current front office and coach. For the first time in forever, we got our #1 preference in a coach. Our front office told Jimmy that this is going to take some time, and last offseason they cleaned house. They drafted a metric fuckton of young talent. We&amp;#39;ll do it again this year, and we still probably won&amp;#39;t be bringing in a star QB. It&amp;#39;s not their style. They&amp;#39;re building a foundation that they can use in the future. This is the first time since the new millenium this team is trying to rebuild the right way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, please. Don&amp;#39;t move my team again. Things are just starting to look bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dgdzhb6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492486400.0, "created_utc": 1492457600.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vo6z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdx6ae", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SexyMcBeast", "parent_id": "t1_dgdvpgq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Patriots used to be just like what the Browns are today.

A 5th year senior who was buried on the depth chart for a long time stepped up due to injuries to our two starters. He was having a great run of games and really stepping up as a leader until he got a scary concussion against TAMU and every time a guy gets injured they drug test him. They found narcotics in his system and had no choice but to kick him off the team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dgdyjf2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492485322.0, "created_utc": 1492456522.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdq34h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aaninja64", "parent_id": "t1_dgdon0m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;did meth\n\n[i'm interested in this story, but i fear i've heard all there is to it](https://media.giphy.com/media/5yLgocEzAWWo8zFkq08/giphy.gif) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;did meth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5yLgocEzAWWo8zFkq08/giphy.gif\"&gt;i&amp;#39;m interested in this story, but i fear i&amp;#39;ve heard all there is to it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dgdq34h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475890.0, "created_utc": 1492447090.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdon0m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NewToSociety", "parent_id": "t1_dgdly9f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And every time we got one their leg fell off or they did meth.
