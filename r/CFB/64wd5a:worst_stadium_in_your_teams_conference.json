TCU and Baylor have brand new stadiums. Iowa State, Oklahoma State, and Tech have stadiums that have been recently renovated. DKR is a pretty nice stadium, and Gaylord Family Memorial Stadium has recently been renovated as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the Big 12 stadiums have the prettiest outer appearances/architecture as well.

Want to get through all, but haven't done it yet.  (2 weeks of classes still.  It'll be my summer project to get through the last 20 G5 stadiums).\n\nMy Ranking of all:\n\n1. [Navy](#f/navy) Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium (Capacity: 34000) - The stadium is absolutely gorgeous.  The amenities are top notch and Annapolis is beautiful.   I've only been there for the Military Bowl, but I want to get there for a Navy game and see the pageantry that is involved with it.\n2. [Cincinnati](#f/cincinnati) Nippert Stadium (Capacity 40,000) - The oldest stadium in the conference and originally opened in 1915 (Not as Nippert Stadium.  That would come ~10 years later), it has it's pains.  Having gone through a recent $90 million renovation, it now has many more amenities, wider concourses, and the works. The stadium is tucked into the middle of campus and the concourses are used as daily paths and the campus has grown around and over it over the last 102 years.  The field is open to all students when not in use by Varsity Sports, the Band, or FCC. Going here for grad school, I recommend as many games as you can.  You also missed the Tuberville era, but you'll be going through the pains for the next few years regardless.\n3. [ECU](#f/eastcarolina) Dowdy\u2013Ficklen Stadium (Capacity 50,000) - This stadium is the largest on campus stadium in the conference sitting at a nice 50,000 capacity and one of the best atmospheres in the conference.  Pregame entrences includes the Purple Haze.  The stadium is about to go through a large renovation to update the press box, luxury seating, and other fan amenities.\n4. [Houston](#f/houston) TDECU Stadium (Capacity 40000) The stadium is the newest in the conference.  At 40,000 seats, it's respectable and amenities are plentiful.  The stadium doesn't have much history though and when I was there, I wasn't overly impressed.  It's an NFL lite stadium in all.\n5. [UCF](#f/ucf) Bright House Networks Stadium (Capacity 44,206) - The stadium was built in 2007 and is fairly cookie cutter in it's design.  When UCF is rocking, the stadium is.  They are adding different amenities and the works.\n6. [Memphis](#f/memphis) Liberty Bowl  (Capacity 60,000) - The stadium has a ton of history with the Liberty Bowl being played there for years.  However, the stadium is showing it's age and is in need of renovations to improve amenities and the facade.\n7. [Connecticut](#f/connecticut) Rentschler Field (Capacity 40,000) - The stadium was built  by Connecticut in eye of many different capacities, such as Uconn, and even MLS soccer and and other.  It's built to allow for growth and has decent amentiies, but it's far from campus.\n8. [SMU](#f/smu) Gerald J. Ford Stadium (Capacity 32,000) - I actually don't know much about it.  So I'll put it here.\n9. [Tulsa](#f/tulsa) Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium (Capacity 30,000) - I don't know much about it.  So i'll put it here.\n10. [Tulane](#f/tulane) Yulman stadium (Capacity 30,000) - The locals limited what they could do, but it really isn't a bad stadium.  Don't really know much more about it.\n11. [USF](#f/usf) - NFL Monstrosity\n12. [Temple](#f/temple) - NFL Monstrosity\n", "edited": 1492005696.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I haven&amp;#39;t been to most, but we have: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Connecticut&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Temple&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ECU &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;USF&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;UCF&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Memphis&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tulane&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Houston&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SMU&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tulsa&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stadiums I&amp;#39;ve been to, I would rank in this order from best to worst:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navy&amp;#39;s Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cincinnati&amp;#39;s Nippert Stadium&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Houston&amp;#39;s TDECU Stadium&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done research on many of the stadiums in the conference at this point.
