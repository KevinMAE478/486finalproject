The very first game I went to was with my father. We went to see the state championship game featuring Earl Campbell.. Since then I assumed I'd never see a more dominating player. \n\nI don't know that VY was more dominating, but he wasn't less. \n\nI will disagree with your friend on one point. VY took his play into a different gear his senior year. The first time I caught him was partway through his junior season. I made a point of catching every single one of his games from them on, and convincing as many of my friends/acquaintances to come out and watch him. I think I missed one game the rest of his junior and senior year, often being the only white guy among thousands. \n\nBut VY wasn't as polished a passer by a long shot in his junior year. That summer he went to a camp run by Steve McNair.- who became a mentor for VY until he tragically died at a relatively young age in adulthood. \n\nIn any case, he went from being unfair as a junior to unstoppable as a senior. \n\nIt is important to note the dynamics of VY's situation. In a state where gridiron success is revered above all other high school pursuits, VY's high school was terrible at it. Madison HS never sniffed the playoffs before or since. They had hand me down, ill fitting uniforms. The opposing sideline would regularly feature 100 kids and about 20 coaches, paid and volunteer, with the latest cooling gear and other accoutrements. Madison had about 30 guys suited up for varsity, and around 4 coaches. VY often would play safety when they really needed a stop on defense, because they simply didn't have enough athletes to compete with most teams. \n\nHis run through the playoffs his senior year is one of the most astounding things I've ever seen in football. In the state's highest classification, in arguably the most competitive region, week after week VY was David slaying Goliath. Hightower. Katy. North Shore in what many consider one of the greatest high school games in Texas history (as long as you don't care for defense - final score 61-58. \n\nFinally he ran into Westlake's buzz saw in the semifinals, but even they had no answer for VY. Similarly to the 2005 Rose Bowl, if Madison just could have figured out a way to get one more additional stop, no matter how much time was left, I was convinced VY would find a way to lead them to victory, simply because I'd seen it so many times before. He simply refused to lose.\n\nEveryone loves to talk about VY's immense physical gifts, which were substantial. But what the vast majority of folks wildly underestimate is VY's leadership. People around him simply elevated their play because of him. Constantly. He had a way of making people feel like the last thing they wanted to do was let him down. Offense or defense, didn't matter. \n\nI would have been a VY fan wherever he attended, but I had mixed feelings when Tim Brewster (now the ace recruiter for Florida State) convinced VY to sign with Texas, my favorite program. I was convinced OC/QB coach Greg Davis and Mack Brown were going to find a way to fuck VY up. And boy did they try. \n\nFor 2 1/2 years (including redshirt year in 2002) they attempted to put one of the finest square pegs to play the game into a round hole. It's hard to believe now, but until after the Missouri game in 2004, many Texas fans wanted VY moved to WR because \"he just wasn't cut out to be a QB.\" No, that's not it. It's dumbfucks Greg Davis and Mack Brown trying to make him something he's not and ruining him. Holy shit I wanted to murder them. Some part of me still does, even with the national championship. \n\nIn any case, VY in his senior year of HS was a complete package, but I disagree with your friend regarding VY as a junior. He was still a man among boys, and a joy to watch, but it was in his senior year that he reached his final form. \n\nMy comment as much as anything was a dig against Mack Brown, who wasn't a bad coach by any means, but doesn't win that championship without VY.
