I've been a listener of his show for about 2 years, simply because when I was younger and worked weird shift hours I would come home and he would be the only person on ESPN. This was before I knew about sports talk, so I didn't know any other people. He left ESPN and starting putting his shows on podcasts, which I still listen to regularly. While he makes his points, hear me out:\n\nCowherd is a smart guy. Like it or not, he knows what he's doing. Hell, this post is on the front page of /r/CFB. He **knows** the business. He even talks business outside of his own show and analyzes a lot about it. He has Saturday podcasts where he talks about the sports media/other off topic stuff and you can tell he's invested in more than just sports. He'll even admit to \"acting\" on his show, as he mentions people on TV and sports talk hosts have to give the audience some flavor.\n\nYou have to have listened and understood Cowherd to get what he's going for here. First of all, he actually doesn't prefer his TV show as compared to radio. He usually brings up how he much prefers talking into the mic without having to have a \"presentation\" every day on TV. A lot of what you see in his show highlights are for the glamour of television. I mean, look at his co-host Kristine Leahey. In reality, he would much prefer to sit in a studio and go off about sports. So, a lot of this is part of the transition to a TV show. Also, Colin has some main rants he goes to. This is mainly where his ratings come from, and he's very well aware of it. A few include: Russell Westbrook hate, Lebron James legacy, Iowa football, and Aaron Rodgers debate, and a few more. He understands it what gets him on the headlines because it's so pressed/engraved on his show that people find it outrageous (like a lot of people in here). \n\nHis highlights and social media posts are the rants. That's why you're seeing this. But, if you listen to him outside of his main rants, he knows a lot about sports and it's hard to not respect his knowledge of everything from baseball to golf. He doesn't necessarily talk about it all that much, because again, he knows his viewers, and he knows they don't care about some of the things he's knowledgable about. But, he will go on a little \"detour\" if you will, and bring things up about other sports and spew some logic you might have never known.\n\nWow, this was really long, but I get pretty tired of seeing the Cowherd hate in general. Yes, he makes some different points and they are stressed too much, but again, it all has a purpose. You have to look past the surface and think about what he's simply trying to say. If he just said Iowa has a weak out of conference schedule like you may tell your friend in a causal conversation, it would' get any movement. For example, Danny Kanell saying Iowa has a weak conference schedule won't get the headlines because he's not making it a big fuss like Colin. This is a lot to do with how social media has transformed the business and he's utilizing that at a time when people are so reactive and offended by things.\n\nSo, if you are actually interested in his opinions and knowledge, look past this stuff.\n\nhaha HOLY SHIT this was long", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, let me give my long opinion on Cowherd.
