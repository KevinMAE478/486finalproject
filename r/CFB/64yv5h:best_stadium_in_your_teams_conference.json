The first was borderline scary, as we sat near the chainlink fence inside the stadium that separated our section from what I can only guess is the frat block section since it was 95% hammered and shit talking guys.  watched a grandma aged lady (at least late 70s) get called a fucking cunt and a coke thrown on her for asking people to stop cursing so much, then her husband who protested got told to \"check out the fucking scoreboard gramps\".  The second, they were mostly decently behaved and patronizing like they have been on my multiple trips to Atlanta to play Bama, when their fans generally act like we're the only school deserving of any respect in the conference, but still decidely inferior.  Both times consistently very loud and passionate.  \n  \nAuburn 3x: 1999 W32-14, 2006 L27-17, 2011 L17-6.  The Auburn crowd is pasionate and consistently loud.  Was treated nicely every time. I've always had a good time at AU and still super pissed we lost them as a permanent rival.  Auburn is like 1.5 hours closer drive than any other road game in the SEC for Florida.  \n  \nArkansas: went for the first time last year when they pounded us 31-10.  One of my favorite road trips I've every taken. Recommend to anyone.  Nice people, nice country.  Probably need to fully enclose to hit the upper echelon in the conference as far as max volume.  Woo pig sooey thing is pretty fun.  \n  \nLSU 2x: watched us get murdered in 2011, L41-11, and went this past season for the goal line stand W16-10.  The first time people were super nice to us and offered us food everywhere. The second people talked a bunch of shit and I started calling people corndogs by the middle of the day (normally not one of our 10%ers). Both were day games so I can't claim to have experienced Tiger Stadium at night, which is supposedly like Stoke City in February. So the LSU people weren't as crazy hammered as normal and so I feel like I have to give an incomplete and hopefully 3 seasons from now we will get a night game.  \n  \nOle Miss 1x: went for the Tebow left, tebow right, tebow up the middle game in 2007 W30-24.  I can't really comment on the city cause we stayed in Tupelo and got caught in accident traffic and got there late and had to go straight to the game.  My brother got a parking ticket he never paid and got letters for like 5 years telling him he was a fugitive from Mississippi law. Fairly loud for its smaller size but I believe they have inclosed the bleachers in the end zone we sat in, so it should be much improved.  \n\nMississippi State 1x: went in 2009 W29-19.  Felt like the whole surrounding community showed up to support the Dogs; everyone went into the stadium a few minutes before and it became almost ghost towny.  MSU played really well for a bad team (5-7) and I felt borderline bad for their fans as we were leaving, cause it seems like it was all they had and they had given it all.  People were very nice.  Lots of Clanga.  Hampered by size a bit like Ole Miss.  \n  \nTexas A&amp;M 1x: went for their opening SEC game in 2012 W20-17.  Nicest fans we had ever come across, but we tagged it as not knowing who they would hate yet.  Cadets coming in was cool pregame.  Wasn't so impressed with noise even though stadium was really big, but I believe they are inclosing the open end parts that were letting out a lot of sound.  Bat guano everywhere.  The coordinated cheers is pretty cool, but it seems like that was the only time some fans made any noise.  To clarify, a certain % of the crowd didn't seem to yell on defense, but would do the designated cheers, so those were louder than the normal crowd except on really big downs.  Everything on campus looked fresh and new.  \n  \nSEC EAST  \nGeorgia: N/A  \nKentucky, Missouri, Vanderbilt: never attended  \nSouth Carolina: 2003 W24-22, 2011 L17-12.  Stadium kinda reminds me of Jaguars stadium in Jacksonville and seems a bit NFLish.  2001 thing doesn't make sense but is pretty cool.  Learned that their rich fans have extra tickets so they can keep doing halftime passouts. Was in college in 2003 and went to a SC party and the fans wouldn't even talk shit back (oh come on yall know you're gonna win).  Issue had been patched by 2011; fans were nice but would engage in banter.  \n  \nTennessee 6x: 2000 W27-23 (Jabar Gaffney \"catch\" game), 2004 L30-28 (Dallas Baker punch game), 2006 W21-20, 2008 W30-6, 2012 W37-20, 2014 W10-9.  My favorite road game.  Love the I75 rivalry and have always had a blast.  Normally real loud.  Fans used to be mean but now pretty docile, I'm sure will be ramped back up after last year.  Always have a good time tailgating except for all the god damn hills if you get a bit drunk.  Caused a fight with a sign I brought in 2000 when a drunk Tenn fan tried to take it from me and random UF frat guys came to my aid and then started brawling with Tenn guys friends. Managed to get said sign autographed by Herbstreit at gameday postgame for being hilarious.  \n  \nI would rank my top three as 1: Alabama 2: Auburn 3: Tennessee\n  \nConsistently loud is very important, which is why Bama is atop my list and Auburn 2nd. They were loud nearly 100% of the time on defense. I think the Swamp is as loud as anywhere in the country (been to Penn State before as well) on a big 3rd or 4th down, but we blow on early downs.  I've literally had people ask me to stop yelling on first down, until i give them the crazy eyes.  It got that way after 2006 when Foley jacked all the ticket prices on the crazy north floridaman rednecks to chase new big money, only to watch all the faux riche boosters walk away when the economy tanked only 2-3 years later.  When I was a kid in the 80s/90s my ears used to ring after games and we had a waiting list for tickets.  Now it seems we cant be bothered if we're up more than a TD and they advertise ticket sales.  I would rate us no higher than 5th, but pre 2007 would have put us no lower than 2nd.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;since there are so many to choose from I&amp;#39;ll just do a quick synopsis on a few I&amp;#39;ve been to.&lt;br/&gt;\nSEC WEST:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alabama 2x: I&amp;#39;ve been to BDS twice, once when Bama was clawing their way back from the wilderness (prothro game 2005, L31-3), and once when they were good (2010, L31-6).

Always have a good time tailgating except for all the god damn hills if you get a bit drunk.  Caused a fight with a sign I brought in 2000 when a drunk Tenn fan tried to take it from me and random UF frat guys came to my aid and then started brawling with Tenn guys friends. Managed to get said sign autographed by Herbstreit at gameday postgame for being hilarious.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would rank my top three as 1: Alabama 2: Auburn 3: Tennessee&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consistently loud is very important, which is why Bama is atop my list and Auburn 2nd. They were loud nearly 100% of the time on defense. I think the Swamp is as loud as anywhere in the country (been to Penn State before as well) on a big 3rd or 4th down, but we blow on early downs.  I&amp;#39;ve literally had people ask me to stop yelling on first down, until i give them the crazy eyes.  It got that way after 2006 when Foley jacked all the ticket prices on the crazy north floridaman rednecks to chase new big money, only to watch all the faux riche boosters walk away when the economy tanked only 2-3 years later.  When I was a kid in the 80s/90s my ears used to ring after games and we had a waiting list for tickets.  Now it seems we cant be bothered if we&amp;#39;re up more than a TD and they advertise ticket sales.  I would rate us no higher than 5th, but pre 2007 would have put us no lower than 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dg6kuid", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492060652.0, "created_utc": 1492031852.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yv5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yv5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6n9yc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fastbird33", "parent_id": "t1_dg6cf2s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jacksonville the city itself isn't that desirable either.
