One of the biggest arguments that is presented to the NCAA, the Playoffs, and the conferences against banning the scheduling of FCS teams as part of the regular season is that the FCS wouldn't be subsidized by FBS programs anymore.\n\nFBS programs across the board should not be playing FCS teams in the regular season, or at the least, results should not count for standings and records. There is also an injury risk in these games for which kids have no chance to recover in season. They generally cost FBS programs quite a bit of money as well and in many cases, they are not well attended, not watched on TV outside of diehards, and there is always the risk of losing.  \n\nMoving these games off the regular season schedules still allows FBS programs to subsidize FCS programs, eliminates that arguments, and gives the FBS AD's another slot for a game against a more marketable program...even if it's against a non-P5 team or a non-P5 power. \n\nI understand SEC fans would oppose forbidding team from playing down a division in the regular season because they use this as a late season BYE week for the most part, but I believe that is wrong, and in the long run will end up costing the SEC a playoff spot or playoff seeding.  They haven't had to deal with it yet because Alabama has been so good, but that really won't last forever.  Lets say an SEC Champion is 11-2, and they are competing with an 11-2 PXII and an 11-2 B1G team for the last 2 playoff spots because the ACC and Big 12 champions are both undefeated (or Notre Dame is in the mix).   Now the committee is going to look at those schedules as say the B1G and PXII teams won 9 games against their conference opponents, lost two, and were 11-2 overall against FBS opponets...the SEC team won 7 games against their conference opponents, to 2 losses and were only 10-2 against FBS opponents.  \n\nAnd while the SEC leader is beating Presbyterian 45-0 on the SEC network the last month of the season, the B1G Team/PXII teams are playing heavily hyped conference rivalry games against big fan bases on national TV.  \n\nIt hasn't hurt the SEC yet, but someday it will. Alabama's dominance masks that this could become in issue in the playoff era. The SEC as a conference DID show cracks last year of turning into what the SEC basketball conference has been (UK and everyone else...the SEC was kind of Alabama and everyone else, and as long as Saban's machine is in place, I don't see this changing much all that soon).  \n\nI know FCS teams sometimes win, and that can mess up a lot (it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if Washington State beat Colorado/Washington to end their regular season, beat Colorado again, and won the PXII last year with a 11-2 record and an opening loss to Eastern Washington on their plate...).  \n\nLosing or struggling in a spring preseason game, when coaches are controlling playing time, without full frosh classes able to participate (which is a good thing) seeing what backups and developing players can do against a live opponents without the fear of it affecting their regular season. A loss or struggle won't kill the perception/ruin a regular season like a loss or struggle against a FCS team does in regular season. \n\nWhile you're right, the FBS program probably loses money from the gate and contract to bring the FCS team in, but they probably make it back from TV contracts. This would be like a 13th game, when not much else is going on in the rest of the sports world and everyone is looking for content.  Preseason/Early Season baseball, pre-playoff end of the season NBA/NHL, and the NCAA basketball tournament is done.  The NFL draft has done so well because people are CRAVING both college an pro football...well...here you go.  \n\nNot only that, but bringing people to campus/college communities for events like this in the spring after basketball is over to fork over $$ to local business means you probably won't have a hard time finding sponsors to float some of the cost.  That's basically how spring games are funded now. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a huge benefit... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason why the NFL won&amp;#39;t limit or get rid of the preseason despite that those games not bringing in as much money from traditional sources (they are on local TV for the most part, and not part of the larger national TV contracts), and, of course, there is higher chance for injury in those games too.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is already a risk for injury in the spring practices/games, and playing a game in the spring means there is more chance to recover.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the real benefit is in the regular season.

Now the committee is going to look at those schedules as say the B1G and PXII teams won 9 games against their conference opponents, lost two, and were 11-2 overall against FBS opponets...the SEC team won 7 games against their conference opponents, to 2 losses and were only 10-2 against FBS opponents.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while the SEC leader is beating Presbyterian 45-0 on the SEC network the last month of the season, the B1G Team/PXII teams are playing heavily hyped conference rivalry games against big fan bases on national TV.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hasn&amp;#39;t hurt the SEC yet, but someday it will. Alabama&amp;#39;s dominance masks that this could become in issue in the playoff era. The SEC as a conference DID show cracks last year of turning into what the SEC basketball conference has been (UK and everyone else...the SEC was kind of Alabama and everyone else, and as long as Saban&amp;#39;s machine is in place, I don&amp;#39;t see this changing much all that soon).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know FCS teams sometimes win, and that can mess up a lot (it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if Washington State beat Colorado/Washington to end their regular season, beat Colorado again, and won the PXII last year with a 11-2 record and an opening loss to Eastern Washington on their plate...).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Losing or struggling in a spring preseason game, when coaches are controlling playing time, without full frosh classes able to participate (which is a good thing) seeing what backups and developing players can do against a live opponents without the fear of it affecting their regular season. A loss or struggle won&amp;#39;t kill the perception/ruin a regular season like a loss or struggle against a FCS team does in regular season. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;#39;re right, the FBS program probably loses money from the gate and contract to bring the FCS team in, but they probably make it back from TV contracts. This would be like a 13th game, when not much else is going on in the rest of the sports world and everyone is looking for content.  Preseason/Early Season baseball, pre-playoff end of the season NBA/NHL, and the NCAA basketball tournament is done.  The NFL draft has done so well because people are CRAVING both college an pro football...well...here you go.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but bringing people to campus/college communities for events like this in the spring after basketball is over to fork over $$ to local business means you probably won&amp;#39;t have a hard time finding sponsors to float some of the cost.  That&amp;#39;s basically how spring games are funded now. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dg98pt5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492211098.0, "created_utc": 1492182298.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg95tug", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cool_Story_Bra", "parent_id": "t1_dg920yv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why though?
