And there is often too little in the way of staff to tune workouts for each position and fitness level, so everyone usually practices mostly together. \n\nAnd I'll modify my sentiment on DI to say that 2 a days are acceptable when one practice is very short and low intensity like a walk through. Which you would expect to be the norm, but it isn't. Athletes need time to recover, and the ability to devote time to other activities is very important for the mental and physical health of college athletes.
