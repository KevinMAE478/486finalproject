The examples of Butch Jones and Harbaugh you gave have nothing to do with being angry on the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember a few times seeing Harbaugh getting crazy angry while at Stanford. It happens. Nick Saban gets after his players and gets red and purple in the face, but he doesn&amp;#39;t get criticized for it. Let&amp;#39;s be real...since there&amp;#39;s a lot of Notre Dame fans/haters out there, the media focuses in on ANYTHING the head coach at ND says or does. It&amp;#39;s just to drive up ratings and clicks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously...If Kelly was at any other program in the nation people wouldn&amp;#39;t care about him getting after a WR for not catching a catchable pass which lead to an interception. The majority of those pictures or videos come from the 2011 season...and only the USF and Michigan games from almost six years ago. Get over it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CFB", "name": "t1_dg8j7z6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160912.0, "created_utc": 1492132112.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg86p4x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bdm13", "parent_id": "t1_dg86egc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; If Brian Kelly did this at Tennessee or Michigan, no one would care or they would call it chewing out. \n\nYou don't really believe this, do you?
