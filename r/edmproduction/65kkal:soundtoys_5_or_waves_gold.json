Soundtoys is useful for creative processing and Waves is generally for mixing. But there's a bit of both in each.\n\nWhat you'd be missing in Waves you could pick up from a variety of other sources, but Soundtoys is very hard to replace. \n\nWaves Gold would give you a lot more plugins but many are long in the tooth and have been supplanted by better offerings. You don't need the C comps, C gates, SuperTap, or Q EQs when you have ReaComp, ReaGate, ReaDelay, and ReaEQ. We simply don't live in the old days of limited CPU power where we need to choose a minimum number of delay taps, and Reaper automatically handles mono/stereo plugins.\n\nThere are things in Waves Gold that may make it worth it to you. H-Delay is really nice, but since I got EchoBoy in the Soundtoys bundle I haven't used it; it just blows it out of the water. TrueVerb is better than ReaVerbate but it's nothing special. You're better off grabbing one of the Valhalla verbs. MaxxBass is interesting and I do use it occasionally for sound design, but you could also do this with saturation and other harmonic plugins. L1 has a distinct sound which you may find desirable, but if you're just looking for a good limiter there are so many better options now. The Renaissance compressor is nice, and you can never have too many compressors. Ultrapitch isn't anything special these days, it's comparable to ReaPitch in shift quality, and ReaPitch has unlimited voices. And Little Alterboy from SoundToys has more character.\n\nWaves also has this Upgrade Plan system. You don't need to renew the plugins... until you do. This can suck when you upgrade your OS or computer and the plugins suddenly don't work any more because the minor version number is off by 0.1.\n\nIf you're looking for a mixing bundle take a look at MeldaProductions, Voxengo's all-inclusive bundle, iZotope, but I suggest doing it piecemeal. Determine the gaps in your mixing setup and I think you'll find you only need a few better workflows and tools (e.g., linear phase EQ, character EQs, character compressor, reverbs). It also depends on your music. I mean, what do you feel is missing from your setup?
