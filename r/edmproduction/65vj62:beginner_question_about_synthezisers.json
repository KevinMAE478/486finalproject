An oscillator is basically the generator of a single soundwave, weather it be a very simple one like a sine or saw, or a complex wavetable like in Serum. The graphic of the wave you see in the oscillator will repeat over and over for the duration the note plays. More often than not, synths will actually have multiple oscillators, therefore \"layering\" the outputted sound by having multiple waves oscillate at once. This is where terms such as \"subtractive synthesis\" and \"FM synthesis\" come into play. In subtractive synthesis, the multiple osciallators will each add together, therefore playing both sounds at once to create a new sound. However in FM synthesis, one oscillator modulates the pitch of another, therefore giving you a different outputted sound than if the two waves were just added together. Don't worry too much about the technicalities of that, just know that the method of synthesis dictates what type of relationship the oscillators have. \n\nThink about it his way: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are all different methods of simple math that take the same numbers and do different things with them to get a different output (ex: 3+5 is different from 3x5). Synthesis is like this except instead of numbers it's waves.\n\nAfter oscillators, pretty much everything else on the synth processes the outputted sound of the oscillators. You'll frequently see things like \"Filter\" which cuts out specific high or low frequencies from the overall sound, \"ADSR\" which can prolong or shorten the start and end times of when you play a note, \"LFO\" which automates and changes pitch, volume, and other things overtime as the note plays, and other things like this.

One of the biggest productivity killers is having 200 VST's to spend hours and hours trying to get the right sound from rather than actually working on music. \n\nThat said, you can break synths down into a few categories. Digital (VST) vs Hardware. \n\nWithin both of those categories you have roughly the following: \n\n1. Subtractive synths (Sylenth1, Helm, etc). These work the same as massive/serum but often are limited to the primary wave types, Sin, Square/pulse, Saw.  \n2. Additive synths (Not familiar with these, NI's Razer is the only one I know of). \n3. Wavetable synths (Serum/Massive). Essentially subtractive synths with more waveforms available to work with. \n4. Frequency modulation synths (FM8, Dexed, Operater, the Yamaha DX7). Probably the most difficult to understand form of synths. You could read books on FM and still struggle. \n5. Granular Synths (Absynth, Omnisphere). Take samples and manipulate them into synth sounds. \n\nThere are more types we could look at, but it won't help to get bogged down in minutiae early on. \n\n&gt; whenever when I try to understand FL Studios Stock Plugins like Sytrus, Sakura, Harmor, Harmless, etc. it gets much more difficult. What exactly are the differences between them? \n\nSytrus is an FM synth. Check out composing gloves on youtube for some series on how FM synthesis works. Essentially it's a series of oscillators that modulate one another. \n\nSakura is a string modelling synth. It has some unique features that let you model the sounds of different strings, but ultimately works like a subtractive synthesizer using string sounds as a waveform. \n\nHarmor is an additive synth. Subtractive synths sculpt out parts of the audio wave to generate a sound, additive synthesis boosts parts of the wave. I've never worked extensively with these, but Im sure there's a solid series on youtube about it. \n\nHarmless is a subtractive synth. Works just like massive or serum. \n\n&gt; Then why can Serum produce more and also the same sounds as for example Massive? \n\nSerum can import massives wavetables, as well as others, making it ultimately more flexible. \n\n&gt; How many Synths should I know and when do I know I'm gonna choose Sytrus and not Serum. \n\nAs many as you need to make what you hear in your head. It's probably a good idea to be fairly familiar with subtractive synthesis as it's extremely common and very easy to learn. \n\nFM synthesis is very popular for bell sounds, growly sounds, and can make some really nasty dubstep sounds. If you want to see what FM synthesis can do, check out some demos of the Dx7. \n\n&gt; What is it about the old Synths like Wurlitzer, Juno 106 etc?\n\nThese are generally very expensive and hard to implement, many are from before the advent of midi. The vast majority of old analog hardware synths are subtractive synths, the first big non subtractive hardware synth was the Yamaha DX7. \n\nI wouldn't worry about buying hardware synths just yet, most producers get by without them. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However I am still overwhelmed by the number of Synthesizers/VST&amp;#39;s out there and what differentiates them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s normal, continue feeling like that.
