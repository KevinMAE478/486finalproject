Online collaboration was supposed to come in version 1.0.   A few weeks before 1.0 was released all mentions of online collaboration just &lt;em&gt;disappeared&lt;/em&gt; from their website with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months later Online Collaboration feature was listed as a new feature for version 2.0 and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  Then a few weeks before 2.0 was released that feature was again just removed from the website with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously doing it is much harder than they originally thought - however not communicating with your customers is a bad move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should just put up a &amp;#39;labs&amp;#39; blog or something that talks a little bit about features they are working on for &amp;quot;future releases&amp;quot; without mentioning when it&amp;#39;s coming if it&amp;#39;s that hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly Online Collaboration was &lt;strong&gt;the only feature&lt;/strong&gt; that would have made me consider Bitwig over various competitors - it turned out to be vaporware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire company seems like a bunch of narcissistic developers who preach Bitwig like a religion and have zero idea of how to run a business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That and $200 for an upgrade every 12 months?  For shame on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compare that to Studio One.  Version 2 was released Oct 2011 version 3 was released May 2015.  The upgrade price from version 2 (pro) to version 3 (pro) is $149.  25% cheaper and 4 years between upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me - version 1.0 of Bitwig should have been a free beta, and version 2 should probably have been version 1.0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "name": "t1_dgf9gfm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492558085.0, "created_utc": 1492529285.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgesj5u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "svero6", "parent_id": "t1_dgepsqf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/edmproduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I see...
