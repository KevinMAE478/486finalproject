Sorry if it took awhile, it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;ve been slacking lately. I&amp;#39;ve been extremely busy, and not quite sure if I was even going to make this guide. But I&amp;#39;m here now to try my best. This was posted almost week late, because  said I would post it last Saturday but I procrasinated and well I sort of got lazy after that. But I did it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to be looking at the artist Wave Racer. Wave Racer is associated with the label Future Classic, as well as the Electronic music scene in Australia. Wave Racer has also been likened to acts like Basenji, Tomggg, Lido, Cosmo&amp;#39;s Midnight, Hoodboi, Sam Gellaitry, Lindsey Lowend, Machinedrum KRANE/KRNE, Cashmere Cat, Flume, Snakehips, Tkay Maidza, ODESZA and of course, Rustie. Wave Racer is known for the sound of &amp;quot;Dofflin&amp;quot; music which is a subgenre of Future Bass which is a subgenre of Trap which is a subgenre of Dirty South Hip Hop which is a subgenre of Hip Hop. I&amp;#39;ve also heard a lot of people label Wave Racer as Jersey Club, Future Beats or even Future RnB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m not really talented, and I&amp;#39;m not Wave Racer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my second guide after the Rustie one. I will correct any mistakes immediately. Alright let&amp;#39;s just get into it then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying something new this time. Only keeping each section to 6-8 paragraphs with a lot more structure. I also cited my sources. Very excited to post it so thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Midnight club beats mediafire, cylp.it chords, wave racer interviews]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Table of contents:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Biography and a quick Discography&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Going Back to the Future Bass (a look at the genre of Future Bass)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Composition (voicing chords &amp;amp; chord extensions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Production Techniques&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Sample Packs + Wave Racer&amp;#39;s own Samples&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Artistic Impact + Afterword&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Sources&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Biography&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tom Purcell, or Wave Racer, is from Sydney, Australia. Purcell grew up in Sydney playing shows until some of the clubs were shut down due to the &amp;quot;lock out laws.&amp;quot; He first got attention with his release of the single &lt;em&gt;Stoopid/Rock U Tonite&lt;/em&gt;. In 2014, Wave Racer released &lt;em&gt;Streamers&lt;/em&gt; which became the 9th most played track at Triple J. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that most likely drew people to Wave Racer. Wave Racer&amp;#39;s a e s t h e t i c seemed to be born out of Vaporwave. His music is nostalgic, because Wave Racer utilizes samples and composition methods reminiscent of 80s/90s RnB and Funk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly Wave Racer seemed to be carrying on the &amp;quot;Future&amp;quot; sound as his predecessors did before him. I&amp;#39;m going to be getting into the history of Future Bass in the next section, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer went on to remix Panama&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt; in 2014, and I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that Wave Racer&amp;#39;s remix slaps. Wave Racer also remixed &lt;em&gt;Stand Still&lt;/em&gt; by Flight Facilities, &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be Shy&lt;/em&gt; by D-Cup. Plus a few other remixes I&amp;#39;m too lazy to name so I&amp;#39;ll just leave &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Waveracer/comments/4jzjyy/wave_racer_discography/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; fantastic post here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer&amp;#39;s 2015 EP &lt;em&gt;Flash Drive,&lt;/em&gt; received Positive and a few mixed reviews. Many really liked Wave Racer&amp;#39;s bubblegum trap and found it to be a more upbeat addition to club music. Others thought that the songs sounded very similar and that Wave Racer&amp;#39;s sonic palette might have been getting old. Personally, I thought it was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What even is Future Bass anyways?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Future Bass is...many things. You can&amp;#39;t always quite pinpoint it. You have the lighter, happier future bass like Wave Racer, Basenji and Lindsey Lowend (&lt;em&gt;Windfish EP&lt;/em&gt;). You have the heavier, club based future bass like Ryan Hemsworth, Cashmere Cat and Vindata. You have the poppier sound that guys like Flume, Snakehips and Cosmo&amp;#39;s Midnight are pushing. Of course we can&amp;#39;t forget the &amp;quot;Chill Trap&amp;quot; subgenre (which I consider to be an offshoot of Future Bass and Trap) which includes ODESZA, Slow Magic, Mura Masa and XXYYXX. Remember when Porter Robinson was considered Future Bass? Good times, good times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Future Bass was once considered to be a mix of Trap, Garage, Hip Hop, 90s R&amp;amp;B and Video Games. It was a blending of a 80s/90s aesthetic and forward thinking productions techniques taken from Trap and Hip Hop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand Future Bass we need to go back. Back to 2008. Now, this might be a stretch, but I think Future Bass might have gathered influence from the Swedish electronic music genre known as &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skweee\"&gt;Skweee&lt;/a&gt;. Daniel Savio called it skweee, because of the goal was to &amp;quot;squeeze out as many interesting sounds as possible.&amp;quot; Looking back at Daniel Savio&amp;#39;s debut 2003 album, &lt;em&gt;Hudarna Fr\u00e5n S\u00f6der&lt;/em&gt; you can see a few similarities with future bass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Jdus8SpLcmw\"&gt;Psychofox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/HS0XUeyUNvw\"&gt;There&amp;#39;s Something Rotten In Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/RkI-dUIoHxA\"&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t&lt;/a&gt; all sound kind of like Future Bass. But a darker, much more serious sound. There is a heavier Techno influence. The beats aren&amp;#39;t overly complex, but instead rather sparse and minimal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that leads us to skweee artist Eero Johannes. With songs like &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/5MHyOF0uroE\"&gt;We Could Be Skweeeroes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/-qTzQ0Oenko\"&gt;Polka Plok&lt;/a&gt; utilizing Trappy percussion and lush saw chords with funk elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve devised this little timeline to show the progression of Future Bass (I&amp;#39;ve probably missed a lot of major players so I apologize)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2003: Daniel Savio released his debut album, &lt;em&gt;Hudarna Fr\u00e5n S\u00f6der&lt;/em&gt;, that seemed to embrace the up-and-coming genre of Skweee&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2008: Eero Johannes released his self-titled album which took the Skweee sound and expanded upon it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2009: Hudson Mohawke releases &lt;em&gt;Butter&lt;/em&gt; which helped HudMo gain more recognition and the interest major pop stars. (FUN FACT: &amp;quot;Fuse&amp;quot; was originally meant to be a song that Rihanna would sing over, but HudMo kept it as a song on Butter &lt;a href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/news/hudson-mohawke-rihanna-team-up\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2011: Rustie releases &lt;em&gt;Glass Swords&lt;/em&gt; which would then help inspire the Future R&amp;amp;B movement, and eventually Wave Racer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2012: Flume&amp;#39;s debut self-titled album (and Future Bass&amp;#39; rise in mainstream appeal)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2012: ODESZA releases &lt;em&gt;Summer&amp;#39;s Gone&lt;/em&gt; album (Chill trap vocal slicing&amp;#39;s rise in mainstream appeal)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2012: Cashmere Cat releases &lt;em&gt;Mirror Maru EP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2013: Ryan Hemsworth releases &lt;em&gt;Guilt Trips&lt;/em&gt; and then releases the album, &lt;em&gt;Alone For the First Time&lt;/em&gt; the next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2015: Wave Racer releases &lt;em&gt;Flash Drive&lt;/em&gt; and it&amp;#39;s really good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2016: Flume&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Skin&lt;/em&gt; album is released and the world explodes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2016: Lido&amp;#39;s album, &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;, is released and it is the most amazing thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Composition&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer is known for all his cool chord progressions. Just listen to songs like &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/_FD5u2TO-f8\"&gt;Rock U Tonite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Js_-DtskxM\"&gt;Flash Drive&lt;/a&gt; and his remix of Panama&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Z7Oqya-swh4\"&gt;Always&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does Wave Racer do to make his chords so magical?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two things: Special chords and chord voicing. We&amp;#39;re about to get into some music theory up in here so hold on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Special chords are different from your normal triads. I call them special chords, because &amp;quot;extended chords&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t really work for all of them. These special chords include the 7th chord, 9th chord, 11th chord, 13th chord, Suspended chords, Power chords (although Power chords are more rare in EDM and less so in Metal and Rock) and a few others if you&amp;#39;re feeling adventurous (Tristan chord, anyone?). 7th chords are chords that include a normal triad, and then another note that is seven scale degrees (IIRC) above the root note. So, take a C Major Chord.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A basic C major triad looks like this: C E G. Add in a 7th chord and it looks like this: C E G B. The B is seven scale degrees above the root note (C). If the B was one scale degree higher than it would be a full octave. Add a D to the CMaj7 (C Major 7th) chord and it becomes a 9th, because the higher D is nine scale degrees above. Add an F and it becomes a 11th chord, and add an A and it becomes a 13th chord. If you play the CMaj13 chord you will notice that there are 7 white notes, and all of those notes are notes within the scale of C Major. Now, this might not seem important until you realize that a CMaj13 chord includes &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the notes from the C Major scale (minus the C an octave up). These chords are versatile, and are typically more present in Jazz, Soul and R&amp;amp;B. Also, since Korean and Japanese Pop take inspiration from Western Jazz, you can find lots of 7ths and Suspended chords in K-Pop songs. Go to hooktheory and look up BoA or something, and you&amp;#39;ll see that there is a VERY heavy jazz influence in modern K-Pop/J-Pop production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: There is a huge difference between a 9th/11th/13th chord and an add9/add11/add13 chord. A 9th chord is the inclusion of the original triad as well as the 7th and the 9th. An &lt;strong&gt;add9&lt;/strong&gt; chord leaves out the 7th (B) and only adds the 9th leaving you with (C E G A) instead of (C E G B A). Basically, an &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; chord is just the triad plus whatever note goes along with the 9th, 11th or 13th chord. I was confused by this for the longest time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned Suspended chords, and I bet you&amp;#39;re wondering what their deal is. Well, their deal is being used as a set up for a chord progression resolution. There are two types of suspended chords, Suspended 2nds and Suspended 4ths. Suspended 2nd chords replace the Major or Minor 3rd (the E in C E G) in the triad chord with a Major second. Suspended 4th chords replace the Major or Minor 3rd with a perfect fourth. &lt;a href=\"https://clyp.it/3mj3pq0u\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example of them being used as a way to resolve a chord progression. The first chord played is a Csus2 (C suspended 2 which includes &lt;strong&gt;C D G&lt;/strong&gt;) and the next chord played is a Csus4 (C suspended 4 which include CFG). Our hears hear that suspended chord, and it doesn&amp;#39;t feel quite right. We almost want it to resolve. We want it to slip down to that C Major chord so the musical &amp;quot;tension&amp;quot; can be released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we&amp;#39;ll finally get into how Wave Racer utilizes chords. I looked up the hooktheory tabs for &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/flash-drive\"&gt;Flash Drive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/streamers\"&gt;Streamers&lt;/a&gt; (sorry I got kinda lazy). As you can see in this tabs Wave Racer is using a whole lot of Maj7, min7 and Suspended chords. If you click on the chords you can see their placements on the keyboard. You&amp;#39;ll notice that they aren&amp;#39;t all lined up neatly in a row. This is because of how Wave Racer &amp;quot;voices&amp;quot; the chord.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Voicing is when a composer rearranges the order of notes in a chord to vary the sound. &lt;a href=\"https://clyp.it/scibs1q5\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example. The first three chords are variations on the C Major chord. The first one is just a basic C Major (C E G - with C being on the bottom), and after that I play C Major with the same notes but with E on the bottom. After that chord I play a C Major chord with the same notes, but with the G on the bottom. This is also called Chord inversions. Also, I included demonstrations of the special chords I talked about earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer certainly spreads out his chords among many octaves, and prefers to have notes leading into each other. Think of it this way, let&amp;#39;s say you are playing a C Maj chord (C E G) and then you play a G Maj chord (G B D). There is a noticeable jump between the two chords since G Maj is played above C Maj regularly. But, if you invert the G Maj chord so that B is on the bottom, D is in the middle and G is on the top it sounds soooo much smoother. &lt;a href=\"https://clyp.it/2vo4u04e\"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something incredibly interesting about Wave Racer&amp;#39;s song &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/flash-drive\"&gt;Flash Drive&lt;/a&gt; is that the first chord CMaj7 has its notes directly lead into the next chord, bm7. The notes in the CMaj7 chord hardly move at all. In fact you&amp;#39;ll notice that almsot all of them move one half-step (or a minor 2nd) up or down to the notes right next to them in order to form the Bmin7 chord (B D F# A). The exception to this rule is the B which moves a Major 2nd down to A, since A# is between A and B which means that there is a 2 semitone difference. You&amp;#39;ll also see that the F# is on the top of the bm7 chord, because it&amp;#39;s only one half-step/semitone/minor 2nd away from the G in the CMaj7 chord. This creates a much smoother transition to the chords which is very similar in Jazz. Which you can notice in the song&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/duke-ellington/c-jam-blues\"&gt;C Jam Blues by Duke Ellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/john-coltrane/countdown\"&gt;Countdown by John Coltrane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/john-coltrane/giant-steps\"&gt;Giant Steps by John Coltrane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/kojima-mayumi/hatsukoi\"&gt;Hatsukoi by Kojima Majumi&lt;/a&gt;. The notes in the chords rarely move beyond minor 2nds or Major 3rds, and when they do it is often to highlight the harmonic differences as well as the rising tension in music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in &lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/streamers\"&gt;Streamers&lt;/a&gt; there aren&amp;#39;t giant leaps in terms of chord progressions. So, you&amp;#39;ll want to really mess around with chord voicing, spreading chords around octaves, suspended chords and extensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something absolutely GENIUS that is in Wave Racer&amp;#39;s music is that his chord progressions don&amp;#39;t always resolve. Remember how I mentioned earlier that we want to hear a CMaj chord after a Csus2/Csus4? Well, Wave Racer throws all that out the window and ends Streamer&amp;#39;s chord progression on a suspended chord. This is an amazing tactic in that it draws in the listener, who is waiting for the chord to resolve. It creates intrigue, so that the chord progression doesn&amp;#39;t feel &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; and eventually when it does it becomes all the more satisfying. Try ending a few of your own chord progressions on suspended chords and see if it builds up any musical tension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer&amp;#39;s melodies make great use of stepwise motion, which is the fancy musical term for a note moving up/down by only a minor 2nd or Major 2nd (up or down 1-2 notes). Stepwise motion is essential for pop hits, as slight movements in notes make for very simple catchy melodies. This isn&amp;#39;t always the case though. &amp;quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&amp;quot; utilizes an octave jump as well as large skips in their melody. A skip is a musical term for when a note moves up/down by a minor 3rd or larger. Octave jumps full under the skip category. Wave Racer&amp;#39;s melodies have stepwise motion, and skipping. Stepwise to give it a simple hook, and skipping to keep it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For chord progression rhythms you&amp;#39;ll want to study Jazz. There are a lot of quick chord changes there. Triplets, chords being played for half a bar, chords changing after three bars and many other options exist. Most importantly is to stick to a consistent rhythm. Wave Racer doesn&amp;#39;t change the chords too much rhytmically during a few of his songs. But it&amp;#39;s important to find a rhythm that can be catchy and danceable (if you are wanting to make catchy, danceable music of course). You could also start chords in between beats, and not exactly on the first bar. If you have the Cthulu vst you can mess around with creating chords and rhythms very easily. Of course you can break chords up and play them in a rather quick fashion. Or you could punch holes in your blocked chords with sidechaining, LFO tool or some volume automation. I&amp;#39;d personally just copy the rhythms from Japanese Pop Music, Jazz and Alternative R&amp;amp;B. Chord progressions aren&amp;#39;t copyrighted, so stealing them is fine (just don&amp;#39;t steal the melody). If you want to make your own chord progressions, then you can just take the rhythms from these songs instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip that many other musicians have given: Study much more than Electronic music. Immerse yourself in as many genres as possible to learn all the different techniques. Jazz has so much to offer in terms of harmonic complexity and rhythm. Soul is the king of chord voicings, and Pop hits are the essense of the phrase &amp;quot;brevity is the soul of wit.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait! One more thing. Wave Racer and Basenji used to be apart of a Nu-Disco duo known as &amp;quot;Pablo J and the Lobsterettes.&amp;quot; Which explains Wave Racer&amp;#39;s 80s/90s Future J-Funk Nu-Disco House influence and a e s t h e t i c s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Instruments (&lt;strong&gt;new section added&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer uses a wide variety of synths, instruments and techniques to make the songs he does. In songs like Flash Drive he uses those wavey lush supersaw chords, square arps and slap basses. Whereas in Steamers he uses Dubstep snares, bell leads and trap vocal chants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s just a quick list of instruments to try out:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supersaws (preferably soft, lush and not too trance-like)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arps (Square waves or bells)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;High melodic leads (bells or portamento synths)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slap basses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kalimbas and marimbas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harps and guitars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flute sounding leads&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The occasional bassline that is a kinda gritty 80s sounding bass&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trap and hip hop vocal chants (especially great if they are from recognizable memes like &amp;quot;catch me outside how out that&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;B acapellas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trap, Hip Hop and Dubstep drums&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small percussion samples like toms, woodblocks, sticks and rims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of hi-hats&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sampled drum breaks from 80s/90s R&amp;amp;B songs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(More additions): Make sure to give these instruments very distinct and clear sounds. Wave Racer arps sparkle, and his slap basses are rich and full. His kicks have enough punch to be noticed, but they aren&amp;#39;t too overpowering. Sometimes subtle Kicks work really well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important thing to take away from this is that each element has its speciality highlighted. Bells sound twinkly and high while supersaws are lush and wide. Making these attributes more present means that each element in the mix not only has a specific purpose, but they have a distinctive sound. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer is great at this. The high pitched vocal verses of Flash Drive are complimented by the slidy sounding pads and the short and sweet harmonized vocal melodies. His sound also has a certain swing to it. Elements don&amp;#39;t always start on the first bat and continue for a specific amount of time. I&amp;#39;m not great at this, but Wave Racer is really letting his melody breathe. It&amp;#39;s not continuing through every single bar. It&amp;#39;s a subtle characteristic of his music. So maybe try writing melodies with short spaces in between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sample Packs (+ Wave Racer&amp;#39;s own samples)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer used a clip from an Adventure Time episode in his song &lt;a href=\"http://www.whosampled.com/sample/456778/Wave-Racer-Stoopid-Adventure-Time-I-Can%27t-Help-It-Man,-I%27m-All-About-Stupid!/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stoopid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer uses the whoop from &lt;a href=\"http://www.whosampled.com/sample/377398/Wave-Racer-Lido-World-Record-Loleatta-Holloway-Crash-Goes-Love-(Yell-Apella\"&gt;Loleatta Holloway&amp;#39;s song &lt;em&gt;Crash Goes Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;/) and the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; from Rye Rye&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.whosampled.com/sample/384980/Wave-Racer-Lido-World-Record-Blaqstarr-Rye-Rye-Shake-It-to-the-Ground/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shake it to the ground&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in his song with Lido, &lt;em&gt;World Record&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, fun fact: Many of the vocal samples from &lt;em&gt;World Record&lt;/em&gt; are recordings of Lido &lt;a href=\"http://www.youredm.com/2015/10/14/your-edm-interview-with-wave-racer-on-his-new-ep/\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer and Cosmo&amp;#39;s Midnight sampled &lt;a href=\"http://www.whosampled.com/sample/384405/Wave-Racer-Cosmo%27s-Midnight-Introooo-Rick-James-Mary-Jane-(Live\"&gt;Rick James&amp;#39; Mary Jane&lt;/a&gt;/) in &lt;em&gt;Introooo&lt;/em&gt;. Wave Racer also sampled &lt;a href=\"http://www.whosampled.com/sample/395428/Wave-Racer-Streamers-Janet-Jackson-The-Pleasure-Principle-(LP-Version\"&gt;Janet Jackson&lt;/a&gt;/) on &lt;em&gt;Streamers&lt;/em&gt; (That &amp;quot;wooo!&amp;quot; chant in the background)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Streamers utilizes a lot of Little John &amp;quot;What!&amp;quot; samples being pitched up and down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer&amp;#39;s remix of Ghost Town DJ&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;My Boo&amp;quot; includes a sample of the drum break from Lyn Collin&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45MSVmfoJ4\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think About It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which comes in at &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dbFfl87eJWU?t=12\"&gt;0:12 seconds&lt;/a&gt; in WV&amp;#39;s remix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer also uses the water drop sample and the &amp;quot;bring it back&amp;quot; sample in multiple tracks. I don&amp;#39;t know specifically where these are from, but I know that they are very popular samples in Jersey Club (and Baltimore club)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Jersey Club, you can definitely see the influence that songs like &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/BsQo6CE5eJ4?t=28\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heartbroken&lt;/em&gt; - DJ Jayhood remix&lt;/a&gt; had on today&amp;#39;s more modern Hoodboi/Dj Sliiink/Drippy Dolphin/Trippy Turtle/FOFOFADI type Jersey Club.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what samples should you use? Everything. Especially R&amp;amp;B acapellas (preferrably from a song that has achieved meme status). Grab a sample of Navi from Legend of Zelda or Pikachu&amp;#39;s cry from Pokemon Yellow. Hell, if you really want to be unique record your Grandmother queefing and turn it into a squelchy bass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For drums you&amp;#39;ll want to find some Kicks that are kinda clicky and punchy, but not too clicky and punchy. On a scale of Flume to Ambient Drone you&amp;#39;ll want to sidechain your Kicks moderately at Machinedrum level. Your snares should punch and snap, but not too punchy or snappy. Wave Racer uses a lot of trap sounding snares, with the ocassional dubsteppy sounding snare like in &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/5LSm6pUdldk?t=47\"&gt;Streamers&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of drum placement: start with a basic trap beat, now add 10 different percussion loops. All jokes aisde, experiment with syncopation (percussion hits and notes not perfectly on beat - pefect example: Burial). Your syncopation game better be so on point that nobody is able to keep up with your music when dancing at a club.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave Racer&amp;#39;s synth chords are those lush future bass supersaws (which I&amp;#39;m personally not that good at making), but try detuning multiple saw waves, play with cutoff filters and try manually slicing bounced audio of the chords. A lot of Wave Racer&amp;#39;s leads sound very bell-like and his arps are square waves. I&amp;#39;d recommend VSTs like Serum, Massive, Synth1 and Sylenth1 for the chords (Wave Racer uses Sylenth1 himself). Then Synth1, TAL-U-No-62 or MiniMogueVa for the pads, basses and analog sounding synths. Although, in my opinion, it matters more that you nail down composition and the voicing of the chords. Build the synth around the melody and not the other way around (it&amp;#39;s up to you. There is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;no wrong way to do things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Future Bass isn&amp;#39;t really all that well...bassy. There&amp;#39;s not a whole lot of that sub-shaking, club bursting, soul booming bass that&amp;#39;s in most trap songs. That&amp;#39;s different for guys like Mura Masa or KRNE who really want that subbass to be known to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of melodic elements happening in Wave Racer&amp;#39;s tracks. So many little oneshot samples, flourishes, short and sweet motifs and melodies. Probably smart EQing, timing and placement within the stereo field helps accomplish this (I&amp;#39;m not an expert so I can&amp;#39;t give a very in-depth explanation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now...the sample pack recommendations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splice Users&lt;/em&gt; [Pack provider - Pack]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Champagne Drip Sample Pack (eveything is very close to Wave Racer&amp;#39;s style here)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SteLouse Sample Pack Vol. 1-2 (Kicks, Snares and FX)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ekali Sample Pack Vol. 1-2 (Snares are especially Future Bass-y)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KRNE/KRANE Sample Pack Vol. 1-4 (drums are a bit heavier than Wave Racer&amp;#39;s, but still great samples nonetheless)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Electric Mantis Sample Pack (Kicks, Snares, synths and vocals)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decap Drums that Knock Vol. 1-3 (More Lofi Hip Hop oriented, but the snares are spot on)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getter Sample Pack (Dubsteppy Snares will sound nice with some Reverb and Compression)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;josh pan x Gill Chang - Childhood sample pack (Drums are very hard-hitting, but still recommended for the 808 subs, and the Slaps/Snares in the pack)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CAPSUN ProAudio - 4:20 The Smokers Kit (basic Trap drums, but some soft kicks and nice percussion loops to play with)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IQ Samples - 813 Hypercolor Bass (Kicks, Claps, Drum fills and chants.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Medasin Microdose Vol. 1-3 (Kicks and Snares are perfect for Wave Racer&amp;#39;s style)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Function Loops - Progressive PsyTrance (Kicks that are punchy and clicky similar to Wave Racer&amp;#39;s or Machinedrums)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Xfer Drum Kit (Great all around drums.

Rustie and HudMo were there first, but Wave Racer and Flume helped it become more accessible. Wave Racer&amp;#39;s more &amp;quot;wavey, cutesy, 8-bit rainbow-y&amp;quot; style has certainly influenced a lot of artists (Snail&amp;#39;s House, ABSRDST, Shawn Wasabi, Tomggg). I think Wave Racer&amp;#39;s sound is a great blend of the nostalgic period of the 80s/90s with more modern production techniques and songwriting styles. He certainly is very good at balancing multiple melodic elements in a track. I&amp;#39;d say that Wave Racer is incredibly creative, and has built up a very distinctive and signature sound palette. He probably just followed his influences, and the music he makes now is where it took him. I&amp;#39;m excited for his future. His popularity means that more remixes, collaborations and EPs/Singles are on their way eventually. Who knows? We may have a Wave Racer album by 2019. Or maybe an official Wave Racer, Basenji collab under their current aliases. The possibilities are endless, and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and I hope this helped some people out. It took quite a while to finish, and I didn&amp;#39;t have as many technical facts as I had hoped. But overall I was able to delve deeper into the theory behind Wave Racer&amp;#39;s music. Hope you enjoyed it! I appreciate any and all feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God my left hand hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.youredm.com/2015/10/14/your-edm-interview-with-wave-racer-on-his-new-ep/\"&gt;http://www.youredm.com/2015/10/14/your-edm-interview-with-wave-racer-on-his-new-ep/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://sweaty320.com/2015/06/review-interview-wave-racer-westword-music-showcase.html\"&gt;http://sweaty320.com/2015/06/review-interview-wave-racer-westword-music-showcase.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mymusicisbetterthanyours.com/2015/08/wave-racer-our-interview-with-the-future-bass-star-and-ticket-contest-for-san-francisco/\"&gt;http://www.mymusicisbetterthanyours.com/2015/08/wave-racer-our-interview-with-the-future-bass-star-and-ticket-contest-for-san-francisco/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gwradiomusic.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/an-interview-with-wave-racer/\"&gt;https://gwradiomusic.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/an-interview-with-wave-racer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.complex.com/music/2014/03/wave-racer-interview\"&gt;http://www.complex.com/music/2014/03/wave-racer-interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.scenewave.com/2014/02/interview-wave-racer/\"&gt;https://www.scenewave.com/2014/02/interview-wave-racer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://runthetrap.com/2014/11/13/rtt-exclusive-interview-surfing-world-wave-racer/\"&gt;http://runthetrap.com/2014/11/13/rtt-exclusive-interview-surfing-world-wave-racer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.whosampled.com/\"&gt;http://www.whosampled.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.hooktheory.com/\"&gt;https://www.hooktheory.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/\"&gt;https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thejazzresource.com/jazz_theory.html\"&gt;http://www.thejazzresource.com/jazz_theory.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.jazzstandards.com/theory/overview.htm\"&gt;http://www.jazzstandards.com/theory/overview.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello r/edmproduction, I'm back with another. Sorry if it took awhile, it's because I've been slacking lately. I've been extremely busy, and not quite sure if I was even going to make this guide. But I'm here now to try my best. This was posted almost week late, because  said I would post it last Saturday but I procrasinated and well I sort of got lazy after that. But I did it now.\n\nToday we are going to be looking at the artist Wave Racer. Wave Racer is associated with the label Future Classic, as well as the Electronic music scene in Australia. Wave Racer has also been likened to acts like Basenji, Tomggg, Lido, Cosmo's Midnight, Hoodboi, Sam Gellaitry, Lindsey Lowend, Machinedrum KRANE/KRNE, Cashmere Cat, Flume, Snakehips, Tkay Maidza, ODESZA and of course, Rustie. Wave Racer is known for the sound of \"Dofflin\" music which is a subgenre of Future Bass which is a subgenre of Trap which is a subgenre of Dirty South Hip Hop which is a subgenre of Hip Hop. I've also heard a lot of people label Wave Racer as Jersey Club, Future Beats or even Future RnB.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not really talented, and I'm not Wave Racer\n\nThis is my second guide after the Rustie one. I will correct any mistakes immediately. Alright let's just get into it then.\n\n*I'm trying something new this time. Only keeping each section to 6-8 paragraphs with a lot more structure. I also cited my sources. Very excited to post it so thank you.*\n\n[Midnight club beats mediafire, cylp.it chords, wave racer interviews]\n\nTable of contents:\n\n1.\tBiography and a quick Discography\n2.\tGoing Back to the Future Bass (a look at the genre of Future Bass)\n3.\tComposition (voicing chords &amp; chord extensions)\n4.\tProduction Techniques\n5.\tSample Packs + Wave Racer's own Samples\n6.\tArtistic Impact + Afterword\n7.\tSources\n\n#Biography\n\nTom Purcell, or Wave Racer, is from Sydney, Australia. Purcell grew up in Sydney playing shows until some of the clubs were shut down due to the \"lock out laws.\" He first got attention with his release of the single *Stoopid/Rock U Tonite*. In 2014, Wave Racer released *Streamers* which became the 9th most played track at Triple J. \n\nThere are a few things that most likely drew people to Wave Racer. Wave Racer's a e s t h e t i c seemed to be born out of Vaporwave. His music is nostalgic, because Wave Racer utilizes samples and composition methods reminiscent of 80s/90s RnB and Funk.\n\nSecondly Wave Racer seemed to be carrying on the \"Future\" sound as his predecessors did before him. I'm going to be getting into the history of Future Bass in the next section, so bear with me.\n\nWave Racer went on to remix Panama's *Always* in 2014, and I think it's safe to say that Wave Racer's remix slaps. Wave Racer also remixed *Stand Still* by Flight Facilities, *Don't be Shy* by D-Cup. Plus a few other remixes I'm too lazy to name so I'll just leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Waveracer/comments/4jzjyy/wave_racer_discography/) fantastic post here.\n\nWave Racer's 2015 EP *Flash Drive,* received Positive and a few mixed reviews. Many really liked Wave Racer's bubblegum trap and found it to be a more upbeat addition to club music. Others thought that the songs sounded very similar and that Wave Racer's sonic palette might have been getting old. Personally, I thought it was amazing.\n\n#What even is Future Bass anyways?\n\nFuture Bass is...many things. You can't always quite pinpoint it. You have the lighter, happier future bass like Wave Racer, Basenji and Lindsey Lowend (*Windfish EP*). You have the heavier, club based future bass like Ryan Hemsworth, Cashmere Cat and Vindata. You have the poppier sound that guys like Flume, Snakehips and Cosmo's Midnight are pushing. Of course we can't forget the \"Chill Trap\" subgenre (which I consider to be an offshoot of Future Bass and Trap) which includes ODESZA, Slow Magic, Mura Masa and XXYYXX. Remember when Porter Robinson was considered Future Bass? Good times, good times.\n\nI think Future Bass was once considered to be a mix of Trap, Garage, Hip Hop, 90s R&amp;B and Video Games. It was a blending of a 80s/90s aesthetic and forward thinking productions techniques taken from Trap and Hip Hop.\n\nTo understand Future Bass we need to go back. Back to 2008. Now, this might be a stretch, but I think Future Bass might have gathered influence from the Swedish electronic music genre known as [Skweee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skweee). Daniel Savio called it skweee, because of the goal was to \"squeeze out as many interesting sounds as possible.\" Looking back at Daniel Savio's debut 2003 album, *Hudarna Fr\u00e5n S\u00f6der* you can see a few similarities with future bass.\n\n[Psychofox](https://youtu.be/Jdus8SpLcmw), [There's Something Rotten In Sweden](https://youtu.be/HS0XUeyUNvw), and ***especially*** [Please don't](https://youtu.be/RkI-dUIoHxA) all sound kind of like Future Bass. But a darker, much more serious sound. There is a heavier Techno influence. The beats aren't overly complex, but instead rather sparse and minimal.\n\nBut that leads us to skweee artist Eero Johannes. With songs like [We Could Be Skweeeroes](https://youtu.be/5MHyOF0uroE) and [Polka Plok](https://youtu.be/-qTzQ0Oenko) utilizing Trappy percussion and lush saw chords with funk elements.\n\nI've devised this little timeline to show the progression of Future Bass (I've probably missed a lot of major players so I apologize)\n\n2003: Daniel Savio released his debut album, *Hudarna Fr\u00e5n S\u00f6der*, that seemed to embrace the up-and-coming genre of Skweee\n\n2008: Eero Johannes released his self-titled album which took the Skweee sound and expanded upon it\n\n2009: Hudson Mohawke releases *Butter* which helped HudMo gain more recognition and the interest major pop stars. (FUN FACT: \"Fuse\" was originally meant to be a song that Rihanna would sing over, but HudMo kept it as a song on Butter [Source](http://www.clashmusic.com/news/hudson-mohawke-rihanna-team-up))\n\n2011: Rustie releases *Glass Swords* which would then help inspire the Future R&amp;B movement, and eventually Wave Racer.\n\n2012: Flume's debut self-titled album (and Future Bass' rise in mainstream appeal)\n\n2012: ODESZA releases *Summer's Gone* album (Chill trap vocal slicing's rise in mainstream appeal)\n\n2012: Cashmere Cat releases *Mirror Maru EP*\n\n2013: Ryan Hemsworth releases *Guilt Trips* and then releases the album, *Alone For the First Time* the next year.\n\n2015: Wave Racer releases *Flash Drive* and it's really good.\n\n2016: Flume's *Skin* album is released and the world explodes\n\n2016: Lido's album, *Everything*, is released and it is the most amazing thing ever.\n\n#Composition\n\nWave Racer is known for all his cool chord progressions. Just listen to songs like [Rock U Tonite](https://youtu.be/_FD5u2TO-f8), [Flash Drive](https://youtu.be/-Js_-DtskxM) and his remix of Panama's [Always](https://youtu.be/Z7Oqya-swh4).\n\nSo what does Wave Racer do to make his chords so magical?\n\nTwo things: Special chords and chord voicing. We're about to get into some music theory up in here so hold on.\n\nSpecial chords are different from your normal triads. I call them special chords, because \"extended chords\" doesn't really work for all of them. These special chords include the 7th chord, 9th chord, 11th chord, 13th chord, Suspended chords, Power chords (although Power chords are more rare in EDM and less so in Metal and Rock) and a few others if you're feeling adventurous (Tristan chord, anyone?). 7th chords are chords that include a normal triad, and then another note that is seven scale degrees (IIRC) above the root note. So, take a C Major Chord.\n\nA basic C major triad looks like this: C E G. Add in a 7th chord and it looks like this: C E G B. The B is seven scale degrees above the root note (C). If the B was one scale degree higher than it would be a full octave. Add a D to the CMaj7 (C Major 7th) chord and it becomes a 9th, because the higher D is nine scale degrees above. Add an F and it becomes a 11th chord, and add an A and it becomes a 13th chord. If you play the CMaj13 chord you will notice that there are 7 white notes, and all of those notes are notes within the scale of C Major. Now, this might not seem important until you realize that a CMaj13 chord includes *all* of the notes from the C Major scale (minus the C an octave up). These chords are versatile, and are typically more present in Jazz, Soul and R&amp;B. Also, since Korean and Japanese Pop take inspiration from Western Jazz, you can find lots of 7ths and Suspended chords in K-Pop songs. Go to hooktheory and look up BoA or something, and you'll see that there is a VERY heavy jazz influence in modern K-Pop/J-Pop production.\n\nIMPORTANT: There is a huge difference between a 9th/11th/13th chord and an add9/add11/add13 chord. A 9th chord is the inclusion of the original triad as well as the 7th and the 9th. An **add9** chord leaves out the 7th (B) and only adds the 9th leaving you with (C E G A) instead of (C E G B A). Basically, an \"add\" chord is just the triad plus whatever note goes along with the 9th, 11th or 13th chord. I was confused by this for the longest time.\n\nI mentioned Suspended chords, and I bet you're wondering what their deal is. Well, their deal is being used as a set up for a chord progression resolution. There are two types of suspended chords, Suspended 2nds and Suspended 4ths. Suspended 2nd chords replace the Major or Minor 3rd (the E in C E G) in the triad chord with a Major second. Suspended 4th chords replace the Major or Minor 3rd with a perfect fourth. [Here](https://clyp.it/3mj3pq0u) is an example of them being used as a way to resolve a chord progression. The first chord played is a Csus2 (C suspended 2 which includes **C D G**) and the next chord played is a Csus4 (C suspended 4 which include CFG). Our hears hear that suspended chord, and it doesn't feel quite right. We almost want it to resolve. We want it to slip down to that C Major chord so the musical \"tension\" can be released.\n\nAnd now we'll finally get into how Wave Racer utilizes chords. I looked up the hooktheory tabs for [Flash Drive](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/flash-drive) and [Streamers](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/streamers) (sorry I got kinda lazy). As you can see in this tabs Wave Racer is using a whole lot of Maj7, min7 and Suspended chords. If you click on the chords you can see their placements on the keyboard. You'll notice that they aren't all lined up neatly in a row. This is because of how Wave Racer \"voices\" the chord.\n\nVoicing is when a composer rearranges the order of notes in a chord to vary the sound. [Here](https://clyp.it/scibs1q5) is an example. The first three chords are variations on the C Major chord. The first one is just a basic C Major (C E G - with C being on the bottom), and after that I play C Major with the same notes but with E on the bottom. After that chord I play a C Major chord with the same notes, but with the G on the bottom. This is also called Chord inversions. Also, I included demonstrations of the special chords I talked about earlier.\n\nWave Racer certainly spreads out his chords among many octaves, and prefers to have notes leading into each other. Think of it this way, let's say you are playing a C Maj chord (C E G) and then you play a G Maj chord (G B D). There is a noticeable jump between the two chords since G Maj is played above C Maj regularly. But, if you invert the G Maj chord so that B is on the bottom, D is in the middle and G is on the top it sounds soooo much smoother. [Example](https://clyp.it/2vo4u04e). \n\nSomething incredibly interesting about Wave Racer's song [Flash Drive](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/flash-drive) is that the first chord CMaj7 has its notes directly lead into the next chord, bm7. The notes in the CMaj7 chord hardly move at all. In fact you'll notice that almsot all of them move one half-step (or a minor 2nd) up or down to the notes right next to them in order to form the Bmin7 chord (B D F# A). The exception to this rule is the B which moves a Major 2nd down to A, since A# is between A and B which means that there is a 2 semitone difference. You'll also see that the F# is on the top of the bm7 chord, because it's only one half-step/semitone/minor 2nd away from the G in the CMaj7 chord. This creates a much smoother transition to the chords which is very similar in Jazz. Which you can notice in the song's [C Jam Blues by Duke Ellington](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/duke-ellington/c-jam-blues), [Countdown by John Coltrane](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/john-coltrane/countdown), [Giant Steps by John Coltrane](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/john-coltrane/giant-steps) and [Hatsukoi by Kojima Majumi](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/kojima-mayumi/hatsukoi). The notes in the chords rarely move beyond minor 2nds or Major 3rds, and when they do it is often to highlight the harmonic differences as well as the rising tension in music.\n\nEven in [Streamers](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/wave-racer/streamers) there aren't giant leaps in terms of chord progressions. So, you'll want to really mess around with chord voicing, spreading chords around octaves, suspended chords and extensions.\n\nSomething absolutely GENIUS that is in Wave Racer's music is that his chord progressions don't always resolve. Remember how I mentioned earlier that we want to hear a CMaj chord after a Csus2/Csus4? Well, Wave Racer throws all that out the window and ends Streamer's chord progression on a suspended chord. This is an amazing tactic in that it draws in the listener, who is waiting for the chord to resolve. It creates intrigue, so that the chord progression doesn't feel \"finished\" and eventually when it does it becomes all the more satisfying. Try ending a few of your own chord progressions on suspended chords and see if it builds up any musical tension.\n\nWave Racer's melodies make great use of stepwise motion, which is the fancy musical term for a note moving up/down by only a minor 2nd or Major 2nd (up or down 1-2 notes). Stepwise motion is essential for pop hits, as slight movements in notes make for very simple catchy melodies. This isn't always the case though. \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" utilizes an octave jump as well as large skips in their melody. A skip is a musical term for when a note moves up/down by a minor 3rd or larger. Octave jumps full under the skip category. Wave Racer's melodies have stepwise motion, and skipping. Stepwise to give it a simple hook, and skipping to keep it interesting.\n\nFor chord progression rhythms you'll want to study Jazz. There are a lot of quick chord changes there. Triplets, chords being played for half a bar, chords changing after three bars and many other options exist. Most importantly is to stick to a consistent rhythm. Wave Racer doesn't change the chords too much rhytmically during a few of his songs. But it's important to find a rhythm that can be catchy and danceable (if you are wanting to make catchy, danceable music of course). You could also start chords in between beats, and not exactly on the first bar. If you have the Cthulu vst you can mess around with creating chords and rhythms very easily. Of course you can break chords up and play them in a rather quick fashion. Or you could punch holes in your blocked chords with sidechaining, LFO tool or some volume automation. I'd personally just copy the rhythms from Japanese Pop Music, Jazz and Alternative R&amp;B. Chord progressions aren't copyrighted, so stealing them is fine (just don't steal the melody). If you want to make your own chord progressions, then you can just take the rhythms from these songs instead.\n\n**Tip that many other musicians have given: Study much more than Electronic music. Immerse yourself in as many genres as possible to learn all the different techniques. Jazz has so much to offer in terms of harmonic complexity and rhythm. Soul is the king of chord voicings, and Pop hits are the essense of the phrase \"brevity is the soul of wit.\"**\n\nWait! One more thing. Wave Racer and Basenji used to be apart of a Nu-Disco duo known as \"Pablo J and the Lobsterettes.\" Which explains Wave Racer's 80s/90s Future J-Funk Nu-Disco House influence and a e s t h e t i c s.\n\n#Instruments (**new section added**)\n\nWave Racer uses a wide variety of synths, instruments and techniques to make the songs he does. In songs like Flash Drive he uses those wavey lush supersaw chords, square arps and slap basses. Whereas in Steamers he uses Dubstep snares, bell leads and trap vocal chants.\n\nHere's just a quick list of instruments to try out:\n\nSupersaws (preferably soft, lush and not too trance-like)\n\nArps (Square waves or bells)\n\nHigh melodic leads (bells or portamento synths)\n\nSlap basses\n\nKalimbas and marimbas\n\nHarps and guitars\n\nFlute sounding leads\n\nThe occasional bassline that is a kinda gritty 80s sounding bass\n\nTrap and hip hop vocal chants (especially great if they are from recognizable memes like \"catch me outside how out that\")\n\nR&amp;B acapellas\n\nTrap, Hip Hop and Dubstep drums\n\nSmall percussion samples like toms, woodblocks, sticks and rims.\n\nLots of hi-hats\n\nSampled drum breaks from 80s/90s R&amp;B songs\n\n(More additions): Make sure to give these instruments very distinct and clear sounds. Wave Racer arps sparkle, and his slap basses are rich and full. His kicks have enough punch to be noticed, but they aren't too overpowering. Sometimes subtle Kicks work really well.\n\nThe important thing to take away from this is that each element has its speciality highlighted. Bells sound twinkly and high while supersaws are lush and wide. Making these attributes more present means that each element in the mix not only has a specific purpose, but they have a distinctive sound. \n\nWave Racer is great at this. The high pitched vocal verses of Flash Drive are complimented by the slidy sounding pads and the short and sweet harmonized vocal melodies. His sound also has a certain swing to it. Elements don't always start on the first bat and continue for a specific amount of time. I'm not great at this, but Wave Racer is really letting his melody breathe. It's not continuing through every single bar. It's a subtle characteristic of his music. So maybe try writing melodies with short spaces in between them.\n\n#Sample Packs (+ Wave Racer's own samples)\n\nWave Racer used a clip from an Adventure Time episode in his song [*Stoopid*](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/456778/Wave-Racer-Stoopid-Adventure-Time-I-Can%27t-Help-It-Man,-I%27m-All-About-Stupid!/)\n\nWave Racer uses the whoop from [Loleatta Holloway's song *Crash Goes Love*](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/377398/Wave-Racer-Lido-World-Record-Loleatta-Holloway-Crash-Goes-Love-(Yell-Apella)/) and the \"what\" from Rye Rye's [*Shake it to the ground*](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/384980/Wave-Racer-Lido-World-Record-Blaqstarr-Rye-Rye-Shake-It-to-the-Ground/) in his song with Lido, *World Record*. \n\nAlso, fun fact: Many of the vocal samples from *World Record* are recordings of Lido [Source](http://www.youredm.com/2015/10/14/your-edm-interview-with-wave-racer-on-his-new-ep/)\n\nWave Racer and Cosmo's Midnight sampled [Rick James' Mary Jane](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/384405/Wave-Racer-Cosmo%27s-Midnight-Introooo-Rick-James-Mary-Jane-(Live)/) in *Introooo*. Wave Racer also sampled [Janet Jackson](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/395428/Wave-Racer-Streamers-Janet-Jackson-The-Pleasure-Principle-(LP-Version)/) on *Streamers* (That \"wooo!\" chant in the background)\n\nAlso, Streamers utilizes a lot of Little John \"What!\" samples being pitched up and down. \n\nWave Racer's remix of Ghost Town DJ's \"My Boo\" includes a sample of the drum break from Lyn Collin's [*Think About It*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45MSVmfoJ4) which comes in at [0:12 seconds](https://youtu.be/dbFfl87eJWU?t=12) in WV's remix. \n\nWave Racer also uses the water drop sample and the \"bring it back\" sample in multiple tracks. I don't know specifically where these are from, but I know that they are very popular samples in Jersey Club (and Baltimore club)\n\nSpeaking of Jersey Club, you can definitely see the influence that songs like [*Heartbroken* - DJ Jayhood remix](https://youtu.be/BsQo6CE5eJ4?t=28) had on today's more modern Hoodboi/Dj Sliiink/Drippy Dolphin/Trippy Turtle/FOFOFADI type Jersey Club.\n\nSo, what samples should you use? Everything. Especially R&amp;B acapellas (preferrably from a song that has achieved meme status). Grab a sample of Navi from Legend of Zelda or Pikachu's cry from Pokemon Yellow. Hell, if you really want to be unique record your Grandmother queefing and turn it into a squelchy bass.\n\nFor drums you'll want to find some Kicks that are kinda clicky and punchy, but not too clicky and punchy. On a scale of Flume to Ambient Drone you'll want to sidechain your Kicks moderately at Machinedrum level. Your snares should punch and snap, but not too punchy or snappy. Wave Racer uses a lot of trap sounding snares, with the ocassional dubsteppy sounding snare like in [Streamers](https://youtu.be/5LSm6pUdldk?t=47). In terms of drum placement: start with a basic trap beat, now add 10 different percussion loops. All jokes aisde, experiment with syncopation (percussion hits and notes not perfectly on beat - pefect example: Burial). Your syncopation game better be so on point that nobody is able to keep up with your music when dancing at a club.\n\nWave Racer's synth chords are those lush future bass supersaws (which I'm personally not that good at making), but try detuning multiple saw waves, play with cutoff filters and try manually slicing bounced audio of the chords. A lot of Wave Racer's leads sound very bell-like and his arps are square waves. I'd recommend VSTs like Serum, Massive, Synth1 and Sylenth1 for the chords (Wave Racer uses Sylenth1 himself). Then Synth1, TAL-U-No-62 or MiniMogueVa for the pads, basses and analog sounding synths. Although, in my opinion, it matters more that you nail down composition and the voicing of the chords. Build the synth around the melody and not the other way around (it's up to you. There is ***no wrong way to do things***).\n\nOddly enough, Future Bass isn't really all that well...bassy. There's not a whole lot of that sub-shaking, club bursting, soul booming bass that's in most trap songs. That's different for guys like Mura Masa or KRNE who really want that subbass to be known to you.\n\nThere are a lot of melodic elements happening in Wave Racer's tracks. So many little oneshot samples, flourishes, short and sweet motifs and melodies. Probably smart EQing, timing and placement within the stereo field helps accomplish this (I'm not an expert so I can't give a very in-depth explanation)\n\n\nAnd now...the sample pack recommendations\n\n\n*Splice Users* [Pack provider - Pack]\n\nChampagne Drip Sample Pack (eveything is very close to Wave Racer's style here)\n\n\nSteLouse Sample Pack Vol. 1-2 (Kicks, Snares and FX)\n\n\nEkali Sample Pack Vol. 1-2 (Snares are especially Future Bass-y)\n\n\nKRNE/KRANE Sample Pack Vol. 1-4 (drums are a bit heavier than Wave Racer's, but still great samples nonetheless)\n\nElectric Mantis Sample Pack (Kicks, Snares, synths and vocals)\n\nDecap Drums that Knock Vol. 1-3 (More Lofi Hip Hop oriented, but the snares are spot on)\n\nGetter Sample Pack (Dubsteppy Snares will sound nice with some Reverb and Compression)\n\njosh pan x Gill Chang - Childhood sample pack (Drums are very hard-hitting, but still recommended for the 808 subs, and the Slaps/Snares in the pack)\n\nCAPSUN ProAudio - 4:20 The Smokers Kit (basic Trap drums, but some soft kicks and nice percussion loops to play with)\n\nIQ Samples - 813 Hypercolor Bass (Kicks, Claps, Drum fills and chants.)\n\nMedasin Microdose Vol. 1-3 (Kicks and Snares are perfect for Wave Racer's style)\n\nFunction Loops - Progressive PsyTrance (Kicks that are punchy and clicky similar to Wave Racer's or Machinedrums)\n\nXfer Drum Kit (Great all around drums.

Rustie and HudMo were there first, but Wave Racer and Flume helped it become more accessible. Wave Racer's more \"wavey, cutesy, 8-bit rainbow-y\" style has certainly influenced a lot of artists (Snail's House, ABSRDST, Shawn Wasabi, Tomggg). I think Wave Racer's sound is a great blend of the nostalgic period of the 80s/90s with more modern production techniques and songwriting styles. He certainly is very good at balancing multiple melodic elements in a track. I'd say that Wave Racer is incredibly creative, and has built up a very distinctive and signature sound palette. He probably just followed his influences, and the music he makes now is where it took him. I'm excited for his future. His popularity means that more remixes, collaborations and EPs/Singles are on their way eventually. Who knows? We may have a Wave Racer album by 2019. Or maybe an official Wave Racer, Basenji collab under their current aliases. The possibilities are endless, and exciting.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope this helped some people out. It took quite a while to finish, and I didn't have as many technical facts as I had hoped. But overall I was able to delve deeper into the theory behind Wave Racer's music. Hope you enjoyed it! I appreciate any and all feedback.\n\nGod my left hand hurts.\n\n\nSources:\n\n\nhttp://www.youredm.com/2015/10/14/your-edm-interview-with-wave-racer-on-his-new-ep/\n\n\nhttp://sweaty320.com/2015/06/review-interview-wave-racer-westword-music-showcase.html\n\n\nhttp://www.mymusicisbetterthanyours.com/2015/08/wave-racer-our-interview-with-the-future-bass-star-and-ticket-contest-for-san-francisco/\n\n\nhttps://gwradiomusic.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/an-interview-with-wave-racer/\n\n\nhttp://www.complex.com/music/2014/03/wave-racer-interview\n\n\nhttps://www.scenewave.com/2014/02/interview-wave-racer/\n\n\nhttp://runthetrap.com/2014/11/13/rtt-exclusive-interview-surfing-world-wave-racer/\n\n\nhttp://www.whosampled.com/\n\n\nhttps://www.hooktheory.com/\n\n\nhttps://www.ultimate-guitar.com/\n\n\nhttp://www.thejazzresource.com/jazz_theory.html\n\n\nhttp://www.jazzstandards.com/theory/overview.htm\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65ag3i", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 150, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThomAngelesMusic", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65ag3i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/edmproduction", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.edmproduction", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa4x", "edited": 1492224898.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "sc-future", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/edmproduction/comments/65ag3i/dissection_of_the_artist_wave_racer/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492171507.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/65ag3i/dissection_of_the_artist_wave_racer/", "author_flair_text": "Good music coming soon", "quarantine": false, "title": "Dissection of the Artist: Wave Racer", "created_utc": 1492142707.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 46, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 150}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa4x", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ag3i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa4x", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ag3i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa4x", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ag3i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9j525", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "F0X_MCL0UD", "parent_id": "t1_dg8u7zr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/edmproduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Def worth the effort - it's much appreciated.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Def worth the effort - it&amp;#39;s much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "name": "t1_dg9j525", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492223125.0, "created_utc": 1492194325.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8u7zr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThomAngelesMusic", "parent_id": "t1_dg8u5fa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/edmproduction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, really hope you enjoy it.
