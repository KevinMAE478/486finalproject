Listeners are not going to take time out of their day to leave feedback.\n\nLet me give you a good example...\n\nOn my Soundcloud I've got a song, Celestial City and it has as of right now 4,390 plays, 202 likes, 72 reposts and 35 comments. Let me break that down for you so you can understand what this means.\n\nWe're going to consider that each play is a unique person. (It's not the case because I know from my stats that some users play my same song several times) However for this illustration we're just going to assume that each play is a unique individual. \n\n4,390 people played my song...\n4.6% of those people liked it.\n1.6% reposted it.\n**.79% left a comment.**\n\nRight now there is no incentive for you to leave a comment on my SoundCloud. It does absolutely nothing for you to leave me a comment. If there were an incentive than perhaps there would be more comments. The point I am trying to illustrate is that these numbers are actually reoccurring. If you look at my song Velvet Pearl the same percentages are reflected. If you look at my other songs these numbers will slightly vary, but *there is a theme* going on here. *Very few people are willing to do more than listen to my songs.*\n\nThis goes back to my statement of *you're not solving a need.* You need to remember that *producers* are having a difficult time finding listeners. Listeners are *not* short of music sources. Just off the top of my head they've got Soundcloud, Youtube, iHeart, and Pandora. I am sure that there are many more that I am unaware of but my point is: What are you going to do to incentives listeners to go to your site and then interact with your site?\n\nAnother point that I would like to make is that this site seems to be catered towards other producers. I'm 24 going on 25 soon and I started producing at about 16. I can tell you that it was a lot easier to make friends when I was younger. Now I have no problem saying this but most music producers are so far stuck up their ass it's amazing that they don't suffocate. The average producer is only thinking about one thing and that's \"How am I going to get famous.\" I don't see this platform working out because of the crab mentality. Nobody wants to help anybody out and it's never been more apparent as I've slowly grown into adulthood. I personally wouldn't invest time in this project because of *what I know* but don't let me crush your dreams. Use what I laid out for you and make it work because I love a good success story.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again I&amp;#39;m not trying to hack your idea but you&amp;#39;re not solving a need.
