We generate thousand of these reports and it takes anywhere form 12min to 19 min and we want to know where the slowdown is in the variation. Some workers take up to 25mins and I would love to know where it went. Theres system slow downs so id like to know if its around lunch time or when does the slow down begin. As much automation as possible so that the workers are not clicking start and stop at every task. If there was a 10 step process id be ideal that this app be able to input which step took the longest. There are about 3 applications used so id like it to detect when switching to the applications. Any good recommendations ? Thanks &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello im in charge of a project that wants to track how long it takes to finish a report.
