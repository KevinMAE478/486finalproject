It can't be answered *in general*, and the details are everything here.\n- What is your field?  As a general rule of thumb, on the lower-comp end of the spectrum, public employees are paid equal or higher to private.  But on the higher-comp end of the spectrum, public employees are underpaid vs. private employees.  But, this will depend on your specific field and qualifications.\n\n**Basics of Federal Pension Program**\n\nI will speak to the current federal pension system, FERS-FRAE. (The older systems were all much better, and it has gotten worse over time for new hires.  But, those previous systems are irrelevant here because you would be a new hire).  Incidentally, I am a FERS-FRAE employee myself.\n\nThe way it works for regular employees (there are special classifications for special types of employees, but I will speak to regular classifications) is you (the employee) have a mandatory contribution of 4.4% of your gross salary, and the federal government contributes 11.9% on your behalf. Then, at the end of your employment, you get a lifetime annuity.  In general, this will be computed as 1% of your high-3 salary* per year of service.  So, if you worked 20 years, you get 20% of your high-three salary.   **IF** you are 62 years old at the time you leave the federal government **and** you have 20 years or more of service, you get 1.1% per year.  \n\n(*High-three salary is just what it sounds like, the average of your highest three years. )\n\n**Your Question and My Assumptions**\n\nSo, let's run through your question, in which you said:\n\n&gt; I am wondering is if it would be best for me to try and find a government job even if it meant a cut in my salary to half.\n\nI will make the following assumptions:\n\n* I will assume 100k gross in private employment, based on your OP\n* I will assume 50k gross in public employment based on your question (\"even if it meant a cut in my salary to half\")\n* I will assume all raises merely track inflation, in both private and public employment\n* Since this is a FIRE forum, I will assume you retire prior to 62 and thus only get 1% per year under FERS-FRAE.\n* I will assume a 20 year career, with retirement at age 46\n\n**Math and Discussion**\n\nFirst, the public side.  You'll be contributing 4.4% of your gross salary per year.  So, that's $2.2k per year.  After that contribution, and less taxes, you have maybe $40k left over for your lifestyle.  After 20 years, you'd be entitled to a pension of $10k per year.  Note, you can't start taking this pension at 46.  You can only start taking it at 62, and it's not COLA'd from 46-62, so it'll get wiped pretty bad by inflation.  Tweaking the hypo, if you didn't go for early retirement and instead worked until 62, you'd get almost a $20k pension starting at age 62.  Still not great, but with SS added in, it's close to covering your $40k lifestyle.\n\nNow the private side.  Let's assume the same $40k lifestyle.  Well, take your $100k and max out your 401k off the top, that's 18k per year.  Let's also add in an IRA at $5500. So you have $76.5k in taxable income.  Let's say you have a total effective tax rate of maybe ~~25%~~33% (~~pretty~~ extremely conservative), which leaves you with $50k in after-tax dollars, so you can also throw $10k per year towards a taxable brokerage.  So, you're saving $23.5k in tax-deferred accounts, $10k in after-tax accounts, and you still are living the same $40k lifestyle.  Well, after 20 years, assuming very modest 4% real (ie, post inflation growth), you have $1M in your nest egg.  That's enough for a $40k draw under a SWR (and $40k is your lifestyle cost) so FIRE is on the table at age 46.  Taxes are [probably 0 or close to it on this amount] (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/06/04/the-lovely-low-taxes-of-early-retirement/), but even if you have to work a couple extra years, you are still much better off than you were in the public sector scenario.  Also, you'd still have SS kicking in in 16-20 years as a fail-stop protecting against sequence of return risk in ER.\n\nFinally, just to track the hypo tweak we did on the public side, if you work until 62, you'd have $2.7M in your nest egg.  Enough for $93k per year draw and really a much more lavish lifestyle than you are used to.  Plus SS.\n\n**tl;dr** \n\nUnder your given conditions, private sector employment is much more financially advantageous as compared to public sector employment.\n\n(Edited formatting)\n", "edited": 1492187484.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;ve gotten some decent advice, but I wanted to chime in as someone who has worked in the private sector and public sector, and someone who sees advantages and disadvantages to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, a couple things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This has already been said, but different pension systems are different, and you&amp;#39;re really asking for overgeneralization when you frame the question as a generic &amp;quot;government pension v. private 401k&amp;quot;.

My pay bump is roughly around 25% more working private compared to at the City, and I was paid well, relatively, at the City (I had come from 7 years of working private so they placed me at the upper range of my job class).  The math works out as such - roughly 20% salary increase, and roughly 5% difference between City employee contribution to pension (11%) vs social security contribution (~6%).\n\nMy advice - you're still young.
