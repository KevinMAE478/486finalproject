I've contributed enough to get the match at my company's 401(K), and if I owe money in taxes each year, I'll usually contribute some money to an IRA to lower the tax bill. I also have access to a 457, and this year is the first year I'll be maxing it out, but to be fair, once I quit my job (likely to happen in 18 months for a change of pace), that money will become liquid.\n\nInstead, I've invested most of my money, until last fall, into a taxable brokerage account, and the liquidity was highly important to me.

If I needed money to ramp up my freelance work, it was there.  Or, what happened last fall:  I found an excellent rental property that had a few strings attached, which made the sellers have to lower the asking price considerably, but also meant I had to come up with about $20,000* more in cash to close than I had anticipated while I was shopping for a house.\n\nHaving the means to sell some stocks, transfer the money to my bank account and write a check to close was well worth whatever tax savings I missed out on in the years prior.\n\nSo, I recommend not saving too much in tax advantaged accounts, but with a few caveats.  For me, I've been consistently in the 15% tax bracket for most of my earning years, so I'm not a particularly high earner.  As such, I've adopted a dividend growth investing strategy in my taxable account, which means that all those dividends are not taxed, and there is no drag on reinvestment.  If I were in a higher tax bracket, I would rethink this strategy, though likely not abandon it entirely.\n\nAlso, like I said, I do contribute some money to tax advantaged accounts.  For me, that's how I answer the \"what about higher healthcare expenses in the future?\" question - I save about 8-10% of my income per year, and when I'm eligible to access that money is also likely when age-related healthcare expenses will go up. \n\nAs far as real estate, my wife and I now have two properties, and are gearing up to buy a third, and we love it.  As part of our strategy, we'd rather keep all our money after tax, and buy more properties faster, than build up assets in our 401(K), and have fewer houses.\n\nAnother point is that we're a bit entrepreneurial.  At the moment, we're at a crossroads, talking about shutting down some of our side hustles, while also thinking about starting up some grand ambitions in the future.  I have no clue what the future will hold for us, but we're very happy knowing we have some financial capital ready to go at a moments notice, if and when we do decide to start something.  \n\nLastly, we both love the flexibility to quit our jobs, and get up and go at a moments notice.  We're in the process of building a tiny house, and at 18 months, I'm planning to quit my job, regardless of a plan for what's next, and she's working to negotiate remote work, but if it doesn't happen, that won't keep us tied down.  Having cash in the bank makes it a lot easier to say \"See ya later!\" and move to something new - the opportunity cost of not exploring a new opportunity, just because you can't afford to because most of your liquid assets are tied up in a 401(K) is hard to quantify, but is very real.\n\nSorry if that's a bit rambling.

I&amp;#39;m sure there are many scenarios where going for tax deferrals at the expense of liquidity makes sense, but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be seen as the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; answer in all circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff is probably some loss of SR bragging rights (people crave simplicity and SR % feeds that need) and maybe a longer wait time for paper FI, but it&amp;#39;s a good tradeoff for real, nearly bulletproof liquidity (Rothing savings gives you some asset protection depending on jurisdiction) and, depending on circumstances, a practically sooner actual RE threshold.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That jump in the marginal tax rate between 15% and 25% makes things pretty simple as you point out.  I think the better general advice is do whatever it takes to stay under 15% and then tilt towards building tax advantaged liquidity and reserves, decreasing healthier debt like mortgages under 5% (and thus avoiding indirect leveraging into investments), keeping the powder dry for non-IRA/401(k) investments like business opportunities or being a landlord, saving up for large but necessary purchases like used cars, replacing failing appliances, funding child&amp;#39;s college, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I&amp;#39;m envious/not envious of being locked out of HSAs.  They sound nifty but my health insurance is too good and paid for by our employers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dg8cu72", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492152277.0, "created_utc": 1492123477.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ilhu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Corn-Picker", "parent_id": "t1_dg6mzsf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the thoughtful reply.

Basically, I think that you should have a year of expenses of highly liquid savings as your goal after you get below the 25% income tax bracket so all of your income is taxed max 15%.  So my priority goes something like:\n\nEmployer match --&gt; Employer tax deferred to 15% bracket bracket --&gt; Roth IRA --&gt; Additional savings for emergency fund to 1 year. \n\nThe long term goal is actually to hit 130% of a year's worth of expenses, all as contributions in a Roth container with a 60/40 bond/stock split (Bettermint makes a pretty good case for why this beats a savings account strategy), around two months of money in an account for purely cashflow.  Once one (as I have) has the year + 30% of expenses either in the Roth or in a combination of Roth and taxable accounts, priority is changed:\n\n401(k) max --&gt; Tax deferred if income/Rothing the savings allows &lt;--&gt; If not, Roth IRA (if you don't need that to convert taxable savings to Roth) --&gt; Backdoor Roth strategies --&gt; taxable accounts.\n\nThe downside with this approach is that I increase the amount of time to FI on paper because of that 15% you're paying in taxes during the 1 year + 30% period.  But I'm a bit skeptical of the calculations thrown around, they sometimes miscalculate tax liability and/or fail to adequately plan for spending during the Roth ladder period.  Let's take your situation.  I'm ballparking 103k with a 40-50% savings rate, which means that your annual expenses are around 30k.  You'll presumably want to hit close to your standard of living, so even with COL adjustments and assuming you don't have increased medical expenses, you're looking at needing 25k a year, realistically.  Let's further say you RE, and want to ladder.  How are you going to have 25k a year while you're waiting on your Roth ladder?  Short answer, you're going to either have to work (decreasing significantly or eliminating the ladder pull outs if you are trying to minimize tax liability and postponing retirement because of taxes) or you're going to have to withdraw from the 401(k) to live off of and probably pay the income tax + 10% tax, offsetting your tax savings or even suffering more in taxes.\n\nNow, what did you give up for racing to FI on paper but not thinking through the RE part?  Opportunity costs and self-insurance for a job loss.
