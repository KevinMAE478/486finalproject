Ultimately, I endorse Marx&amp;#39;s critique of the contradictions in capitalism, but unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t think there has yet been a good proposition on how they might be resolved in an actual society. That is very troubling for people who are looking to FIRE, because unless society figures out a way to transition, and capitalism falls apart in our lifetimes, our savings will be worthless.

There is some point at which humans have to interact with corporations, and at every point of contact there individuals will be sorely outmatched. Having good lawyers wins court cases, and courts are pretty much the zero level governmental interaction between 2 parties. Further, even if you reduced the size of the government, businesses in capitalism have a manifest interest in increasing bureaucracy. Its really hard to actually do something better in a way that systematically profitable, so the profit motive inevitably turns to legal loopholes to optimize.

Secondly, liberal democracy=/=capitalism. Although the united states is both a liberal democracy and capitalist, only the liberal democracy part was there from the outset really. \n\nAgreed though on the UBI, I really don't see it resolving the massive class disparities that we are currently observing.
