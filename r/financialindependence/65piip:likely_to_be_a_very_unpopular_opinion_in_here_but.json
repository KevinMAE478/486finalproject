In 1993, I set a goal of FI by age 50.  I achieved that goal at age 47.  BUT, the spousal unit felt she was too young to retire, that she had more to accomplish professionally, and that I should work seasonally while she continued to pursue her goals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I got a gig teaching at the community college level.  Wasn&amp;#39;t thrilled about the idea at first, BUT it turned out to be a great experience for many, many different reasons.  Now she&amp;#39;s ready, and we&amp;#39;re gonna travel the globe together soon. Another upside is that our finances are much stronger now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In regard to some of your particulars:  We do not live in a LCOL area and have no real interest in moving overseas.  We paid off the mortgage. We paid cash for a rental unit as a response to the opportunities offered us by the great recession. And we doubled our stock market assets.  Finally, I have never been one of these tax phobic people.  My experience has taught me that trying to get to ZERO tax obligations causes warped investments and actually leads to very strange political opinions.
