One must prioritize. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our house PITI is 5.1% of our new &amp;quot;SS income&amp;quot; gross salary figure. I wish I could say that it met our needs and I felt great about it, but I don&amp;#39;t! There&amp;#39;s numerous downsides to our living arrangements that are wearing on me, especially now that we have enough nickels to rub together to easily fix them by spending money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By deferring our high-tax income into tax-advantaged accounts, we have no access to liquid money, so putting together a downpayment on a pricey house isn&amp;#39;t happening either. We&amp;#39;ve also gotten used to spending only what I regard to be a pittance on housing obligations, and it&amp;#39;s difficult to consider paying a very reasonable, say 15%, because it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;3 times higher&lt;/strong&gt; than what we pay now, which seems insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Author isn&amp;#39;t wrong, though: When I bought this house, PITI was like 30% of my gross base pay, and it was difficult to make any headway at all on FIRE.
