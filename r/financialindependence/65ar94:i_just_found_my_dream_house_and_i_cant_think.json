Our conservative calculations are that if we don&amp;#39;t touch the 1M, it should provide full retirement funding for us once we&amp;#39;re 65 (in 20 years). With this in mind, we figure we can divorce our corporate jobs in 3 years and do our own thing (with part time and freelance work) once we hit 45.

I do believe it is important to create the home that you want. My ex used to love throw pillows and I couldn't understand them because I thought they were just a waste of money but they were something that helped create a happy environment for her, just like I enjoy having some paintings on my wall or I like having a piano in my room. I'm building the environment that makes me happy and leads me to have the life that I want to live.  \n\nSo my advice would be to really think if this house will help you create the life that will make you successful down the line. What are the few things that are important to you? Is having a dock and a private lake property the dream you've always had or is it just something that seems nice? Do you guys go boating all the time right now at a nearby lake? I mean a giant mansion out in California with a built in theater, bowling alley, indoor pool, etc sounds wonderful, but those are all just \"nice\" things that would be cool to have for a bit but then I wouldn't care for it eventually once things settled down they would probably go to waste or be used sparingly. So just think how much this builds your life and the home that you want. If this is really the place, go get it and don't worry about the finances because they are only there to help you build the exact life you want.

Is home owners association run by assholes?  Are there crazy deed restrictions?  Will a nextdoor neighbor infringe on your enjoyment of property?  How is crime including petty theft?    Id definitely visit the neighborhood a few times especially at night or a weekend.   If it&amp;#39;s on the water is it one those areas that are annoyingly noisy?  If it&amp;#39;s tidal/brackish water, how is the smell at low tide?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any issues with flooding or needing extra insurance?  How much will a good policy cost.  It might be far more than for a regular home away from water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If everything still seems pretty good, why not go for it?   It doesnt delay your FI too much and it sounds like it would add a lot of enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dg97hpr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209544.0, "created_utc": 1492180744.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ar94", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cu9i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "justgrowingup", "parent_id": "t3_65ar94", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Split reaction in this thread. \n\nIf it is the house of your absolute dreams, that you can see living there forever - FUCK IT GO FOR IT!
