If you're planning to fly in the hundreds of hours a year, buying can make sense.

My club has a 3 hour daily minimum on weekends, so if I want to do a weekend trip, I'm on the hook for at least 6 hours if I keep it overnight twice. If you really want to use a plane to go places, you'll probably want an instrument rating as well, otherwise you'll occasionally be grounded by weather (even when you have the instrument rating, weather can keep you on the ground due to icing, winds, etc). Instrument ratings are about another $10,000 in training.\n\nI'm like you - flying was always a dream of mine and I had just discovered FI (had always been a saver though) when I decided to get my license. Eating that $10,000 to get it hurt, but in the grand scheme of things, hasn't made a huge difference.

I eventually want to buy a plane, so this is also something I'm slowly saving for in my budget. Overall, I feel it's totally worth it.\n\nMake sure your SO is actually onboard with the idea. General aviation brings along plenty of safety risks, and as a pilot, you'll learn how to mitigate them, but your SO might not have the same level of understanding. You could reach out to a local flight club/school and ask if they do discovery flights and if you could bring your SO along with you, that way you could both get a taste for what flying small planes is like.\n\nCheck out /r/flying as well. You'll get more pilots chiming in about what general aviation really is and what it is not.\n\nGood luck making the decision! It's a very rewarding, but very expensive hobby.

It is something that I've looked into, but I can't justify at the moment (also, my wife is kinda opposed - mostly due to the cost).  Back when I was younger, before I went to college, I looked into it as well, but decided that I would rather get scuba certified than get my private pilot's license.\n\nThat being said, here are a number of things that you want to keep in mind and think about.\n\n1. Becoming a pilot is nice.  But it isn't just take it once and you are done.  You have to stay current, and if you lose your currency then you need to regain it before you are allowed to fly again.  Staying current means that you need to fly with an instructor for 1h about every 2 years or so.  Additionally, if you want to carry passengers, you need to perform 3 take offs and landings every 90 days.  This basically means that you are going to need to fly at least once every 90 days just to make sure you can carry passengers, and every 2 years you are going to need to rent instructor time.  Assuming I can rent a plane for ~$150/hour, and an instructor for ~$50 an hour, this means that you are looking at about $625/year (ish) just to be able to fly and take passengers at any time.\n\n2. Renting a plane.  As you are going for FI and just talked about how you had to push to pay off $20k of debt, you are not going to be buying a plane anytime soon.  I've looked.  I can't find a decent one (ultra-lights excepted) for less than about $150k.  The few that I can find for less than that are definitely going to cost me more than that in the long run, as they are all nearing EOL for wings/engines/avionics/etc.  This leaves renting, and you might not always be able to get a plane at short notice to rent to take somewhere.  Also, how much is it going to cost you to rent a plane for the weekend, even if you are only putting half a dozen flight hours on it?  I recommend you run your numbers again, as your current statements lead me to either think that you are underestimating the costs, or you are currently travelling pretty fancy when you do travel.  Best recommendation - go talk to one of the instructors or to the aircraft rental company/club, and ask what the price would be to rent a plane for the weekend to fly to X.  And when you do, make sure said plane is big enough to carry you, your passenger's, AND your luggage - every time I look at it, I discover that I can't take the cheapest plane there because of weight limit requirements.\n\n3. Additional Training.  A basic pilots license gets you to fly visual only in a single engine prop plane.  Want a twin engine?  More training.  Want instrument rating?  More training.  Want to fly more and pay less?  Go for your instructor's certification (more training).  Trust me, there are a LOT of ways that it is going to end up costing you far more than you anticipated from an initial review - the above are just what I could come up with off the top of my head.\n\nIn the end, I still intend to become a pilot (eventually).  However, realize that it is a money pit, and it is going to set you back on FI.  If that is worth it to you, go for it.  However, I would HIGHLY recommend that you only do this when you can afford to pay for it in cash, and aren't financing any of it.  Additionally, for a purchase this size, I would also recommend that after you have the cash available, think about it for a month or so and decide for yourself whether this is really what you want to spend that money on.  If you are sure, then go for it.  If you aren't, then I would recommend investing that money instead in the meantime, and postpone getting your flight lessons for a bit longer.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I am not a pilot.

There is so much that would go into a 2 day trip.

Then all week you'll be hoping the weather will be perfect (it never is) and if not then your plan will be done for. Then you have to make the hardest decision of all and tell your friends and family that the trip is off due to weather OR you go for it and put everyone in a dangerous situation.\n\n* owning a plane has a lot of costs ie hangar fees and annual inspection costs, maintenance,  insurance and cost of the plane.\n\n* for more freedom you need an instrument rating. Thats another ~$9k\n\n\n* beside the legal currency requirements, you really need to fly often. I felt like once every 2 weeks was a bare minimum for myself to feel safe. Are you really going to want to get in a plane (possibly a rental you arent used to) with your loved ones after not flying for 2 months and fly a trip you are fairly unfamiliar with? This was my biggest concern. I wanted to fly at least every weekend to feel like i was on top of my game but with my job it wasn't practical. \n\n* what happens when you get a flat tire or other mechanical issue on sunday two states away from your house and have to work monday morning? \n\n* is your spouse and family on board 100%? My spouse definitely was not. Another big issue. Felt it was unsafe. The safety stats are similar to riding a motorcycle (maybe worse for new, non IR pilots) so if your spouse wouldn't support that then chances are they would be uneasy about this as well. I came to a compromise that i would fly cirrus since they have an airframe parachute and this made her feel a lot better, but now the costs of flying are doubled.\n\n* Your priorities might change. I still think about flying all the time and the last time I flew was 2 years ago. Even so, my priorities are in line now. I wish i had an SR22 hangared at the nearby airport that I could take up every weekend but thats just beyond impractical at this point. My priorities now are ensuring my family is financially secure, THEN I may pursue PPL and IR but I'm not sure anymore because its really not the same as the daydream youre having about it.\n\n* Finally I'll give some tips on getting your license. Ok so one thing I did was fly cirrus SR20 because I wanted to fly cirrus mainly after PPL. Find what plane you'd like to fly based on availability and cost and preference and then find a school or club that has one. Also joinging a flight club will likely save you money over using a flight school due to getting better rental rates. And lastly DO NOT pay $14k up front! You may not like your instructor or school or planes. I fired my first instructor after 2 hours because Im a hands on learner and he was not letting me fly most of the time and not teaching me much and didn't even preflight the plane our first lesson. \n\n**Conclusion:** You're looking at some high costs here and when will you realistically be able to use it? $14k might seem doable but it is much more than that to keep things going. You're looking at $200 at the very least per month just to fly around the airport you are based at once per month. Thats not the dream you had in mind.

Also joinging a flight club will likely save you money over using a flight school due to getting better rental rates. And lastly DO NOT pay $14k up front! You may not like your instructor or school or planes. I fired my first instructor after 2 hours because Im a hands on learner and he was not letting me fly most of the time and not teaching me much and didn&amp;#39;t even preflight the plane our first lesson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;re looking at some high costs here and when will you realistically be able to use it? $14k might seem doable but it is much more than that to keep things going. You&amp;#39;re looking at $200 at the very least per month just to fly around the airport you are based at once per month. Thats not the dream you had in mind. My advice is wait until you&amp;#39;re FI and definitely do not go into debt over this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dg7lahy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121429.0, "created_utc": 1492092629.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6il", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6il", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7o5o0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BlindTiger86", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nqih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for your response!
