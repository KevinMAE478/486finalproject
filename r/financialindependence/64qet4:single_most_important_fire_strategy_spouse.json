I had a car loan, about $6k in credit card debt, and a townhouse mortgage which included PMI. On paper marrying me would have been a terrible decision!\n\nWith my husband's support, I moved jobs twice and ended up with a salary of $48k. This was still significantly less than his salary but was a decent jump! We sold his house and my townhouse, and bought a larger house together. Paid off all debt and cars except mortgage. NW is $950k which is obviously mostly his doing. I'm sure without me around it would be higher but there have been pluses for him too!\n\nThe biggest--we are expecting our first child together next month. He went from a single, basically confirmed bachelor, to an instant family with daughter and dog, and a wife (me!) and his friends have told me they've never seen him so happy. He will turn 40 and have his first child a week later and he's thrilled. Something he never thought would happen is happening. I'd also like to think I helped my husband a few ways. The biggest is he realized that not everyone's life is as easy as a single guy in his late 30's who has a great job in the computer industry. While my life certainly wasn't terrible, it was much different from his, and I think it made him much more understanding and compassionate. He has also admitted on a few occasions that I help balance him out by encouraging him to live a little. Naturally he also has a partner, helper, friend, and live-in maid (me, haha). \n\nAnd to be fair, he has definitely rubbed off on me too. I'm definitely a spender, but have changed a lot in the last few years and I'm just as concerned about our budget as he is. With baby arriving next month I'm in a panic over all the money that's being spent and he's the one calming me down. \n\nI imagine with the wife+2 kids+bigger house, my husband will work a few years longer than he planned back in his 20's.
