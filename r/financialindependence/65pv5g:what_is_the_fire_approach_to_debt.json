", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, my only debt is my mortgage at 3.25% fixed for 30 years.  After tax benefit, that&amp;#39;s about 2.34%.  Comparing that to inflation (2%) and it&amp;#39;s pretty darn near zero % interest.  I&amp;#39;m fine keeping that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, once I hit my FI goal, I&amp;#39;ll probably pay down the mortgage anyway.
