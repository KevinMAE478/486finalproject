Can&amp;#39;t say enough good things about it! I was raised in East Sacramento, which is a fabulous family friendly neighborhood, and is easily bikeable to midtown/downtown. The lower numbered streets in East Sac (30s streets) are for sure walkable to the outer parts of midtown (20s streets). Land Park is another beautiful and family friendly neighborhood that would be bikeable to midtown/downtown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some excellent schools in Sacramento. Unfortunately, I went to school in the suburb of Carmichael, and can&amp;#39;t comment too much on public elementary or middle schools in midtown or downtown. That said, McClatchy High is an incredible public high school in Land Park, which is quite close to East Sac, Midtown, and Downtown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since he works remotely, I&amp;#39;m guessing your husband wouldn&amp;#39;t need to get to the Bay too often? Once per week or less would probably be doable, but more than that would be totally exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, if you choose the right living situation, you can get by without using a car too often. I would definitely recommend having a car, though. Part of what makes Sacramento awesome (besides how easy/pleasant/affordable it is to live there) is the proximity to incredible places. Tahoe, Yosemite, Napa, Sonoma, SF, Marin headlands, Point Reyes, Monterey, Big Sur...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dg75hc9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087053.0, "created_utc": 1492058253.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hif1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "renegadecause", "parent_id": "t1_dg4hf1y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Midtown, which is one of the more expensive parts of the city.
