But if, for whatever reason, you can&amp;#39;t access those opportunities then you have one strategy for FI: grinding away for 1-2 decades, experiencing top line growth of a few pp, while aggressively lowering your bottom line.

Where I do roll my eyes, however, is when people who wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to afford a city life try hard to convince others that rural/suburban life is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better. Even if they genuinely like it better, you can&amp;#39;t believe them because they have to think that: it&amp;#39;s in their self-interest to believe something other than &lt;em&gt;I can&amp;#39;t afford to live where I&amp;#39;d prefer to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sub isn&amp;#39;t the kind of place where people get together and talk about becoming financially independent by creating scalable sources of revenue.
