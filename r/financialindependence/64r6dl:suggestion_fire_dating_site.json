I see three main problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- a website where I highlight how much money I have, then meet strange men in real life...no thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- FIre is a small community, focusing on that group will be very limiting.  (Although I&amp;#39;m a single woman in the Bay Area so...good for me :))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3-  I think assuming you need a partner who is currently planning to FIrE is over-limiting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend normal dating sites, but figuring out how to filter what you care about in a partner.
