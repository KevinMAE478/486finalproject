Here is what we do:\n\nFirst, get YNAB.com. I love this budgeting app.\n\nNext, do the math to fully fund your 401k for 2017.  This will be $18,000 divided by the number of paychecks you will get for the rest of the year.  In 2018, you need to readjust to account for the full year of paychecks.  \n\nI really recommend funding your 401k from each paycheck to keep yourself used to the lower net pay.  If there is a Roth option, you should strongly consider it.  To get started in your investments, just pick a target date fund.  You will have a lot to learn at work and a lot of time to optimize your investments later. \n\nPeople are going to advise you to do a back door Roth IRA because you cannot directly contribute to a Roth.  Please speak to a tax professional about this, as my tax professional explained that these are an illegal step transaction.  So: caution re backdoor roth and seek professional advice.\n\nNext, calculate how much you need for your monthly expenses.  YNAB really helps with this.  Since you are probably getting RSUs, you should save up about $5,000 to pay taxes next April.  You are not going to get a refund unless something horrible happens to the stock market - we've found it impossible to withhold enough with RSUs and a bull market.  That's a good problem to have.\n\nThe extras from your paycheck, your bonuses, your stock vests - these all go into either (a) your 3-6 month emergency buffer (b) your house downpayment fund or (c) a taxable investment account.  I recommend delaying the house down payment a bit, since if you're looking at a $300,000 house somewhere else, you can probably just use your lsat few bonuses and stock vests for the down payment.\n\nLook for credit unions.  I have a credit union that gives 2% on the first $25,000. I use Barclays for the extra house savings at 1%.  For the taxable investment account, we have a Vanguard index fund.  You want one that does *not* pay a lot of dividends or interest.  Really, though, the \"don't let perfect be the enemy of good\" solution is to just do another target date index fund.  If you get at all overwhelmed and procrastinate selecting an investment, go to target date fund and select the investments in a few years.\n\nNext, you have to do a good job at work.  Notice how few people there are who are older than 30, 40.  This is because they lose their jobs.  I don't know what you're doing, specifically, but just regularly read some blogs in your field.  Buy Getting Things Done - I love that book.  If you're allowed to install it, add boomerang to your email account.  Get lunches with a variety of people on your team and on teams you work with and on teams that do something that sounds cool.  By Emotional Intelligence.  Get Better Faster Stronger. (I love books.)\n\nMy husband and I do this.  We live off of our post-retirement savings net paychecks and stuff the rest into Vanguard.  It is causing a lot of concern amongst my family who have asked us about our \"financial situation.\"  Apparently, only owning one car when you live less than a mile from your jobs is really, really scary. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a similar situation, but doubled up on marriage.  Here is what we do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, get YNAB.com. I love this budgeting app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, do the math to fully fund your 401k for 2017.  This will be $18,000 divided by the number of paychecks you will get for the rest of the year.  In 2018, you need to readjust to account for the full year of paychecks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really recommend funding your 401k from each paycheck to keep yourself used to the lower net pay.  If there is a Roth option, you should strongly consider it.  To get started in your investments, just pick a target date fund.  You will have a lot to learn at work and a lot of time to optimize your investments later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are going to advise you to do a back door Roth IRA because you cannot directly contribute to a Roth.  Please speak to a tax professional about this, as my tax professional explained that these are an illegal step transaction.  So: caution re backdoor roth and seek professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, calculate how much you need for your monthly expenses.  YNAB really helps with this.  Since you are probably getting RSUs, you should save up about $5,000 to pay taxes next April.  You are not going to get a refund unless something horrible happens to the stock market - we&amp;#39;ve found it impossible to withhold enough with RSUs and a bull market.  That&amp;#39;s a good problem to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The extras from your paycheck, your bonuses, your stock vests - these all go into either (a) your 3-6 month emergency buffer (b) your house downpayment fund or (c) a taxable investment account.  I recommend delaying the house down payment a bit, since if you&amp;#39;re looking at a $300,000 house somewhere else, you can probably just use your lsat few bonuses and stock vests for the down payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for credit unions.  I have a credit union that gives 2% on the first $25,000. I use Barclays for the extra house savings at 1%.  For the taxable investment account, we have a Vanguard index fund.  You want one that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pay a lot of dividends or interest.  Really, though, the &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let perfect be the enemy of good&amp;quot; solution is to just do another target date index fund.  If you get at all overwhelmed and procrastinate selecting an investment, go to target date fund and select the investments in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, you have to do a good job at work.  Notice how few people there are who are older than 30, 40.  This is because they lose their jobs.  I don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re doing, specifically, but just regularly read some blogs in your field.  Buy Getting Things Done - I love that book.  If you&amp;#39;re allowed to install it, add boomerang to your email account.  Get lunches with a variety of people on your team and on teams you work with and on teams that do something that sounds cool.  By Emotional Intelligence.  Get Better Faster Stronger. (I love books.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband and I do this.  We live off of our post-retirement savings net paychecks and stuff the rest into Vanguard.  It is causing a lot of concern amongst my family who have asked us about our &amp;quot;financial situation.&amp;quot;  Apparently, only owning one car when you live less than a mile from your jobs is really, really scary. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dg70ja2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492079919.0, "created_utc": 1492051119.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vj4n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64im5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wakeboarder079", "parent_id": "t3_64vj4n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do you do for work?
