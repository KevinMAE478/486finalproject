There's a closed-form equation to what you're trying to calculate.

In particular, if the interest gained in a year exceeds yearly spending, but yearly spending exceeds portfolio value, your code will say there's a finite time horizon, when really the person will never be insolvent.\n\nC) This method will systematically overestimate the years solvent because years where returns are low (or negative) have a greater detrimental effect than years where returns are higher.  This is because when the stock market is down, you have to sell more shares, which means your withdrawal biases to selling low.

The only way to do accurate forecasting is with Monte-Carlo simulations.", "edited": 1492255870.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A) No need to write a program for this.  There&amp;#39;s a closed-form equation to what you&amp;#39;re trying to calculate.  It&amp;#39;s the solution to the linear differential equation dy/dt = y * i - s (where y is the amount of money you have at time t, i is your interest rate, s is the spending per year, and P is your initial principle).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When s&amp;gt;P*i, the closed-form solution is that your years solvent is: ln(s/ (s-P*i))/i&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) Your code incorrectly calculates the contribution of the final year since there&amp;#39;s no credit given for investment returns for that year.  In particular, if the interest gained in a year exceeds yearly spending, but yearly spending exceeds portfolio value, your code will say there&amp;#39;s a finite time horizon, when really the person will never be insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) This method will systematically overestimate the years solvent because years where returns are low (or negative) have a greater detrimental effect than years where returns are higher.  This is because when the stock market is down, you have to sell more shares, which means your withdrawal biases to selling low.  (This is the mirror image of the effect of dollar cost averaging when accumulating your investment that leads DCA investors to buy more when the market is down.)
