This part of the phase is where everything is on auto pilot and you are tracking towards your goals. Often this is the longest phase, and is the most boring. Many people have difficulty psychologically here, and keeping the course is hard when you have such a long runway. This can last from about 5 years for the lean FIRE to up to 30 years for the fat FIRE.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The final stretch. This phase is the last year or two of your working career as you approach the NW you need to retire, or a number that you are happy with.

Many people increase their savings rates here as they try to hasten the process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of this discussion is to address phase number 2, the coast mode phase. In order to remain interested in tracking and following your net worth through this phase it is important to shift the kinds of metrics you track. Many new people often track their net worth as the most important number. This is exciting early on, as it increases rapidly, but as you enter the coasting phase, the month over month changes to your net worth will grow to be small and uninteresting. Here are two metrics worth tracking that avoid this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Percent of expenses covered by the 4% rule.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Years until broke if you quit work today.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these metrics grow exponentially as you invest more and more money, until they snowball past your retirement number. That kind of trend is more exciting to track and follow every month than a growing net worth. These metrics may help you remain more interested in the process as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the net worth chart for a fairly fresh college graduate. They graduated in August 2015 and began aggressively saving and tracking their net worth towards FIRE. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Xnu1nmX.png\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/Xnu1nmX.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are in the process of transitioning from phase 1 to phase 2 above. Almost two years have passed since they began the journey, and their percentage growth in NW is becoming smaller and smaller each month. Where before they were increasing their net worth by 20% or 30% in a given month, now 1% to 2% growth is pretty common. That is a lot more boring. It&amp;#39;s a lot easier to be excited about going from $10,000 to $13,000 than it is to go from $125,000 to $128,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is their chart for month over month NW change since they graduated college. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/FZurgRz.png\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/FZurgRz.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is a chart showing their expenses covered by the 4% rule (blue) and their years until broke (red).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/CK0tCKD.png\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/CK0tCKD.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These metrics should be more interesting going forward, especially as the net worth month over month changes get smaller and smaller.
