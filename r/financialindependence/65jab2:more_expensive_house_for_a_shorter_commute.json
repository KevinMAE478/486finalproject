I had to do this traffic trek when I went to college. I did it for 5 years and then did it for about a year for work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how my mom does it and is STILL doing it... but it&amp;#39;s soul-sucking for me. I get home and I&amp;#39;m drained and sluggish. I feel like I have to exert a lot of energy just to go grocery shopping or run errands because I have to go back out to the traffic masses. It just wasn&amp;#39;t worth the time and wasted energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I moved closer to work. It went from 2 hours a day to 20 minutes a day. I am much happier. I get to sleep in more, I spend less time in traffic and feel like I have more energy. I&amp;#39;m now going to the gym, going on walks with my dog, I find cooking and cleaning exciting... and I have a shit ton energy. Although I am renting in a shared house, I can tell you I will be buying a property near work and I am saving for it. Like you, it&amp;#39;ll be 20-30% more expensive (and not diving into budgeting, affordability, etc), with our current finances and if we continue to save, I&amp;#39;ll be happy to pay a little more to spend less time in traffic. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dgappbr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296220.0, "created_utc": 1492267420.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 135}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jab2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavdud", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheHatedMilkMachine", "parent_id": "t3_65jab2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Life is measured in time, not money.
