I decided to go and message him about it to maybe have some good conversation, I'm bored, thats why I'm on tinder.\n\n\nHe told me how he plans to max his 401k this year. I mention that I plan to retire at 35yo, he goes on a rant talking about how there is no way, \"some dumb blonde bimbo with an ass has beaten the system, if its easy enough for you to do it, then everyone would do it.\" I explain it in baby steps and, after calling me stupid a few more times, I unmatched him.\n\n\nThe world is so uneducated on retiring early, during our conversation it became clear that he doesn't even know anything about interest, like he thinks retirement is about saving enough money and hoping you don't run out. (Admittedly, that is what I thought once upon a time, but he wouldn't even let me explain it) In addition to insulting (complimenting?) my appearance, he also slammed my intellect. He really needs to 1, change his bio because planning to max out your 401k for one year does not make it sizable, and 2, learn how to treat people with respect, because his bod didn't do it for me, and his personality DEFINITELY didn't do it for me.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off topic, but I want to rant a bit and it loosely applies and I figure some of you may get a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I was messing around on tinder and up popped a guy who&amp;#39;s bio said, &amp;quot;sizable 401k.&amp;quot; I am not a gold digger by any means, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t have right swiped if I didn&amp;#39;t see that.
