Totally different vibe than Wake Forest I would say (though the New Neighborhoods all feel kind of the same - few trees, manicured lawns, HOAs keeping things uniform, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely agree with your comment: &amp;quot;[RTP] is [d]efinitely one of the more welcoming parts of the South for POC&amp;quot;.
