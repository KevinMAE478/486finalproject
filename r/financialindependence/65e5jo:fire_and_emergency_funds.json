Say a huge storm comes through and you need a new roof and shed and your deductible is $10,000.  Well, where are you going to get that from?  Or, your mom dies and the funeral home wants it&amp;#39;s money in two days.  You know she&amp;#39;s got life insurance and stuff, but you&amp;#39;re not going to get it that quickly.   The funeral home wants to be paid before they do the service.  And they don&amp;#39;t take credit cards.  This happened to us with my husband&amp;#39;s dad.  It was a small town and we had just built up a $10,000 emergency fund. We had to use that for the funeral and then when the life insurance came through we put it back into the fund.  I would not have wanted to sell stock for that.  There is something to be said for peace of mind of having $10-$20k on hand for &amp;#39;just in case&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dgbf4qj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331670.0, "created_utc": 1492302870.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e5jo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9jb54", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "saivode", "parent_id": "t3_65e5jo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Realistically, if I were FI, I would probably not keep a full 6 month emergency fund in a savings account somewhere.
