I sense 2 other top producers will leave right after me (at a minimum) and performance is going to greatly decline.  It's going to take 90+ days to re-build the team, everyone has so little bandwidth these days and we are in peak season.\n- How much notice should I give?  30 days?  60 days?

The sub seems like it&amp;#39;s falling apart a bit and a few people on my team have confided in me that they are seeing what&amp;#39;s going on above me and are thinking of leaving.  Leadership is very disconnected from the day-to-day realities of the work we produce.  If I step down, I worry it will only take 1-2 others in my office stepping down for the entire office to crumble.  I have three questions for anyone having experienced a similar situation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is there anyway to have a &amp;quot;come to jesus&amp;quot; talk with my leadership team about fixing the role?  There&amp;#39;s a part of me that says &amp;quot;What do you have to lose?  Put it all on the line; you&amp;#39;re walking away anyways.&amp;quot;  But a friend has told me this strategy rarely works out and my best bet would be to walk away quietly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Any idea what will happen when I step down?  I sense 2 other top producers will leave right after me (at a minimum) and performance is going to greatly decline.  It&amp;#39;s going to take 90+ days to re-build the team, everyone has so little bandwidth these days and we are in peak season.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How much notice should I give?  30 days?  60 days?  This is my first time being in a senior leadership position.  Not sure if there is an unspoken etiquette?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dge01jd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487030.0, "created_utc": 1492458230.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uwef", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uwef", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t34z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uwef", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge2bhu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Donpabloescobar", "parent_id": "t1_dgdze2o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; start small, and fail fast.\n\nWhat do you mean by 'fail fast'?

Since then, I have opened 11 cards and my husband has opened 9. I have also opened 3 bank accounts (for cash bonuses).So far we have only closed 2 cards, but we&amp;#39;re due to close a bunch this year to avoid paying the annual fees. Our credit scores fluctuate a bit month to month, depending on utilization and new accounts opened, but have been 740-780. (It&amp;#39;s different everywhere I check it.) My husband started out with a low 600s score so his has really improved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really overwhelming to get started. Since you&amp;#39;re posting in this subreddit, I presume you have a good handle on your finances, but it goes without being said that you have to be able to pay your balances in full every month. You also need to have a good idea of your monthly spending, because that will affect what sign-up bonuses you can meet easily. And tracking everything can be a little hairy (I have SO MANY accounts in YNAB, ha).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PM me if you have more questions, I&amp;#39;m happy to help. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "financialindependence", "name": "t1_dgebenb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492500799.0, "created_utc": 1492471999.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeaqqn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "monsteez", "parent_id": "t1_dgdyq7y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/financialindependence", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ultimately, how long have you been churning?
