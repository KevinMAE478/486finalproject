Just notice how groups who are under fire for supporting/enabling bad behavior tend to defend the guilty parties because they don't want to lose the argument.

They LOVE to be seen as awkward underdogs or 'freedom fighters' or even just to be among those who also feel that way because it's more likely those people will come to their defense and dismiss evidence of wrongdoing, especially as creeps tend to muddy the water and mince words once they get caught to make their victims seem less credible. I don't know what being part of the 'gaming community' entails, but I do know from personal experience that there is a lot of blind trust and good faith between people who are more or less total strangers in online communities I've been in and many times bad behavior will be tolerated or even defended thanks to the tribalism and mob mentality that people who have imagined closeness feel towards each other, much like creeps feel like someone they just met online is entitled to treat them like close friends/owe them something. It's not always intentional, but bad social skills feed and fuel others who have bad social skills. I will say, however, that it's not limited to the internet, this stuff happens in all sorts of other communities, families, clubs, etc. Job site harassment is another fine example of people who might not know each other very well or communicate that often and completely miss the creeps preying on their coworkers due to apathy or sympathy for the creeps who weasel around and call their victims 'overly sensitive' and say they were 'just joking around'.\n\nAbout a year ago, there was a new coworker who I sympathized with at the time. He had a degenerative disease and slight speech impediment and he had a lot of trouble at work and was really socially awkward. I had seen him around town, almost always by himself in his car working odd jobs and I sort of assumed that he was struggling in life and just needed people to be more supportive of him so I tried to be very friendly despite the fact that I literally didn't even know the dude's name or anything about him.\n\nFlash forward to a few months of him working at store: Turns out he somehow got ahold of one of the female managers social media account to collect 'private messages and pictures' sent between her and her fiance and may or may not have tried to blackmail her.\n\nLong story short his little escapade didn't go unnoticed by management and he was promptly removed to all of our relief. I'd like to say this was a great example but in reality we have had other creeps who were actually admired by higher management who rarely had to work with them or see them that often. The kind of people whose slights were ignored or dismissed up until legal action was taken and they got caught with their pants around their ankles and nobody could defend them anymore, sometimes not even for the reasons they should have been caught, sorta like Al Capone got caught for tax evasion and not all the other awful things he did.\n\nI think the big issue that people miss is that internet creeps aren't worse than creeps on the streets, they're merely a different variety of awful, they're harder to hold accountable for their actions and tend to get a lot more slack from people who work with them.
