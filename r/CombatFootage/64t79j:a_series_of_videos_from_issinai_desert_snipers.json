I have observed it in the case of the Pakistani army as well, where during the beginning of the insurgeny in FATA (near Afghan border) our soldiers were taking heavy losses and didn't have a proper strategy or tactics to fight the opponent, but they have really improved over the last decade. \n\nEven the Frontier corps paramilitary which is responsible for guarding the Afghan border, went from [this in 2008](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/pakistan-waziristan-militia-men-of-the-frontier-corps-fighting-in-picture-id548183903) to this [in 2016](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/pakistani-border-security-force-special-operation-group-take-part-in-picture-id624330424). They even operate their own tanks and armoured vehicles now.
