The special forces guys embedded with the Iraqi Commandoes are US Army Special Forces (Green Berets), not Navy SEALs.\nIn June, 2004 the U.S. gave sovereignty back to Iraq. The city of Samarra said that they didn't want Americans in the city any more. AIF flocked to Samarra and slowly took it over (as well as other cities like Najaf and Fallujah). In late September, a police station was blown up. The next day, no Iraqi Police showed up for work anywhere in the city. The day after that, the city fell. On 01OCT04, the Iraqi Prime Minister authorized the Americans to assist the Iraqi Army to take back the city. The task fell to the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division.
