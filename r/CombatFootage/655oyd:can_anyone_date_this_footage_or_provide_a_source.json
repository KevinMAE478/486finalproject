I was thinking of WWII paratroopers and The Invasion of Normandy in particular, which would be relevent to the video clip.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mission Boston - Some D-Day drops were very successful, but more than a few were chaotic and even disasterous.  Some of Mission Boston&amp;#39;s jumpers &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Boston\"&gt;descended into swamps,&lt;/a&gt; killing &amp;quot;a few&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;scores&amp;quot; of paratroopers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rommel%27s_asparagus\"&gt;would drown.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not everyone was so fortunate as Fitzgerald. More than one entire stick, or planeload, of paratroopers was dropped into the Channel &lt;a href=\"http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-101st-airborne-division-participate-in-operation-overlord.htm\"&gt;and drowned.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CombatFootage", "name": "t1_dg9n6zh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492228009.0, "created_utc": 1492199209.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8pxf1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nicko_89", "parent_id": "t1_dg7sddh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CombatFootage", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can't speak for this particular scenario but certainly these days and particularly while the T-10 was in service water jumps were far more preferable to land jumps, its much easier to not drown then it is to not break bones and hitting water hurts a lot less.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t speak for this particular scenario but certainly these days and particularly while the T-10 was in service water jumps were far more preferable to land jumps, its much easier to not drown then it is to not break bones and hitting water hurts a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CombatFootage", "name": "t1_dg8pxf1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492170653.0, "created_utc": 1492141853.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sddh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Syfte_", "parent_id": "t3_655oyd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CombatFootage", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know if it's training, but I'm fairly confident that parachuting into water with a full kit is an excellent way to drown.
