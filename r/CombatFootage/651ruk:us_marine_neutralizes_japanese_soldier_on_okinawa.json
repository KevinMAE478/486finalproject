A Kamikaze was a pilot specifically trained and ordered to fly his plane (often specifically loaded with explosives or fuel) into an enemy ship or installation.  The official Kamikaze doctrine Was not undertaken until Oct 1944, though several suicide dives had been made before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One such incident did occur at Pearl Harbor, \n&amp;quot; One example of this occurred on 7 December 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor. First Lieutenant Fusata Iida&amp;#39;s plane had taken a hit and had started leaking fuel when he apparently used it to make a suicide attack on Naval Air Station Kaneohe. Before taking off, he had told his men that if his plane were to become badly damaged he would crash it into a &amp;quot;worthy enemy target&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is a suicidal crash by a single disabled aircraft and pilot who did not wish to be captured. Such incidents are not isolated to the Japanese or to the Pacific Theater.  However, this is not a Kamikaze in the correct use of the word, and it&amp;#39;s certainly not MULTIPLE Kamikazes, as you seemed to be asserting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CombatFootage", "name": "t1_dg93pd5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492204032.0, "created_utc": 1492175232.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8do6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "twiyg01", "parent_id": "t1_dg8daed", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CombatFootage", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; It's as valid as any other source.
