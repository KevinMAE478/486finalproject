Almost all of our senses are inward-facing, to tell us how our body's doing and what it's up to. \n\nOne such sense is called **gustation**, and it's essentially the sense that tells our body all about the digestive system's current fill-level. The digestive system is [so complex we literally have an entire secondary nervous system just to run it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system), and so senses like \"how full am I\" are actually absurdly complex, detailing not just what absolute amount of food you have in your guts but also what it's made of, its consistency, its solute levels, whether or not it contains toxins or bacteria, how quickly it's spoiling, etc. \n\nNow, whether or not these get tripped is dependent on a stupidly-huge array of factors, and it's actually not as simple as just fill-level because the body doesn't really have any method that could give you fill-levels.

It's definitely got a strong genetic component, although it's likely related strongly with lifestyle too as certain foods will dull gustation and satiation, and of course a limited diet low in micronutrients will cause the body to constantly crave them and tell you to keep eating so it can extract the nutrients it needs from the low-quality food available. If you feed someone a diet that's artificially depleted of phosphorous but not of calories, they'll eat many more calories than they need to and all they'll be able to say as to why is \"I felt like it\" or \"I was hungry\". The body isn't able to say WHAT it's missing, outside of certain specific micronutrients (sodium is one) and so instead it just says \"KEEP EATING WE NEED THIS SHIT\". \n\nAdd onto that the fact that it's reeaaally fuckin addictive, like, imagine if heroin was something that society encouraged you to do and was also available in every single fucking shop for really cheap.

Don&amp;#39;t let it happen to you, seriously - you have time after school.  Join a school sport, ask if you can lift and exercise with one of the teams if that&amp;#39;ll keep you motivated.  See if you can join ROTC.  I promise, promise promise you&amp;#39;ll thank yourself in later years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6pcnq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492066134.0, "created_utc": 1492037334.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 182}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6qr3v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crunklos", "parent_id": "t1_dg5we9p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Perspective ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perspective &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6qr3v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492067887.0, "created_utc": 1492039087.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5we9p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 172, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Meizuba", "parent_id": "t1_dg5fsln", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good on you.

Put your fork down and drink water between each bite- it will slow you down so your body has a chance to get the &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m full&amp;quot; hormones to your brain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re still hungry, have chopped up veggies and fruit in your fridge to snack on: the water content and fiber will fill you up. If you don&amp;#39;t want the fruits or veggies and want chips or processed foods it probably means you&amp;#39;re not actually hungry- go distract your mind with whatever you enjoy doing and the &amp;quot;hunger&amp;quot; should pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope these help- if you ever have any questions or need advice feel free to PM me, I&amp;#39;d be more than happy to help! You&amp;#39;re young and there&amp;#39;s always time to change your habits and set your future self up for a great life :)  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6rf9a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068705.0, "created_utc": 1492039905.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fsln", "gilded": 6, "archived": false, "score": 42385, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shiftgood", "parent_id": "t3_64vjwg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I gotta be honest here.

There are a lot of \"fat/ugly/dude\" insults here, and they do not dictate your worth. You have inherent value, just as much as the prettiest person you see. You're no doubt bright, you have your own interests, thoughts and personality. When you invite a roast, it should be in good fun. Commenters show their own worth, not yours. \n\nWhoever your guardian/s are, they are failing you utterly. I'm fucking mad at them, to be honest. I know most teenagers think their parents don't know what's best for them, but it's clear that yours do not. You no doubt know that it's not normal for adults to ignore their children's health, emotions and needs until their child has endangered themselves. \n\nAt your age, your health is a symptom of your home environment.  You are not broken or permanently stuck. You have been trained to fill your life with food where necessities such as mental, physical, emotional connections are neglected. Some parents give their kids a snack and screen to keep them busy when they are unable for whatever reason to do something active with them. Once you start filling your time with things that interest you, you will not even have time to be preoccupied with food.\n\nYou are as young as you will ever be. At 13, 16, 19, 25 none of us could accurately imagine being different in a few years time. If you start this minute telling yourself to eat something healthier, take a short walk during a depressing night, walk the stairs a few times every day, talk to someone new and learn something new -and actually getting up and doing it instead of later- you can be thinking, feeling and living much better. \n\nYou deserve to be healthy, happy and yourself. You deserve friends and role models who care about *your* emotional, physical and mental needs. Cutting people out of your life can be difficult, as can bringing new people in when you are feeling unworthy of even your own positive attention. It is absolutely worth it. When you get rid of selfish people who do not care about your needs as much as their own, the relief is unbelievable. You are responsible only for your own behaviour. Do not ever feel obligated to keep people who do not improve you.\n\nThis will be your past no matter what you choose to do. This will be your future if you choose to keep procrastinating. In two years you will legally be an adult. If your home situation is making you hate life, work toward being an adult you can respect. You have two years to build friendships, support systems, skills and goals that will leave you free to be what you want, then the rest of your life. You can leave this version of yourself behind if you want.\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey honeylove, I have a girl your age.

If you start this minute telling yourself to eat something healthier, take a short walk during a depressing night, walk the stairs a few times every day, talk to someone new and learn something new -and actually getting up and doing it instead of later- you can be thinking, feeling and living much better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You deserve to be healthy, happy and yourself. You deserve friends and role models who care about &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; emotional, physical and mental needs. Cutting people out of your life can be difficult, as can bringing new people in when you are feeling unworthy of even your own positive attention. It is absolutely worth it. When you get rid of selfish people who do not care about your needs as much as their own, the relief is unbelievable. You are responsible only for your own behaviour. Do not ever feel obligated to keep people who do not improve you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will be your past no matter what you choose to do. This will be your future if you choose to keep procrastinating. In two years you will legally be an adult. If your home situation is making you hate life, work toward being an adult you can respect. You have two years to build friendships, support systems, skills and goals that will leave you free to be what you want, then the rest of your life. You can leave this version of yourself behind if you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6xeax", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492076007.0, "created_utc": 1492047207.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 374}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6of9p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 185, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dunderball", "parent_id": "t1_dg6n0yp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Holy shit lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy shit lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6of9p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065001.0, "created_utc": 1492036201.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 185}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6op2z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 93, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lyricyst2000", "parent_id": "t1_dg6n0yp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jesus Christ.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6op2z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065339.0, "created_utc": 1492036539.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 93}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6phcw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 60, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SoSaltyDoe", "parent_id": "t1_dg6n0yp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh my fucking god dude", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my fucking god dude&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6phcw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492066295.0, "created_utc": 1492037495.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 60}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6n0yp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1085, "report_reasons": null, "author": "area88guy", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lgbq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No one's gonna sugar coat it for you, because you'll probably eat that too.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one&amp;#39;s gonna sugar coat it for you, because you&amp;#39;ll probably eat that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RoastMe", "name": "t1_dg6n0yp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492063247.0, "created_utc": 1492034447.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1085}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjwg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6mbkm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 165, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pickle_bug77", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lgbq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RoastMe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fuck em, show em what you can do.\n\nProve them all wrong.
