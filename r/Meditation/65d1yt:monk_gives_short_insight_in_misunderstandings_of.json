"Alright, sorry for my earlier non-response.  I finally have time to write this out.  The difference I finally understood was in nature of dealing with accepting.  To explain this I'll appear to go on a tangent but I'll bring it back home on the end.  \n\nOver the course of the week long retreat Yongey Mingyur rinpoche gave two main teachings a day. You'll have to forgive the simplicity of description to each of these, it's hard to distill an hour or hour and a half lecture and guided practice into a sentence or two for lectures.  \n\nThe first was on open awareness.  He described this as letting everything be rather like you've gone out for a hard run and are resting at the end.  You are aware of things but attach attention to none.  I had been practicing mindfulness for over a decade so had an established practice of letting myself be with whatever came up and assumed this is what he meant.  \n\nThe next five lectures were on meditative focuses.  He began with the tactile, and of that the breath.  Whenever the mind strays you just bring it back to the focus.  A very traditional and functional technique.  He expanded this to other tactile sensations, your butt in the chair, the pants on your legs, the warming summer air.  Any tactile sensation can be a focus for meditation.  \n\nThe next was visual, where we meditated on a rose. To some that is the simple and vibrant red, others might have words attached, yet more an almost tactile evocation from simply the sight.  The clouds in the sky, the grass on the ground, or the shirt on the guy sitting in front of you on the bus, all equally valid visual foci.  When the mind strays simply bring it back.  \n\nSound of course, again a traditional focus. He began with a singing bowl.  As equal to that, the hum if florescent lights, the breath of the person meditating next to you or the din of a highway next door.  Many things a meditatator might find distracting can instead become a focus.  When the attention drifts simply bring it back and let it be.  \n\nAfter this taste and smell.  He encouraged us to meditate over lunch chewing each bite fully and savoring the taste and smell.  Again, smells which might distract can instead become a focus making his techniques flexible under conditions many might not find conducive to meditation.  \n\nHe did not devote an entire lecture to the sense of space, but it did play in a number of guided meditations and would be an equally valid focus, weather the space in the room, of your room in the town, town on the planet or planet in the whole.  \n\nAfter this we leave the senses thoughts and emotions can become a focus too.  One must be a bit more wary with these, he described it as sitting on the banks and watching them flow by rather than being caught in the stream.  The senses bring you to now when these can be of the past or future.  One can lead to another and another and soon awareness has left and you are lost in thought.  But if not that, then it can be useful to note them, let them be, and let them go.  On occasion one is sticky, coming time and again.  Rather than let it run wild notice the cues that bring it up.  Let those be and let those go.  \n\nNext, and I loved his wording on this, was getting lost meditation.  Meditation in his vocabulary was simply awareness.  It is simple for a moment but the longer it goes the harder to sustain.  Getting lost meditation is when you are meditating, get lost in thought, and notice this.  The moment you notice you are meditating again.  There is no need to chastise yourself for this, he claimed it one of his favorite styles.  Each time you bring your attention back it's like an arm curl for the mind.  The more you do the stronger your mental muscle becomes and the less it drifts while meditating.  Further the more you do this on the cushion the more you can bring this practice into daily life.  \n\nNow we're nearing the end, and this one I forget the name he gave but it was essentially whatever comes up.  Whatever sensation you notice, whatever thought it emotion, getting lost meditation, any of these becomes a momentary focus and in between these you drift back into open awareness.  It was at this point I began to understand open awareness.  I thought he meant this last technique when he first used that term.  He did not.  There is an attention paid with this but in open awareness, while you are aware there is no attention.  \n\nSo to sum up my overly long point it really depends on what you mean by accepting whatever comes up.  There is an active and a passive sense.  Open awareness is the *entirely passive* type.  It is a more gentle and light hold on awareness that extends non attachment or non grasping to a much more significant degree.  It is like having gone for a very long run and being exhausted but aware at the end, not attaching your attention to anything, simply letting it be.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, sorry for my earlier non-response.
