Thus, the mind needs something beyond the realms of typical understanding and the mystical feeling associated with believing in the energy field is entertaining to the mind. People latch on to their belief systems and ride it like their life depends on it. Too much knowledge leads to ignorance, rather than wisdom, if not tempered with honest true experience.

It takes years of cultivating Chi, meditating, and practicing martial arts (for martial applications) to be able to utilize Chi in such a manner. \n\nWith enough practice some can attain high levels of understanding and control of Chi to perform even greater, seemingly miraculous, feats. \n\nI use the example if you train someone from a very young age to be an olympic athlete, and they have the skill/potential, they can do some amazing shit like gymnasts who can flip through the air, rings, etc. If someone were to train equally hard at meditation, martial arts, and developing concentration/awarness/control of their mind/body/energy they could perform some crazy shit that most people can't.  \n\nThere are plenty of accounts of people through ancient history to modern times that talk of such phenomena. \n\nAnd like talented athletes, some people are naturally gifted and excel at manipulating/feeling Chi in their bodies, and some are worse. With practice,  no matter your natural ability,  you can get better to a certain point.\n\nSo basically the author is changing the definition of Chi because he can't do it. I can't do a lot of things but that doesn't make me say they don't exist. \"I can't do a triple backflip so it's impossible.\" Get over yourself.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling energy radiate through your body and drawing it in - Cultivation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Increased power in strikes.
