This time, I really focused on my breathing, I kept my back straight and within minutes I was in a far deeper state of relaxation than i thought possible. I felt like I was in control of my mind.

I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about anything except things that make me happy (loved ones, my pets, my friends, my car, my hobbies, etc.). This time, when I thought about them they were just images. My thoughts didn&amp;#39;t speak like they usually do. I was at peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have heard it is supposed to be an out of body experience.

It&amp;#39;s not the easiest thing in the world to get used to. I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ll be able to achieve that state for another week.
