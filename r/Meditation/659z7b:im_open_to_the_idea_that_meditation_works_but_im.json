Equally unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you want &lt;a href=\"/r/fitness\"&gt;/r/fitness&lt;/a&gt; to laugh at you? Then tell them that you are looking for just the right audio guide to your training program, which outlines the benefits of each exercise for you at just the right time. Unless you have that, and you have your doubts about physical training lessened, you can not possibly start training, and it will probably not work anyway...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get reliable instructions. Maybe visit a trainer to learn the basics first hand. You are set. You can train now, and you can do that for the rest of your life. When you are looking for &lt;em&gt;just the right&lt;/em&gt; audio guide to the bench press, because you &lt;em&gt;need that&lt;/em&gt; before you can start, then you have officially won the self-bullshit award of the year... Neither does that point of view seem helpful, nor does it convey the attitude of someone who is ready to take training seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I would be saying, were we talking about fitness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we are not talking about fitness, I would recommend you go to our beautiful FAQ over there in the sidebar, get some instructions, and sit down as instructed once you have 20 minutes of free time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you have done that, you can mull over what sitting down and doing nothing is like, and you can think about what it does to you. And you can then do some research. You can do some thinking about what exactly it is you want out of your meditative practice, and what kind of method might be a good fit to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in doubt about anything, you can ask here. Or you can ask yourself what &lt;a href=\"/r/fitness\"&gt;/r/fitness&lt;/a&gt; would tell you, if you asked the same question about the bench press. The answers often might tend to be quite similar (though the amount of meditation bro-science is significantly higher).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Meditation", "name": "t1_dg95vez", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207353.0, "created_utc": 1492178553.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659z7b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659z7b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagj87", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trendographics", "parent_id": "t1_dg9xoap", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Meditation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for your explanation, it's a little bit eye-opening as you explain it quite well!
