Sometimes, many times I guess, I get taken in by thoughts because they seem SOOOO important. Like I have to complete a scenario, or solve and issue in my head or replay an event over and over (example; Like defending myself in a situation, but the other person being nasty to me...its fucking weird idk). I do notice when I cut off the thought immediately before it takes hold, I CAN let it go, its almost easy, If I cut it at the bud. You guys are awesome btw, this was suggested many times here on this subreddit. Now that I have been meditating daily and practicing awareness through out the day, I have noticed sometimes I get this almost perverse satisfaction out of the suffering the rumination causes me. Maybe because I have been doing this so long to myself it is comforting in a way, like victimizing myself makes me feel justified in my depression and in turn justifies the choices I make because of that anxiety/depression, the choices I hate that I make. Wow, I cant believe I just said that...Anyway, it is like a CHOICE, a very subtle habitual choice to get dragged down by these thoughts and emotions, to get sucked under the waves by them.  These depressed states used to last all day or even weeks, now that I have been meditating though, It only last a little while, a few minutes or hours, and when I come out of it (its like a wave), I&amp;#39;m like, omg, no way, I don&amp;#39;t want to feel that way again, I have to stay in this awareness. It&amp;#39;s like i&amp;#39;m seeing these polar opposites clear as day now. The thing is now I&amp;#39;m beating myself up when I can&amp;#39;t keep it up, staying present and instead i&amp;#39;m in my thoughts (past or future). The last 2 days have been rough and more ups and downs. I don&amp;#39;t know what i&amp;#39;m looking for, I feel stuck sometimes like I should be better (not getting caught up by thoughts), although I know mentally its not gonna be like that.
