Especially if you choose to think positively in place of the anxiety, even &amp;quot;fake it till you make it&amp;quot; helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the best&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Meditation", "name": "t1_dgdp7fy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474911.0, "created_utc": 1492446111.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhjz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhjz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhjz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhjz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnc9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhjz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge5uq6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "involuntaryintel", "parent_id": "t1_dgdzn0q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Meditation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "do not become a monk.
