When a short breath is inhaled, he knows that he inhales a short in-breath.\n\n(III) While exhaling, he tries to experience the entire out-breath\u2014its beginning, middle, and end. While inhaling, he tries to experience the entire in-breath\u2014its beginning, middle, and end.\n\n(IV) As he exhales, he tries to allay and calm down the out-breath.
