For long periods of time throughout my childhood. I thrived for a missing force in my life. I tried plenty of religions, Anti depressants, drugs, alcohol,   just plain nonsense. Also as I child i had an innate feel for nature, conscious, and ive had many meditative experiences throughout my life. Im only starting to figure out a little about universe. But i feel i am learning truth. In my opinion, from my meditation I have subsided feelings of anxiety.

So I did research into the practice the mindset behind. What meditation actually is. What amazing men had done to teach the world not of religion but of true spirituality. For the longest time I thought this stuff was a joke. As Im coming to understand, western beliefs are quite black and white. Quick to dismiss what is not culturally appropriate.

I have cried in meditation whilst feeling no emotion just peace, ive had a few visions, and had a really intense experience with one of my cats. I finished my meditation and I looked into her eyes.

I find every time I delve into myself im more excited to do it the next day. And the more I learn. This is it for my rant but I felt a wish to relay my experience.
