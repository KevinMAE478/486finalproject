I've watched a few Culadasa videos on YouTube (including this one which I was watching when you sent the above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnlYW_4FMqs) and he is a really cool guy. His views expressed in that video such as the nature of the \"consciousness field\" and how one tunes into past lives via a kind of resonance, and also how many siddhis are explained, are mirror images of conclusions I arrived at just from my own practice (which was mostly self-guided).\n\nI'm reading him now to learn his views on Awakening and how to get there. However it is mainly to improve my samatha practice and get to more refined mindstates. I am a \"natural meditator\" in that I was inclined towards and skilled in concentration from the outset, and experienced jhana early on without knowing what it was or having it as a goal. It seems that there are quite a few natural meditators like me (LuminousBliss on my blog having virtually the exact same back story and technique as me). These little techs I'm putting out there are attempts to reverse-engineer the processes I do as a \"natural meditator\". However this easy ability to gain piti (seemingly plucking it from mid air) has led to a rather lazy and slapdash practice which is why I don't have much to say about the higher stages of concentration. This is one thing I am now more diligently working on and TMI will be my guide for the next year on that.\n\n\"If you have any other comments about things that might be KEY to reaching the absorption states, fire away!\"\n\nI think my main key idea is the role of intention in your practice. So, here are two forms of intention to consider. The first is that you must get on board with the idea that these highly absorbed, often amazing and mind-blowing states are possible and can be \"tuned into\", and that doing so can be quick and relatively painless at times. You have to kind of make an assumption that your mind will find its way into these states.\n\nYou can slip expectations in through the back door that these states are waiting for you and you can just let your mind fall into them. One way I do this is that I fully assume my mind came pre-made with \"autopilot programs\" for entering these states. I have always had this assumption that my mind can find its way into any state if I let it do its thing, and it always has, from OOBE to lucid dreaming to jhanas and all sorts of other custom states. Before I started reading formal materials and guides about how to get into jhana I mainly said to my mind, \"Okay, do your autopilot thing. Make it happen\", and it would be like it would start taking me through a tunnel into these amazing states. My breathing would start doing some autopilot thing and I would feel myself letting go into that. It was only when I found formal materials that I started looking at that process more with the goal of getting further.\n\nSo I do recommend fully assuming these states are something your mind can do, that it can take you there, and to have full faith in your mind and its capabilities, and get on board that jhana and other custom states might be just around the corner. This intention is really powerful.\n\nThe second intention to cultivate is that, if you want to experience the classical hard jhana progression with full-blown piti and sukkha, you have to decide to be really dedicated to that goal BEFORE the session. There's nothing wrong with setting an intention to experience some piti and develop your concentration a bit, before a session, and if you're just doing a kind of \"on the fly\" session where you meditate because you feel like it or you have some time to kill then that's a valid intention to set. But if you want jhana, you have to really be fully dedicated to getting that BEFORE the session. \"This is it, I'm going to go all the way in this session.\" Then sit there and practise your way into jhana. If you don't feel that firm conviction then your intention is more likely to be along the lines of, \"I'm going to sit here and practise and see what happens\", and your results will be sketchier in reflection of that (you might get jhana; you might not, but your concentration will probably improve regardless). At the same time there is nothing wrong with being convicted and really going for it but failing; this happens often too. But, in general, the strength of your intention to experience X, Y or Z will strongly shape the outcome of the meditation. That's just my experience.\n\nSo, set strong intentions before the practice.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just started reading TMI as many people on my blog are students of it (it&amp;#39;s really popular right now) so I thought I&amp;#39;d better catch up with it. I&amp;#39;ve watched a few Culadasa videos on YouTube (including this one which I was watching when you sent the above: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnlYW_4FMqs\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnlYW_4FMqs&lt;/a&gt;) and he is a really cool guy. His views expressed in that video such as the nature of the &amp;quot;consciousness field&amp;quot; and how one tunes into past lives via a kind of resonance, and also how many siddhis are explained, are mirror images of conclusions I arrived at just from my own practice (which was mostly self-guided).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reading him now to learn his views on Awakening and how to get there. However it is mainly to improve my samatha practice and get to more refined mindstates. I am a &amp;quot;natural meditator&amp;quot; in that I was inclined towards and skilled in concentration from the outset, and experienced jhana early on without knowing what it was or having it as a goal. It seems that there are quite a few natural meditators like me (LuminousBliss on my blog having virtually the exact same back story and technique as me). These little techs I&amp;#39;m putting out there are attempts to reverse-engineer the processes I do as a &amp;quot;natural meditator&amp;quot;. However this easy ability to gain piti (seemingly plucking it from mid air) has led to a rather lazy and slapdash practice which is why I don&amp;#39;t have much to say about the higher stages of concentration. This is one thing I am now more diligently working on and TMI will be my guide for the next year on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you have any other comments about things that might be KEY to reaching the absorption states, fire away!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think my main key idea is the role of intention in your practice. So, here are two forms of intention to consider. The first is that you must get on board with the idea that these highly absorbed, often amazing and mind-blowing states are possible and can be &amp;quot;tuned into&amp;quot;, and that doing so can be quick and relatively painless at times. You have to kind of make an assumption that your mind will find its way into these states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can slip expectations in through the back door that these states are waiting for you and you can just let your mind fall into them. One way I do this is that I fully assume my mind came pre-made with &amp;quot;autopilot programs&amp;quot; for entering these states. I have always had this assumption that my mind can find its way into any state if I let it do its thing, and it always has, from OOBE to lucid dreaming to jhanas and all sorts of other custom states. Before I started reading formal materials and guides about how to get into jhana I mainly said to my mind, &amp;quot;Okay, do your autopilot thing. Make it happen&amp;quot;, and it would be like it would start taking me through a tunnel into these amazing states. My breathing would start doing some autopilot thing and I would feel myself letting go into that. It was only when I found formal materials that I started looking at that process more with the goal of getting further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I do recommend fully assuming these states are something your mind can do, that it can take you there, and to have full faith in your mind and its capabilities, and get on board that jhana and other custom states might be just around the corner. This intention is really powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second intention to cultivate is that, if you want to experience the classical hard jhana progression with full-blown piti and sukkha, you have to decide to be really dedicated to that goal BEFORE the session. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with setting an intention to experience some piti and develop your concentration a bit, before a session, and if you&amp;#39;re just doing a kind of &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; session where you meditate because you feel like it or you have some time to kill then that&amp;#39;s a valid intention to set.
