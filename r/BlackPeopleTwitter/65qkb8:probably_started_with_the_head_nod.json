Here is a random anecdote \n\n\"They tend to think the worst of black people. I lived there so I know. Despite a few good experiences, I couldn't stand the ignorance and silent hostility of the locals and left for elsewhere! Being a black man there often means people treat you like a potential criminal whoever you go. People won't sit next to you on even crowded public transport, people sneer at you, mumble words like \"kimochiwarui\" (gross) at you, and try to avoid you at all costs, unless absolutely necessary. The reason is this: Japanese people via their cropped and exclusive media, go by what to us are outdated racial stereotypes of every race but the Japanese, as well as new ones (however humorous or satirical their modern Western media origins tend to be (for example family guy or a sitcom), the concept of satire or hinikui doesn't really exist in Japan outside of a few instances, and so things are sponged in without question or humour as full truths). All this means that people of African-descent are seen as anything from criminally inclined and sporty, to poor, uncivilised, uneducated, animal or ape-like, tribalistic and sexually over active. While Japanese music and youth culture tends to be more balanced and even positive about black people (sometimes, and that's limited to Beyonc\u00e9, Jero (a black Emma singer) and the late Michael Jackson.. Post melanin disorder), racist views of blacks are still reflected in Japanese mainstream media. One of the only black celebrities in Japan (outside of the very few you will encounter in the music scene) is former MMA fighter Bobby Ologun, who deliberately uses a \"coon\" style in speaking, acting and performing to gain laughs from various variety panel shows common in the country. The problem is most times the locals are laughing at him as being a specimen of what they believe to be every African, rather than someone using a gimmick for comedic effect. He had married a Japanese woman and they have 2 children, who were born and raised in Japan and only know Japanese as their mother tongue, but they have been being lumped in with their buffoonish father as sideshows to the Ologun minstrel like dynasty as future \"black comedians\". Absolutely sickening.. Glad to say I'm out of Japan and back in the black friendly multicultural world.. My experiences have armed me to know what people from a country like that would actually think about blacks, and as a result I steer clear of them..
