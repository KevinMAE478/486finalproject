I.e. you stole this family&amp;#39;s chicken so now you will be their slave for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose it is possible that before shipping off, some slaves would be like &amp;quot;nice, we get to be slaves of the rich people who bring us gold and weapons, I bet life will be great in 5 years when I&amp;#39;m freed!&amp;quot; But then they&amp;#39;d get on the boat where each person gets like 1 cubic foot of space to themselves and everyone is stored lying in puddles of human waste, only to find out slavery on the other side of the ocean was permanent...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it&amp;#39;s definitely a retarded a thing to say, but it could sort of be true...in a way...for the first 5 seconds of someone&amp;#39;s slavery. I kind of doubt Ben Carson knows that much about it though, and he was probably just saying stupid things because he&amp;#39;s stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BlackPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dg64ade", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043531.0, "created_utc": 1492014731.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33x33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y1ny", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33x33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y1ny", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33x33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y1ny", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ydcf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Crash0997", "parent_id": "t1_dg6b2kt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BlackPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He didn't specify past or present tense.\nUsing \"still a brilliant doctor\" could either mean\n\n\n\"Still is a brilliant doctor\" or \"Still was a brilliant doctor\"\n\n\nBoth meanings work, and both makes sense.\nNothing wrong with what he said. :)  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t specify past or present tense.\nUsing &amp;quot;still a brilliant doctor&amp;quot; could either mean&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Still is a brilliant doctor&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Still was a brilliant doctor&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both meanings work, and both makes sense.\nNothing wrong with what he said. :)  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BlackPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dg6ydcf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077212.0, "created_utc": 1492048412.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33x33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y1ny", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6p2vx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "That_Othr_Guy", "parent_id": "t1_dg6b2kt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BlackPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's like riding a bike, you don't soon forget", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like riding a bike, you don&amp;#39;t soon forget&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BlackPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dg6p2vx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065803.0, "created_utc": 1492037003.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6b2kt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoReligionPlz", "parent_id": "t1_dg67vpo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BlackPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;  Still\n\nWell he's retired and hasn't practiced in years, so not sure how brilliant he still is at doctoring...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well he&amp;#39;s retired and hasn&amp;#39;t practiced in years, so not sure how brilliant he still is at doctoring...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BlackPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dg6b2kt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492050442.0, "created_utc": 1492021642.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg67vpo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DownvoteDaemon", "parent_id": "t1_dg62o9j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BlackPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Smartest dumbest guy ever.
