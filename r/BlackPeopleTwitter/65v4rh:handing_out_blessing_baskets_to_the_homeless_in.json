You're relying on the kindness of strangets to see past the filth and their own pity, to give you a job or allow you to rent a room. People in general aren't known for giving the  homeless the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThink about it. What happens when you lose your home and have no money and no support system? You're starving so maybe you panhandle on the first or second day. Maybe you get enough money panhandling for a motel room, so you shower and get a good night's rest and feel hopeful about getting your life back on track. You start looking for a job the next day but you need to eat, and the only way to do that is to panhandle some more. You make enough for a sandwich but not for the motel room, so that night you're out on the street again, hungry again, panhandling more. The cycle continues, a constant state of trying to feed yourself, find a safe place to sleep and protect yourself from other street people. There is a ton of effort involved in being homeless, effort which could've been used to look for work or better your prospects in other ways. Eventually you've been on the street struggling for months, then years, and you've suffered so many setbacks that your spirit is utterly broken. Your cell phone was turned off long ago so if you even tried to apply for a job there's no way for them to get in touch with you. You're constantly tired, hungry, and depressed as hell. You've stopped renting motel rooms because you've learned its a waste of precious money - food is a higher priority than shelter at this point - so you haven't showered or slept more than a couple hours at a time in years. \n\nIt takes incredible strength, perseverance and probably some luck to lift yourself out of that situation. As much as we'd all like to believe we could do it, there's a very good chance you'd find yourself stuck too, if you experienced the same set of circumstances that led these people there. To say someone can't have been \"down on his luck\" for 25 years is ignoring the utter hopelessness and incredible hurdles that need to be overcome by people in that situation in our society. ", "edited": 1492449186.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is once you start looking and smelling homeless, which only takes a couple weeks, it&amp;#39;s incredibly difficult to get out of that situation no matter how badly you want it. You&amp;#39;re relying on the kindness of strangets to see past the filth and their own pity, to give you a job or allow you to rent a room. People in general aren&amp;#39;t known for giving the  homeless the benefit of the doubt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it. What happens when you lose your home and have no money and no support system? You&amp;#39;re starving so maybe you panhandle on the first or second day. Maybe you get enough money panhandling for a motel room, so you shower and get a good night&amp;#39;s rest and feel hopeful about getting your life back on track. You start looking for a job the next day but you need to eat, and the only way to do that is to panhandle some more. You make enough for a sandwich but not for the motel room, so that night you&amp;#39;re out on the street again, hungry again, panhandling more. The cycle continues, a constant state of trying to feed yourself, find a safe place to sleep and protect yourself from other street people. There is a ton of effort involved in being homeless, effort which could&amp;#39;ve been used to look for work or better your prospects in other ways. Eventually you&amp;#39;ve been on the street struggling for months, then years, and you&amp;#39;ve suffered so many setbacks that your spirit is utterly broken. Your cell phone was turned off long ago so if you even tried to apply for a job there&amp;#39;s no way for them to get in touch with you. You&amp;#39;re constantly tired, hungry, and depressed as hell. You&amp;#39;ve stopped renting motel rooms because you&amp;#39;ve learned its a waste of precious money - food is a higher priority than shelter at this point - so you haven&amp;#39;t showered or slept more than a couple hours at a time in years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes incredible strength, perseverance and probably some luck to lift yourself out of that situation. As much as we&amp;#39;d all like to believe we could do it, there&amp;#39;s a very good chance you&amp;#39;d find yourself stuck too, if you experienced the same set of circumstances that led these people there. To say someone can&amp;#39;t have been &amp;quot;down on his luck&amp;quot; for 25 years is ignoring the utter hopelessness and incredible hurdles that need to be overcome by people in that situation in our society. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BlackPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dgdpqho", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475501.0, "created_utc": 1492446701.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33x33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v4rh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdolxj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MortalShadow", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmakt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BlackPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's often that an addiction or mental illness starts it and after a while it's nearly impossible to end it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s often that an addiction or mental illness starts it and after a while it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to end it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BlackPeopleTwitter", "name": "t1_dgdolxj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474237.0, "created_utc": 1492445437.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33x33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v4rh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnaeq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "canofpotatoes", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmakt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BlackPeopleTwitter", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We were all thinking it, 25 years of bad luck?
