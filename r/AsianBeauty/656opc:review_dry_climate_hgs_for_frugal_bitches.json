I&amp;#39;m a late adopter of popular products mainly because of money constraints, so posting reviews didn&amp;#39;t seem worthwhile, but I got a couple comments asking for reviews. So here&amp;#39;s my first one! My current morning products are a mixture of Western and AB, but I also include what seems to be equivalent AB versions of the western products I use. As always, YMMV. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin type:&lt;/strong&gt; dry, not sensitive, occasional hormonal breakouts but not acne prone, minimal PIH, NC25, olive undertone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other factors:&lt;/strong&gt; currently living in Missoula MT, which is essentially LA,  Extreme Cold Edition. Also on medication that further dries out my skin. I was also beginning to see the barest of fine lines beginning in my forehead. They were enough to bother me, but something told me I could see them more because of the sheer dryness my skin was experiencing. This turned out to be true. I&amp;#39;m still 27, but those lines in my forehead are ghosts of their former selves. So if you live somewhere really dry, and are considering expensive anti-aging measures, make sure you heal your moisture barrier before you make that sort of decision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scinic Honey AIO Ampoule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this product is $17, why is it frugal? OK, I went on this product with my MOM. I\u2019m almost 30, but this is the kind of relationship we have. It\u2019s 250ml, and the ingredient you actually want (honey) is over 90%! Lots of people are turned off by the packaging, but I decanted half the product into an old Cosrx bottle with the label taken off, and found that it played nice with the pump. If you have a dry skin buddy, I recommend going in together on purchasing this. It\u2019ll last you ages. When my moisture barrier was damaged, I had tried lots of thicker products with ceramides and lanolin, such as CeraVe and Aquaphor. But still I\u2019d end up with flaky skin, only now they were just greasy flakes all over my cheeks. I wasn\u2019t using ceramides to their greatest effect. I was using them to try to heal my face and keep moisture in, when in reality I had to be introducing &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; moisture beforehand. Scinic AIO was this first change in helping me introduce new moisture. It went on slimy, but sunk in quickly, and really held moisture to my face when combined with a hydrating toner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Lotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started using the 3 skin method with this and it was like a light bulb went on. The layers sunk in so quick, my face was eager to drink it up. I haven&amp;#39;t really come across a western equivalent to this product. It also soothed redness and got rid of flakes, and was great in combination with the Scinic Honey AIO. I loved the refills at a cheaper price. I went back and forth on whether to purchase this for a while, because there used to be some confusion as to whether HA was actually effective in extremely dry weather. I am here to tell you that YES, it is. Dry weather sisters and brothers should be using HA, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only thing. You will go through this quickly if you use it for 3-7 skins, but as your moisture barrier is repaired, it\u2019s possible you might not have to. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CeraVe in the tub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to thank the folks again who told me to add a heavy cream on top of my hydration layers. I was seeing so much improvement in my skin, but it wouldn\u2019t last the whole day. Within the next couple hours my skin would have great texture and zero flakes, but it would start to feel tight again. I had ditched ceramides because of how poorly they performed before the AB products, but as soon as I added them back as a final layer on top of the Hada Labo and Scinic Ampoule, I was able to stop doing the 3-skin method completely and just did one layer of each. Cerave doesn\u2019t look and feel as luxe as other products, but I\u2019m cheap and I like a gigantic tub to use for my entire face and body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If CeraVe is not for you, lots of people have had success with Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream (but it\u2019ll cost you $$$$!!! Dr. Jart is for BALLER$), and Benton Steam Cream (same size, less than half the price). CeraVe is the cheapest per oz by far, but I understand everyone\u2019s skin is different, and I\u2019m not particularly sensitive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elta MD UV Facial Broad Spectrum SPF 30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current go-to for winter. I admit it\u2019s because I got it for free, but it worked out so great. A friend and former roommate gave this one to me before she moved out, and I\u2019d had lots of success with UV Shield and UV Clear, so there was no way I was going to say no. The total size is 3oz for about $14 USD, which to me is a pretty good price for a facial sunscreen. It\u2019s a physical/chemical sunscreen combo that includes moisturizers and sits under makeup without pilling. As with all other sunscreens in the brand, the white cast is minimal. This leaves me with a bit of a \u201cglow,\u201d but since I\u2019m dry skinned, my face just can\u2019t wait to suck it up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s in the bullpen? Cosrx Aloe Soothing Suncream SPF 50 PA+++. I was interested in this one for the higher SPF and PA rating, and similarly mild ingredients. I\u2019m also not fully won over by Cosrx (Birch Sap did very little for me in the dead of winter), but I am a fan of the minimal and clinical packaging. It\u2019s about half the size of the Elta MD at the same price. I actually do like having smaller sunscreens because I\u2019m more likely to take them in my purse, encouraging reapplication. I\u2019ll be comparing the two as soon as I finish my UV Facial.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I posted a heartfelt thank you yesterday to AB and SCA, and expressed that I wanted to be more active.
