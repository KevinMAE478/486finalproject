Before South Korea rose to that status, there was Japan, with their long history of cosmetic power house brands like Shiseido. \n\nWhy is it like that? Mostly, it's industrialisation and the wealth of the originating countries. When you think Asian cars, you think of Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, etc. Can you name one Chinese car brand off the top of your head? You probably can't, and it's not because they don't exist. There's plenty of them. \n\nSome history: China's economy didn't really start to take off until Chairman Deng allowed and pushed for it to happen. That was in the late 80s. Before that, China was pretty closed off economically and most people were piss poor. Hell, up until the 70s, they still rationed food and other goods. Some of the biggest economic players in the East, India and China, really didn't start to gain wealth and produce their own luxury goods until fairly recently. Their industries are still catching up to the head start and leg up of Korea and Japan. And we also have to think of regulations and industry standards. Most people in China are leary of Chinese goods because of the lack of regulation and rule-breaking. Counterfeit goods (ranging from food to pharmaceuticals) are a huge issue. Hell, even street food can be fake (eg: the fake meat and gutter oil scandal that came out a few years ago). There are plenty of beauty products from China and I think in the future, more and more brands will gain wider popularity, but it's going to take time. They even produce some high end stuff now (eg: Herborist), but it's hard to break into such an established market, and that  market is already biased against you (bad reputation). \n\nAs for places like India, Thailand, Cambodia etc. Similar stories. A lot of these countries have only recently started to rapidly develop, have been/are still politically unstable. It's hard to develop a luxury industry when those aspects are holding you back.\n\n**TL:DR** Economics is decided by people with money. Korea and Japan are some of the richest countries in Asia and have a longer history of industrial development.

I can buy something just as good locally\" which is currently a mentality missing from a lot of these underrepresented countries (Some other redditors touched up on this and they said it more eloquently than I did). Another, these local products help support local businesses that are great for these countries. In mine for example (background: we're a poor agricultural country), a lot of these local products help support the livelihood of farmers who otherwise would've been eaten up by the system. Some brands even support education, housing projects, environmental awareness, women empowerment, etc which is so so so unbelievably needed in countries like mine.

Reddit is very US-centric with regards to it's users. However, it's not the only site. Tumblr is the same way for example. YouTube too. I suspect this is due to being essentially \"made in the US\" if you will. I know for a fact that there are many sites (such a NND) that are Japan-centric due to being \"made in Japan\". Think of it like this; if a website is \"made\" in your country, you'll hear about it more. It's in your primary language and easy to use. It naturally sets a barrier of entry inadvertently. Shoot, I didn't even know about NND until I got into Vocaloid since the Vocaloid videos on YouTube were being ripped form there and posted to YT for the Western fans! Even though NND now has an English version of the site so it's more accessible, the vast majority stick to YT. It's basically the same principle; ease of access. Reddit is the same way; no one is going \"You must be American to use!\" but word of mouth about Reddit will naturally be more intense among the US online circle.\n\n2. It all comes down to money to be blunt. When money talks, morals walk. Diversity in a market it a tricky thing because at the end of the day, a vast minority spend their money on products or companies that match their morals; the average Jane or Joe will care more about if they know the product, the ad was eye catching and do they want it. Markets naturally befits from product diversity because it increases competition and product quality. Korean's skincare market in Korea itself is a prime example. But outside of Korea and Japan, other country's markets are not as intently focused on that industry. Obviously in all markets there were be terrible products, average products and amazing products, but whether or not consumers care will depend on the culture. And that culture were influence the market and starts a loop, a self-feeding cycle. Abroad (or let me specify; the West because that's actually what you're meaning by abroad form what I'm understanding) there is a focus on makeup, clothes, fitness. The culture is different. Korea, being skincare-focused, saw and grassroots movement going and took it because of money. And the West, in turn, was primed for it because for years InstaGlam makeup has been the trend. Every 5 or so years people like to buck the trend and break away because they're bored. So the timing worked out super well.\n\nIt's all about money at the end of the day. Korea already had a diverse internal market in terms of companies and products and the Western market (particularly the US market) was bored of their current route. So it was a great match. Other countries aren't as invested in skincare are an economic market so they can't hold a candle. It's why we on the subreddit talk about overwhelmingly Korean products. It's not like lovely products from other countries don't exist. But the Korean products are the most easily available, have the largest range in price point, cover many skincare concerns. It's a fully matured market while skincare in let's say the US is still an infant. Plus, as mentioned, most users on this subreddit are in the US so there's the added reinforcement of the \"K Beauty\" trend making it even easier for us in particular to get products.\n\nEdit: Ah, and as to why \"Asian Beauty\" and not specifically \"Korean Beauty\"; marketing. When I mention my parents are form Bulgaria they think it's \"Russia\"! This should explain everything.... The marketing is playing of the - to be blunt - idiocy of the Average American not knowing about anything beyond the Iron Curtain. Which does include the Asian continent. Apparently someone once said to a friend of mine India is a continent. And my friend is *Indian*.

Think of it like this; if a website is &amp;quot;made&amp;quot; in your country, you&amp;#39;ll hear about it more. It&amp;#39;s in your primary language and easy to use. It naturally sets a barrier of entry inadvertently. Shoot, I didn&amp;#39;t even know about NND until I got into Vocaloid since the Vocaloid videos on YouTube were being ripped form there and posted to YT for the Western fans! Even though NND now has an English version of the site so it&amp;#39;s more accessible, the vast majority stick to YT. It&amp;#39;s basically the same principle; ease of access. Reddit is the same way; no one is going &amp;quot;You must be American to use!&amp;quot; but word of mouth about Reddit will naturally be more intense among the US online circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to money to be blunt. When money talks, morals walk. Diversity in a market it a tricky thing because at the end of the day, a vast minority spend their money on products or companies that match their morals; the average Jane or Joe will care more about if they know the product, the ad was eye catching and do they want it. Markets naturally befits from product diversity because it increases competition and product quality. Korean&amp;#39;s skincare market in Korea itself is a prime example. But outside of Korea and Japan, other country&amp;#39;s markets are not as intently focused on that industry. Obviously in all markets there were be terrible products, average products and amazing products, but whether or not consumers care will depend on the culture. And that culture were influence the market and starts a loop, a self-feeding cycle. Abroad (or let me specify; the West because that&amp;#39;s actually what you&amp;#39;re meaning by abroad form what I&amp;#39;m understanding) there is a focus on makeup, clothes, fitness. The culture is different. Korea, being skincare-focused, saw and grassroots movement going and took it because of money. And the West, in turn, was primed for it because for years InstaGlam makeup has been the trend. Every 5 or so years people like to buck the trend and break away because they&amp;#39;re bored. So the timing worked out super well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about money at the end of the day. Korea already had a diverse internal market in terms of companies and products and the Western market (particularly the US market) was bored of their current route. So it was a great match. Other countries aren&amp;#39;t as invested in skincare are an economic market so they can&amp;#39;t hold a candle. It&amp;#39;s why we on the subreddit talk about overwhelmingly Korean products. It&amp;#39;s not like lovely products from other countries don&amp;#39;t exist. But the Korean products are the most easily available, have the largest range in price point, cover many skincare concerns. It&amp;#39;s a fully matured market while skincare in let&amp;#39;s say the US is still an infant. Plus, as mentioned, most users on this subreddit are in the US so there&amp;#39;s the added reinforcement of the &amp;quot;K Beauty&amp;quot; trend making it even easier for us in particular to get products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ah, and as to why &amp;quot;Asian Beauty&amp;quot; and not specifically &amp;quot;Korean Beauty&amp;quot;; marketing. When I mention my parents are form Bulgaria they think it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Russia&amp;quot;! This should explain everything.... The marketing is playing of the - to be blunt - idiocy of the Average American not knowing about anything beyond the Iron Curtain. Which does include the Asian continent. Apparently someone once said to a friend of mine India is a continent. And my friend is &lt;em&gt;Indian&lt;/em&gt;.
