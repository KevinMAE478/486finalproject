Still a bit combination though. My cheeks are the dryest area of my face so I always have to apply extra face cream on my cheek areas. I'm also slightly sensitive but have/had rosacea. (It's pretty much gone now thanks to ab products unless I use something my skin doesn't like, then my cheeks flare up.) Used to be a lot more sensitive but I've found that regularly using Vitamin C serum, 1% retinol, lots of antioxidants, ab products as well as Aquaphor in my night cream all have helped my skin be so much stronger, less sensitive and more tolerant! I also deal with redness and hyperpigmentation! And discoloration. And also have been aiming to rid the fine lines under my eyes! They drove me nuts for so long but I discovered that so long as I mix a bit of Aquaphor in my hand into my sleeping pack/night cream every night they pretty much disappear! Aquaphor has been the best thing for my under eyes. I wake up with plump smooth under eye skin so long as I use a bit of Aquaphor at night. I've recently tried the Alpha brand 14% Glycolic acid serum and it's great once a week for a stronger treatment. Omg I also love kiku (Holy grail. I never want to be without it. Really helps lighten discoloration, hydrate and calm!) And I too love HA (it's in most of my products lol) and I adore snail! My skin loves snail. \ud83d\ude0d\n\nOoh I'm going to look into the Nufountain Vitamin C! I heard someone else say they loved that one and have been curious about it. My neck is sensitive from the 1% Retinol despite the fact that I've been using it for 3 years even though my face skin is totally adjusted to it. So I get a rashy/irritated neck whenever I apply 20% Vit C serum to my neck even tho it's perfectly fine on my face. But I'm not sure if it's just the formulas I've been using. Haven't tried the Nufountain one yet. I was able to use the PC 15% C serum on my neck with no problems. Do you ever get irritation on your neck from the Nufountain C Serum? Do you use the Retinol on your neck as well?\n\nWhat is it about the Nufountain Vitamin C serum that you adore and what effects have you gotten from it? I think I'm going to try that C serum next!\n\nOoh the only difference is I'm not sensitive to Niacinimide! I even use the Paula's choice 10% Niacinimide product. But interestingly, I've noticed more of a decrease in pigmentation with the Kikumasamune over the 10% Niacinimide!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ooh I was combination before starting Retinoids but they&amp;#39;ve made me more dry skinned now. Still a bit combination though. My cheeks are the dryest area of my face so I always have to apply extra face cream on my cheek areas. I&amp;#39;m also slightly sensitive but have/had rosacea. (It&amp;#39;s pretty much gone now thanks to ab products unless I use something my skin doesn&amp;#39;t like, then my cheeks flare up.) Used to be a lot more sensitive but I&amp;#39;ve found that regularly using Vitamin C serum, 1% retinol, lots of antioxidants, ab products as well as Aquaphor in my night cream all have helped my skin be so much stronger, less sensitive and more tolerant! I also deal with redness and hyperpigmentation! And discoloration. And also have been aiming to rid the fine lines under my eyes! They drove me nuts for so long but I discovered that so long as I mix a bit of Aquaphor in my hand into my sleeping pack/night cream every night they pretty much disappear! Aquaphor has been the best thing for my under eyes. I wake up with plump smooth under eye skin so long as I use a bit of Aquaphor at night. I&amp;#39;ve recently tried the Alpha brand 14% Glycolic acid serum and it&amp;#39;s great once a week for a stronger treatment. Omg I also love kiku (Holy grail. I never want to be without it. Really helps lighten discoloration, hydrate and calm!) And I too love HA (it&amp;#39;s in most of my products lol) and I adore snail! My skin loves snail. \ud83d\ude0d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ooh I&amp;#39;m going to look into the Nufountain Vitamin C! I heard someone else say they loved that one and have been curious about it.
