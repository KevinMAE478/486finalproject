The puff is pretty much identical to the quality of an IOPE one but without the blue colour. Has your typical old lady scent but fades fast when it\u2019s on the skin. I found this bb cushion good for layering but sometimes it could get a little bit sticky if I put too much on therefore needing a setting powder powder. In terms of how much it covered I think it did a really good job with covering and neutralising the redness on my face and the final look was quite acceptable for a natural look without needing extra concealer. \n\nTexture wise I didn\u2019t find it to exaggerate the texture I normally have on my face. The photos without flash in my post (glaring reality of DSLR/HD cameras haha obviously tell a different story but to my naked eyes the texture is not as pronounced or exaggerated. I also chose the worst day to take photos as I\u2019m also recovering from an eczema flare up and so my entire face feels dry and grainy despite the actual flare up being on the other side of my face under my left eye. (Note: I don\u2019t usually put makeup on when I have eczema but I was visiting my grandmother after not being able to see her due to sickness and I didn\u2019t want to look too sick)\n\nIn terms of the shade match I found #23 to be a good match for my face and chest. My face is more neutral than my neck which is a little more yellow due to residual fading tan so it\u2019s a little tricky to find a match that goes with both. I\u2019ve found this one to last about 8 hours (longest I\u2019ve worn it for) during a dry Australian summer, humidity and light rain with a touch up needed around the mouth after eating. This doesn\u2019t break or fade away from my face either like I\u2019ve experienced with some other cushions like the original Etude House Precious Mineral Any Cushion and the Missha Magic Moisture BB Cushion. While it covered up my redness it did nothing for the dark circles under my eye so I usually use yellow concealer under there. This BB cushion does have flashback if you use too much of it.\n\nDespite the slight stickiness I\u2019ve found this BB cushion to be a pretty good one for daily wear. I wouldn\u2019t use this BB cushion at an event or party where I\u2019d be photographed because I prefer to use foundation for that. I would not recommend this for people with oily skin.
