They gave me a contact number for the local US Customs facility that is holding my order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I called the US Customs &amp;amp; Border Protection facility my package was being held at, and after I gave them all the information I had about the situation, they said they&amp;#39;d call me back.
