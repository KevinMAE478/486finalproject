Aritaum, Etude House, Tony Moly, Nature Republic, Innisfree, and Missha standalone stores are very easy to find. Holika Holika, Clio/Peripera, and Too Cool for School stores were less common. &lt;del&gt;Too Cool for School was only in Myeongdong while the others I was able to find in Edae&lt;/del&gt; (4/15 edit: removed, Too Cool for School is more common than indicated!). A few CosRX products can be found at some LOHBs and Olive Youngs (I did not check out Aland). I did a lot of research before going, went with a shopping list, and did not buy items if I could purchase it for cheaper online, so my store trips tended to be quick and to the point (much to the chagrin of Myeongdong SAs, and to the relief of my husband). In general, it was easy to find what I was looking for, and sales associates will follow you around, sometimes aggressively so. YMMV with samples, some places are much more generous than others, and it may depend on your purchase amount. I went into one Missha store near Gyeongbukgung Palace where the SA left me alone, was super nice, and gave me a ton of samples after I purchased a cushion compact. At Holika Holika in Myeongdong, the SA was super aggressive, wouldn&amp;#39;t take no for an answer, got visibly annoyed when I wouldn&amp;#39;t purchase more, and then didn&amp;#39;t give me any samples (I bought an eyeliner and a Gudetama blush). Like I said, YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myeongdong is packed, and would not be my first shopping area choice, but the concentration of stores in a small area makes it hard to skip. Multiple locations of Tony Moly, Aritaum, Missha, and Etude House, which was very disorienting for my husband (&amp;quot;Did we make a circle?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No honey, that&amp;#39;s just the fifth Etude House store&amp;quot; XD) I much preferred Edae, as there are also lots of cute stores and cafes in the area.

My Beauty Diary is very easy to find (7-11, Watsons, Cosmed). My Scheming was a little harder to find (not all Watsons and Cosmeds carry the line). Maskingdom can be found at some Cosmeds and Dr. Wu products can be found at both Watsons and Cosmed. Ximending is the place to go for cosmetics shopping (comparable to Myeongdong, but with street performers and less aggressive SAs). There&amp;#39;s a big Cosmed that carries all of the major Taiwanese mask brands, and the 24 hour Watsons by Ximen station carries a wide variety of items. Watsons had buy 1 get 1 free sales on masks when I was there, and it was hard not to go crazy (we were on our honeymoon). At the time that I went (early April), I could only find the old version of Biore Aqua Rich sunscreen (both gel and watery essence) at Watsons and Cosmed. It was selling for 200NTD. Sasa is also there, but I did not go into any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong: I had gone to Hong Kong three years ago, and it seems to have gotten more expensive since then. Notably, Japanese cosmetics were more expensive in Hong Kong than in Taiwan. I only went to one Sasa in Hong Kong (shopping was extremely limited due to family obligations), and found that they had the new Biore sunscreens, but at a slightly higher price than Amazon (84HKD for a bottle of gel or watery essence). Because of this, I only bought the gel to try, but had I known that Asian sunscreens were about to get harder to ship from Asia, I would&amp;#39;ve stocked up! The proportion of Korean cosmetics available is much higher compared to three years ago, although it is much cheaper in Korea. I would only recommend purchasing cosmetics and skincare in Hong Kong if you could not find the item elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this report helps anyone doing research for a trip.
