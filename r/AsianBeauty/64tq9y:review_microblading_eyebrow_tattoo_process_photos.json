I didn't know if anyone on this sub was contemplating getting some microblading done. This is huge in Korea so I had it done in Korea through May-June of 2016. I was only there for two weeks - they recommended that I wait for three weeks in between sessions but because of my limited time, I had two sessions in two weeks and probably had a slightly less ideal outcome as a result.\n\nNow that it's been about two years since getting microblading done, I'd like to share some photos of the degradation over the years. \n\n**Even though it faded, is it worth it? In my opinion, YES!**\n\nI went for a little bit under a year without wearing any eyebrow make-up, which was great. At about the year mark, I started to fill in slightly, but the shape was still alive enough for me to depend on the shape. Now that it's been about two years, I will always do my eyebrows before leaving the house. \n\nEven though now I don't like to be seen without having additional make-up on, it's amazing what having the tattoo has done for my self-esteem. I really feel like it helped me to feel more confident about my face. Having a professional make the perfect shape for my face really helped me understand what I should be aiming for when I do my own eyebrows. I also like that the eyebrows faded because eyebrow trends change! In korea, at the time, having a very straight eyebrow was very in. But now, the trend is to have a slight kink or curve. (See: https://www.instagram.com/p/BRqRXK6gFYk/) \n\n**If I still lived in Korea, would I go back regularly to get touch-ups? Yes I would!**\n\nAt the particular place I went to, they had a deal that up to a certain time period, they would touch-up for free. I would have then probably tried to make a deal with them that if I went to them regularly for minor touch-ups, that they would charge me far less than the full price of that tattoo. \n\n**Would I get microblading done elsewhere? USA, Canada, Europe?**\n\nI would, but I would heavily heavily research the particular parlor. When got it done, it cost me about $200 for both sessions, including guaranteed touch-ups (which I wasn't able to use because I was only in Korea for vacation.) I would ask for a photo portfolio and only go if they had done a shape that I felt was attractive on my face. \n\nAt the end of the day, I trust Korean microbladers the most - not because there's something inherently better about Koreans, but because it is *so common* and *so cuthroat* in the Korean beauty industry that you can't survive and making a living off of it unless you're really good at it.
