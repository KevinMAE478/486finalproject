But you should also be able to find decants of it on the ab exchange.\n\nSo regarding the Missha long name ampoule, idk why it's not more popular. I think it's because people get turned off it by popular reviews on blogs. This is what it did for me: I spent years dealing with slow healing zits. I don't get breakouts often but when I do, the breakout takes FOREVER to heal. I literally would have to apply antibiotic ointment to it several times a day for 2 months just to try to get it healed quickly and without a scar. (Because that's what worked best for me to prevent a scar) Even vitamin c serum didn't fully fix this. I then started using the Missha long name ampoule right when I had a breakout that had just popped so I was thinking to myself \"omfg this will be another 2 months of ointment all day...\" I began using the Missha ampoule once a day around fall 2016 just for the other purported benefits of it. 2 days later no joke the healing breakout became almost invisible. It was beyond shocking. And the Missha ampoule was the only new addition to my routine. I was screaming at my husband about this in total awe because I had been dealing with these slow healing breakouts forever and just with the addition of the Missha ampoule, bam, healed up more in a few days than all other ones healed in 2 months!  I couldn't believe it. So despite negative reviews on this product from bloggers and elsewhere, I am a devotee to it and use it once a day everyday now. People really should remember YMMV and to not not use or try a product just because someone else didn't like it. I no longer have to struggle with a zit taking 2 months to heal and no longer have to slather gross ointment on any healing breakouts. I literally used ointment everyday and now rarely do. The same thing happened with a scratch on my face. I often accidentally scratch my face with my nails like with the swipe of my hand during doing things and it cuts my skin because my skin is like baby skin from so much Retinoids, vitamin c, Glycolic etc. So it cuts easy and because my nails are like weapons lol. I have a long running joke with my husband about how he should get me those baby mittens that babies have to wear cuz they hurt themselves with their nails cuz their skin is baby skin. Anyways, normally I'd have to put antibiotic ointment on these for weeks but since starting the Missha long name ampoule, they heal so damn fast I forgot I even had a scratch! I'll panic remembering I forgot to keep using ointment on it so I'm like \"omg there's goona be a scar!\" But low and behold the scratch is gone and I can't even locate it. This happens every time now. I wrote a post about Missha long name ampoule being reformulated and now a 3rd gen but no one really replied so it's unfortunate that seemingly no one is using this product. It's been amazing for me.\n\nRegarding Glycolic acid, no I mean Glycolic acid. AHA's were originally studied on for their effectiveness for helping dry skin conditions/Xerosis. Like Urea. Glycolic acid has the smallest molecular structure of all AHA's and so penetrates the deepest and is thus the most effective. Glycolic acid actually works as a humectant but because of how effective it is at exfoliating skin, it gets rid of all the dry rough surface skin cells the best therefore making all of your hydrating and moisturizing layers work better thus making them more effective at doing their job. It actually increases the hyaluronic acid in your skin and helps it retain hydration better. I started using a 10% Glycolic acid product around summer 2016. Around the fall I got the flu and did my routine a few times without it and even though I had kept my routine the same except without Glycolic acid, my skin wasn't retaining moisture as well and was more dry and parched and I was like wtf? Then I remembered I hadn't been using my Glycolic acid so I added it back in and voila. Plump moist well hydrated skin again. I've experimented with stopping the Glycolic a few times now and it happens everytime. My skin becomes dehydrated and parched. I have been shocked at how much it actually was helping to keep my skin hydrated because I thought that was just a minor effect of Glycolic that was supposed to be barely noticeable but it was very noticeable at how much less hydrated my skin was when I wasn't using it. Now I keep using Glycolic acid even just for the hydration retention effect I get from it.\n\nHere are some good articles/links:\n\nhttp://www.firstskinfoundation.org/understanding-alpha-hydroxy-acids\n\nhttps://www.beautyrx.com/blogs/learn/glycolic-acid-faq\n\n\"Humectant agents include alpha-hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid, glycolic acid, and tartaric acid, as well as urea, glycerin, and propylene glycol.\"\n\nFrom: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/502433\n\n\"Glycolic acid acts as both a moisturizer and an exfoliator; it increases the skins supply of hyaluronic acid, which can hold 1000 times its weight in water, thus making Glycolic acid a humectant.\"\n\nFrom: https://www.futurederm.com/spotlight-glycolic-acid/", "edited": 1492272161.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well the Kiku is also so cheap so I bit the bullet deciding to go for it and figured if it didn&amp;#39;t work out I wouldn&amp;#39;t be out too much money and could use it in my hair and on my body.
