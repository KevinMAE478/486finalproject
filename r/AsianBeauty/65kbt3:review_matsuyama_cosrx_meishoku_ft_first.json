It's a nice hydrating FTE that over time brightened up my skin very subtly. I'm not repurchasing it because I want to try something else.\n\n**Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel**: I've been using this tub since January and I've finally emptied it. I thought it would take forever but since it's such a versatile gel, I use it for a lot of things. For example, I usually use it as a sleeping pack but whenever I wash my face earlier in the day (e.g., after the gym) I will use it as a moisturizer. I also use it as a light moisturizer sometimes, before my heavier moisturizer, then put another layer of it on to seal everything in. It's occlusive enough and far less sticky than Vaseline and Aquaphor. I might repurchase it in the future. I want to try a different sleeping pack for now.\n\n**Matsuyama Moisturizing Infusion (Toner)**: I just used up a bottle of the regular version. It's an essence packed with ceramides and soy proteins. I really liked it. It's got the consistency of Hada Labo Gokujyun lotion, slightly thick. I typically apply 2-3 layers of this as my last essence step since it's heavier than my other toners/essences. I love ceramides and this product definitely helped my skin heal from my skincare sins last December. I probably won't repurchase this because I'm trying the light version and so far I'm loving it more.\nIngredients for regular version:\nhttp://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5e1d267124.html\n\n*First Impression:*\n\n**Matsuyama Moisturizing Infusion (Toner) Light**: I've used this 4 times and so far I love it. It has very similar ingredients to the regular version. The difference is in the texture. This one is watery and feels more like a toner than a thick essence. I like it more for this reason. It's lighter and I can layer more if I want without it getting sticky. Summer is coming and I'm glad I have this.\nIngredients:\nhttp://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_eb34267125.html\n\n**Sulwhasoo Perfecting Cushion Brightening**: I love the finish of this. It makes my skin look so dewy and smooth right after application. However, it doesn't hold well throughout the day. I find that around the 2-3 hours mark, it gets really patchy and breaks up all over. It accentuates my dry areas and makes my pores look bigger. I have tried using primer with it and using powder with it and using both of those things with it. Nope. Nothing is helping and I'm so sad :( :( I think I'll have to return it. At least I'm glad that I bought it from a department store with a generous return policy. I would've cried if I had bought this from Korea and can't return it.
