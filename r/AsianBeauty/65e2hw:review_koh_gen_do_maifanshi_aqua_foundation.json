That said, I have only good things to say about this product. It fit my winter skin tone extremely well, and I think it&amp;#39;s sheer enough that it&amp;#39;ll work for summer, too. I use it in 213 as an NC25 with an olive undertone. This is a lightweight, no-fuss, high-end formula, and if you&amp;#39;re olive, especially fair and olive, it&amp;#39;s wonderful. I&amp;#39;ve looked everywhere and foundations and BB creams always seemed too peachy, orange, gray, or yellow on me. I spent many years shrugging and making do with what the world gave me. No more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pros: The foundation has a natural finish, the most like skin that I&amp;#39;ve ever used, and there is no SPF, so it photographs well. I would absolutely recommend this foundation for a wedding. Also, no fragrance. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m wearing anything, and once it&amp;#39;s set in, it doesn&amp;#39;t rub off onto clothing. The colors that lean more olive seem to take down redness. It&amp;#39;s easy to apply with fingers, but applies equally well with a BB cushion puff.  It leaves a natural finish and doesn&amp;#39;t cake up around my nose. My no-makeup-makeup look has improved so much with it and I get compliments on my skin health and overall appearance when I use it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cons: It is pricey. The fact that it is silicone-based might be a con for people who are sensitive. For people who use beauty blenders or sponges, the texture might be too watery, and will sink into the applicator. It&amp;#39;s important to have realistic expectations about this product. This is a LIGHT coverage foundation, which means that it&amp;#39;s not for covering blemishes, and it can only be built up to a point. It will not make anything &amp;quot;disappear,&amp;quot; it will just blur imperfections a bit. Recommended for skin with few breakouts or blemishes, and someone who is OK with spot concealing, or leaving a few spots visible. The lack of coverage is the trade-off for the natural feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/ISTK2\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Don't see a ton of reviews on this foundation! \n \n[I coughed up $60 bucks for this god forsaken bottle.](https://kohgendocosmetics.com/products/maifanshi-aqua-foundation) By the time I did it, I was fairly certain I was going to like it, but if you're not sure, GKD offers samples, so please take advantage!

Oh yeah, this foundation has never oxidized on me, which is a huge plus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I initially got it, I was worried about the shade being too dark. In the winter, I can get a bit lighter than NC20, but because it&amp;#39;s fairly light coverage, it&amp;#39;s never seemed too dark, especially if you bring it down the neck just a tad. This foundation has played really well with all of my sunscreens (all Japanese), it&amp;#39;ll cover the white cast from my physical sunscreens, although the face will still appear slightly lighter/brighter than normal, but not enough for people on the street to notice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dga8nuq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492256821.0, "created_utc": 1492228021.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e2hw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e2hw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e2hw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8n2j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sneakpeekbot", "parent_id": "t1_dga8myg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Here's a sneak peek of [/r/OliveMUA](https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA) using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) of all time!**\n\n\\#1: [Can we talk Coloring, from a WOC Angle?](https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/5ikeve/can_we_talk_coloring_from_a_woc_angle/)  \n\\#2: [How I feel when I shop with friends](https://i.reddituploads.com/6bf624cd05f74c1c9c7b4afc06ee9c73?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=3c9b7ae59f0adb4ea5a6741cf275bd42) | [5 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/4r0m17/how_i_feel_when_i_shop_with_friends/)  \n\\#3: [FOTD subdued cranberry](https://i.imgur.com/81kCUlQ.jpg) | [13 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/5h1w06/fotd_subdued_cranberry/)\n\n----\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/5lveo6/blacklist/)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a sneak peek of &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA\"&gt;/r/OliveMUA&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/top/?sort=top&amp;amp;t=all\"&gt;top posts&lt;/a&gt; of all time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#1: &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/5ikeve/can_we_talk_coloring_from_a_woc_angle/\"&gt;Can we talk Coloring, from a WOC Angle?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n#2: &lt;a href=\"https://i.reddituploads.com/6bf624cd05f74c1c9c7b4afc06ee9c73?fit=max&amp;amp;h=1536&amp;amp;w=1536&amp;amp;s=3c9b7ae59f0adb4ea5a6741cf275bd42\"&gt;How I feel when I shop with friends&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/4r0m17/how_i_feel_when_i_shop_with_friends/\"&gt;5 comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n#3: &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/81kCUlQ.jpg\"&gt;FOTD subdued cranberry&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/5h1w06/fotd_subdued_cranberry/\"&gt;13 comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;bot,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;beep&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;boop&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Downvote&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;remove&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Contact&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Info&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/5lveo6/blacklist/\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Opt-out&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dga8n2j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492256787.0, "created_utc": 1492227987.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8myg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sorry_ari", "parent_id": "t1_dg9z1hk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "good luck!
