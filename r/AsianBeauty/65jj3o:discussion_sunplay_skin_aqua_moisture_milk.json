I did 2 thicker layers, and while I experienced no pilling on the second layer, each layer felt greasy/oily and actually looked like I had water droplets on my skin until I worked it in and it dried down. I am going to assume this is due to all the silicones. However, magic happened once the layers dried down! My face no longer felt greasy/oily and I had a beautiful smooth, satin (or demi matte if you prefer) look to my skin. My face did feel more moisturized after putting this on, but it was not so much that it made my oily skin feel congested. No white cast what so ever and the sunscreen felt lightweight, but not invisible. I would compare it to the feeling of wearing a lightweight liquid foundation. If you're not used to wearing a liquid foundation/bb cream/cc cream/etc. this could be a little heavy feeling for you. The best part for me was not having to put powder over this sunscreen, it actually dried down to a non tacky finish! You will also need a good oil/balm/cream cleaner to remove this sunscreen.

Which is very impressive since I normally have to blot several times during the day and mist at least once mid day to help counteract the dry, desert air. When I had to blot, the sunscreen felt heavy-ish (but all sunscreens and foundations do for me when it comes to blotting time), the feeling went back to lightweight after the blotting. At the blotting time, my face didn't look shiny, but it did look more on the dewy side. The finish went to a more glowy satin look after I blotted. It withstood sweating and my oily skin despite not being sebum resistant, I did not test the water resistant claims nor if it worked well under make-up. My Botanic Farm cleansing sherbet did successfully remove this at the end of the evening. Only further testing will tell if this will cause me to break out.\n\nOverall, I really like the wear and feel of this sunscreen, though I wish it came in a bigger bottle!
