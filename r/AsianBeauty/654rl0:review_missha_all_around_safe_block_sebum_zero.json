It&amp;#39;s your sunscreen addict LadyBanterbury. Here is another alcohol-free sunscreen review. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve been stressed due to upcoming exams but I finally got my Missha sunscreens in my package along with some face masks and a Canmake cream blush. Every time I get a package I like freak out and bow to the postman. (I kid, I kid I do this in my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of ABers looking for an-all physical sunscreen, I wanted to try one and review it for you guys. As some of you know, I have pretty sensitive skin which dies at the sight of alcohol so I have been reviewing some alcohol-free sunscreens as Biore Watery Essence murders my skin youch. I also have dehydrated acne prone skin and since I hit puberty later than most, I get breakouts at 21 T_T. Since I am a student, I tend to look at the lower price stuff because I am broke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First impressions&lt;/strong&gt;: I think I got the new packaging of the Missha sunscreen as originally it used to be a blue colour but my one is a white sun pattern with the label in a cute mint green. It comes in a 50ml which is good. Although I love shoving loads of plusses in my sunscreen, i&amp;#39;m not that miffed to see only three plusses. This has only physical filters (it has both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide respectively) and can be used on sensitive skin. It apparently has a sebum control benefit and is supposed to be for oily skin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I think?:&lt;/strong&gt; This actually was pleasant to use. In comparison to the yellow Missha waterproof, this looks like an angel. It has a slight floral scent that fades - I&amp;#39;m thinking lilies and chamomile - very pretty. There is a slight white cast but this fades away very fast and this is a must for me as I am a person of colour. This dries to a matte finish but it isn&amp;#39;t drying, just comfortable on the skin. It is also water and sweat resistant so you can wear this to the beach or if you are exercising and out about in the sun. The consistency is thin and not thick at all. I am impressed. I broke out with the pink Missha sunscreen (the essence one - my big sister took it haha), but this is great. I got it for about \u00a39 something so it is quite inexpensive and I brought it from Yesstyle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; Any ABers with very sensitive skin or their skin only likes physical filters, I think you should try this. Those who have dry skin can try this as it controls the sebum but does not dry the skin. This is also an alcohol-free sunscreens so even better.  I hope I have given some hope to those who cannot handle alcohol laden sunscreens. I like this and I am going to wear this when I am out in the sun or at the beach! This did not break me out or cause a reaction which is wowee. This is miles better than Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun SPF 50. This is a wearable physical sunscreen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next review: Sunkiller Perfect Water Essence SPF 50 PA++++ which will probably be in a month.
