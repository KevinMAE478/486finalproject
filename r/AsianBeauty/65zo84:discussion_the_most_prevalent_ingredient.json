It is also used to make coconut derivatives - see the next section for further discussion.\n\n**Olive oil** is also used to make olive derivatives such as olivates (e.g., cetearyl olivate); squalane is often derived from olive oil but can also be derived from other sources such as sugarcane.  Olive oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 on cosDNA.  \n\n**Mineral oil** has a low comedogenicity (cosDNA rating of 0) since it has a high molecular weight that prevents absorption into the skin.  Several people with botanical oil sensitivities have noted that they can use mineral oil.  However, many people reported mineral oil sensitivities.\n\n**A note on oleic acid/lineolic acid ratio:** In general most of the carrier oils high on the sensitivity list have a high oleic/linoleic acid ratio.  Linoleic acid levels tend to be low for people with acne; the linoleic acid applied topically can bring the oleic / linoleic acid ratio more in balance for acne prone people, resulting in acne mitigation.  See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/42p2d9/using_oils_with_linoleic_acids_for_dehydrated/) for more discussion about lineolic/oleic acid ratios in oils.\n\n**Essential oils**: Another class of oils of note to which people reported sensitvities are essential oils.  Common essential oils include citrus oil, tea tree, lavender, peppermint, rose.  These oils can be irritating and must be diluted heavily before use.  **Tea tree oil** is probably the most popular essential oil on this sub; it is used for anti-acne properties.  Like all essential oils, is an ingredient that must be used a low concentrations (never use it at more than 1%(face)/2%(body) concentration topically!)  \n\n\nIn this tally of reported sensitivities, I am listing each type of oil separately since oil sensitivities seem to be highly dependent on the type of oil.  \nSome people can't take any botanical oils (they are often able to use mineral oil!) and are tallied as \"botanical oils\".\n\n####**Coconut derivatives**\nI found a lot of discussion between people who can't use coconut derivatives; there are many different ingredients frequently made from coconuts; some common ones include SLS/SLES, stearic acid, capric/caprylic triglycerides, phenoxyethanol, some fatty alcohols.  In this tally, they are each listed separately since some people are sensitive only to subsets of coconut products.  Here is a link to a (long!) list someone made of coconut-derived ingredients:\n\n- [Coconut-derived ingredients](http://coconutallergy.blogspot.com/2007/11/coconut-derived-ingredients.html)\n\n\n####**Silicones**\nIncludes **dimethicone** (cosDNA=1) and **cyclopentasiloxane**; look for the 'cone ending or siloxane ending.\nSome people are only sensitive to some types of silicones.

It comes in different molecular weights that correspond to polymer chain length (check); shorter chains are able to penetrate deeper into the skin.\nSome of you said you are sensitive only to low molecular weight hyaluronic acid.  About a third of people with HA sensitivities said that they are only sensitive to it if the concentration is relatively high.  One or two of you said that you are sensitive to hyaluronic acid but not to the salt form, sodium hyaluronate, but most of you avoid both the acid and salt form.  Note that all of these statements were counted as a HA sensitivity (except a couple of you who is sensitive only to the salt form).\n\n- [Mega-List: AB Products without Hyaluronic Acid/Sodium Hyaluronate](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5r2oqc/megalist_ab_products_without_hyaluronic/)\n\n\n####**Sulfates** (SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), SLES (sodium laureth sulfate), ALS (ammonium lauryl sulfate), others)\nThese ingredients typically derived from coconuts are most fresquently used in foaming products such as shampoos and cleansers.

One or two of you said that you are sensitive to hyaluronic acid but not to the salt form, sodium hyaluronate, but most of you avoid both the acid and salt form.

However, my work sells bodycare ingredients and I developed this sensitivity from working there and decanting the undiluted oils. It&amp;#39;s not so much breakouts but that even just the vapors of certain fragrance oils make specific parts of my body (mainly my elbows, wrists, and between my eyebrows) super itchy and irritated. I can no longer use any products with FOs and I can always smell when products have them even before reading the labels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;#39;m actually commenting, though, is because I&amp;#39;m very curious about the EO aspect; mainly extraction methods.
