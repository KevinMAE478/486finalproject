I used to love to get my stationery, some grocery, and get some ab if i can. But I stick to my K-town and chinatown tbh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer the Missha that was on 7th ave and 30 something street in the city at one point. So cheap, sales staff was nice, mind you this was 6-8 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on that point, when I used to work at a vitamin store, when a customer dropped something, we never insulted them on one issue that happens at anypoint, we clean it up, and suggest them other products that might suit them, dont make them feel embarrassed, whats the point, have to give good customer service because we want customers to feel comfortable and keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgdpqee", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475498.0, "created_utc": 1492446698.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
