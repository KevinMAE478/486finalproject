That&amp;#39;s not to say I&amp;#39;m not looking to improve on it, considering I should be addressing aging concerns already (and I&amp;#39;ve just received my Melano CC too, for this purpose!). But for now, this routine is what&amp;#39;s making my skin happy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I feel what is also helping this routine to settle is my discovery that it&amp;#39;s better to apply thin layers of all the products and add additional layers if necessary, rather than slathering them on generously which didn&amp;#39;t help with absorption at all and consequently leave skin still dehydrated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banila Co CIZ Purity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash (avoiding SLS and parabens everywhere but can&amp;#39;t do without this wash argh)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosrx BHA / Cosrx AHA &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosrx Skin Returning A-Sol (spot treatment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emprani Softfull Booskin - 2-3 layers (but this is discontinued! testing the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner but I&amp;#39;m starting to think my skin doesn&amp;#39;t like it as much as the Booskin =/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJH Tea Tree Essence (occasionally, when needed)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin (HG)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scinic Aqua AIO (hydration in the day!) / Banila Co Miss Flower and Mr Honey Essence Oil (nourishment at night! this was a game changer with the thin layer thing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosrx Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap / Mizon Snail Recovery Gel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgeg2i0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492506663.0, "created_utc": 1492477863.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65zlw5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeh0bq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aishaaa", "parent_id": "t3_65zlw5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I actually gave up having a rigid routine because my skin is different day to day.
