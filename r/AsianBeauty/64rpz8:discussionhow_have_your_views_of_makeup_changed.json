I learned how to blend eyeshadow, choose the right colors for my skin tone, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after finding AB last year, my steadily improved and now I wear very little base makeup. I simply use a little concealer under and above my eyes to camouflage my dark circles/hollows, and a light dusting of translucent setting powder everywhere else since my sunscreen can be a little too dewy at times. A little eyeliner, mascara, tinted lip balm, and tinted brow gel and I&amp;#39;m ready to go! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m feeling like it or if I have extra time in the morning I&amp;#39;ll also apply a little eyeshadow, blush, and a bit of highlighter, but I haven&amp;#39;t worn base makeup/foundation for a few months now! And I credit that entirely to finding AB and feeling more confident in my skin. The only time I wear base makeup now is for going out to special events or things like that. But that&amp;#39;s also because I love doing my eyeshadow or a old lip and foundation helps me start on a good canvas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dg4vf2g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971437.0, "created_utc": 1491942637.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rpz8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4weoo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Titanchain", "parent_id": "t3_64rpz8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was really into makeup before, because I felt like my skin had no hope and I needed the coverage, but now my skin is great, so I hardly wear any at all.
