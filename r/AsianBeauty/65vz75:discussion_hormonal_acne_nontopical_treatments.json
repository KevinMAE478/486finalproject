I use curology, my prescription has a mix of azelaic acid, zinc pyrithione and clyndamicin, which mostly helps with bacterial and fungal infection and calms inflamation. I use this in conjunction with retinols and so far it has been working well for me, but I have super resilient skin. It&amp;#39;s true that topical stuff&amp;#39;s effect isn&amp;#39;t major but if you can prevent the infection, inflammation and dead skin build up it does prevent acne. \nI&amp;#39;m also taking one 300mg zinc supplement tablet a day since that&amp;#39;s supposed to help with acne flare up, and tbh I don&amp;#39;t have new acne anymore, just healing ones. Remember to change your pillowcase every day or put a new t shirt on every night, it helps tremendously.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy friend also has terrible hormonal acne to the point where 2 rounds of accutane didn&amp;#39;t work for her. She has been prescribed a hormone blocker (androgyn) and so far it has been working well for her so maybe you can go to a derm and ask for that option. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgdl82z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470287.0, "created_utc": 1492441487.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz75", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz75", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgectg0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KoohiiSama", "parent_id": "t1_dgdxya2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, thank you for this PSA for all future antibiotic users...

This is a common misconception. Phytoestrogens actually can act as an anti-estrogen. (Phytoestrogens aren't only found in soy btw, all legumes and grains have phytoestrogens as well. Peanuts, beans, lentils, grains, peas, etc. Phytoestrogens actually oftentimes act as antioxidants in your body. If you don't want to consume phytoestrogens then you might want to stop consumption of all grains and legumes lol.) When people say soy increases estrogen it reminds me of the faulty argument regarding phytic acid being bad because of it inhibiting some mineral absorption. (The effect is miniscule and phytic acid being anti-cancer outweighs it. Phytic acid actually helps to protect you from cancer. Not to mention some minor iron inhibition isn't always a bad thing considering how pro-oxidative and damaging iron is. Think of how women often outlive men and how women bleed every month which reduces iron. Longevity enthusiasts often even donate blood monthly to decrease iron because it's that bad for you. So I just give people side eye when they act like phytic acid is bad. Im like well have fun getting cancer then lol. For example, people in the Paleo community believe phytic acid is bad and that we shouldn't eat legumes or grains. There aren't so many studies proving a diet high in fruits, vegetable, legumes and whole grains prevents cancer and heart disease etc for no reason. Phytic acid is good for you, phytoestrogens are good for you. \n\nAnyways back on topic regarding phytoestrogens, so you have in your body what are called \"estrogen receptors\". Phytoestrogens are much much  weaker than real estrogen. When you eat foods high in phytoestrogens, some of the phytoestrogens actually attach themselves to your estrogen receptors *displacing* real estrogen. So instead of your estrogen receptors being full of only real estrogen which has a much stronger effect on your body, some of your real estrogen is *replaced* with the much weaker phytoestrogens. So you end up with a weaker less strong estrogenic effect on your body vs if you were to consume no phytoestrogens.\n\nIf you're concerned about consuming and thus increasing your estrogen you would want to cut out dairy because dairy actually contains real estrogen considering it comes from lactating mammals. Phytoestrogens protect you from having too much estrogen and problems related to that. Wheras dairy does the opposite.\n\nThere's a reason people in various parts of Asia have lower incidences of disease as a whole and some of the greatest rates of cenentarians. It's not just vegetables, they also consume soy and antioxidant rich teas like green tea. (As well as not alot of dairy, sugar and crap like the west.

Not to mention soy phytoestrogens may help to increase bone density, and may help to protect against osteoporosis and breast cancer and other cancers. You get a much weaker effect from phytoestrogens than you would with real estrogen so that's why it's actually good to displace some of your estrogen from your estrogen receptors with phytoestrogens instead and cut dairy because it contains real estrogen.\n\nLet me add another thing: estrogen actually increases men's risk for prostate cancer. As men get older, their estrogen levels increase and testosterone levels decrease. Hence why they often gain fat in abdominal area. Which starts a bad cycle because fat produces estrogen so their estrogen levels increase even more and estrogen contributes to prostate cancer.  It's a helluva lot more complicated than that but it's interesting to think about how if dairy increases estrogen and androgens, both of which would contribute to prostate cancer, what would happen if they cut dairy and instead consumed high phytoestrogen foods like soy to replace the \"bad\" estrogen with much weaker phytoestrogen and thus also had androgens decrease? \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477605/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134227/\n\nhttp://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=79", "edited": 1492511141.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy doesn&amp;#39;t increase estrogen.
