Pretty speedy with the free express shipping! All-in it was $150USD \u2013 happy to share individual prices as needed. I am, of course, introducing these haul items very slowly (starting with the BHA). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream:** Refills. This stuff is gold and I love it. (Cue: no one being shocked.)\n\n**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid:** I\u2019ve got some SFs on my nose and t-zone. I\u2019m hoping the BHA will better clear them out and smooth out the texture of my skin. I\u2019m introducing this to start at night once every 2-3 days and see if I get results \u2013 definitely don\u2019t want to overexfoliate out of the gate.\n\n**Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid:** I don\u2019t have a major problem with CCs, so I got this for spot treatment in the random instances where I do. I\u2019m going to wait until the BHA is more integrated into my routine to test this one out. \n\n**Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch:** As with the AHA, I got these for the random occasional spot I get, because I\u2019ve read such good things.\n\n**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence:** Everyone raved about this, so I picked it up. Not sure where and how I\u2019ll slot it in just yet. But if you\u2019re going for the free shipping... \n\n**TonyMoly Magic Food Banana Sleeping Pack:** I\u2019ve been using the Cosrx Nourishing Rice Overnight Mask, and I\u2019m not totally in love with it. I have Sulwhasoo too, but it is just too expensive to get attached to! My skin is pretty dry, but the Cosrx sits a bit heavily and feels sort of greasy. I\u2019ll use it until it runs out, but figured I\u2019d give the TonyMoly a try after reading good things.\n\n**Purebess Galactomyces 80 Eye Cream:** I\u2019m looking for a replacement for the Burt\u2019s Bees eye cream I currently use, and I\u2019ve heard really good things on this one. This will be a later introduction, because I don\u2019t want to fall in love when I still have something to use up!\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask:** I\u2019m a perpetual chapstick-er, so I\u2019m hoping this will help me cut down the middle of the night scramble for my Burt\u2019s Bees.\n\n**Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask:** Practically everyone\u2019s HG, I\u2019m planning to work this in over time to help with my SFs and general de-gunking.\n\n**Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask:** This one just seems fun. Same as above, hoping to find a clay mask to use intermittently for SFs and getting my pores whipped into shape.\n\n**Tosowong Pure Mask Pack** (2ea of Aloe, Green Tea, Propolis, Snail, Blueberry, Deep Sea Water): So many people have some of these as their HG, so I figured this was a good chance to give them a shot and see what takes. So far I\u2019ve tried Deep Sea Water. I like the mask fit and texture, but I\u2019m more excited to try propolis and snail.\n\n**Holika Holika Pure Essence Sheet Mask** (6 Damask Rose): I love this mask, but wasn\u2019t too keen on the rest of the Holika Holika line \u2013 thankfully Jolse packages up sets of 3 for a pretty good price.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince everyone loves the sample reports \u2013 here you go. Not sure where I\u2019d even start here -- let me know what you think sounds fun. I know Fiddy just had an Instagram post where she was not so happy about the Heimish balm, and our skin seems pretty similar.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Samples:** \n\nThe Saem Snail Sheet Mask\n\nEtude House Fix and Fix Primers (Lavender and Rose)\n\nEtude House Sunprise Mild Sunscreen\n\nTonyMoly Black Tea Classic Cream\n\nEtude House Baking Powder BB Deep Cleansing Foam\n\nCosrx PHA Moisture Renewal Power Cream\n\nMissha Super Aqua Oil Clear Gel Cream\n\nA\u2019pieu Deep Clean Cleansing Oil\n\nHeimish All Clean Balm\n\nFloria Peeling Gel\n\nLiole Dollish Veil Vita BB\n\nRizette Magic Whitening Cream\n\nMissha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence\n\n", "edited": 1492185827.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP here -- I\u2019ve been at the AB thing now for about a month, and I\u2019ve decided to expand my repertoire.

This will be a later introduction, because I don\u2019t want to fall in love when I still have something to use up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask:&lt;/strong&gt; I\u2019m a perpetual chapstick-er, so I\u2019m hoping this will help me cut down the middle of the night scramble for my Burt\u2019s Bees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask:&lt;/strong&gt; Practically everyone\u2019s HG, I\u2019m planning to work this in over time to help with my SFs and general de-gunking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask:&lt;/strong&gt; This one just seems fun. Same as above, hoping to find a clay mask to use intermittently for SFs and getting my pores whipped into shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tosowong Pure Mask Pack&lt;/strong&gt; (2ea of Aloe, Green Tea, Propolis, Snail, Blueberry, Deep Sea Water): So many people have some of these as their HG, so I figured this was a good chance to give them a shot and see what takes. So far I\u2019ve tried Deep Sea Water. I like the mask fit and texture, but I\u2019m more excited to try propolis and snail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holika Holika Pure Essence Sheet Mask&lt;/strong&gt; (6 Damask Rose): I love this mask, but wasn\u2019t too keen on the rest of the Holika Holika line \u2013 thankfully Jolse packages up sets of 3 for a pretty good price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since everyone loves the sample reports \u2013 here you go. Not sure where I\u2019d even start here -- let me know what you think sounds fun. I know Fiddy just had an Instagram post where she was not so happy about the Heimish balm, and our skin seems pretty similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Saem Snail Sheet Mask&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Etude House Fix and Fix Primers (Lavender and Rose)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Etude House Sunprise Mild Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TonyMoly Black Tea Classic Cream&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Etude House Baking Powder BB Deep Cleansing Foam&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cosrx PHA Moisture Renewal Power Cream&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missha Super Aqua Oil Clear Gel Cream&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A\u2019pieu Deep Clean Cleansing Oil&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heimish All Clean Balm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Floria Peeling Gel&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liole Dollish Veil Vita BB&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rizette Magic Whitening Cream&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dg97c4e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209342.0, "created_utc": 1492180542.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgabecw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "specialsnowflakeee", "parent_id": "t1_dg9a5no", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's such good stuff, I'm sold ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such good stuff, I&amp;#39;m sold &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgabecw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261542.0, "created_utc": 1492232742.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9a5no", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mlieskyx3", "parent_id": "t3_65cusg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was gonna ask why so many Mizon snail recovery cream then I read the comment xD", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was gonna ask why so many Mizon snail recovery cream then I read the comment xD&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dg9a5no", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212834.0, "created_utc": 1492184034.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cusg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb3ss7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sissie85", "parent_id": "t1_dg9nloq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "that's a smart idea, thanks !", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;that&amp;#39;s a smart idea, thanks !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgb3ss7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315707.0, "created_utc": 1492286907.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9nloq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tranrekted", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ejjw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I believe Jolse ships all economy orders free (no tracking) and standard shipping is only $2.50 (w tracking).
