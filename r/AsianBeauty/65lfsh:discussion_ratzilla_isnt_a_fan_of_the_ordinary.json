It's very light and makes my skin softer than anything. When my squalane runs out, I'll probably restock from the Ordinary. I'm currently using:\n\nLAA vitamin c suspension-from all the reviews, I thought this was going to be terrible. Surprisingly, mine actually isn't gritty the way the reviews describe it. It's an odd consistency, sort of a thick, white sort of emulsion texture. Too thick to use the dropper bottle it comes with, but spreads and sinks in easily when it touches my skin, not at all what I would have expected just looking at it. It does have occasional tiny vitamin c crystals, which are the gritty bits everyone complains about, but they're pretty rare, definitely not part of the overall texture. I like that it's not water based and therefore not prone to oxidation, but not oily like other non-aqueous formulas I've tried. Also the price point is pretty beautiful.  \n\n10% Argireline solution-This is pretty new. I use it in the hope that it will prevent me from tensing the skin around my eyes and forehead so much. No idea if it works, but the formula itself is light as water, pretty much the consistency of a light hydrating toner. Sinks in quickly, no residue. Much cheaper than other formulas out there that contain argireline, a high percentage, and really inoffensive to use.\n\nBuffet serum-I've always tried to have peptides in my routine. Typically they've been scattered about and expensive. With this serum though, all my peptides are in one place and cheap. It's a clear, light serum consistency. Spreads easily, sinks in easily. No residue. \n\nAlpha Arbutin 2%-I don't use this much anymore except as an occasional spot treatment because I'm already quite pale and don't have any lasting hyperpigmentation. But it's a similar consistency to the Buffet. Clear, serum texture, spreads easily, no noticeable residue for me. For lightening, it's quite powerful, and way cheaper than any other 2% alpha Arbutin products I've come across.\n\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid 5%-this stuff is intense and when I introduced it too quickly into my routine I got some peeling. I'm big on antioxidants in my routine though, so I love it. Before the Ordinary I had never seen ALA sold as the primary ingredient in any skincare item. This in a non-aqueous solution, because ALA tends to be highly unstable in water, and I love that the Ordinary pays attention to that kind of thing, and also ships it in a dark bottle to protect it from sunlight. This is an oil texture, so lately I've been mixing it with my skincare oils during that part of my routine-a few drops mixed with rosehip oil or squalane, or alternately mixed into my lotion depending on how I'm feeling. \n\nAzelaic 10% Suspension-I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this, because the medium is a little odd. It's thicker than my Curology formula, and I use a thin layer. I don't use it every day, but it sinks in surprisingly well on me and I don't mind the cream/lotion texture as much as I thought I would. Still unsure of the best place for it in my routine.\n\n\nThings from the Ordinary that *haven't* worked for me include:\n\n10% niacinamide+zinc-unfortunately this broke me out, but otherwise would have beeb nice. Similar texture consistency to Buffet/alpha Arbutin.\n\nThe 2% retinol-I really wanted to like this because of the price point, but it seemed to break me out. I'm not sure if it was purging, but either way I didn't like it as much as my current retinol HG, so I gave up on it.\n\nThere's some mini-reviews for you!", "edited": 1492367963.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not using their squalane, but I am using squalane in my routine and I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend it.

Typically they&amp;#39;ve been scattered about and expensive. With this serum though, all my peptides are in one place and cheap. It&amp;#39;s a clear, light serum consistency. Spreads easily, sinks in easily. No residue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alpha Arbutin 2%-I don&amp;#39;t use this much anymore except as an occasional spot treatment because I&amp;#39;m already quite pale and don&amp;#39;t have any lasting hyperpigmentation. But it&amp;#39;s a similar consistency to the Buffet. Clear, serum texture, spreads easily, no noticeable residue for me. For lightening, it&amp;#39;s quite powerful, and way cheaper than any other 2% alpha Arbutin products I&amp;#39;ve come across.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alpha Lipoic Acid 5%-this stuff is intense and when I introduced it too quickly into my routine I got some peeling. I&amp;#39;m big on antioxidants in my routine though, so I love it. Before the Ordinary I had never seen ALA sold as the primary ingredient in any skincare item. This in a non-aqueous solution, because ALA tends to be highly unstable in water, and I love that the Ordinary pays attention to that kind of thing, and also ships it in a dark bottle to protect it from sunlight. This is an oil texture, so lately I&amp;#39;ve been mixing it with my skincare oils during that part of my routine-a few drops mixed with rosehip oil or squalane, or alternately mixed into my lotion depending on how I&amp;#39;m feeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Azelaic 10% Suspension-I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how I was going to feel about this, because the medium is a little odd. It&amp;#39;s thicker than my Curology formula, and I use a thin layer. I don&amp;#39;t use it every day, but it sinks in surprisingly well on me and I don&amp;#39;t mind the cream/lotion texture as much as I thought I would. Still unsure of the best place for it in my routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things from the Ordinary that &lt;em&gt;haven&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; worked for me include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10% niacinamide+zinc-unfortunately this broke me out, but otherwise would have beeb nice. Similar texture consistency to Buffet/alpha Arbutin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2% retinol-I really wanted to like this because of the price point, but it seemed to break me out. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it was purging, but either way I didn&amp;#39;t like it as much as my current retinol HG, so I gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some mini-reviews for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgccrc6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395082.0, "created_utc": 1492366282.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lfsh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lfsh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lfsh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lfsh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdftnh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ondine____", "parent_id": "t1_dgdeyle", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I see!
