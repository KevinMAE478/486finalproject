Also, SUNSCREEN STUFF!\n\nI'm getting back to my teenage baby soft skin finally. It's been two months but I finally figured out that I have dry skin not oily skin.\n\nI stopped using a foaming cleanser and picked up randomly the Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser and started using it instead of my foam cleanser - omo my sensitive skin loves it.\n\nMy hyper-pigmentation is nearly all gone - I don't want to wear foundation to university anymore!\n\nRave number 1: **Country and Stream Honey UV Water Gel SPF 50 PA++++** Wowow. Wearing this sunscreen is such a dream - so so hydrating and lovely. This contains a buffet of wonderful ingredients - 2 kinds of collagen, 3 kinds of hyaluronic acid, honey, royal jelly and 6 kinds of organic herbal extracts. It's alcohol free- this blows Biore Watery Essence out of the park. This dries down to a lovely semi-matte finish - no greasiness or film. I love wearing it under my make-up too - it gives a chok chok glow to the skin. Oh god, it smells so good too - a mix of fresh lemon and honey. Comes in a 45ml bottle and is now available on Beautius. \n\n\nRave number 2: **Missha All Around Safe Block Sebum Zero Sun SPF 50 PA+++(2017 formulation - the white tube).** This is so great for an all-physical sunscreen. I'm seriously impressed. It's not only a creamy texture but it sinks in easily.  It feels like nothing on the skin. There is a tiny white cast but you can layer your BB cream or foundation over easily. Water and sebum resistant so I can wear this outside or at the beach. This provide sebum control and it has a nice matte finish. It has a lovely faint floral scent too. Not drying and contains both green tea water and tea tree extract. Alcohol free too! Comes in a 50ml bottle. \n\nRant: **Kikumasumune High Moist lotion.** This made my skin break out, probably the ferments. Using some on my hair and gave the rest of the bottle to my grateful friend. I gave this a good go, but to no avail. I ordered the Hada Labo Gokujyun lotion to try out soon. What a pretty bottle though. \n\n\nNon AB raves: **Simple Cleansing Oil** This is not only cheap as chips, but contains grapeseed oil as the base oil (which is high in linoleic acid which is good for acne prone skin). It also has both Vitamin A &amp; E and leaves my skin soft and clean. Dissolves all my make-up easily too. There's no fragrance in this and is good for sensitive skin. \n\n**Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser** Been looking for a gentle milk cleanser, and this ticks all the boxes. I use this on a dry face and just massage for about two minutes and rinse everything off. Replacing my foam cleanser with this has worked great for my skin.

Also, SUNSCREEN STUFF!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting back to my teenage baby soft skin finally. It&amp;#39;s been two months but I finally figured out that I have dry skin not oily skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped using a foaming cleanser and picked up randomly the Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser and started using it instead of my foam cleanser - omo my sensitive skin loves it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hyper-pigmentation is nearly all gone - I don&amp;#39;t want to wear foundation to university anymore!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rave number 1: &lt;strong&gt;Country and Stream Honey UV Water Gel SPF 50 PA++++&lt;/strong&gt; Wowow. Wearing this sunscreen is such a dream - so so hydrating and lovely. This contains a buffet of wonderful ingredients - 2 kinds of collagen, 3 kinds of hyaluronic acid, honey, royal jelly and 6 kinds of organic herbal extracts. It&amp;#39;s alcohol free- this blows Biore Watery Essence out of the park. This dries down to a lovely semi-matte finish - no greasiness or film. I love wearing it under my make-up too - it gives a chok chok glow to the skin. Oh god, it smells so good too - a mix of fresh lemon and honey. Comes in a 45ml bottle and is now available on Beautius. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rave number 2: &lt;strong&gt;Missha All Around Safe Block Sebum Zero Sun SPF 50 PA+++(2017 formulation - the white tube).&lt;/strong&gt; This is so great for an all-physical sunscreen. I&amp;#39;m seriously impressed. It&amp;#39;s not only a creamy texture but it sinks in easily.  It feels like nothing on the skin. There is a tiny white cast but you can layer your BB cream or foundation over easily. Water and sebum resistant so I can wear this outside or at the beach. This provide sebum control and it has a nice matte finish. It has a lovely faint floral scent too. Not drying and contains both green tea water and tea tree extract. Alcohol free too! Comes in a 50ml bottle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rant: &lt;strong&gt;Kikumasumune High Moist lotion.&lt;/strong&gt; This made my skin break out, probably the ferments. Using some on my hair and gave the rest of the bottle to my grateful friend. I gave this a good go, but to no avail. I ordered the Hada Labo Gokujyun lotion to try out soon. What a pretty bottle though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Non AB raves: &lt;strong&gt;Simple Cleansing Oil&lt;/strong&gt; This is not only cheap as chips, but contains grapeseed oil as the base oil (which is high in linoleic acid which is good for acne prone skin). It also has both Vitamin A &amp;amp; E and leaves my skin soft and clean. Dissolves all my make-up easily too. There&amp;#39;s no fragrance in this and is good for sensitive skin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser&lt;/strong&gt; Been looking for a gentle milk cleanser, and this ticks all the boxes. I use this on a dry face and just massage for about two minutes and rinse everything off. Replacing my foam cleanser with this has worked great for my skin. It also comes in a big 200ml bottle for \u00a312.

I didn't have high hopes for this lip balm at all, like when I bought it I was 80% sure this was either going to irritate the shit out of my lips/make them swell up or it was not going to do anything and leave my lips even drier. I wanted it anyway because I'm immature and I like pokemon.\n\nMan this Charmander lip balm was just as bad as I thought it was going to be. First of all, I was excited to order the thing because based on the promo pictures and based on the Pokemon eyeshadow palettes I bought, I thought the Pokemon characters were going to be screen printed directly onto the tubes. I can't even tell you how disappointed I was when I unboxed the lip balm and found out it was actually just a Charmander sticker with a clear background wrapped around the tube. Smh at Tonymoly, y'all couldn't have spent a few more cents to print these pokemon directly onto the packaging? I got my own stickers that I can stick on to my AB stuff for free, foh with that noise Tonymoly, can't believe y'all are making people pay a few bucks more just for a sticker ( \uff40_\u309d\u00b4).\n\nANYWAY, I do have a few positive things I wanna point out before jumping back into the negatives. The balm stick looked kinda matte/dry in the tube (like really hard wax), but when I applied it to my lips it immediately melted into a super soft and super glossy texture. The pinky orange color also looked really nice on my lips. The scent actually smells like grapefruit and it even has that citrus bite that I love about grapefruit. It also kinda tasted a little sour/bitter like a real grapefruit, but I'm not sure if it's actually supposed to be flavored or if I just imagined it because it smelled so strongly of grapefruit.\n\nBack to the negatives. I decided to finally unbox this to try last night because my lips were painfully dry and I figured I'd let the balm sink in and condition my lips overnight to get my lips back to being soft. When I applied it, it gave me that glossy sheen that I mentioned before, but it never ever sunk into my lips and moisturized them. It's not heavy in texture (like it's not thick and goopy like a lip gloss), so it just felt like I had a light sheen of chicken grease sitting on my desert dry lips the whole night. Even though it felt weird and gross, I resisted wiping it off because I still had a little hope that it'd work its magic while I was sleeping. PSYCH, I woke up and my lips were still dry as hell and greasy as hell at the same time. Ya done goofed on this one Tonymoly. The color was still nice, and it still smelled good when I woke up though. I will probably layer this on top of plain vaseline in the future just so I can use up the tube.

Sensitivities include, but are not limited to: Nut/Seed Butters, most oils, fatty alcohols and high amounts of silicones.\n\nFor application, I recommend more thin layers over 1-2 thicker layers. I did 2 thicker layers, and while I experienced no pilling on the second layer, each layer felt greasy/oily and actually looked like I had water droplets on my skin until I worked it in and it dried down. I am going to assume this is due to all the silicones. The first layer took a couple of minutes to dry down and the final layer took about 5 - 10 min. However, magic happened once the layers dried down! My face no longer felt greasy/oily and I had a beautiful smooth, satin (or demi matte if you prefer) look to my skin. My face did feel more moisturized after putting this on, but it was not so much that it made my oily skin feel congested. No white cast what so ever and the sunscreen felt lightweight, but not invisible. I would compare it to the feeling of wearing a lightweight liquid foundation. If you're not used to wearing a liquid foundation/bb cream/cc cream/etc. this could be a little heavy feeling for you. The best part for me was not having to put powder over this sunscreen, it actually dried down to a non tacky finish! You will also need a good oil/balm/cream cleaner to remove this sunscreen. When I tried to wash it off my hands, I had to use my oil cleanser to finally get my hand soap to suds again. This thing is tenacious!\n\nIt was in the high 80's/low 90's in AZ yesterday and I wore this for about 8 hours. I only had to blot once and at no point did my face ever feel tight or dehydrated! Which is very impressive since I normally have to blot several times during the day and mist at least once mid day to help counteract the dry, desert air. When I had to blot, the sunscreen felt heavy-ish (but all sunscreens and foundations do for me when it comes to blotting time), the feeling went back to lightweight after the blotting. At the blotting time, my face didn't look shiny, but it did look more on the dewy side. The finish went to a more glowy satin look after I blotted. It withstood sweating and my oily skin despite not being sebum resistant, I did not test the water resistant claims nor if it worked well under make-up. My Botanic Farm cleansing sherbet did successfully remove this at the end of the evening. Only further testing will tell if this will cause me to break out.\n\nOverall, I really like the wear and feel of this sunscreen, though I wish it came in a bigger bottle! I can see this working for combo leaning dry to oily skin types, dry and really dry skin types may have to moisturize well before putting this on.

Thanks!\n\n**Mini-Review: Illi Total Aging Care Cream Wash** - This is a really nice, non-drying body wash that I recently switched out from the much harsher Koji San Soap. I like that it doesn't smell too hanbang-y, like the Ryo Shampoo, and actually has a pleasant floralish scent. I bought a backup and will be using this until I find something better.  \n\n**Rave: Illi Total Aging Care Body Lotion** - Holy cow, I freaking love this stuff! This totally lives up to the hype! It's a little pricey for a body product for me, but I feel like it's totally worth it. It's very moisturizing for my dry, aging skin (T.T), but doesn't feel greasy. It does take a while to absorb, but I think the results are worth it. This will be replacing the kikumasamune duo in my body routine until the summer. I am going to try and get my hands on another bottle from my local Aritaum store, as it seems to be sold out everywhere online.  \n\n**Rave: Etude House Honey Cera Firming Body Cream** My only gripe about this is that it doesn't actually smell like honey. It has kind of an old lady perfumey smell that I'm not too fond of, but it performs well so I'm willing to live with that. It's VERY thick and very moisturizing, the color and consistency of butter, except that it doesn't really \"melt\" onto your skin. It also takes a minute to absorb, but my SO has been complimenting me on how soft my skin is since I started using it, so I feel the results are worth the wait. It helped tremendously in this past week to heal a photoallergic reaction I had to a non-AB sunscreen. I am almost done with the tub, and will be repurchasing.  \n\n**Rave: Daiso Eyebrow Gel** I'm not sure if I've raved about this here yet, but if so I'm going to re-rave! I finally found this at my local Daiso and it totally lives up to the hype. I swipe it over my eyebrows after drawing them in with a pencil, and then I take the spoolie end to lightly comb my eyebrows into place. Once it dries (within a few seconds), my eyebrows are set and don't really budge all day. I have very oily brows and lids and normally am having to constantly retouch, but with this I find that I hardly ever have to do that anymore. If you use an expensive pencil like the famed Shu Hard Formula, it would also save you some money from not having to reapply, thus using less product. Best $1.65 I have ever spent on a product! A+++++ ETA: I like it so much I bought 3 backups, but I've hardly even made a dent in my first bottle even though I use it everyday.

This totally lives up to the hype! It&amp;#39;s a little pricey for a body product for me, but I feel like it&amp;#39;s totally worth it. It&amp;#39;s very moisturizing for my dry, aging skin (T.T), but doesn&amp;#39;t feel greasy. It does take a while to absorb, but I think the results are worth it. This will be replacing the kikumasamune duo in my body routine until the summer. I am going to try and get my hands on another bottle from my local Aritaum store, as it seems to be sold out everywhere online.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rave: Etude House Honey Cera Firming Body Cream&lt;/strong&gt; My only gripe about this is that it doesn&amp;#39;t actually smell like honey. It has kind of an old lady perfumey smell that I&amp;#39;m not too fond of, but it performs well so I&amp;#39;m willing to live with that. It&amp;#39;s VERY thick and very moisturizing, the color and consistency of butter, except that it doesn&amp;#39;t really &amp;quot;melt&amp;quot; onto your skin. It also takes a minute to absorb, but my SO has been complimenting me on how soft my skin is since I started using it, so I feel the results are worth the wait. It helped tremendously in this past week to heal a photoallergic reaction I had to a non-AB sunscreen. I am almost done with the tub, and will be repurchasing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rave: Daiso Eyebrow Gel&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;ve raved about this here yet, but if so I&amp;#39;m going to re-rave! I finally found this at my local Daiso and it totally lives up to the hype. I swipe it over my eyebrows after drawing them in with a pencil, and then I take the spoolie end to lightly comb my eyebrows into place. Once it dries (within a few seconds), my eyebrows are set and don&amp;#39;t really budge all day. I have very oily brows and lids and normally am having to constantly retouch, but with this I find that I hardly ever have to do that anymore. If you use an expensive pencil like the famed Shu Hard Formula, it would also save you some money from not having to reapply, thus using less product. Best $1.65 I have ever spent on a product! A+++++ ETA: I like it so much I bought 3 backups, but I&amp;#39;ve hardly even made a dent in my first bottle even though I use it everyday. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AsianBeauty", "name": "t1_dgdtug7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480056.0, "created_utc": 1492451256.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w0u7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tflw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdyuiz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ipnh", "parent_id": "t3_65tflw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AsianBeauty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Mini Review :  Naisture Honey honey Mask Pack **\n\n**Bought From :**\n\nA couple of weeks ago, i bought this product for $7 from TJ MAXX when they had free shipping for all orders. \n\n**Skin Type:**\n\nCombination , Hormonal Acne , PIH \n\n**Presciption:**\n\nCurology ( 0,04% Tret ) \n\n**Packaging:**\n\nComes in a cute jelly jar .

I have some fine lines that all other sunscreens I've tried seem to accentuate. I just started using the Klairs sun lotion three days ago, but I'm almost ready to call it my HG. PROS: It helps hide my redness, does not dry my face out, and it works as a really great primer for my BB cream. CON (for some): it definitely has a white-blue cast. BUT I let mine soak in for about 10-15 minutes before I put on my creams and makeup, and I have noticed the blueness lessens over that time. The white/blue cast disappears completely with light makeup for me. In fact, another PRO here: I found that my BB cream looked flawless compared to how it looked with just a regular primer! CON NO. 2: Some people say it dried them out, but I didn't find this to be the case. I do, however, use a hydrating toner, a hydrating essence, a hydrating serum, and a high-end moisturizer so there's a lot of moisturizing going on over here.

I have some fine lines that all other sunscreens I&amp;#39;ve tried seem to accentuate. I just started using the Klairs sun lotion three days ago, but I&amp;#39;m almost ready to call it my HG. PROS: It helps hide my redness, does not dry my face out, and it works as a really great primer for my BB cream. CON (for some): it definitely has a white-blue cast. BUT I let mine soak in for about 10-15 minutes before I put on my creams and makeup, and I have noticed the blueness lessens over that time. The white/blue cast disappears completely with light makeup for me. In fact, another PRO here: I found that my BB cream looked flawless compared to how it looked with just a regular primer! CON NO. 2: Some people say it dried them out, but I didn&amp;#39;t find this to be the case. I do, however, use a hydrating toner, a hydrating essence, a hydrating serum, and a high-end moisturizer so there&amp;#39;s a lot of moisturizing going on over here.

Tints and dark lips don't go together but wow was I surprised. It's so damn pigmented it blows my mind. The color is such a lovely shade of red that really compliments my skin tone, rather than looking clownish like I feared. Staying power is amazing too. Once it's on there, it's not coming off. It feels a little sticky at first, but then you forget you even have anything on. I found it really easy to apply too. \n\n- **\u00c9tude House Dear My Blooming Lips-Talk Chiffon in RD315**\nThis lipstick is GORGEOUS. The color is more of a pinkish red on me but wow it's so pretty. The formula itself is so comfortable. It doesn't feel heavy or drying and it has a gorgeous satiny finish. I couldn't find reviews for these lipsticks on darker skins so I was again worried, but I love this one on me. It's also opaque with just one swipe even on my darker lips. Not 100% on the staying power as I haven't worn it for more than 2 hours but staying power for lipsticks never really bother me. \n\nand last but not least.......\n\n- **Peripera Peri's Ink Velvet in 06 'Celeb Deep Rose'**\nOkay right off the bat I should say that this is neither a deep or a rose color on me but it's just lovely. My favorite of the bunch. It's more a pinkish brown? Not sure how to describe it. I'm in love with the formula. It feels so moussey and comfortable, but not at all drying. It stains a really pretty pinkish color on my lips that lasts *hours.* I really don't know what else to say about this other than I'm really struggling to not go and buy every single shade. \n\nJust to throw this in there, my sister who is around NC45-50 and has very dark pigmented lips also loves and looks great in all these products as well.
