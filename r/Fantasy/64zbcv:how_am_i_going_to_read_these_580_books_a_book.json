I average about a book a week so I have more than 10 years of reading to go, assuming I don't buy any more, which I will.\n\nI love this collection and I do intend to read all of them, though I have decided that I have no more space for bookshelves in the house, so when I buy new books I have to find books to remove, which gives me the motivation I need to toss the odd James Patterson or Dean Koontz.\n\nThe biggest difficulty for me is actually that I feel pressure to read them. I am in the middle of many series, and I have other things I like to do with my time as well, so sometimes I feel guilty that I have so much left to read.\n\nI also struggle sometimes to choose, not because I don't know what they are, but because I DO. Just looking at my shelves, a dozen books pop out at me as things I've been wanting to read for a long time, but there are always new options. I started one series because my wife has been insisting for years, even though I was not in the mood for it. My current book I won on Goodreads so I feel obligated to review it in a timely manner. And then I know Oathbringer is coming out so I want to re-read the first two Stormlight books, which will be a glorious, enjoyable experience but will take a lot of time I could use to read new books!\n\nAnd finally, there are a lot of non-fiction books about important topics that I really want to read. I'm going through a life stage where I am learning a lot about myself and want to get better at being a husband, father, Christian, and all-around human being. There are another dozen books that I really kind of NEED to be reading for those reasons.\n\nAnd if those weren't enough difficulties, having such a large collection means that when I hear about a book I might really like, I am trying not to allow myself to read any that I don't already own, since I mostly buy bargains. So I'm sure I'm missing stuff I'd love, and libraries have lost all joy because I won't let myself take out books due to the massive number I have already.\n\nSo yeah, I feel your pain. =)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an outdated photo of my collection. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wHeJqEf.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/wHeJqEf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to my records I own 1,124 books, 730 of which are unread (only read 35% of my collection so far). I average about a book a week so I have more than 10 years of reading to go, assuming I don&amp;#39;t buy any more, which I will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love this collection and I do intend to read all of them, though I have decided that I have no more space for bookshelves in the house, so when I buy new books I have to find books to remove, which gives me the motivation I need to toss the odd James Patterson or Dean Koontz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest difficulty for me is actually that I feel pressure to read them. I am in the middle of many series, and I have other things I like to do with my time as well, so sometimes I feel guilty that I have so much left to read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also struggle sometimes to choose, not because I don&amp;#39;t know what they are, but because I DO. Just looking at my shelves, a dozen books pop out at me as things I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to read for a long time, but there are always new options. I started one series because my wife has been insisting for years, even though I was not in the mood for it. My current book I won on Goodreads so I feel obligated to review it in a timely manner. And then I know Oathbringer is coming out so I want to re-read the first two Stormlight books, which will be a glorious, enjoyable experience but will take a lot of time I could use to read new books!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, there are a lot of non-fiction books about important topics that I really want to read. I&amp;#39;m going through a life stage where I am learning a lot about myself and want to get better at being a husband, father, Christian, and all-around human being. There are another dozen books that I really kind of NEED to be reading for those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if those weren&amp;#39;t enough difficulties, having such a large collection means that when I hear about a book I might really like, I am trying not to allow myself to read any that I don&amp;#39;t already own, since I mostly buy bargains.

Oddly enough, those ways do not always involve actually **reading** to reduce my tsundoku (TBR) pile. :)\n\nI have given up on even the **idea** of ever reading all the books I ever want to read. My [comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/610tm9/how_do_you_hear_about_new_fantasy_books/dfav2gf/) should show that I look at way too many sources of book suggestions, and it always adds to my list.\n\nOne thing I *have* tried to do is to develop a priority list (you can see it in the last image [here](http://imgur.com/a/GSU9A)). I came up with this idea because I was feeling so overwhelmed about how to even TACKLE the idea of my piles o' books. I came up with a few categories.\n\n* **Library/Borrowed**: Books I borrow from the library or a friend--usually highest priority because they're either time limited (library) or I want to give them back to the friend ASAP (I have a friend I lent a book to about 8 years ago that I'm still waiting to be returned--probably not going to get it back because we fell out of touch!)\n* **Series Finishers/Catch-Ups**: Books where, if I finish it, I will either be done with the series, or caught up so that I can read any new releases right away.\n* **Gifted/Promised**: Books I was given for my birthday, holidays, or other occasions, or books I've promised a friend to read.\n* **Next in Series**: This is different from the Series Finishers because these are for books that I need to read MULTIPLE books--I filter my spreadsheet so that only the very next book I need to read for that series is visible (I don't want to panic myself about looong series, like Discworld or Nero Wolfe). My happiest day is when I'm done to only one left in the series and I can move the book up to Series Finishers.\n* **Short Fiction**: Where I put all the standalone short fiction (like from Tor.com), anthologies and collections. Over the last few years I've tried to make short fiction a bigger part of my routine, and plus, short stories are good lengths for commutes or reading at work.\n* **Received in 2010**: I mark the dates I get a book, and my oldest unread books date back to 2010, so I'm trying to read these suckers (the TBR 1+ year square for this year's bingo made me laugh, and laugh, and laugh...).\n\nI also have special priorities where don't really rank them, but they're more like \"projects\"--for instance, I'm deaf, so I have a \"Deaf\" project where I read authors I know are deaf (which is just uh, Teresa Frohock and Judith Tarr. I'm caught up with Frohock, still making my way through Tarr's catalog). I also go to the Capclave convention in DC every year, so I try to read stuff by the authors I've met there or plan to see there. And then my book clubs, too.\n\nI did a paper on procrastination when I was in high school, and I've always remembered one piece of advice: ***Eat the Elephant***. Meaning, how does one eat something as large as an elephant? One bite at a time.
