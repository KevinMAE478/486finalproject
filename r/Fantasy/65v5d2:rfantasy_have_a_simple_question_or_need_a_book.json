Starting midway through the series, Jordan started building more towards the series finale than individual book finales. Some people really (vocally) dislike this, I loved it and thought it made the series stronger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Robert Jordan passed away, his wife chose Brandon Sanderson to finish the series. He was to write the last book based on Jordan&amp;#39;s notes; however, there was so much there he expanded it into three books. Some of my favorite parts from the series are in these books. People will say Sanderson saved the series, but really he just benefited from all the lead up Jordan had plotted and written notes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah, the finale to the series is fantastic, and WoT is still one of my favorite series of all time. Sanderson is trying to take that spot with Stormlight Archives, but that will not be done for like 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dgduosw", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480977.0, "created_utc": 1492452177.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v5d2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge7mz2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "im_so_not_creative", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmlg8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm still in the middle of the series now, so i cant answer, but from what I've seen around here, yea.
