It felt like Grossman wanted to insult me, make me feel like fantasy was stupid and I was stupid for liking it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was this kind of air about it that was like, &amp;quot;haha magic actually SUCKS. Wizards are all ASSHOLES, myths and legends are actually wrong and everyone is ASSHOLES&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also what I&amp;#39;ll call an over abundance of suffering. Every single time something cool or nice might have happened, it was actually awful in the worst way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert from here down -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old man that wrote the Fillory books in the story - he wasn&amp;#39;t a kind old man at all. He was actually an abusing pedophilic rapist. He couldn&amp;#39;t have just been a racist drunk or been physically abusive and bitchslapped the kids? This happens throughout the book, every time something potentially cool is there, it turns out it sucks, and then it turns out it sucks in the most possible shitty and shocking way. You petitioned a goddess for help and strength? Surprise it was actually a trickster God who murdered your friends and raped you face down in their blood. Like seriously? The deal couldn&amp;#39;t have just been with the actual goddess but cost you something big? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get the idea that things aren&amp;#39;t all cool and fun and somethings the things we think are actually wrong - I understand where that was going. But it just felt like Grossman was shitting intentionally on all the things we as fantasy readers enjoy, to prove a point that we are all actually idiots. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dg660ai", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045312.0, "created_utc": 1492016512.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wdsi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ukrv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "petethehuman", "parent_id": "t1_dg5qs6j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ya, the hate for Quentin Coldwater seems to be the key element here.
