To wit: AVOID SCOTT ODEN LIKE THE PLAGUE!!  Jesus, this guy has some serious delusions of grandeur.  Ignore, for a moment, his choice of pen names (honestly, did he misspell *Odin* or did he name himself after a Japanese soup on purpose), I think he actually sees himself as the spiritual heir to Robert E. Howard.  Small problem -- where REH could write, Oden most assuredly cannot.\n\nI was unfortunate enough to snag an early copy of his first book, ***Men of Bronze*** (2005) -- thinking, based on the title, that it might be a titillating bit man-on-man action.  Sadly, no.  It's the story of a brooding murder-hobo who hates Greeks and snarls a lot.  There's a bit of cheap Egyptian theatrics cribbed from Cecil B. de\nMille and a metric assload of unpronounceable names -- I mean, come on . . . how the hell do you say *Udjahorresnet*, anyway?  There's some sturm-and-drang, a ham-handed attempt at a love story, and more cloven skulls than you can shake Set's gnarly pecker at.\n\nNot one to fade away and spare readers more of his drivel, Oden followed up with a book called ***Memnon***.  Apparently, it's about some loser who got steamrolled by Alexander the Great.  I'm sure in the hands of a competent writer, the life of Memnon of Rhodes would have been of some mild interest.  In Oden's purple-prosaic fists, however, it becomes a tedious exercise in trying to get  a two sheep (one nicknamed \"REH\" and the other given a bit of blush and called \"Mary Renault\") to shag on the bearskin rug of history, so they might have a love-child.

To wit: AVOID SCOTT ODEN LIKE THE PLAGUE!!  Jesus, this guy has some serious delusions of grandeur.  Ignore, for a moment, his choice of pen names (honestly, did he misspell &lt;em&gt;Odin&lt;/em&gt; or did he name himself after a Japanese soup on purpose), I think he actually sees himself as the spiritual heir to Robert E. Howard.  Small problem -- where REH could write, Oden most assuredly cannot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was unfortunate enough to snag an early copy of his first book, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Men of Bronze&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2005) -- thinking, based on the title, that it might be a titillating bit man-on-man action.  Sadly, no.  It&amp;#39;s the story of a brooding murder-hobo who hates Greeks and snarls a lot.  There&amp;#39;s a bit of cheap Egyptian theatrics cribbed from Cecil B. de\nMille and a metric assload of unpronounceable names -- I mean, come on . . . how the hell do you say &lt;em&gt;Udjahorresnet&lt;/em&gt;, anyway?  There&amp;#39;s some sturm-and-drang, a ham-handed attempt at a love story, and more cloven skulls than you can shake Set&amp;#39;s gnarly pecker at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not one to fade away and spare readers more of his drivel, Oden followed up with a book called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memnon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Apparently, it&amp;#39;s about some loser who got steamrolled by Alexander the Great.  I&amp;#39;m sure in the hands of a competent writer, the life of Memnon of Rhodes would have been of some mild interest.  In Oden&amp;#39;s purple-prosaic fists, however, it becomes a tedious exercise in trying to get  a two sheep (one nicknamed &amp;quot;REH&amp;quot; and the other given a bit of blush and called &amp;quot;Mary Renault&amp;quot;) to shag on the bearskin rug of history, so they might have a love-child.

If you cut out the sad attempts at jokes, this book would be about three pages long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: And son of a bitch, I just realized that he kept writing these.  16 stories worth of this crap, and they just get longer and worse.

Then, because he still didn't have enough material to rip off, he must have set up two screens side by side so he could watch *Ghost in the Shell* while playing *Metal Gear Solid*, and topped it all off with an amphetamine-fueled reading marathon of everything Michael Moorcock ever wrote that so much as mentioned the Eternal Champion or a Black Sword.\n\nHis villain is a white-haired wizard and tech magnate named Imaginos. You meet him in first chapter. Apparently he's also called Isaac Magnin. In fact, you can identify his other series-level bad guys by the fact that they have at least two names. One name must have come from the liner notes of a black metal album, and the other is meant to sound like the first.\n\nExcept for Ashtoreth. Apparently her name is Elisabeth Bathory. As in *that* [Elizabeth Bathory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory). But she insists that the whole \"blood countess\" thing was a vicious slander. She runs a chain of brothels called Xanadu House and a courtesan college called the Garden of Earthly Delights.\n\nOh, and the catnip thing? There's a reason for that. You see, Graybosch must have decided that elves were lame, but a fantasy novel can't just have humans, so he has catbros and catgirls living among humanity *Alien Nation* style.\n\nThat's right. In this novel and others in the Starbreaker cycle, your neighbor could have furry ears, slit pupils, and not be able to wear a bikini because she's got extra nipples. There's no mention on whether the catbros have barbed penises, though.\n\nThank God. Oh, speaking of God? Apparently Imaginos has him imprisoned under Antarctica until he can get some dude named Morgan Stormrider to kill him.\n\nFirst, what kind of ridiculous fucking name for a protagonist is Morgan Stormrider? Oh, right, it's a Final Fantasy pastiche, which features protagonists like Cloud Strife and Squall Leonheart.\n\nFortunately, Morgan's weapons aren't *nearly* as ridiculous. He favors a longsword and an 11.43mm USP semi-automatic pistol. Apparently he can load it with tranquilizer rounds like he's fucking Judge Dredd or some shit.\n\nOh, speaking of Judge Dredd, my girlfriend is reading this no-talent assclown's other novel **Silent Clarion**, and there's a crack about going \"full Dredd\".\n\nSo this guy's seen *Tropic Thunder*, too. How many kitchen sinks worth of pop culture references did he bake into these fucking books, anyway?\n\nRight, so how is Imaginos going to get Morgan Stormrider to kill God? Apparently, he's going to murder his ex and frame him or his new squeeze, some white-haired, red-eyed catgirl named Naomi Bradleigh. That's supposed to get Morgan screaming for vengeance or something, so all Imaginos has to do is make sure Morgan gets the series titular Sword of Plot Advancement, a sentient crystal runesword called the Starbreaker, and then put God between himself and Morgan like some kind of ablative meat shield.\n\nOh, but get this. Imaginos *knows* he's a bad guy, and wants Morgan to kill *him* too because he became a monster to fight monsters and lost a staring contest with the abyss or some similar fucking pseudo-intellectual Nietzschean bullshit.\n\nWhere the fuck did this clown go to college, anyway? His bio doesn't say, but it did make some crack about his mother's name was Rosemary.\n\nOh, and God isn't called God. He's called Sabaoth, which is supposed to mean \"Lord of Hosts\" or some shit. If this fucking novel had giant robots I'd figure he was ripping off fucking *Neon Genesis Evangelion* on top of all the other shit.\n\nOh, wait, he probably was. You see, instead of NERV there's this outfit called the Phoenix Society that rebuilt society after ~~Second Impact~~Nationfall. They have this hitmen called Adversaries that are supposed to be an order of civil libertarian knights who go after dirty politicians, abusive corporate executives, and priests who butt-fuck little kids instead of hiring hookers like normal people.\n\nAnd instead of three supercomputers collectively called Magi, the Phoenix Society has ten AIs called \"the Sephiroth\". And the most talkative one, Malkuth, apparently looks like Samuel L. Jackson and is human enough to utter such witticisms as, \"Say please, bitch.\"\n\nSo, Morgan is apparently one of these Adversaries, but he really really like to kill suspects instead of doing his job and arresting them. And he's all angsty about it because the Phoenix Society *lets* him do this shit instead of court-martialing his ass, so apparently he's helping tyrants instead of fighting them.\n\nThat's supposed to be deep, people.\n\nBut get this, Morgan isn't just a killer! He's a rock musician, too, who writes rock operas based on works of literature that even the author himself probably hasn't read like Percy Bysshe Shelley's *Prometheus Unbound* and that fucking Chinese novel about the cheeky monkey king, *Journey to the West*.\n\nThen again, maybe he *has* read them. He looks like the sort of pretentious wanker who has nothing better to do because nobody wants anything to do with him.\n\nOh, but let's talk about some of his other characters. Apparently he's trying to throw feminists and SJWs a bone, because at least half of his characters are women. Granted, he sticks one of them in the fridge, but if you pay close attention you'll see him setting up for what he apparently thinks is a clever twist right at the end.\n\nSo he not only thinks he's the second coming of Roger Zelazny and Hideo Kojima, but the new M. Night Shyamalan to boot. I bet that if he played guitar his practice sessions would consist primarily of speed-wanking in the tradition of Yngwie Malmsteen.\n\nOne of these characters is basically a more sociable version of Lisbeth Salander named Claire Ashecroft. Because this novel is basically something Graybosch wrote because he wishes he had friends and musical talent so he could start a prog metal band and write rock operas, Claire isn't just a l33t h@x0r but a pansexual slut and a complete fucking weeaboo.\n\nOh, and speaking of Japan? The third chapter is set there, and goes back and forth between Morgan and this chick named Chihiro Nakajima, who's basically a re-imagining of Tony Stark while listening to Deep Purple's \"Woman from Tokyo\". Oh, and she has an AI of her own. It's called Masamune. Why? Because she makes swords as well as guns.\n\nSo, Tony Stark + Hattori Hanzo. So the author must be a Quentin Tarantino fan, too. I shouldn't be surprised, given how much fucking dialogue there is in this book.\n\nOh, and watch out for viewpoint changes. In most chapters every scene break is a viewpoint change. You'll see things from the good guys perspective, the bad guys perspective, and there are lots of each.\n\nRight, so what else? Oh, yeah. The romance. Not only is there the one between Morgan and Naomi Bradleigh, who apparently can handle a sword like D'Artagnan and a keyboard like Keith Emerson or Jon Lord while singing like Sarah Brightman or Idina Menzel, but remember Imaginos? He's in love with this old sorceress named Thagirion who apparently turned an entire Fifth Avenue high-rise into a greenhouse and plays the cello in the New York Philharmonic. They have a magicians' duel near the end, followed by angry wizard sex.\n\nAnd speaking of sex? This guy's totally trying to impress his girlfriend or wife or dominatrix with how progressive he is because even when his villains get lucky they're gentle and enthusiastic muff divers who put their partner's pleasure first.\n\nBut if you're hoping that Imaginos will ruin Morgan's day by banging Naomi in front of him -- she's his daughter, you suck fuck.\n\nOf course, she doesn't know that yet.\n\nSo, yeah, this book is really fucking pretentious, it has an unnecessarily complex plot with way too many characters, all of his characters are fucking hipsters dropping obscure references at every opportunity, and he put way too much goddamn thought into catbro/catgirl biology.\n\nDespite all of **Without Bloodshed**'s flaws, most of which I haven't explored, the author deserves some credit for a few reasons:\n\n* While it's obvious you're reading a novel from the stylized dialogue, it's equally obvious he put a shitload of effort into writing interesting prose.\n* His computer hacking scenes are more realistic than most of the shit you see on TV or in movies.\n* If you read closely, the plot makes sense and the characters all seem to have reasons for doing the shit they do.\n* Even though **Without Bloodshed** is billed as \"Part One of Starbreaker\", the novel has a self-contained plot involving a gun-runner turned dictator that lets it stand alone.\n* It's only 320 pages in paperback, which if this wasn't such a monument to the author's pretentiousness would actually feel like it was too short for all the plot and characters he's crammed into this piece of shit.\n\nIf Matthew Graybosch wasn't so fucking self-indulgent, he might actually prove a decent writer. But we'll probably have to suffer through the rest of Starbreaker first unless that wife he won't shut up about puts her foot down and tells him to stop dicking around with this pastiche he probably started kicking around in high school so he could tell himself he's a writer and not just another socially defective nerd who was too chickenshit to talk to people and make friends.", "edited": 1492181635.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of dirt Matthew Graybosch had on his publisher, but it had to be weapons-grade blackmail material stolen from the KGB because there is no way &lt;strong&gt;Without Bloodshed&lt;/strong&gt; would have made it to print otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like the author smoked a pound of hydroponic catnip while playing old &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; games while listening to old Judas Priest, Queensryche, Nightwish, and Blue Oyster Cult albums.
