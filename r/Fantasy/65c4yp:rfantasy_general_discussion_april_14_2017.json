This is a historical fantasy romance that is about a guy that can see spirits and a girl spirit that finds him and together they work to solve her murder (she's lost her memory). There are other fantasy elements, like some kind of demon lady and iirc there are gods and stuff too. This was a really good drama, the acting was great (ok, the woman playing the evil demon mom was over the top but it made it fun), the love story was one of those 'we love each other but we can't be together' things which gave it this nice yearning feel, and it was just *really* visually appealing. Also, the fantasy aspect was handled well (which is my main gripe with fantasy dramas). \n\n* Can You Hear My Heart. This is a modern day fantasy romance. The fantasy aspect is that there is a guy that can hear other people's thoughts. It's also a law drama (I have a feeling the law aspects of this would drive real lawyers crazy so if that's an issue, might want to skip). Anyway, the main themes of this show is law vs justice vs vengeance. What is doing the right thing vs what *feels* right? It's got *such* a great villain and one of my favorite love stories. Also when it pulls out a typical kdrama trope (like amnesia) and I'm ready to roll my eyes, it somehow manages to do it well. The pacing in this one is also pretty good throughout all the episodes, that's something a lot of kdramas suffer from.\n\n* Faith (aka The Great Doctor). This is one of many time traveling romances.  A doctor from modern day goes through a doorway in time to mid-1300's Korea (at the time the end of the Goryeo Dynasty that was kind of under rule by the Yuan Dynasty of China--interesting period in history!) This is not the best executed drama, however I stuck with it because I liked the main female character, she was hilarious. The secondary romance between two of the side characters was more satisfying for me than the main romance and I did spend sometimes laughing at the show instead of with the show because some of the plot points were so ridiculous, but it may be worth checking out.\n\n* Gu Family Book. I didn't watch much of this one, but it was ok, just not for me. It's a historical fantasy drama about a guy that his half human, half gumiho (a legendary nine-tailed fox creature).\n\n* Master's Sun. Oh, I liked this one quite a bit, the romance was fun. It started off with a bang, then took a bit to get going again and was pretty good throughout the rest of the show. There is a woman that can see spirits. They really scare her. One day she meets a man that when she touches him it turns off her ability to see spirits. So of course she wants to cling to him always, which results in much hilarity. There are other things going on too, but I really enjoyed the relationship in this one.\n\n* Queen In-Hyun's Man. Another time travel fantasy romance. This one takes place half in modern times and half in Joseon times. For me, the main focus of this drama is the romance between a Joseon era scholar and a modern day actress, everything else falls by the wayside. There is a bit of lack of consistency with the way the time travel works in the show, but, meh, this is par for the course with fantasy elements in dramas imo.\n\n* Scholar Who Walks the Night. If you like vampires, this is a good drama. It's a historical vampire romance woot. It's not the best executed drama in the world, but I really enjoyed it. The pacing was a bit lacking here and there. I don't often see vampire dramas done well, and I thought this one was done well enough.\n\n* You From Another Star (aka My Love From the Star). This one is about an alien that arrives on Earth 400 years ago and is sorta kinda immortal (or just very very long lived?). Most of it takes place in modern times, but some of it takes place in various parts of history, mostly in flashbacks. The alien has all sorts of powers like enhanced hearing and can freeze time, move objects with his mind. He tries not to get too close to humans because people are always dying and also when they find out his secret they tend to turn on him. Enter, a famous actress that moves in next door. Also there is a serial killer on the loose because why not? The best part of this drama imo is the main female character, she is just so hilariously played by Jun Ji-Hyun. She's not exactly an idiot, but she does a lot of dumb things and she's used to getting her way because of being famous and the alien dude is just not having it. Hijinks ensue.\n\nAnywho. That's a few of them, good enough to get you started. :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so here&amp;#39;s my list with some notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arang and the Magistrate.
