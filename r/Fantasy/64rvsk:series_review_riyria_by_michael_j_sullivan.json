There is very little magic in the world, with only a few characters capable of practicing the &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; The standard Tolkien races like elves, dwarves, and goblins are present but they are presented in an original way that feels fresh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Legends of the First Empire series takes place about 3000 years before the other two series and follows the events that lead to the founding of the pre-Riyria empire. I hadn&amp;#39;t read any bronze-age fantasy before this and it was a really nice change of pace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might have seen the names Royce and Hadrian popping up a lot around here, and for good reason. Royce and Hadrian &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; Riyria. Royce is the dark and brooding rogue with a troubled past and a tendency to get a little stabby.

Their bromance is incredible and you can&amp;#39;t help but to fall in love with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Legends of First Empire follows different characters. You get to see Raithe, the reluctant god-killer; Suri, a child seer with a pet wolf; and Persephone, and older woman trying to do what&amp;#39;s best for her tribe. All of these characters are beautifully written.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Revelations, Royce and Hadrian are framed for the murder of a king. The resulting quest to prove their innocence gradually builds in scope until the series reaches full epic fantasy levels. The first book has an intentionally simple plot, reading almost like a fantasy action movie. Each successive book adds character depth and plot complexity, making this trilogy one of my absolute favorites. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Riyria Chronicles is a prequel series to Revelations, with each book capable of standing on its own. It tells the story of how Royce and Hadrian met. If you think they are opposites in Revelations, just wait until you see how they started! This series fleshes out many of the side characters from the original series and has small easter eggs for both Revelations and Legends of the First Empire. Want to read some solid sword and sorcery hijinks and adventure? This might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legends of the First Empire (starts with Age of Myth) begins with a human from one of several bronze-age tribes killing a seemingly immortal god. In the chaos that follows, a reluctant god-killer, a young seer with visions of impending doom, and an older woman seeking to unite her tribe must band together to save humanity. Age of Myth is a strong start to this series, and the next book is coming out in June!

Yes, there is plenty of action, and yes, the action is awesome. However, you get loads of character-focused scenes, too.

If you can make it past Book 1 in Revelations (which is by far the weakest of any Riyria book, but still a pretty good book in its own right), then you&amp;#39;re in for a treat. And if you don&amp;#39;t want to start there, Riyria Chronicles and Age of Myth are both excellent, as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These books are by no means dark, but don&amp;#39;t think that means you won&amp;#39;t shed a tear or ten.
