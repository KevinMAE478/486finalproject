Its a fantasy in that there is magic, undead sorcerers, gods, golems etc... but it is set in a &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; seeming world, with talk of return on investments, financial markets, world wars etc... I guess I&amp;#39;m going to put it in &amp;quot;urban-fantasy&amp;quot; but it seems to be coming to that genre from a mirror direction - instead of our own modern world with &amp;quot;fantasy&amp;quot; thrown in, this book is a magical world that has evolved to match the &amp;quot;technology&amp;quot; of our modern world...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be honest, and say that the first half of this book felt like a pain to read. It felt too close to home - with bureaucratic annoyances and a character going through a general malaise towards life... &amp;quot;Kai&amp;quot; (one of the main PoV characters) could have been just about any mid-level investment banker, her attitudes and opinions were very familiar - and depressing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, the worldbuilding of this magical place put a strange twist on this. Mr Gladstone took a old mythic trope - that you can sell your soul - and extrapolated that onwards in a fantastic way. Prayer and soul-stuff is literally the currency of this world - and so there is a whole market based around it. In this &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; magic world there is an international marketplace for prayer and soul-stuff. So priests are the &amp;quot;investment bankers&amp;quot; of this world. It is fascinating! Kai is a &amp;quot;investment banker&amp;quot; who makes Idols - non sentient gods - that allow worshippers to pick and choose what returns they want on their investments, and to keep their investments (souls) away from the Gods and Magicians of this world...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it clicked, the way everything flowed out from this basic idea was astounding. What would you do if you were an investment banker and your &amp;quot;investment account&amp;quot; suddenly came alive and started spending money itself? What would your bosses do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this was two main stories intertwined - Kai is the priest who discovers that the Idols are being &amp;quot;killed off&amp;quot;, and due to a rash action gets involved in a legal case where her Order is being sued for &amp;quot;financial mismanagement&amp;quot;. The other story is about a street kid (Izza) in a gang of thieves who&amp;#39;s goddess (The Blue Lady) died and left them with nothing, and is struggling to get enough soul-stuff to buy her way off the island and into a better life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the two stories are linked - the death of the Blue Lady and the &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; of the Idol happen at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, the first half of this novel is intellectually interesting in that I liked the worldbuilding and extrapolation of ideas, but I could never really connect to either of the PoV characters, and the flow of the writing seemed to go on a little too much. Everything felt somewhat held at a distance. I kept on getting tired and putting the book down. But that all changed at the halfway point where the link between the stories became crystal clear, and the characters each made a solid decision about what they were doing... Everyone had a driving goal and was acting to try to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story developed some serious pace!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pretty much read the rest of the book in a single day (yeah, I&amp;#39;ll get to those chores in a little while) because all that boring first half full of day to day minutia suddenly becomes very important. &lt;a href=\"#s\" title=\"My favourite scene is when Kai is held at knifepoint by Izza, and she uses her training as a saleswoman (which is totally out of a telemarketing handbook!) to defuse the situation and get Izza onto her side.\"&gt;spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say that Max Gladstone is doing a fantastic job, he is taking some old fantasy tropes that often feel overdone or tired, and imagining how the modern world would look if those tropes were a reality..
