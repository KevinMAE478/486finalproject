The POV characters are interesting and fun to read one and all, and Vlora in particular--the leader of a mercenary company, for those of you who&amp;#39;re unfamiliar with McClellan&amp;#39;s work-- is a great, fun lead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Explosive. That&amp;#39;s one word I&amp;#39;d use to describe the action in Sins of Empire. It leaves you hungering for more, and I can&amp;#39;t wait to read the sequel. I&amp;#39;ll be writing a full-on review later down the line; might very well post it in a thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also back on my quest to finish the Black Company series, by Glen Cook. Currently at Book 7 - She is Darkness; the stakes are big and getting bigger. I&amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing what happens next.

Now, I definitely loved this book and I plan to read the rest of the series and I totally get the hype around it.  But I did feel like, for me, the pacing started to drag during the last half of the book.  Every time I picked it up to read it, I was enjoying the story but it also wasn't holding my attention.  It was a weird experience and ultimately it took a bit of concentrated effort to push through the last half of the book.  I will own that I am having some concentration challenges right now, so it is harder for me to focus on much of anything.  However, even with those challenges I tore through the first half of the book.  So, just something to note about it!  Overall I thought it was fantastic and I still highly recommend it!  I thought the setting was, of course, freaking fantastic.  The characters are well rounded and there is a good amount of tension in the plot.

Now, I definitely loved this book and I plan to read the rest of the series and I totally get the hype around it.  But I did feel like, for me, the pacing started to drag during the last half of the book.  Every time I picked it up to read it, I was enjoying the story but it also wasn&amp;#39;t holding my attention.  It was a weird experience and ultimately it took a bit of concentrated effort to push through the last half of the book.  I will own that I am having some concentration challenges right now, so it is harder for me to focus on much of anything.  However, even with those challenges I tore through the first half of the book.  So, just something to note about it!  Overall I thought it was fantastic and I still highly recommend it!

The intermixing of Jewish-inspired magic and folklore (the Golem) and Syrian (the Jinni) is beautiful.  This reminds me very much of a Guy Gavriel Kay book with the well-researched historical settings, beautiful prose, and magic that seems entirely natural to the narrative.  Added bonus, this book can work in 7 different bingo squares (is that a record?) - Goodreads BOTM, Debut Novel, To Read for 1 Year or More, Award Winning, Desert Setting (arguably, via the Jinni&amp;#39;s backstory), Non-Human Protagonist, and AMA Author. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next up, Dragonwriter - a collection of tributes to Anne McCaffrey by people who knew her/worked with her.  I&amp;#39;ve been a huge fan of Anne McCaffrey&amp;#39;s work for years (even the obscure stuff) and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to reading these pieces.  I hit on it when I saw a mention of Elizabeth Moon writing a piece for this book.  Things work in strange ways sometimes.  I&amp;#39;m planning to use this for the Non-Fiction Fantasy Related Book (even if Anne was decisive that she wrote SF, not F books) - hopefully it&amp;#39;ll be ok!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dg5ktev", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492008241.0, "created_utc": 1491979441.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qem0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hdt1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wintercal", "parent_id": "t3_64qem0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Finished *A Turn of Light* on Sunday.
