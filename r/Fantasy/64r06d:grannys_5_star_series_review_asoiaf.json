It seems long....&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would argue for most people who love the show would also love the books, maybe even a little more especially if you&amp;#39;re into the complexity and background plots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After season 3, there are major drifts away from the books with characters missing, huge plot changes, and a bunch of other stuff that &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; keep the novels fresh and exciting. By season 6 many plot lines are utterly unrecognizable from their book counter points. To be brief: Jaime never goes to Dorne, nor does Bronn and there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;bad pussy&amp;quot;, (and those sand snakes aren&amp;#39;t cringey). Sansa is NOT being married to Ramsay Snow, and Brienne is in the riverlands looking for her, not at Winterfell. There&amp;#39;s lots of stuff like that, so here&amp;#39;s my spiel on why the first three are 5 star books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even before the major changes to the plot and characters there&amp;#39;s a level of depth that&amp;#39;s missing, and I don&amp;#39;t think the show could have done anything about it. You get inner dialogue and thoughts and memories from these characters that are almost completely gone from the show. It wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense for it to be on the show so it&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m knocking it for, but it does amplify the awesome of the books. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man oh man are there a ton of POV&amp;#39;s and characters in these books! I think that Georges strength outside of his world building would absolutely be his character development. I feel like I have pages and pages of stuff I could say about how wonderful, believable, likable, hate-able his characters are, and how masterfully well done the arcs are for each character, and how sometimes he even plays arcs off of multiple characters (Looking at you Jaime and Brienne). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 14 main POV&amp;#39;s. Yes, that&amp;#39;s right. Add to that 10 more POV&amp;#39;s that are more like side characters (my personal favorite is Davos). Then there are prologue and epilogue characters that only show up once for each. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The major detraction I see people cite for huge casts of characters is that you don&amp;#39;t get to spend enough time with each one to get to know them, care about them, and invest in their story. Even with just the prologue and epilogue characters you get to know them in a single chapter. I find that remarkable. It takes unbelievable sense of &amp;quot;humanity&amp;quot; and characterization to pull that off and IMHO he does it exceedingly well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are just too many characters to talk about them all here in this blurb, but I&amp;#39;ll highlight one that I love, one that I have a love-hate relationship with, and one that I fucking despise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE ME SOME BARRISTON SELMY. Barriston the Bold, the most badass gray haired warrior I&amp;#39;ve read about, he reminds me a lot of Dalinar Kholin except he doesn&amp;#39;t really want to lead. He has an almost unwavering sense of honor that&amp;#39;s known throughout the world. He&amp;#39;s an older, more mature protagonist with a wealth of life experiences that&amp;#39;s so intriguing to read about since much of the cast is under 40. This guy was ousted by the brat Joffrey Baratheon from the White Knights (the royal guard) and cut his way through multiple guards sent to stop him when he was leaving the city. He treks halfway around the world to find someone to serve, because that&amp;#39;s his purpose in life in his eyes. To serve, to protect, to die for the rightful heir to the throne. We get to see deep regrets come to the surface, we get to see memories of things that have happened before most people were born in this series, and I love him to bits and pieces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LOVE-HATE. Catelyn Stark. This is a character steeped in tragedy, bitterness, and woe. Before we get to really see her in action in her POV&amp;#39;s we get this &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; brutal dialogue between her and another character, Jon Snow. We&amp;#39;ve already gotten to know and somewhat sympathize with Jon, so seeing her lash out for something he never could have prevented (existing) telling him she wished he had died was shocking and an interesting intro to a character. We see her give great advice, and we see her give terrible advice through her sons campaign against the Iron Throne. There are a few things she told her son that could have saved the war, but then she does something that almost certainly will lose the war for them as well. She goes through unspeakable loss through the books and even though she wasn&amp;#39;t the most likable character created, it&amp;#39;s hard not to feel for her through her losses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HATE-HATE Fuck you, Cersei. This bitch is full of fire and impulsive and stupid behaviors. We get to see flash backs of her past, and she was a bitch then too. This isn&amp;#39;t a terrible spoiler - she kills a &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; of hers in childhood by pushing her down a well and tortures her baby brother because she blames him (Tyrion) for her mothers death. She turns on people the moment they question her, family included. She berates her children when they don&amp;#39;t do what she wants them to do, and also spoils them retarded, defending even the most heinous of acts. I blame her for much of what Joffrey turns into - which is a pathological murderous bag of fuck sticks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you could say that this book elicits strong emotions. I like that, even when I hate it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plot/Setting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has a very traditional medieval feel to it, and actually since Martin loves history much of this is historically accurate - as in the technology available, foods, agriculture techniques and all that jazz. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plot is extensive. There&amp;#39;s a war for the throne and what&amp;#39;s cool is you get to see it from like 5 different perspectives. You literally see all sides of the war from people involved, to people looking in. There&amp;#39;s also a subplot for another character that&amp;#39;s taking place on an entirely different continent so you get to explore different cultures, magics, peoples and cities on top of the traditional medieval setting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacing/tone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so here&amp;#39;s where my opinion may vary from others, and really the more people I talk to about this series, the more opinions I get on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pace is steady for books 1 and 2, fast for 3, and slows back down in books 4 and 5. My first reaction to reading book 4 and 5 when they were  first published was not overwhelmingly good - mainly because some of my favorite characters didn&amp;#39;t show up in book 4 at all, and I had been waiting on that for years, then it would be years before I saw Tyrion again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason this happened was because book 4 got split into 2 different books that are actually happening within the same timeline. So, Chapter 1 of Book 4 is happening at roughly the same time as chapter 1 of book 5. This negative impact can be entirely ignored if you want to go to Boiled Leather which gives you a list of chapters that is roughly a straight through read in chronological order. You&amp;#39;d be reading both books 4 and 5 at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-readerfriendly-combined-reading-order-for-a\"&gt;http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-readerfriendly-combined-reading-order-for-a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I also had a more negative reaction to books 4 and 5 at first because that was back in a time where I was really focused on plot, and I was coming off of reading book 3 which was packed full of action. My reading tastes changed, and now I actually look for more slow burn, intricate, complicated world building with character arcs and themes that flow from one book to the next. Upon re-reading and getting older/tastes changing books 4 and 5 are held in the same esteem as the first three, &lt;em&gt;for me in my opinion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Verbose and descriptive. If you get annoyed with a lot of food descriptions, setting descriptions and character descriptions this may not be for you. I used to get annoyed with a bit until I realized he was telling an under-story with much of it. What I mean by that is, with this series there&amp;#39;s a WEALTH of unspoken plot. For instance, you may be introduced to a character who remains unnamed in the first book, but whose description would be like &amp;quot;long greasy black curls, hooked nose, with a scar&amp;quot;. 4 books later that same character pops up again named and part of the plot. Back in book 1 that character IS significant, you just don&amp;#39;t know it yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The re-read value of this series is off the charts insane. I have re-read this at LEAST 2 dozen times per book and I still pick things up and have &amp;quot;AH HAH&amp;quot; moments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t like books 4 and 5? that&amp;#39;s okay, I get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure if we&amp;#39;re going to see a conclusion to this series? That&amp;#39;s fair, I get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please, lets not have this turn into a shit show on Martins behalf though. Dude has pushed out some amazing literature and I really believe it deserves the 5 stars I&amp;#39;m giving it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm riding the coat tails of another thread posted today about them doing a re-read for the first time in 6-7 years u/tkinsey3 and I figured since this review was already 80% done I'd tweak it and post it to ride the coattails of that review - I figure it might help bring the point home that these series are worth reading, and absolutely worth re-reading as well. \n\n**Intro**\n\n*\"I've already watched the series, is this really worth reading?
