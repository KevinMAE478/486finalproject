This boy begins to learn magic from his aunt, the village witch, and some wandering weatherworkers.

While out gathering herbs, Ged meets the daughter of the local lord and fails to impress her with his limited magic. He goes through Ogion's spells and accidentally summons a shadow monster (classic Ged). Ogion banishes it before things get out of control and tells Ged the girl he met was a witch. Ged then sails on the ship named ~~fore~~Shadow for the wizard school on Roke Island. \n\n**Ch. 3: The School for Wizards**\n\nGed enters the school for wizards by giving the gatekeeper his true name, and a shadow follows him.

I can&amp;#39;t believe how much I&amp;#39;m enjoying it! The style of writing, pace, and magic system seem so modern, and yet I&amp;#39;ve never heard of the author or series before. Unlike Potter, you aren&amp;#39;t stuck in school for years, and the journey embarks right away. Excited to continue the journey with you all, and over other books!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;ve seen this book mentioned as a nice stand-alone from the rest of the series.
