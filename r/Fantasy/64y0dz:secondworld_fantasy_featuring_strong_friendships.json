He&amp;#39;s very good with the other kind of friendship this thread is about -- there&amp;#39;s also Kaladin and Syl, Kelsier and Vin, Raoden and Karata, Sarene and the group of the Prince&amp;#39;s political allies -- and of course he likes his bromances. With all that, the lack of female friendships seems conspicuous. He&amp;#39;s not the only favorite writer of mine who has trouble in that area. I love Juliet Marillier with all my heart, and I appreciate the way she endows female characters in what might be considered &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; roles with insight, cleverness, and complexity -- but I can&amp;#39;t think of a single heroine in all her work who has a significant female friend. In &amp;quot;Daughter of the Forest,&amp;quot; for example, Sorcha bonds with the male friends of her eventual love interest, but the sole woman who treats her kindly is dropped like the proverbial hot potato, as if she never mattered at all. The heroines may interact with other women with casual good will, but they tend not to form anything as important as an actual friendship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dg7hm2p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116354.0, "created_utc": 1492087554.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ybzd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "perditorian", "parent_id": "t3_64y0dz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh man - this is my jam.
