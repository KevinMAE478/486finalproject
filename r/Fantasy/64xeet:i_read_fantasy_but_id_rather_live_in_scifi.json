And even then, no matter how hard he works, he'll never be able to bend even a little bit because he wasn't born with the ability, and as a result even a fairly average bender could kick his ass sideways every single time.\n\n&gt;As for LoK, I think Amon's argument fails in that it blames their oppression on benders' privilege. The goal should not be to tear others down, but to make all people equal. When one group is oppressed and the other is not we don't blame them, we should blame the people that uphold this oppression.\n\nI think you're letting real world politics spill over into this a bit - my whole point is that this isn't equatable to anything in the real world because the real world doesn't work that way. Anyone who isn't specifically disabled in some manner can work to improve themselves in any field - but that's not true with Bending or other magic systems like it.\n\n&gt;The show starts out with benders and non benders sharing equal rights.

As long as we don't say that an unfair world is what we should strive for, which I don't think these stories do, then I am fine.\n\nThe problem is in the way they depict unfairness. I agree that the world is unfair, and fictional worlds should generally reflect that, but in reality there are few situations where unfairness cannot be overcome to some degree through hard work and effort (ie. everyone can improve at least relative to themselves), whereas this isn't the case with magic systems like Bending (or Channeling from WOT, or Skill/Wit from Farseer, or magic from Harry Potter, or etc etc etc. )\n\nIn fact the only fantasy world I can think of off the top of my head which doesn't have this weird binary magic divide is D&amp;D settings like Forgotten Realms, where magic is primarily a learned skill.
