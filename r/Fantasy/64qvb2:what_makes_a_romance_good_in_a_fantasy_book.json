That's far from the only romance plot, but it's a cliche for a good reason--it's the furthest possible change from start to finish. But a romance doesn't have to go from pianissimo to fortissimo to show range--the evolution of a close childhood friendship to complex estrangement to romance to being on opposite sides of a war is the plot of two of my favorite recent romantic reads. ([Broad strokes spoilers](#s \"That's both Claudia Gray's Lost Stars and Charlie Jane Anders's All the Birds in the Sky\")) All those notes let us really follow how these two characters grow together. This is the narrative problem of simple love at first sight that is never truly shaken--you can have the characters separated or endangered, but then your plot is about adventure, not romance. Even the most unshakable relationship can be dynamic in this way--I don't think I've loved any couple more than Coach and Tami Taylor from Friday Night Lights. They are happily married throughout and still manage to show a ton of relationship changes. \n\nFor me personally, to really hit it out of the park on romance I also want some tragedy. Give me Casablanca. Put your characters on opposite sides of a war. Give me \"in the few hours we had together, we loved a lifetime worth.\"\n\nThings I'm not into--main characters who everyone is throwing themselves at for no real reason. People point this finger at Twilight, but I see this as a staple of white dude fiction.

When you've got some wishy-washy protagonist beating them off with a stick, I just roll my eyes.

Even the most unshakable relationship can be dynamic in this way--I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve loved any couple more than Coach and Tami Taylor from Friday Night Lights. They are happily married throughout and still manage to show a ton of relationship changes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me personally, to really hit it out of the park on romance I also want some tragedy. Give me Casablanca. Put your characters on opposite sides of a war. Give me &amp;quot;in the few hours we had together, we loved a lifetime worth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things I&amp;#39;m not into--main characters who everyone is throwing themselves at for no real reason. People point this finger at Twilight, but I see this as a staple of white dude fiction. It&amp;#39;s bad enough with a powerful attractive hero like Darrow from Red Rising where at least you can kind of see the appeal (though heroes make terrible boyfriends and you&amp;#39;d think people as smart as &lt;a href=\"#s\" title=\"Mustang and what&amp;#39;s-her-name the bad one\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would figure that one out). When you&amp;#39;ve got some wishy-washy protagonist beating them off with a stick, I just roll my eyes. Good romance is about a strong connection between two (or more--I love me sme poly romances) specific people, not a bunch of pigeons fighting over the best breadcrumb because he&amp;#39;s the biggest and the strongest and the best at everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dg4i8sn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957094.0, "created_utc": 1491928294.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvb2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kqn9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "darkmattergods", "parent_id": "t3_64qvb2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Two well developed characters who are original and a believable reason for those two characters to fall in love", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two well developed characters who are original and a believable reason for those two characters to fall in love&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dg4kqn9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959823.0, "created_utc": 1491931023.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvb2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4sat6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FakeOrcaRape", "parent_id": "t3_64qvb2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I cannot stand most romance in fantasy, but only because of the way it's usually done.

Having their lives revolve around each other right from the get-go *can* work, but having them be *people* before *love interests* would be more effective. \n\n\nIn that regard, I'd say avoid making either one of them too stereotypical. Their relationship should be unique in its own ways, make the audience care for them as a unit by emphasizing what makes them special. Having the girl hate the boy on the surface but secretly love him has been done to death, as has the boy being completely clueless when it comes to the idea of romance. \n\n\nHaving chemistry definitely helps. I'll support a couple if they genuinely like each other and have some banter. Making their \"love\" an extra serious thing where neither ever smiles kind of defeats the purpose. \n\n\nAlso, I would generally avoid making the romance the center of the work, as the audience might see it coming and feel pressured to like the couple, which might lead to resentment and belief that it is cliche. Also, however, avoid making it feel like it is tacked-on. If the romance is there just for the sake of itself, it feels like every action movie ever. It's a delicate balance to maintain, between neither making the romance uber-central nor on the fringes and pointless. Make the audience feel something for them. \n\n\nMake it develop naturally. If they are in love with each other after three minutes, I tend to write it off as cliche and boring. If they have time for their relationship to breathe and develop, however, over months and years and with ups and downs, then I'll like it a lot more. \n\n\nWhile tragic endings and forced separations are cliche in themselves, they can be extremely powerful. Probably 80% of the romantic pairings I like have the characters irreparably separated across time or space. I don't know what that says about me, but I think tragedy makes people long for atonement like nothing else. Some of the most poignant stories have their couples being broken up, in my opinion. Partially because it subverts the traditional happy ending, partially because it makes the audience yearn to somehow fix things, investing them in the story with that longing. Maybe audiences are just always sadistic, we love it when characters have been beat to shit, and so nothing makes us love a couple like them being torn apart. Notable, though, that generally having people like the relationship beforehand by using the other points above would make this last point more effective. If you despise both lovers, or simply do not care about them, then tearing them apart does nothing. The audience should generally like the couple, should be leaning towards supporting them, when this tragic ending is utilized. It should be the coup de grace, the home run that wraps up the game, the punch in the gut that everything else builds to. If you want a tragic ending, that is. \n\n\nJust some of my ideas, opinions. ", "edited": 1491924685.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few points can help:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liking both characters, each one being distinct and having development of their own. Having their lives revolve around each other right from the get-go &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work, but having them be &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; before &lt;em&gt;love interests&lt;/em&gt; would be more effective. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that regard, I&amp;#39;d say avoid making either one of them too stereotypical. Their relationship should be unique in its own ways, make the audience care for them as a unit by emphasizing what makes them special. Having the girl hate the boy on the surface but secretly love him has been done to death, as has the boy being completely clueless when it comes to the idea of romance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having chemistry definitely helps. I&amp;#39;ll support a couple if they genuinely like each other and have some banter. Making their &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; an extra serious thing where neither ever smiles kind of defeats the purpose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I would generally avoid making the romance the center of the work, as the audience might see it coming and feel pressured to like the couple, which might lead to resentment and belief that it is cliche. Also, however, avoid making it feel like it is tacked-on. If the romance is there just for the sake of itself, it feels like every action movie ever. It&amp;#39;s a delicate balance to maintain, between neither making the romance uber-central nor on the fringes and pointless. Make the audience feel something for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make it develop naturally. If they are in love with each other after three minutes, I tend to write it off as cliche and boring. If they have time for their relationship to breathe and develop, however, over months and years and with ups and downs, then I&amp;#39;ll like it a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While tragic endings and forced separations are cliche in themselves, they can be extremely powerful. Probably 80% of the romantic pairings I like have the characters irreparably separated across time or space. I don&amp;#39;t know what that says about me, but I think tragedy makes people long for atonement like nothing else. Some of the most poignant stories have their couples being broken up, in my opinion. Partially because it subverts the traditional happy ending, partially because it makes the audience yearn to somehow fix things, investing them in the story with that longing. Maybe audiences are just always sadistic, we love it when characters have been beat to shit, and so nothing makes us love a couple like them being torn apart. Notable, though, that generally having people like the relationship beforehand by using the other points above would make this last point more effective. If you despise both lovers, or simply do not care about them, then tearing them apart does nothing. The audience should generally like the couple, should be leaning towards supporting them, when this tragic ending is utilized. It should be the coup de grace, the home run that wraps up the game, the punch in the gut that everything else builds to.
