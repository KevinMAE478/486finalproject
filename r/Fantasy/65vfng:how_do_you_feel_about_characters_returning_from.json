The character is *dying* and not *dead*, making them a Schr\u00f6dinger's Corpse.  There is room for that person to be saved, so I'll believe they're alive until proven otherwise.  \n\n**Resurrection was previously established in the setting.**  \nIf resurrection has been introduced in any way previously, the author *must account for that* if they want us to believe a character is truly and permanently dead-dead.  \n\nA character can come back from any of those \"deaths\" and I wouldn't bat an eye.  It happens all the time.  Sometimes I'm a bit irritated if a death was presented as permanent, but then nope, they're back.  \n\n-----  \n\n# Characters should Stay Dead if ...  \n\n- **The character died on-screen and was completely Dead**  \n- **Resurrection was not previously established**  \n- **A \"Permadeath Weapon\" was used**  \n- **The character's death was important/significant/etc.**  \n\nI'm lumping them together without individual commentary.  *All* of those do not need to apply, of course, and there are probably lots of other situations where a character should Stay Dead that I've forgotten.  \n\nPermadeath Weapons can be either something established in the setting, like a \"get stabbed by this and you're dead forever\" or it can be something more from the generic traditions, like \"the body was dismembered and burned.\"  \n\nThere are tons of exceptions--*The Princess Bride* for example, shows several character deaths / presumed deaths *and* one of those breaks the \"resurrection was not previously established\" rule.  That could also be hand-waved by the notion that, given the setting's primitive medicine, the character was in a coma and not genuinely deceased.  \n\n-----  \n\n# Special Case:  The Sacrifice  \n\nI really, really feel mixed on this.  There are characters whose entire purpose in existing is to be killed off at some point.  Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's shit.  \n\nAt one extreme, you can end up with a **Women in Refrigerators** situation, where a character exists and dies *only* to motivate another character.  Clearly, this person can't be brought back or the hero doesn't have a reason to keep hero'ing.  (Unless it's like, a quest to get the character resurrected or something.)  \n\nAnother extreme being the **Noble Self-sacrifice**, where a hero dies on purpose to save the others.  This can be a last-stand, this can be a \"Someone has to die to make this happen\" situation, there are lots of ways to play it.  Resurrecting this kind of character can cheapen the significance of what they willingly gave up, but depending on the specifics of the situation, it can be pulled off pretty well if they did the \"no body / off screen\" type death.  \n\nAnd then there's the **Accidental Sacrifice**, where an important, central, significant, well-liked character dies.  This is sometimes done as a \"Raising the Stakes\" moment, where the character's death shows that the author is willing to kill anyone, making you more worried/invested in the following scenes.  Sometimes it pulls double-duty as the Motivational Death, sometimes it an attempt to make the story feel darker/grittier.  Accidental sacrifices can be resurrected with a \"no body / off screen / cliffhanger.\"  It's absolutely *expected* in some situations, especially if Resurrection was already established.  \n\n-----  \n\n# Special Case:  The Unbelieved Death  \n\nThere are characters that are pretty much ... essential.  Characters that Cannot Die.  Everyone expects the wise old man mentor to die, but that Precocious Child Sidekick is invulnerable.  If they try killing off that kid, you *know* the entire time that he/she is getting rezzed, no matter what.  It's also hard to believe when the Comic Relief or the \"Team's Heart and Soul\" character is apparently dead.  \n\nI can and will spend *books* in full expectation that a certain character is \"not dead after all\" and in a lot of cases, I'm eventually proven right.  \n\n----  \n\nEdits:  formatting, some clarity here and there.  \n", "edited": 1492440883.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have very mixed feelings; thinking over character resurrection from various books and stories, I can think of a dozen &amp;quot;exceptions&amp;quot; to most of the handling rules I would want to make.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here are some of the guidelines:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Characters are not dead if ...&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIn order to make me truly believe a character is dead-dead, there needs to be a body.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They die off-screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nRelated to &amp;quot;No body.&amp;quot;   When we&amp;#39;re told a character is dead, or missing-presumed-dead, or something like that, it&amp;#39;s hard to really accept, especially if the character was important or significant in some way.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are super-badly injured, bleeding out, etc. and the scene ends on a cliffhanger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThat last bit is the important part.

Reviving him and making the trilogy just a &amp;quot;Kelsier show&amp;quot; all along from behind the scenes killed alot of the parts that i found was great about the trilogy including Kelsier. It felt like one of those series where the show is trying to convince you that the character is so &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; that it just turns undesirable instead of impressive.\"&gt;Secret History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still love the series but i wish that shit wasn&amp;#39;t pulled off&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "name": "t1_dgdwt75", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492483362.0, "created_utc": 1492454562.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdgoz1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oirish97", "parent_id": "t3_65vfng", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think it's best accomplished when the possibility or effects are foreshadowed.

The worst times are when the author tries to combine it with some sort of \"crowning moment of awesome\" for a protagonist.  I'd probably say that [s](#s \"The Belgariad, Durnik's return to life\") is probably the worst offender I can think of in this regard.  Any time you kill off the supporting cast just so the hero can pull them back, because he's just so damn talented, you're going to piss me off.  This also covers when you kill off the main character and he can pull himself back to life.  [s](#s \"Iron Druid series does this and it lasts like two chapters. No point at all other than a cheap, temporary, unearned emotional shock.\")\n\n\"Next Book\" resurrections also tend to piss me off for multiple reasons.  One is just because of sheer impatience: I know you're not going to kill off the protagonist of your series, especially when there's already a publication date announced for the next book (looking at you, Butcher).  Another reason it pisses me off is what I call the \"AC Doyle\" excuse - the author is sick of the character, and wants to find a way to stop writing more in the series.  If this is the case, you can usually expect the quality to start plummeting whenever the narrative resumes.

If you haven't been reading the online web serial [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/), well, you should. [Complete crowning moment of badass](#s \"At the end of the 2nd book, the main character gets killed as part of her plan, then self-necromances her way back into the fight, kills her enemy, then mugs an angel into bringing her back to full life.\")  It's one of my favorite things in the series so far.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can think of a handful of times when it&amp;#39;s been done really well, several more times where it really pissed me off, and a few that were just meh.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The times when it pisses me off the most is when an author uses it as an excuse to get a cheap emotional hit without long-term consequences.  The worst times are when the author tries to combine it with some sort of &amp;quot;crowning moment of awesome&amp;quot; for a protagonist.  I&amp;#39;d probably say that &lt;a href=\"#s\" title=\"The Belgariad, Durnik&amp;#39;s return to life\"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; is probably the worst offender I can think of in this regard.  Any time you kill off the supporting cast just so the hero can pull them back, because he&amp;#39;s just so damn talented, you&amp;#39;re going to piss me off.  This also covers when you kill off the main character and he can pull himself back to life.  &lt;a href=\"#s\" title=\"Iron Druid series does this and it lasts like two chapters. No point at all other than a cheap, temporary, unearned emotional shock.\"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Next Book&amp;quot; resurrections also tend to piss me off for multiple reasons.  One is just because of sheer impatience: I know you&amp;#39;re not going to kill off the protagonist of your series, especially when there&amp;#39;s already a publication date announced for the next book (looking at you, Butcher).  Another reason it pisses me off is what I call the &amp;quot;AC Doyle&amp;quot; excuse - the author is sick of the character, and wants to find a way to stop writing more in the series.  If this is the case, you can usually expect the quality to start plummeting whenever the narrative resumes.  (Doyle is, surprisingly, the exception to the rule - both &lt;em&gt;The Hound of the Baskervilles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Adventure of the Empty House&lt;/em&gt; are two of my favorite Sherlock stories, both published after &lt;em&gt;The Final Problem&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say, however, that when it is done well, character resurrection can be absolutely badass.
