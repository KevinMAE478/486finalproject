First up is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463760-age-of-iron?from_search=true\"&gt;Age of Iron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Angus Watson. This is a great series, definitely dark, but also full of magic and a few laugh out loud moments. This review is just for Age of Iron, but the series as a whole is unbelievable. Also quite unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4.5/5 stars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a very down and dirty, dark, twisted, funny and exciting read. Despite that, this is going to be a really hard review to write. I enjoyed it. Actually, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed it. But the interesting thing is, while reading I could pick out things that I think other people may complain about. So, do I ignore them, since I don\u2019t really care? Or do I let people know, since am sure some readers will. I decided to go with a list of who I think should read this book at their own risk. I\u2019m certainly not going to tell them to not read it, because, like I said, I found it to be a really good story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who should read this book with caution?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are easily offended by descriptions of women\u2019s bodies.&lt;/strong&gt; Personally, I never felt it was out of line in this book, I didn\u2019t feel the women were objectified. But were there descriptions of the female form? Yes. If that bugs you, well prepare yourself. Now you know and can choose to read at your own risk of being outraged.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who don\u2019t like to laugh at dark humor.&lt;/strong&gt; I don\u2019t know who these people might be, but if humor that comes from a dark place or sarcasm, or self-deprecation bothers you, well, I have to wonder why you are reading my post. I love this stuff. And you probably won\u2019t get this book.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are easily disturbed by deranged characters.&lt;/strong&gt; If you lose sleep at night easily when reading about twisted individuals who get their jollies in depraved ways, well, you might not want to read this book.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who don\u2019t enjoy seeing women excel in battle.&lt;/strong&gt; What? You think only men can be useful in battle? Well, then, you are not my friend. And you might not enjoy this book.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are unsettled by violence.&lt;/strong&gt; Don\u2019t want to hear about a skull getting crushed under the weight of a war hammer? This may not be the book for you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who hate bright and mysterious little girls.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are the type to dislike orphans (and probably kick puppies in your free time), then this book might irk you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are quite bothered by anachronisms&lt;/strong&gt;. I\u2019m not an expert here, but I am fairly sure OK was not word in the Iron Age. I\u2019m not sure how many anachronisms there are in this book, but in general, the speech just felt modern to me. I don\u2019t mind, it was easy and fun to read, but I know some do. If it\u2019s something you tend to bellyache about, prepare yourself for it.  *** The author was kind enough to leave a very nice and reasoned response to this point on my blog, I am including it here because I think he makes an excellent point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t think I\u2019m meant to comment here, since I wrote the book and am biased, but about the anachronistic language \u2013 I reckon a lot of people would have used slang in the Iron Age, and surely they did have a word or phrase for OK, so, when it\u2019s applicable to the character, I\u2019ve used slang, including OK. Alternatives would have been to write the whole thing in ancient British Celtic, which might have been inaccessible to the modern reader, or to stick a few forsooths, prithees and milords in, which I reckon is just dumb\u2026 I think this is very different from something like Downtown Abbey when a character says \u2018get over yourself\u2019 or similar and it grates. I\u2019m not trying to recreate ancient Celtic, I\u2019m translating it wholly and utterly, and that includes the slang.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There, that\u2019s out of the way. Now I can move away from my anticipated reaction of some others to what I care about with my review, this is about my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several things really going for this book. First. I love the characters. Dug, Lowa and Spring are all fascinating, strong characters. You could flip between any of them, and I\u2019d be happy because at the end of this book, I want more of all of them. I love when a story features multiple characters and I can\u2019t pick a favorite because I just love them all. That was definitely the case here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The humor is another strong aspect of this. Like many of the successful grimdark authors, Watson is able to balance the horrific aspects of his story and world with some dark edged humor that lightens things up and makes everything more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention, this is a fantastical story, and as such sometimes has moments that require a little bit stronger suspension of disbelief. But that\u2019s fine since the story is so fun. Some of the characters, especially antagonists, almost seem like caricatures, but they are fun to read, and in my opinion do not take it too far. And the main characters are all so enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for magic, it is still lighter on fantasy than a Sanderson book, but I don\u2019t think it is as low magic as many of the popular grimdark books. That\u2019s not a bad thing, just an observation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only complaint, and it is minor, is that at times I felt the \u201cSlavery and oppression are bad \u2026. mmm\u2019Kay?\u201d message was a bit heavy handed. Often less is more, and for me personally, I felt it would have been a stronger book if parts of it were trimmed to sound a bit less \u2026. preachy for lack of a better word. And this is MINOR! It was by no means a preachy book, it just maybe dwelled on this particular message a tiny bit more than I would have liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have to say this is a great debut, the next one is firmly on my TBR list as I look forward to continuing the adventure with Dug, Lowa and Spring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2017 Bingo Squares:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An Author&amp;#39;s Debut Fantasy Novel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2016 Underread/Underrated List&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reuse Any Previous Bingo Square (Historical Fantasy, Fewer than 3K ratings, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AMA Author&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Also, there is a slight chance it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; count for Too Old for this Crap. I know Dug was older, I just can&amp;#39;t remember if he was over 50, since just being mid 30s is &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; in these books. Will try to verify one way or the other. He&amp;#39;s probably too young.&lt;/del&gt;  Turns out Dug is only about 40, so guess he&amp;#39;s not quite Too Old for this Crap yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I decided to dig through my old reviews from my blog and post some here for books that I love that I want more people to read.
