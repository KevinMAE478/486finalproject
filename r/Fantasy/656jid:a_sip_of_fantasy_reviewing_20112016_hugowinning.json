The narrator is a sentient AI who likes cat pictures. A lot. Although it knows it likes--nay, loves--cat pictures, the AI doesn&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s purpose in life is. Come out to the world? Hopefully they don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re Skynet from Terminator and shut you down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the AI decides to try to help people. You know those ads you see on you laptop for flu shots? The AI might have put those there so you could stay healthy. That lucky break in your job search? Maybe the AI sent your resume to hundreds of potential employers. All it asks in return is that we keep uploading cat pictures (seriously, they&amp;#39;re adorable).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole story is a contrast between light humor and the painful truths that people work so hard to hide from the world and themselves. As hard as the AI tries to help people, we often don&amp;#39;t want to be helped (or don&amp;#39;t even realize that we need help in the first place). By the end, the story leaves you wondering, if only slightly, if there is something behind all of the random things we encounter through technology and the internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2015&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No award was given for short story this year.
