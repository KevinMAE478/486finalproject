There are three points on a plane that people will be moving: getting on, occasionally going to the bathroom, and getting off. When people are getting on and off, *everyone* is slow. There is no reason one would need to be fast in this situation, because nobody moves faster than two seats per minute. And the other time, going to the bathroom, doesn't matter because chances are, there's no one else in the aisle.\n\n&gt; They poo too much for air travel \n\nThis is very inaccurate. When flushing the toilet of an aeroplane, it releases everything that was in it into the air. This means that no poo ever stays on the plane. I don't know how someone could poo too much, since (as mentioned before) the aisles are usually empty, and toilets flush into the air. \n\n&gt; They're generally stupid \n\nThis is a huge generalisation.
