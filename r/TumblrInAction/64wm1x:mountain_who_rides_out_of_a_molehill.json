You implied religion wasn't threatening to people. I responded that, by the way most people seem to practice religion, and the way it's embodied by those with political power, it's actually quite threatening to several demographics and interest groups, and I think it sidelines a lot of those individuals' experiences to brush off something that has the trappings of a certain belief structure. I don't know what your experiences are, but I live south of the Mason-Dixon, and the religious people *I'm* most familiar with ain't that nice when you make lifestyle choices they disapprove of.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, but I do think it's the smallest bit disingenuous to say \"people who truly belong to the religion only have these good beliefs, so nobody who believes in interpretations with bad consequences therefore belongs to the religion\"--you might want to be more cautious about dismissal of counterexamples that don't fit your conception of what the faith is \"really about\". Even if you're right theologically, that doesn't convince me the people who actually abide by that standard are absolved of responsibility for the vast majority of practitioners who are screwing it up.\n\nAnd, look, I'm not trying to derail the thread with a religious debate. At least one party feels like their identity is being attacked, then it goes south fast. But I do think it's worth remembering *why* the faith prescribes the \"love each other\" stuff--it's not motivated by trying to build a harmonious Earthly Kingdom: the subtext is worldly suffering and humility ought to be endured for the sake of living forever in the hereafter, and those who continue to sin without repenting will be, if not cast in a literal lake of fire for eternity, then (in the less tortuous interpretation) mired in eternal hopelessness owing to separation from God. From my nonbeliever's point of view, the Last Judgment seems plainly monstrous: if you're gay, for example, you pretty much either have to (a) deny yourself romantic self-actualization until you die or (b) accept eternal damnation.
