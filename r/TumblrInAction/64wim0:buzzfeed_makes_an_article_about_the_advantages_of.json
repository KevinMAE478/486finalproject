My liberal arts school is about 50/50 male/female, but what I&amp;#39;m slowly noticing is that a large (I would guess about 1/3) of the male population is gay (me included). Then at least another 1/3 are guys so weird, hated, jocky, or off the wall as to be undatable for the women here (a lot of jock and frat hatred here).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The number of men willing and able to date women is way below the number of women willing and able to date men. And people here have a tendency for longer relationships, which has a bigger relative impact on the male dating pool than the female. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the skewed gender sexual dynamics has anything to do with the behavior coming from liberal arts schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg5lkhk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492010223.0, "created_utc": 1491981423.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5l4qh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EmotionalClusterfuck", "parent_id": "t1_dg5kzia", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had a boyfriend when I started, so I had no problem, but I imagine it was a bit tricky for the others.  \nThough it seems like half or more of the girls on my floor were lesbians, so maybe it wasn't so difficult after all.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a boyfriend when I started, so I had no problem, but I imagine it was a bit tricky for the others.&lt;br/&gt;\nThough it seems like half or more of the girls on my floor were lesbians, so maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t so difficult after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg5l4qh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492009060.0, "created_utc": 1491980260.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5kzia", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ivey323", "parent_id": "t1_dg5krb6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm just curious, was it harder to find a date because of the high ratio of females to males?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just curious, was it harder to find a date because of the high ratio of females to males?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg5kzia", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492008674.0, "created_utc": 1491979874.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wim0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6rjsa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cuddly_kittehs", "parent_id": "t1_dg5krb6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What the holy fuck are you talking about", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the holy fuck are you talking about&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg6rjsa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068858.0, "created_utc": 1492040058.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5krb6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 49, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EmotionalClusterfuck", "parent_id": "t3_64wim0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I went to a school that was 75% female...do you know what happens when women spend a lot of time together?
