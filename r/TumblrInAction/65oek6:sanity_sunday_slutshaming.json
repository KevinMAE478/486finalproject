It takes emotional maturity to know that adults will wear exposing clothing &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are confident, not &lt;em&gt;to be&lt;/em&gt; confident. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why if this is about adults &amp;quot;slut-shaming,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s more so watching out for the tween&amp;#39;s emotional well-being. (Unless it&amp;#39;s one of those parents who teaches the tween that all sexual thoughts are evil, and they would probably just punish them for wearing revealing clothes rather than reaching out to them. At that point, the tween is probably just wearing exposing clothes in rebellion.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: thirteen- to fourteen-year-olds, not twelve- to thirteen-year-olds, whoops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dgc123q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492378455.0, "created_utc": 1492349655.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oek6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7pfu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "comrade-jim", "parent_id": "t1_dgbww7y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you ever tried that argument with an SJW?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried that argument with an SJW?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dgc7pfu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388451.0, "created_utc": 1492359651.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oek6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcijau", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dinosauringg", "parent_id": "t1_dgbww7y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah.
