I'm saying my piece and washing my hands and moving on.\n  \n\n&gt;the normalization of jealousy as an indicator of love.   \n\nJealousy is an indicator of several emotions, including love, and it's a perfectly normal emotion. You don't feel jealous over someone that means nothing to you. How you deal with the jealousy is what makes it healthy or unhealthy. Monogamy is one healthy way of dealing with it because both parties agreeing to an exclusive relationship eliminates the fear of instability and the lack of clear expectations that can lead to jealousy.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that a sufficiently intense love is enough to overcome any practical incompatibilities.   \n\nIndeed, this is incredibly na\u00efve at best. However, polyamorous people are just as susceptible to this as anyone else.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that you should meet your partner's every need, and if you don't, you're either inadequate or they're too needy.   \n\nYes, this is a problem. But the answer is not the idea that you are not responsible for meeting *any* of your partner's needs and that they should \"own their shit\" and deal with everything themselves.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that sufficiently intense love should cause you to cease to be attracted to anyone else.  \n\nTrue. But being attracted to someone in no way requires you to act on it because you are a human being and not a mindless automaton controlled purely by base instinct.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that commitment is synonymous with exclusivity.  \n\nA stable one is. Commitment involves an increased level of investment of time, energy, and resources, as well as an agreement to prioritize that relationship above most others. The more commitments you have, the less you are able to devote to any one relationship, and the more likely it is that important things and people will fall through the cracks. Even if you have only one major commitment and a series of casual encounters on the side, that's basically a commitment to your own self-indulgence and also takes significant time, energy, and resources.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that marriage and children are the only valid teleological justification for being committed to a relationship.   \n\nFirst of all, using academic buzzwords does not make your tumblr posts any less stupid. Second, you have it backwards. Marriage does not justify the presence of a commitment. A commitment justifies the presence of a marriage. Marriage exists as a way to explicitly articulate the rights and responsibilities of people who make a significant commitment to each other and to provide legal protection for the individuals who enter one in good faith.  \n\nAs for children, they are at the mercy of their legal guardians and unfortunately have to accept pretty much anything their parent(s) do to them. But they shouldn't. We know from many, many studies done over the years that the family structure that produces the best outcomes (emotionally, educationally, and for employment) for children is a monogamous, legal marriage of the biological parents. And it's also been shown conclusively that the biggest risk factor for abuse (emotional, physical, and/or sexual), accidental death, or murder of a child is the presence in the home of an adult who is not a biological parent.  \n\nWe also know from studying societies where polygamy is legal and socially supported that the children of monogamous families within that society have better outcomes than the children of polygamous families, even though the polygamous families are richer (which is why they could afford multiple wives in the first place). The adults in polygamous families have to devote more time, energy, and resources to managing their own relationships and it's the children who lose out.  \n\nDivorce is bad for children. A revolving door of parents' lovers is bad for children. Even long-term extra committed partners isn't great for children. I honestly couldn't care less if you feel ~personally unfulfilled or like you're ~not being your authentic self. If you choose to bring a child into the world, then you are obligated to do everything in your power to provide the best environment you can for that child. Sometimes a divorce or whatever is unavoidable, or even desperately necessary, but a lot of this stuff is avoidable.\n\nAnd yeah, \"kids are resilient.\" But just because they don't collapse under the weight of a burden doesn't mean it's not a hard one to carry.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that your insecurities are always your partner's responsibility to tip-toe around and never your responsibility to work on.  \n\nYes. But it's also true that sometimes your partner is responsible for creating or feeding into your insecurities and you need to work on them together. And even ones they're not responsible for can sometimes benefit from working on them together because that's what committed couples do.  \n  \n\n&gt;The idea that your value to a partner is directly proportional to the amount of time and energy they spend on you, and it is in zero-sum competition with everything else they value on life.  \n\nBut it is, you half-wit. Time, energy, and money are all finite resources. When you spend five days a week and 3/4 of your paycheck with one person, there is much less available for everything else. And when we value something, we invest more resources in it. That's true for everyone and everything. I like my step-sister way more than my step-brother. Guess who I make the effort to stay in contact with and go out of my way to support? Does it mean I value my familial relationship with her more than the one with him? Yes. Yes it does.  \n  \n\n&gt;the idea that being of value to a partner should always make up a large chunk of how you value yourself.  \n\nHaving valuable relationships with the people around you should always make up the majority of how you value yourself. When you die, no one will give a crap how often you volunteered for overtime or how in awe they were of your mathematical abilities or whatever. They'll care about how you always volunteered for overtime so your coworker who cared for his disabled mother could go home on time or how your joy for math was contagious and made them appreciate the things math makes possible even though they suck at it. If you don't have meaningful relationships with other people then what is the point of you? Most people spend a large amount of their time and energy day to day with a romantic partner, so that becomes an important part of that.  \n  \n\nIn conclusion: piss off poly evangelists.
