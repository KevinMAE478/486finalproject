And if there isn&amp;#39;t a crisis? Manufacture one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really weird seeing this anti-multi-national viewpoint being spread by anyone on the far left. I was raised to see other humans as my equal and that everyone should be put on a level playing field. To see anyone pushing the idea that we should restrict foods or culture or even marriage by race or region is just appalling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if we&amp;#39;re claiming things, I&amp;#39;m of Scottish heritage, WE invented the television and all of these modern computer screens and phones and stuff are just bastardizations of Baird&amp;#39;s glorious invention.
