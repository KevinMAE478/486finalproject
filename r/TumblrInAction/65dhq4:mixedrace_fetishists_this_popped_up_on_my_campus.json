A fetish was an object with magical powers, i.e. a charm. Later the word was used to describe objects that had strong sexual appeal, such as articles of clothing, e.g. high heeled shoes, latex, leather, and other items. \n\nSomehow it morphed to describe interracial relationships. I first recall seeing it used by either Asian American males complaining about white male - Asian female couplings or American American women complaining about white female - black male pairings. And as most things in SJW world, there was no actual evidence of fetishisation, it was simply a mean spirited and jealous accusation that appealed to bigots and then a whole narrative was concocted to make is sound less like the KKK and more academic, for example \"black bodies\", \"bodies of colour\", \"colonising bodies\", \"asymmetrical power\" and \"yee ha!\". OK, not the last one.  \n\nI remember this because just a few years earlier there were several articles celebrating the significant increase of interracial dating and marriage - evidence of better race relations. Now these relationships are used as examples of worse race relations. This encapsulates social justice's capricious nature. Where there is genuine progress it becomes the source of imagined misery and oppression; one step forward and two steps back. \n\nNow, some of you have commented that the poster seems of days long ago, something used by racists opposed to miscegenation. You're exactly right. I have to wonder how someone who is multiracial might feel seeing such a poster. Remember, these SJWs are all about making people feel safe, right? Of course, we can see here this is a lie. The movement is a group of bullies gathered together to invent, fixate, and embellish their grievances and use it to grab money and power.  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really quite messy and ought to be, to use a social justicey word, unpacked. A fetish was an object with magical powers, i.e. a charm. Later the word was used to describe objects that had strong sexual appeal, such as articles of clothing, e.g. high heeled shoes, latex, leather, and other items. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow it morphed to describe interracial relationships. I first recall seeing it used by either Asian American males complaining about white male - Asian female couplings or American American women complaining about white female - black male pairings. And as most things in SJW world, there was no actual evidence of fetishisation, it was simply a mean spirited and jealous accusation that appealed to bigots and then a whole narrative was concocted to make is sound less like the KKK and more academic, for example &amp;quot;black bodies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bodies of colour&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;colonising bodies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;asymmetrical power&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;yee ha!&amp;quot;. OK, not the last one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember this because just a few years earlier there were several articles celebrating the significant increase of interracial dating and marriage - evidence of better race relations. Now these relationships are used as examples of worse race relations. This encapsulates social justice&amp;#39;s capricious nature. Where there is genuine progress it becomes the source of imagined misery and oppression; one step forward and two steps back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, some of you have commented that the poster seems of days long ago, something used by racists opposed to miscegenation. You&amp;#39;re exactly right. I have to wonder how someone who is multiracial might feel seeing such a poster. Remember, these SJWs are all about making people feel safe, right? Of course, we can see here this is a lie.
