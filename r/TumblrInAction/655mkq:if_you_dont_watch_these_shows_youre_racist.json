I care about representation and diversity and all that crap as a black guy but so many &amp;#39;black&amp;#39; productions made such a big deal out of being black or covered how being black is terrible in some way or was just so stereotypical to the point of being unrelatable. Kenan and Kel was just funnies first. In fact I do remember a lot of black comedies in the 90s along the same lines that I remember for being great comedies rather than them being particularly black. Did they stop making those because I&amp;#39;m hard pressed to think of recent ones that I gravitated to aside from Blackish, which doesn&amp;#39;t count because racial integration is the primary subject. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg7u50j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492131145.0, "created_utc": 1492102345.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mkq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg809f3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RonDeGrasseDawtchins", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ndkn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "#I DROPPED THE SCREW IN THE TUNA!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;I DROPPED THE SCREW IN THE TUNA!&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg809f3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137650.0, "created_utc": 1492108850.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mkq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7spzd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BloodSugarSexMagix", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ndkn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good Burger is still one of the funniest movies of the 90s", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Burger is still one of the funniest movies of the 90s&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg7spzd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129622.0, "created_utc": 1492100822.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mkq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655mkq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8q7gp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Veldie", "parent_id": "t1_dg8m0do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Kel loves orange soda", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kel loves orange soda&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg8q7gp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492171108.0, "created_utc": 1492142308.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8m0do", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fattygoneham", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ndkn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Who LOVES orange soda?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who LOVES orange soda?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "name": "t1_dg8m0do", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492164791.0, "created_utc": 1492135991.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ndkn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Veldie", "parent_id": "t1_dg7mo71", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TumblrInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Kenan&amp;Kel was the shit growing up I never looked at it as a black show, I looked at it as a comedy and orange soda.
