But let me take you up on the specifics you mention as examples:\n\nThe British were the principal movers in the Africa campaign, whilst commonwealth forces played a part and Americans were also present, I don't know of any sizeable American force which faced Rommel and his Afrikacorp. This was mostly a fight of British vs Italian, then later German forces under several different generals before Montgomery found victory at El Alamain.\n\nThe liberation of France, Italy, and Germany were all extensions of D-Day itself, and as such, I consider them as part of the same basic operation. The same forces which took part in the landings pushed on and continued the campaign, supplied and reinforced, yes. But it was essentially one big sweeping push which began with d-day.\n\nThe strategic bombing of Germany and the destruction of the Luftwaffe is, again, a principally British, commonwealth, and Polish acheivement. The Luftwaffe were repelled in the battle of britain by forces from these nations in particular. I know of no sizeable American contingent among the defenders. (I could be wrong, but if I am, it merely speaks to how poorly this information is propagated) The strategic bombing of Germany was, again, principally British under the command of 'Bomber' Harris. The USAAC may have been involved, as you say, but again, the perception among many is that this was a British operation with \"some minor help\" from pilots of other nations. \n\nI'm not saying I'm in agreement with this perception, merely that it exists, as this is how the information and the story of the war has been passed down to later generations of people.\n\nSo this is why I call American involvement in these areas \"very little\" the perception certainly is that, whilst the US were there, they were present only in small numbers and a larger force of some other nation(s) were the principal combattants. This leaves people with the (quite possibly mistaken) notion that the US were not really involved in the European theatre outside of d-day and the extension of this operation. \n\nFor the record, let me state again that I'm **not** claiming that the USA were not invloved or were somehow wrong to stay out of the war for so long. I am/was merely objecting to the comment which implied that a gung-ho attitude to killing nazis was a very American thing, when in fact, quite a degree of reluctance to this endeavor was initially present among the population (to the cost of those who died in Europe and around the world who might not have if the USA had entered earlier and brought the war to a swifter conclusion)\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, for the record, completely agree with your sentiments in your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My initial comment was merely objecting to the mention of kicking nazi ass as &amp;#39;the most American of things to do&amp;#39; or some such nonsense.

It means something, and I want it marked into me forever.\n\nI don't think tattoos themselves are the problem; it's the impulsiveness behind them.
