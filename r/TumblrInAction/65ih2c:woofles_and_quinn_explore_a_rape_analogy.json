This generally isn't the argument against rape (\"Women were asking for it!\"). The arguments the majority of us employ are stuff like \"This doesn't seem like rape, it seems like consent with buyer's remorse.\"  \n\nAnd it's a retarded analogy. Place a steak in front of a dog. They WILL eat it. The steak can't even tell them \"NO.\" If you, a respected outsider, tell them NO *and then watch them* you're shitting on your own experiment. A steak can't tell a dog NO, so the analogy would be closer to putting a naked woman in front of a man and then having his father or having the local sheriff say \"NO\" and watching to see what he does. You can bet your fucking savings that he wouldn't do it in these circumstances.  \n\nThis also doesn't prove anything about the rest of her agenda. A steak cannot consent to being eaten. The default behavior for the dogs is to eat unless told not to. This actually supports the idea that the default behavior for men is to rape unless told not to. By saying that men should act *more* like dogs, OP is really saying that men should only stop when told \"no.\" (and not wait for a yes).  \n\nFinally, it's just retarded to attempt to compare your opponents (in this case, men/patriarchy) to animals during a movement when you're trying to say people should be treated like humans. At best, it makes you look like an ass, and at worst, the shitty human beings that DO exist (ie, actual rapists) will get the \"Well you think I'm an animal so I'm gonna show you!\" kind of attitude. It's just unhelpful.  \n\nThe ending is what really goes off-the-rails. Neutered and kept on a leash? Could you imagine saying the same thing to her, even as a joke, about a slut? \"That slut can't help herself but to just take all the meat she can, like an untrained dog!

It's:  \n\n1. A straw man.  \n2. A shitty analogy because the steak isn't the one saying no.  \n3. A shitty analogy because dogs default to eating unless told no.  \n4. Hypocritical because it makes an effort to compare men to dogs when saying humans should be treated with respect.  \n5. Retarded \"joke\" at the end suggesting extreme violence to anybody for any reason.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s insane because the comparison is a straw man. This generally isn&amp;#39;t the argument against rape (&amp;quot;Women were asking for it!&amp;quot;). The arguments the majority of us employ are stuff like &amp;quot;This doesn&amp;#39;t seem like rape, it seems like consent with buyer&amp;#39;s remorse.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a retarded analogy. Place a steak in front of a dog. They WILL eat it. The steak can&amp;#39;t even tell them &amp;quot;NO.&amp;quot; If you, a respected outsider, tell them NO &lt;em&gt;and then watch them&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re shitting on your own experiment. A steak can&amp;#39;t tell a dog NO, so the analogy would be closer to putting a naked woman in front of a man and then having his father or having the local sheriff say &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; and watching to see what he does. You can bet your fucking savings that he wouldn&amp;#39;t do it in these circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything about the rest of her agenda. A steak cannot consent to being eaten. The default behavior for the dogs is to eat unless told not to. This actually supports the idea that the default behavior for men is to rape unless told not to. By saying that men should act &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; like dogs, OP is really saying that men should only stop when told &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot; (and not wait for a yes).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;#39;s just retarded to attempt to compare your opponents (in this case, men/patriarchy) to animals during a movement when you&amp;#39;re trying to say people should be treated like humans. At best, it makes you look like an ass, and at worst, the shitty human beings that DO exist (ie, actual rapists) will get the &amp;quot;Well you think I&amp;#39;m an animal so I&amp;#39;m gonna show you!&amp;quot; kind of attitude. It&amp;#39;s just unhelpful.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ending is what really goes off-the-rails. Neutered and kept on a leash?
