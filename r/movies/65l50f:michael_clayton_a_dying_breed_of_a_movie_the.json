He flies back to NYC and we see him talking with Marty and Barry at the office on what seems to be a workday (based on everyone's attire).

You can see her in the room when that happens).\n\nDay 3 (Saturday) is definitely a weekend day because Michael has his kid and he's wearing casual clothes. He meets with Marty at Marty's house (asks for the loan) and has the confrontation with Arthur on the street (though I don't recall if its necessarily in that order). On Saturday evening/night, the UNorth mercs/hitmen\u2014having tapped Arthur's phone\u2014intercept the messages he's leaving, exposing the whole U/North conspiracy. Mr. Verne meets with Karen Crowder later that night and effectively gets the kill order.\n\nDay 4 (Sunday) --- A LOT happens on this day. Presumably Arthur is killed early in the day. Then Michael's father's birthday party. Then the phone call about Arthur. He meets Marty at the bar to talk about Arthur, making funeral arrangements, etc...

Having probably not really slept, Michael first goes to the copy shop and gets one of the memos that Arthur had printed in book form. He makes his way to the office and talks to Marty who accuses him of having been drinking all night, and then gives him the loan (in the form of a \"bonus\"). Of course, having just been handed $80K and a contract, this derails Michael's plan to tell Marty what's been going on. Monday afternoon/evening is squaring the debt with the loan shark, followed by the poker game and the call to the client's house to deal with the hit &amp; run.

I distinctly remember Karen having her hair styled in a \"Samurai way\" (sort of like a man bun up top, hair dropping in back) when she was either working out or casually talking to one of the \"janitors\" (Michael calls himself a janitor but I see him more as a fixer, or a trash collector, as he doesn't really get as dirty as the two characters played by Anthony Michael hall and the other actor whose name escapes me). Karen even has her own sensei in Darren, too. Lastly, I felt like her outfit in her final scene looked a bit like a Samurai outfit, with it the bottom of her suit jacket flaring outwards almost like the samurai uniforms with it narrow at the waist -- maybe I'm looking too into it. \n\nAnd yes, I had to rewind and watch that Arthur scene where he's ambushed 3 times, as they were ruthless and sociopathic in their efficiency. I take out the garbage with more empathy. The whole method of assassination was just so...well thought-out, particularly in terms of location of delivery so that an autopsy wouldn't reveal anything. Scary stuff. \n\nAnd yeah I am pretty sure it takes place over 5 different days but 96 hours or 4 days of time. \n\n* Day 0 Clayton picks up his kid from divorced wife and talks about Realm and Conquest with his son. He also meets up with the loan shark, and they auction off his bar before this. He then flies to Wisconsin to get Arthur, after being briefed as to what's going on. That night, Arthur talks to Clayton's kid about Realm and Conquest over the phone. Then he escapes Michael. Karen hires the hitmen. \n\n* Day 1 Karen and Michael meet. She's unimpressed by Michael. Michael finds Arthur in this clip; Arthur thinks his phones are tapped. Arthur then makes the recording exposing UNorth as he thinks he's being tapped. Karen OKs the hit on Arthur. \n\n* Day 2 The hitmen kill Arthur, who's on his way to pick Anna up. Michael celebrates his father's birthday then takes his kid and talks about how he'll never be uncle Timmy. Michael gets the call about Arthur's death. Michael drinks with the firm and mourns and feels guilty, and then calls Anna's house only to find out she's in NYC. He visits her hotel and then goes to Arthur's loft after getting a new seal from his brother at the NYPD -- and the hitmen follow him. He goes to the loft and sees that there are signs it was not a suicide (prepared champagne, receipt for pickup of memos) but he gets arrested. \n\n* Day 3 He gets bailed out, his brother is pissed off at him. Clayton gets the Summons and Conquest memo copies that day. Visits the office.  He gets the $80k and a 3 year contract with no disclosure agreement. Then squares away the debt with the loan shark and goes and plays poker and we're back to the cold open. His car is loaded with a bomb. He drives to the hit and run guy. He leaves. He drives and drives and stops to see the horses. Car blows up. He flees. It's morning of day 4. \n\n* Day 4 He gets a ride from Timmy and he goes to the UNorth shareholders meeting where Karen talks about settlement. Karen comes out and looks like she has seen a literal ghost in Clayton. She then unwittingly speaks into a wire bribing Clayton and implicating herself in killing Arthur and trying to kill Michael, but I believe the charge that sticks is bribery, admission of fraud of covering up deaths and hiding material shareholder info. \n\nI think it goes Friday - Tuesday (since he has to pay the shark by Monday, and he picks his kid up on a weekend/Friday)\n\nClayton then drives \"rudderless\" (love that description, and the Ronin part, although I see Marty as more of the master or sensei). \n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love every single point and observation you made. It&amp;#39;s amazing that you watch it on that anniversary. I&amp;#39;m glad other people appreciate the film too. Not enough of these films are made. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not pick up on the samurai motif but in retrospect all the pieces fit so perfectly. I distinctly remember Karen having her hair styled in a &amp;quot;Samurai way&amp;quot; (sort of like a man bun up top, hair dropping in back) when she was either working out or casually talking to one of the &amp;quot;janitors&amp;quot; (Michael calls himself a janitor but I see him more as a fixer, or a trash collector, as he doesn&amp;#39;t really get as dirty as the two characters played by Anthony Michael hall and the other actor whose name escapes me). Karen even has her own sensei in Darren, too. Lastly, I felt like her outfit in her final scene looked a bit like a Samurai outfit, with it the bottom of her suit jacket flaring outwards almost like the samurai uniforms with it narrow at the waist -- maybe I&amp;#39;m looking too into it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, I had to rewind and watch that Arthur scene where he&amp;#39;s ambushed 3 times, as they were ruthless and sociopathic in their efficiency. I take out the garbage with more empathy. The whole method of assassination was just so...well thought-out, particularly in terms of location of delivery so that an autopsy wouldn&amp;#39;t reveal anything. Scary stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah I am pretty sure it takes place over 5 different days but 96 hours or 4 days of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 0 Clayton picks up his kid from divorced wife and talks about Realm and Conquest with his son. He also meets up with the loan shark, and they auction off his bar before this. He then flies to Wisconsin to get Arthur, after being briefed as to what&amp;#39;s going on. That night, Arthur talks to Clayton&amp;#39;s kid about Realm and Conquest over the phone. Then he escapes Michael. Karen hires the hitmen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 1 Karen and Michael meet. She&amp;#39;s unimpressed by Michael. Michael finds Arthur in this clip; Arthur thinks his phones are tapped. Arthur then makes the recording exposing UNorth as he thinks he&amp;#39;s being tapped. Karen OKs the hit on Arthur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2 The hitmen kill Arthur, who&amp;#39;s on his way to pick Anna up. Michael celebrates his father&amp;#39;s birthday then takes his kid and talks about how he&amp;#39;ll never be uncle Timmy. Michael gets the call about Arthur&amp;#39;s death. Michael drinks with the firm and mourns and feels guilty, and then calls Anna&amp;#39;s house only to find out she&amp;#39;s in NYC. He visits her hotel and then goes to Arthur&amp;#39;s loft after getting a new seal from his brother at the NYPD -- and the hitmen follow him. He goes to the loft and sees that there are signs it was not a suicide (prepared champagne, receipt for pickup of memos) but he gets arrested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 3 He gets bailed out, his brother is pissed off at him. Clayton gets the Summons and Conquest memo copies that day. Visits the office.  He gets the $80k and a 3 year contract with no disclosure agreement. Then squares away the debt with the loan shark and goes and plays poker and we&amp;#39;re back to the cold open. His car is loaded with a bomb. He drives to the hit and run guy. He leaves. He drives and drives and stops to see the horses. Car blows up. He flees. It&amp;#39;s morning of day 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 4 He gets a ride from Timmy and he goes to the UNorth shareholders meeting where Karen talks about settlement.

(Fun, unrelated fact: this was about ten days before the Meredith Kercher murder, for which Amanda Knox was arrested.) I was milling around the streets during the Perugia Chocolate Festival and saw a theater with the poster for the film (whose existence I was aware of but I hadn't yet seen). Decided, \"What the hell? I'll check it out.\" I speak a bit of Italian but seeing a movie in a foreign language sans subtitles is another matter. I'd say I understood maybe 50% of what took place in the film. (I can still remember thinking that Denis O'Hare's character\u2014[the guy who called Michael after hitting a pedestrian with his car after having a few drinks](#spoiler)\u2014at the start of the movie was a mafia crime boss or something. How I arrived at that conclusion still kind of cracks me up.\n\nUpon arriving back in the U.S. later that month, I saw Michael Clayton a second time and fell in love with the film. I'd go on to see it in the theater three more times during its run, and twice more when it was brought back to theaters during awards season.\n\n* I watch \"Michael Clayton\" every year on February 2nd. Why this date? It is the date on which the event\u2014[Arthur's breakdown during Anna's deposition](#spoiler)\u2014that kicks off the rest of the film takes place. You can see the date on the video footage of the deposition and meltdown.)\n\n* Also, people tend not to realize that a large majority of the movie takes place on a very compressed timeline: about 4-5 days total.

Tony Gilroy has said that Karen Crowder laying out her business suit on her bed (to somewhat resemble samurai armor) is not a coincidence. And of course, at the end of the film, [Michael, having sold out Arthur and effectively betrayed his employer, is a ronin, a samurai without a master](#spoiler).\n\n* And yeah, that final scene is just heart-breaking. [Michael has redeemed himself somewhat, but he's just devastated and rudderless at this point, as evidenced by the fact that he has no destination. He just tells the driver to \"give me fifty dollars worth.\"](#spoiler) By the way, that's Tony Gilroy (the director) as the unseen cab driver in that scene.\n\n* Also, a small goof --- in the soundtrack, the name of the song that goes along with the final scene is \"$25 dollars worth\" but in the scene itself, Michael requests that the taxi driver give him \"fifty dollars worth.\" Tony Gilroy must have done the math at some point and realized that $25 won't get you very far in NYC.\n\n* In addition to Clooney, Wilkinson and Swinton, the movie features an astonishingly large number of esteemed character actors in small (and some virtually non-existent) roles: Dennis O'Hare, Julie White, Merritt Weaver, Katherine Waterston, Maggie Siff, Jennifer Ehle (who I think is completely cut from the film proper, save for a reaction shot, but appears in a deleted scene), Michael O'Keefe Tom McCarthy (actor and the director of \"Spotlight\" --- in MC, he is just a voice on the phone), Sean Cullen (popular Broadway actor, gets a ton of work in productions shot in NYC) and John Douglas Thompson (very popular Broadway and off-Broadway actor --- in Michael Clayton, he has a single line of dialogue as a jail guard). And of course, Sydney Pollack (in a decent-sized role), who died not long after \"Michael Clayton\" came out.\n\n* By the way, that loaf of bread that Arthur gives to Michael? It makes a cameo in one of the film's deleted scenes. The scene involves Michael sitting outside the house of Denis O'Hara's character. He's waiting on a status update from the other lawyer. As he waits, he grabs the day-and-a-half old bread off the car seat and eats a chunk of it.\n\n* Tom Wilkinson's monologue at the beginning of the film (later repeated as part of the story) is just amazing.\n\n* The ruthless efficiency of the hired killers as they [murder Arthur in his apartment](#spoiler) is something I'll never forget.
