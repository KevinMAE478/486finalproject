It&amp;#39;s literally the same plot, history and character. Are U guys really being all fooled only by the trailer? Hollywood doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit anymore about having a single original idea for a movie because of &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TX9Ram2.png\"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;. They know they gonna profit regardless of the public opinion. I still don&amp;#39;t get why they had to put a f*\u00a8$&amp;amp; teenager as the protagonist. In a action movie we always like to see older bad ass characters that inspire us like Statham, Stallone or even Ryan Gosling on Drive. Are U guys taking this seriously?
