Simple (the whole being super-rich is just icing on the cake, making his char more believable). Superman though were not supposed to relate to, he's nothing like us. He's there as a beacon of hope, that no matter how bad things get, never fear cause Superman can save the day!!\n\nThen I think you misunderstand Superman, or at least you're forgoing one very popular and powerful interpretation of him. Here's my take:\n\nThe idea that Batman is more relatable than Superman just because Superman has powers and Batman doesn't I think misses out a big part of both characters. There's this very wrong quote (in my opinion) from Kill Bill 2 that says that Superman is always Superman, whereas Batman is fundamentally Bruce Wayne. I would argue that the opposite is actually closer to the truth.\n\n\"Bruce Wayne\" died when his parents were killed. From that moment, he had already devoted himself to avenging his parents and fighting the criminal world. Depending on which origin story you're following, he devoted himself to mastering his mind, body and soul to fight his crusade from young to adulthood, and at some point adopts the Bat symbol. His whole being is devoted to being Batman. His \"Bruce Wayne\" identity is a facade, or tool, or inconvenience depending on the story, that he works with/around while on his Batman crusade against crime. \n\n\"Superman\" is a role Clark Kent plays. Clark Kent is a all-American good-guy *who just happens to have superpowers*. The best stories about Clark always emphasize his Midwestern roots and parents and values for this reason. What would Clark Kent be without his power? Probably still just as good a person, helping everyone he can. What would Clark do if one day his job was done and the world was at peace? Retire and live happily ever after with Lois Lane. (In contrast, almost every Batman \"ending\" involves him fighting to his grave.) However, he just so happens to be born with powers of a God, so being the good person that he is, he takes on that responsibility and plays the role of Superman, who does lots of good and saves people and is a model for others around him.\n\n(Snyder actually touches on a fairly nuanced idea about \"Superman\", and then dropped the ball in the second act of MoS and never picked it up again. Here's what MoS should have been at its core: Clark/Superman is a son of two fathers: Clark, son of Jonathan Kent, and Kal-El, son of Jor-El. Jon Kent wants him to be happy and live a good, peaceful life, but if he uses his powers for good, that mean that he will have to sacrifice himself by revealing himself to the world. Jor-El wants him to forget about being a human and embrace his \"otherness\" and do good and guide humanity. The conflict between the two fathers' philosophies means he came up with this crappy compromise at the start of the movie, where he just sneaks around doing good, and as a result barely does anything with his Clark Kent life - the worst of both worlds. The solution to his dilemma is: \"Superman\" - an identity that he can use to unabashedly use his powers for good and guide humanity, while still emphasizing that he is *human*, while still retaining \"Clark Kent\" as his true identity and being able to have a normal human life, when he's not flying around saving the world.)\n\nBoth characters are deeply human. Batman captures our anger, paranoia, obsession and drive. Superman captures our optimism, devotion, empathy and belief in the best in others. Batman stories are generally about crazy criminals and corrupts city officials, and how one man with sufficient wit and will can stop the worst of it and make the world just a little better. Superman stories are about world-ending aliens and sci-fi and yet how a good person in the right place and the right time (and with the right powers) can fix everything. It is true that the best Batman stories tend to be dark and the best Superman stories tend to be optimistic, but there are counter-examples to each too, because they're both human and they both encounter happy and dark times in their careers.\n\n(I could also be cute and frame things in a neat line like \"Superman is man in the body of a God, Batman is a God in the body of a man\", but I think forcing these analogies can be very reductive.)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Batman at least the public can relate to for obvious reasons, he&amp;#39;s a regular guy just trying to do good for his city, since he&amp;#39;s seen first hand what happens when the city has no protector. Simple (the whole being super-rich is just icing on the cake, making his char more believable). Superman though were not supposed to relate to, he&amp;#39;s nothing like us. He&amp;#39;s there as a beacon of hope, that no matter how bad things get, never fear cause Superman can save the day!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I think you misunderstand Superman, or at least you&amp;#39;re forgoing one very popular and powerful interpretation of him. Here&amp;#39;s my take:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea that Batman is more relatable than Superman just because Superman has powers and Batman doesn&amp;#39;t I think misses out a big part of both characters. There&amp;#39;s this very wrong quote (in my opinion) from Kill Bill 2 that says that Superman is always Superman, whereas Batman is fundamentally Bruce Wayne. I would argue that the opposite is actually closer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bruce Wayne&amp;quot; died when his parents were killed. From that moment, he had already devoted himself to avenging his parents and fighting the criminal world. Depending on which origin story you&amp;#39;re following, he devoted himself to mastering his mind, body and soul to fight his crusade from young to adulthood, and at some point adopts the Bat symbol. His whole being is devoted to being Batman. His &amp;quot;Bruce Wayne&amp;quot; identity is a facade, or tool, or inconvenience depending on the story, that he works with/around while on his Batman crusade against crime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Superman&amp;quot; is a role Clark Kent plays. Clark Kent is a all-American good-guy &lt;em&gt;who just happens to have superpowers&lt;/em&gt;. The best stories about Clark always emphasize his Midwestern roots and parents and values for this reason. What would Clark Kent be without his power? Probably still just as good a person, helping everyone he can. What would Clark do if one day his job was done and the world was at peace? Retire and live happily ever after with Lois Lane.
