It\u2019s a confused film, a patchwork of sentimental ideas and styles messily executed, but also a brave one, confronting the past through four wonderfully realised characters, rather than replicating it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dganztw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492293417.0, "created_utc": 1492264617.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbjrdc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "icantbelieveyoutho", "parent_id": "t1_dgbc1a6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for telling me to kill myself over something stupid like this.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for telling me to kill myself over something stupid like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgbjrdc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338357.0, "created_utc": 1492309557.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gg0a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbd3eg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "icantbelieveyoutho", "parent_id": "t1_dgbc1a6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"To see this movie\" would imply just does the tickets, so nope.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To see this movie&amp;quot; would imply just does the tickets, so nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgbd3eg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328775.0, "created_utc": 1492299975.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbc1a6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PM_YOUR_CLIT", "parent_id": "t1_dgbbame", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because I'm not single and popcorn + drink.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#39;m not single and popcorn + drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgbc1a6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492327278.0, "created_utc": 1492298478.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbbame", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "icantbelieveyoutho", "parent_id": "t1_dgbaygm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How does it cost 30 dollars?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does it cost 30 dollars?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgbbame", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492326203.0, "created_utc": 1492297403.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbaygm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PM_YOUR_CLIT", "parent_id": "t1_dgb97k6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can rent for like 3 dollars... lmao.
