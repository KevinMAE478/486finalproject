You're not the only person I've heard say that, about not liking Superman until MoS, but for me as a lifelong fan I'm just sitting there in the theatre thinking \"That's *not* Superman!\"\n\nWhat I think WB/DC has struggled to understand is that it's *okay* if people don't like a certain character.  That's the entire reason we have so many great characters in each company's universe.  Look at the Marvel movies: for some people Iron Man is their favorite, for some it's Captain America, others like Doctor Strange best, or Thor, or even Ant-Man.  Each movie has been true to their respective character and fans have been able to find the one they engage with the most.\n\nOn the flip-side of that though, WB/DC just kind of makes every movie character the same.  Superman became dark and brooding to appeal to the people who love Batman, and by all appearances they've done the same with Aquaman and their other characters.  That's great for one type of fan I think, but it strips the characters of their uniqueness that, when combined, can have a much broader appeal.\n\nI think WB could make a great movie about a more classic type of Superman (it's worked for Marvel - Captain America is basically a more accurate Superman than WB has made in a while) and it may not be everyone's cup of tea just as 'Captain America: The First Avenger' wasn't every Marvel fan's favorite movie, but having that Superman in contrast to the darker, brooding Batman, in contrast to a unique Wonder Woman, a unique Flash, and so on, could result in a better and more diverse film universe, both in terms of content and audiences.

You&amp;#39;re not the only person I&amp;#39;ve heard say that, about not liking Superman until MoS, but for me as a lifelong fan I&amp;#39;m just sitting there in the theatre thinking &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Superman!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I think WB/DC has struggled to understand is that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; if people don&amp;#39;t like a certain character.  That&amp;#39;s the entire reason we have so many great characters in each company&amp;#39;s universe.  Look at the Marvel movies: for some people Iron Man is their favorite, for some it&amp;#39;s Captain America, others like Doctor Strange best, or Thor, or even Ant-Man.  Each movie has been true to their respective character and fans have been able to find the one they engage with the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip-side of that though, WB/DC just kind of makes every movie character the same.
