Before the MCU his title was B-list at best, sales were often rocky, and rarely if ever justified multiple books (unlike Batman or Spider-Man, for example, that have different books to experiment with different tones or eras in their career, etc). I would say that his popularity has spread beyond the movies, I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re still going on but I remember that there were a couple of Iron Man books at one point last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note: The fact that (based on the &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; trailer) Marvel feels it needs Iron Man to put butts in seats for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely insane, bizarro-universe type stuff to me. The only Marvel character that could hold a candle to Spider-Man in popularity throughout the 90s / 00s was Wolverine, maybe Hulk. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dg3vz12", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491915775.0, "created_utc": 1491886975.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 119}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n1yo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3za62", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Radulno", "parent_id": "t1_dg3umj8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; As someone who's not a comic fan it's hard to imagine Iron Man being a B list hero.\n\nWell as a non-comic reader, before the first Iron Man movie, I didn't even know the character existed.

Add in the fact that because we're getting *three* films this year, Guardians Vol. 2 has been competing with promotion for both Spider-Man and Thor. Normally they'll focus on just the next film, but now Guardians is sharing the promotional spotlight with The Defenders, Homecoming and Ragnarok. That's a *lot* of material.

We're gonna be getting some rapid-fire MCU films rolling out, so there isn't as much long-term anticipation and hype built up as there was when the latest film had just come out a month ago and they dropped the next trailer on us for a film that was half a year away.
