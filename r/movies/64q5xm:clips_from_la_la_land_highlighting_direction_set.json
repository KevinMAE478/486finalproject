And Another Day in the Sun is the exact same song as Someone in the Crowd just with inaudible vocals. \n\nWhy is there about 40 minutes in the middle where there's no songs? That's not how you make a musical. Not to mention most of the songs do nothing to develop character and plot, like songs from a musicals are meant to do. \n\nThe casting of Mia's husband. Who the fuck believes that a woman that had previously dated Ryan Gosling would be happily married to an ugly guy that looks about 15 years older than her? Seriously? It's not like she would have done it for money.\n\nDo you want me to go on?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script could have been a tad stronger? The script was fucking awful. Felt like I was on a rollercoaster watching it. One minute I was enjoying myself and the next minute I was bored out of my mind. It says something that Eva Mendes made up the best line in the entire thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The performances were also bang average. Emma Stone&amp;#39;s big audition scene? She doesn&amp;#39;t even change facial expression. She looks bored the whole way through the song! Don&amp;#39;t get me started on that hideous blue sweater she&amp;#39;s wearing, thank fuck this film didn&amp;#39;t win the costumes Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The opening scene is awful. Sure it&amp;#39;s filmed impressively but it&amp;#39;s completely off to the tone of the rest of the movie and makes it come across like it&amp;#39;s going to be some cheesy High School Musical type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound mixing is also really bad, particularly in the opening scene. You can&amp;#39;t hear what they&amp;#39;re singing because the music is so  much louder than the vocals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The songs other than maybe City of Stars and Somewhere in the Crowd are completely basic and unmemorable.
