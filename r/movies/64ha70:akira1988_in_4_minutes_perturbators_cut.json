When Tetsuo awakens to his latent powers, the hierarchy of his world gradually upends itself and he sees himself as the creator of a new order. In the movie, this leads to him exerting physical dominance on every layer of society that previously superceded him importance, and culminates in him creating a new world that he appoints himself god as. In the manga this plays out a bit differently, but it ends with the same result.\n\nIn Chronicle, we have Andrew who finds himself at the bottom of: 1) a capitalist society, communicated as allegory through his sick mother who can't afford her medication; 2) his school, where he's socially withdrawn and where his brief moment of success quickly transitions into humiliation; 3) the one circle of friends he does have, which he feels inferior to based on social success and the stability of their family; and finally 4) his own family unit, wherein he is bullied by his father. Where Tetsuo in Akira sees himself as being at the bottom of a kind of monarchical order (in the manga he eventually crowns Akira king of the nation he establishes),  Andrew sees it as even less civilized: Andrew thinks of himself as being at the bottom of the food chain. Andrew differs from Tetsuo here in that instead of attempting to create a new social order, he instead comes to see the world as not being any different from the ecological environments we might study in school. Ergo, Andrew sees the world as a jungle and himself as literally an \"apex predator\" who can take what he wants. And of course the first thing we see Andrew do is take money from local bullies to pay for medicine for his mother. Thus rather than creating a new world of his own design by force, Andrew responds by, in his view, taking the top spot in the only kind of social order that he sees as existing: survival of the fittest.\n\nSo I think both movies kind of explore what is ultimately the inverse of a superhero movie. In your typical superhero movie, the protagonist tends to go on a journey that ends with him finding self actualization through contributing to his society on a scale he couldn't before. Akira and Chronicle instead have their protagonists questioning the merit of the society that currently exists as well as the people who administer its rules. But they kind of differ on what conclusion the protagonists reach: Tetsuo ultimately opts to create something that is new (and in the manga, still ordered), where Andrew sees \"society\" as a veil for the same kind of animalistic competition that exists in nature and seemingly rejects the idea of it entirely. \n\nAgain, this isn't to say they're the same movie. I just think there are enough similarities that I can see why Chronicle communicates a similar enough message and themes to some people that it comes across as a \"remake\" in the ways they find most meaningful. There are of course plenty of ways in which Chronicle doesn't address things that Akira does and vice versa, and I'm sure those ways makes them very distinct to you in the ways you find most meaningful.\n\nAlso I really like Akira so this post was kind of an excuse for me to type a bunch of words about it.
