Obviously this is a win for a very weak weekend that is more a holding pattern before The Fate of the Furious takes more screens than any other film in April history. Still the film featured a very solid 47% drop and of course is profiting off a very surprising $50M opening last weekend, far surpassing expectations. Not to mention Boss Baby completely shrugged off the animated film competition in Smurfs. Right now the film is performing about the same level as Dreamwork&amp;#39;s 2015 film Home, and should similarly end up in the $175M range domestically. Boss Baby isn&amp;#39;t going to be remembered as a groundbreaking animation but it has shown that there is a market still for the more cartoony, silly animated films especially in an always hungry marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smurfs are a weird brand. Why does the &lt;strong&gt;Smurfs: The Lost Village&lt;/strong&gt; an animated Smurfs movie open at #3 to $14M when a live/action movie about Smurfs in New York trying to save some dudes marriage open at #2 to $35.2M? Who knows, but yes the newest animated Smurfs film failed to excite even the children as it barely maid any money in its US opening, opening even worse than the previous live action films mentioned. The strange thing is Sony already knew that Smurfs: The Lost Village would fizzle in the US as the film was barely intended for a US audience in the first place. See the Smurfs are really popular overseas, like the last two movies made over $250M in international sales popular. And now the film is basically pulling a xXx: Return of Xander Cage move, giving a wide release in the US but barely caring about it and focusing all the efforts on the foreign markets. So far it seems to be working as the film made $42M overseas already. It also helps Sony is pulling an Illumination move of keeping the cost down (Lost Village only costs $60M) which gives a lot of buffer if the film fails to ignite overseas. Sony isn&amp;#39;t the only one trying to profit off surprisingly brand loyalty overseas. Did you know Universal has an animated Woody Woodpecker movie coming out this year? If you didn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s probably because you don&amp;#39;t live in Brazil. Yup, Brazil is the only country currently with a planned release for the film, they already have Brazilian trailers and posters for the movie. See the thing is, Woody Woodpecker is insanely popular in Brazil, with many kids growing up on him in that country. So instead of doing what Sony did Universal just cut out the middleman and are making a major character in their library just for a non-English language country. There&amp;#39;s a very interesting world these two films are possibly opening up, where these troublesome properties with nowhere to go but are surprisingly popular outside the usual English language countries could become pinpoint targeted with to those markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess the old guys doing stuff genre still has some juice in it as &lt;strong&gt;Going in Style&lt;/strong&gt; opened to a surprising #4 with $12.5M. While that sounds pretty bad, and it&amp;#39;s certainly not amazing, it actually surpassed the studio and prediction houses&amp;#39; expectations which didn&amp;#39;t even have it cracking the teens. The film seems to be on track with similarly themed Last Vegas, which also featured famous older actors doing wacky young people things which cost about $28M (this film cost $25M) and opened in the teens. If we are looking at that film&amp;#39;s progress then Going in Style should have solid legs and end up making about $50M - $60M when all is said and done. At the very least this is the highest opening for director Zach Braff of his career by 25x, though his last two films were indie releases so that may not really count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time for the small release round-up! After a string of losses it seems Pure Flix has found a new minor hit with &lt;strong&gt;The Case for Christ&lt;/strong&gt;, a biopic about a famous atheist turned Christian defender that opened on 1,100 screens to #10 spot with $3.9M. This comes after the disasterous performance of the much maligned I&amp;#39;m Not Ashamed, showing Pure Flix should stick to their brand, claiming atheists are dummies. This week also finally saw the release of megahit anime film &lt;strong&gt;Your Name&lt;/strong&gt; which opened in 300 theaters to $1.6M. That represents a solid per theater average of $5,281 so it will be interesting to see if Funimation tries to expand more to see if the film will be a surprise hit like it was in Japan and China. However winner of per theater average this week was &lt;strong&gt;Colossal&lt;/strong&gt; the odd Anne Hathaway film which is a mix of mumblecore and kaiju film which has gotten mixed reviews but seems to be on track for a possible big expansion in the coming weeks as it opened in just 4 theaters to $125,809, a per theater average of $31,452. This will be an interesting film to watch as it is the first release from NEON, the new distribution company from Alamo Drafthouse which is hoping to be a more mainstream, A24-esque distribution arm compared to Drafthouse Films which is typically more niche and small scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Films Reddit Wants to Follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren&amp;#39;t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

The opening for Fantastic Beasts felt a little weak, as it was the worst opening for any Wizarding World film, but in the end the film found its footing and while it is the lowest grossing Wizarding World film domestically and the second lowest grossing worldwide it still managed to get past that $750M worldwide point that basically defines the brand. Honestly WB would have probably settled for a $500M - $600M showing as the film was an experiment to see if people cared more about the world or \"the boy who lived\", but this shows that a five film series isn't necessarily the worst idea if the start is this strong to begin with. With the possibility of more marketable characters like Dumbledore to appear in future installments the franchise seems on excellent ground moving forward. \n\n\n* **Trolls** While Dreamworks latest film is cleaning up their previous effort has closed to a solid $153.7M domestic and $344.7M worldwide on a budget of $125M. Trolls unfortunately couldn't seem to translate the super successful Justin Timberlake song into massive success, but the animated film ended up okay mostly led by a few good showings in foreign countries like France and Russia. \n\n* **Fences** The first of the Oscar winners to close post-ceremony, Fences has closed to a very good $57.6M domestic and $64.4M worldwide on a budget of $24M. Originally intended as an HBO exclusive, the film used its star power and acclaim to bring in a sizable amount of money for what was basically a A-list led filmed play. Don't expect the nine future August Wilson adaptations from Washington to get this kind of exposure, but it represents a great start to the series and another case for why Oscars matter in getting adult dramas like this seen. \n\n* **Resident Evil: The Final Chapter** Methinks this will not be the \"final\" chapter as the sixth Resident Evil film closed to a shocking $26.8M domestic but $312.2M worldwide on a budget of $40M. If that split seems wide to you, it is as the domestic gross only amounted for a measly 8.6% of its total gross. Of course most of that comes from China where the film made a whopping $159M, an increase of $100M+ from the previous entry's earnings in the country. Now Final Chapter is the highest grossing Resident Evil film despite earning the worst of all the films domestically including $44M less domestically than previous winner RE:Afterlife. With such a shocking jump in interest in China it will be very hard for ScreenGems to just let this franchise go, despite the ironic title (though that didn't stop the Friday the 13th franchise). \n\n* **Fifty Shades Darker** While the delayed sequel to the mega erotic drama hit wasn't quite the success of its predecessor it still scored big thanks to its February release earning $114.4M domestic and $378.8M worldwide on a budget of $55M. While the film didn't crack $500M like the previous entry it still was a very significant R-rated hit across the world, in fact opening to the fourth highest R-rated opening worldwide, even surpassing the original in many ways. However the drop-off was even more extreme than the last film, as evidence by a $300M+ film closing in just 7 weeks. These diminishing returns show its good business for Universal to rush out the final film and thankfully not split it up into unnecessary extra parts. \n\n* **The Great Wall** If the idea for Great Wall was to make the first Chinese blockbuster to blow up overseas then it wasn't a huge success as the film closed to $45.1M domestic and $330.6M worldwide on a budget of $150M. Clearly the controversial casting of Matt Damon was an attempt to do to the US what they do to China, cast one of their major stars in a foreign film to bring in interest. However despite being the most expensive film in Chinese history it didn't quite excite even the Chinese market. It did okay, earning $170M but you have to put that in context. That's the same amount that Resident Evil: The Final Chapter and xXx: Return of Xander Cage made in the country, and those are US imports that gets limited time in Chinese theaters to play while Great Wall got preferential treatment as a Chinese production. Also when you compare it to the big Chinese film hits of 2016, Monster Hunt ($381.8M) and The Mermaid ($526.8M), it pales in comparison. The film isn't a failure financially but it is a failed experiment that shows just because you have the trappings of an American blockbuster doesn't mean you will perform like one.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notable Film Closings: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them&lt;/strong&gt; While it took a while to find its footing Fantastic Beasts ended up performing right on track with most Harry Potter films closing to $234M domestic and $813.2M worldwide on a budget of $180M.
