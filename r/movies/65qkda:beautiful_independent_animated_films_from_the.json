It has three production companies listed on imbd, two of which have only produced Tower, while the third one has only produced two other movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Window Horses is a Canadian movie funded with indiegogo and Canadian government grants, plus the production companies of Ann Marie Fleming (director of the film) and Sandra Oh (actress in the film).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree something like Your Name wouldn&amp;#39;t be considered indie in Japan because it was produced by a regular anime-making studio (CoMix Wave Films) and distributed by a prolific distributor (Toho). However, it still wasn&amp;#39;t picked for distribution by one of the major American distributors (unlike The Wild Life or Rock Dog, which were picked by Lionsgate and went wide).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movie Big Fish &amp;amp; Begonia was made by two guys who started a company and worked on their movie for years before getting the backing of a big Chinese company.
