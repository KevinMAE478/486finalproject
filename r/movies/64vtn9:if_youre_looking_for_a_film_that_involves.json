Actually the results vary wildly, depending on &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is taking the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People in third world countries were more likely to accept any offer, even when they would get a ridiculously low sum. That is because &amp;quot;money is money&amp;quot; to them. They didn&amp;#39;t care that A got more than B, just that they got &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr &lt;strong&gt;Depending on the cultural or socio-economic background of your test-subjects you get different results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Stanford Prison and Milgram Experiments had a very narrow sample size, mainly middle aged white men from a middle class background. That doesn&amp;#39;t tell you, how a group of grandmas would have reacted in this situation or any kind of minority. If you put a group of Holocaust survivors in there, would they have turned to monsters too? What if you picked someone who hid jews during WW2?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr &lt;strong&gt;People aren&amp;#39;t inherently evil.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t let anybody tell you that. It is merely an excuse by actually evil people, so they won&amp;#39;t get persecuted for their deeds.
