That jar jar was a marketing ploy (that worked. Again, I was 7). Truthfully, those are my only marks against it. The rest of the movie was stunning for the time, the acting wasn&amp;#39;t outstanding, but the kind of stiff robotic sense you get played well into the climate they set, political tension and distrust, not knowing what you can and can&amp;#39;t say without reprimand. The Jedi were a stoic order at the time, they were nearer to politicians than peacekeepers for the most part. I think it holds up, with the notable exceptions of jar jar and midichlorians. It&amp;#39;s by no means the best Star wars movie, but it told a story of a different time in that history, much the way movies in a Victorian setting are in a different time, where there were different rules and customs and social norms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dg9a8te", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212935.0, "created_utc": 1492184135.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ctje", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9aak4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "notgravy", "parent_id": "t3_65ctje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I thought that while the duel was spectacular, it lacked the trash talking the OT added to it's duels.  \nThe podrace was ok, but seemed forced.  \nJar-Jar and the underwater stufff, yeah...no.  \nI thought the beginning was awesome, with everyone afraid of the Jedi's even though it was somewhat cartoonish in nature.  \nThe battle looked great, seemed too PG'ish.
