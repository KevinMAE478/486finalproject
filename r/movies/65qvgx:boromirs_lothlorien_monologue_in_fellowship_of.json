The second and third movies picked up much more speed, so adding one hour of extra scenes very noticably hurts their rythm. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgd0hty", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426851.0, "created_utc": 1492398051.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qvgx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvz0l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "debacol", "parent_id": "t1_dgchwlo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No movie version is better for tolkien superfans.
