Aliens is a great action movie that is outdone by Scott&amp;#39;s far superior original. The Abyss is a fantastic film. Everything since ranges from mediocre to awful. Cameron had a terrific run of three films, all in the sci-fi genre, all in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By comparison with Spielberg you have Duel, Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, ET, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Empire Of the Sun, Jurassic Park, Schindler&amp;#39;s List, Saving Private Ryan, AI, Minority Report, Catch Me If You Can, War Of The Worlds, Munich, Lincoln, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of Spielberg&amp;#39;s minor works would be considered brilliant by anyone else. To have such a prolific career of such incredible films over decades is an insanely high bar that Cameron (or anyone else outside of Scorsese) cannot touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgcvxzm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492420615.0, "created_utc": 1492391815.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcun19", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 76, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThatDamnedImp", "parent_id": "t1_dgctu7j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You may say this flippantly, but people will remember James Cameron for this bullshit (and movies are the greatest illusions humanity has ever pulled off, which makes them Grade-A bullshit in my book) for centuries.
