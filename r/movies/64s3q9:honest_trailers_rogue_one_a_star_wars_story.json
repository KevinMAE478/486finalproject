You introduce a telepathic tentacle monster and say that is causes the victim to lose their mind, you expect later in the movie there to be a plot point that related to this character losing their mind. I expected Bohdi to struggle with his mental health/sanity, and then through some action overcome that obstacle and triumph. That doesn't happen. They meet him in the jail cell and he has some memory loss and seems disturbed, but then through the rest of the movie nothing happens with him to indicate that he is still struggling with his mental health, or that he has overcome it. It just isn't referenced again in the movie aside from having him act a little strange here and there. \n\nTo me that seems like either poor writing or at one point there was a reason for him to have lost his mind, but it it was taken out on in the editing room.
