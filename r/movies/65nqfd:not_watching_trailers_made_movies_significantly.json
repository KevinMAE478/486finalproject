Growing up trailers were my favorite thing. I loved being hyped for a movie to come out. However, numerous times trailers have spoilers for movies coming out. Even if the trailer doesn&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;spoiler&amp;quot; it can have a scene from the end of the movie that you&amp;#39;re waiting for that can count as a spoiler. An example without trying to do a spoiler in an actual movie is that you see a character from the movie that does something you haven&amp;#39;t seen yet, but they just had a scene where they are supposed to be dead and now you know they aren&amp;#39;t because they haven&amp;#39;t done the scene from the trailer yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spoilers aside a lot of times people who do the trailer portray the movie incorrectly then how you do once you watch the movie.
