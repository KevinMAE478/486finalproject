The third problem was, the two main characters (the thief and the cobbler) don&amp;#39;t speak at all for almost the entire movie. There is hardly any dialogue-- the action and story are told almost entirely visually. Only secondary characters have voices. The studio thought that this wasn&amp;#39;t #relatable enough for their target audience, and it wasn&amp;#39;t like they could just dub voices in since the mouths of the characters never moved. So to fix the &amp;quot;problem,&amp;quot; they brought in Matthew Broderick to unnecessarily narrate everything that happens. And oh, my brothers. Is it better for a man to have chosen evil than to have good imposed upon him? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cloying amount of schmaltz in Broderick&amp;#39;s incessant, superfluous voiceover is appalling. It adds nothing to the movie. It ruins it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a glimpse of the masterpiece that could have been, go out and watch &amp;quot;The Thief and the Cobbler: Recobbled Cut&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgco2km", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492409950.0, "created_utc": 1492381150.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oxsz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oxsz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcv13i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NotTopherGrace", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9xyr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Jay Baruchel\n\nThat fuck taught me how to properly cook meat without dying when I was like 7, put some respeck on his name.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jay Baruchel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That fuck taught me how to properly cook meat without dying when I was like 7, put some respeck on his name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgcv13i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419427.0, "created_utc": 1492390627.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oxsz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oxsz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcegoh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "420falilv", "parent_id": "t1_dgcafb4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Hop was just a bad film\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hop was just a bad film&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "movies", "name": "t1_dgcegoh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492397377.0, "created_utc": 1492368577.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcafb4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nuts_out_latenight", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9xyr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Russell Brand is pretty good as Dr. Nefario in Despicable Me though.
