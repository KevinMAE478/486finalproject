The plucky, younger accompanying child snatches the phone from BDH's hands and l337 h4ckz his way into it. The kid says the 'signal' has been 'triangulated' from this 'vector', and BDH says \"but I thought inGen closed down?\" And Chris Pratt stares out over the horizon and narrows his eyes as a dinosaur roars in the distance.\n\nAt the end of the second act, the group enters the derelict bunker where the signal is coming from - the one with the giant radar dishes on top and the place that is using about 90% of the island's power supply. They creep through and they find some early-twenties Greenpeace type, who sits in front of half a dozen screens and wipes DORITO dust on his 'Feel the Bern' t-shirt. He spouts activist bullshit about freeing caged animals, but from the shadows a solitary figure rolls forward in an electric wheelchair. John Hammond, old and decrepit and emaciated, smirks throughout a ten minute recap between himself and BDH about who everyone is and what their motivations are and *remember the plot of the first film*?\n\nHammond says he has only months to live (wheeze wheeze cough cough), and wants to see nature's greatest ever apex predator given a chance to reach the top of its local biome, because apparently 'dinosaur' is a species. T-Rex, velociraptor, stegasaurus - they're all basically like breeds of dog. He orders the neckbeard to open the *super secret dangerous enclosure*, and for some reason even that idealist thinks it's a bad idea. \n\nHammond aims a gun at the kid, so the neckbeard does what he's told. Hammond looks at Chris Pratt and says \"we spared no expense\" before shooting the activist in the back of the head. The woman and children scream and are rendered powerless in the face of adversity. Chris Pratt glares and says \"Mr Hammond, you want to see an apex predator? You're about to\" as he backs away with BDH and the kids. Hammond turns and rolls away into the darkness, laughing and coughing maniacally as he goes.\n\nThen there's another 45 minutes of CGI dinosaurs fighting each other in badly choreographed sequences as the humans run past more product placement. Hammond gets into a private helicopter and takes off, but as he looks out the window the treeline shakes and Hammond's eyes widen. Pratt, BDH and the kids get onto their rescue vehicle, and the plucky younger deadsec thing uses the merc's iPHONE 6S PLUS to track Hammond, and says that his helicopter crashed just after take off.\n\nBDH asks Pratt \"do you think he's dead?\" And Pratt responds \"I think life will find a way.\" In the distance, a dinosaur roars. Cue John Williams score. The r/movies thread gets astroturfed with comments that say \"this is great fun if you just don't think too hard about it.\"\n\nIf they're going to shit on characters from the previous films, at least they intend to shit on the bit part that was in a single scene.
