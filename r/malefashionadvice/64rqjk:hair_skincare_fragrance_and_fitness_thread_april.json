Hair is longer than the rest there, seems like it won&amp;#39;t stand up enough to get clipped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas on how I can trim the bottom of my hairline on the neck so it&amp;#39;s even? Without the assistance of another person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And any recs on a different/better option than a beard trimmer? Also, with hair this short how often should I trim?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recent hair length before trim: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/KK3bZiY.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/KK3bZiY.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roughly current length after trim, older pic not sure what a #2 translates to: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/rIEqoI9.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/rIEqoI9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg5hb1b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492000822.0, "created_utc": 1491972022.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rqjk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rqjk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rqjk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6gf0t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shortalay", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wmrt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, people said that there was a difference on which lasted longer and which were easy to clean and the like, that bacteria can grow on it rapidly from the dead skin cells is a concern of mine.
