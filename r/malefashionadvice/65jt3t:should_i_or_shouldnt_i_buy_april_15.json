I&amp;#39;m looking for some casual sneakers similar to &lt;a href=\"https://www.yellowshoes.com/products/octave-francais?variant=33599163020\"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, which I got a while back in Montreal but they only lasted a few months (they were cheap as hell). I found &lt;a href=\"http://www.vans.com/shop/atwood-textile-black-orion?storeId=10153&amp;amp;urlLangId=-1&amp;amp;productId=3472919&amp;amp;urlRequestType=Base&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;catalogId=10703\"&gt;Vans Atwoods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.vans.com/shop/chukka-low-denim-black?storeId=10153&amp;amp;urlLangId=-1&amp;amp;productId=3526463&amp;amp;urlRequestType=Base&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;catalogId=10703\"&gt;Vans Chukka Lows&lt;/a&gt; which seem similar, though in my limited experience with Vans back in high school, I remember them running a bit too narrow for me (I think it was Authentic Core Classics, I don&amp;#39;t seem to have a problem with any other brands I&amp;#39;ve tried besides Nike, though), so I&amp;#39;m not sure if I should buy them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t be able to go to the mall for a while (it&amp;#39;s nearly finals time), so I won&amp;#39;t really be able to try them on. Anyone have experience with these? Do they look decent/is the width pretty standard? Also open to other suggestions, but I&amp;#39;m looking to spend under $80 roughly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dgbcx1t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328531.0, "created_utc": 1492299731.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jt3t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jt3t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbf22d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BoldestKobold", "parent_id": "t1_dgbebd5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Of the two, I like the Navy/Red, but that could be just because I expect the Black/Blue to have a Carolina Panthers logo.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the two, I like the Navy/Red, but that could be just because I expect the Black/Blue to have a Carolina Panthers logo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dgbf22d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331559.0, "created_utc": 1492302759.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbebd5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LitFacts", "parent_id": "t3_65jt3t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In the Navy/Red or the Black/Blue color\n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/142307353174 ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Navy/Red or the Black/Blue color&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/142307353174\"&gt;https://www.ebay.com/itm/142307353174&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dgbebd5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492330470.0, "created_utc": 1492301670.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jt3t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jt3t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbon1u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bamgrinus", "parent_id": "t1_dgber0r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wouldn't pay that much for a quartz watch.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay that much for a quartz watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dgbon1u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492345970.0, "created_utc": 1492317170.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgber0r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tessl", "parent_id": "t3_65jt3t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://vincerocollective.com/collections/watches/products/the-bellwether-silver-white\n\nSummer watch.
