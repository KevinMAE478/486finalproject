Their prices are in line with or cheaper than companies like Epaulet, Wolf v. Goat, etc. They aren't filling the fast fashion, perpetual sale niche that J.Crew, BR, HM, whatever are. They're a menswear boutique and they're priced accordingly. In what world is $450 expensive for a blazer? Suit Supply, which is commonly recommended here, sells for $400-500 and makes in China.\n\n3. And in terms of prices, I don't think the added value here comes from \"brand name\" recognition.
