Some opt for the [Standard Kit](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/budget-starter-kit/) since it comes with an alum block (which is useful at the beginning because when you rub it on your face after a shave you'll *know* where you used bad technique, but less useful later - I hate alum) and a full size soap instead of a large sample.\n\n[Stirling Soaps](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/starter-kits/) also has a starter kit as well as [Chiseled Face Groomatorium](https://www.groomatorium.com/product-category/shaving/shaving-kits/) (which comes in a nice box) - both of these guys also sell their own soap, while Maggards is probably *the* online wetshaving vendor.\n\nIf you want to make your own, you can start with the [Maggard V3 head paired with one of their many handles](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/safety-razors/maggard-razors-safety-razors/) - this is what I started with and you can do the same with Stirling and CFG, though Maggards will have the most variety.  \nYou can also stop by /r/Shave_Bazaar and pick up a vintage Gillette Tech for ~$10-15 from someone. The vintage Gillettes are typically made of brass and are very durable (as opposed to the cheaper razors that are made of a brittle zinc alloy that'll break if the chrome plating chips off, though that shouldn't be an issue if you don't drop things lol).\n\nAs for brushes:\nNever buy a badger brush for under ~$35. The best budget badger brush you can get at that price point is the [Stirling 24mm badger brush](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/finest-badger-shave-brush-24mm-x-54mm/), though Maggards recently introduced a [$25 Badger brush](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-22mm-2-band-badger-shaving-brush-aluminum-handle/) that seems to get good reviews, though I've never tried it. Oh also, **NEVER BUY PURE BADGER** - that shit has clipped tips on the hairs and will scratch your face to oblivion.  \nThe more budget friendly options are synthetic brushes and boar brushes. [Stirling](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm/), [Maggards](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-24mm-synthetic-shaving-brush-black-handle/), and [Chiseled Face](https://www.groomatorium.com/product/chiseled-face-fauxmere-shaving-brush-24mm/) all have their own brand synthetic brushes that use similar fibers that should be very soft and easy to lather, plus they're around $10. Boar brushes will feel more \"natural\" and less \"springy\" on your face, but do require a break in period (Omega branded ones tend to break in faster than Semogue, but both have their fans) - I personally wouldn't go this route if you just wanted to try wetshaving first.\n\nBlades: Buy a sampler pack and see what you like best, stick with that kind of blade until you get the technique down, then you can go to [tryablade.com](http://tryablade.com/) and sample a bunch of blades without committing to the 5-pack \"tucks\" in case you don't like a blade.\n\nSoap: pretty subjective: just avoid glycerine based soaps like [Col. Conk](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/col-conk-bay-rum-shave-soap-2-25-oz/) and you should be good - quality shave soaps tend to have stearic acid (also listed as potassium stearate and sodium stearate) high up in the ingredients list. Most of the stuff sold on Maggards (includes CFG and Stirling) should be good quality (my top 5 brands are [L&amp;L Grooming](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/ll-grooming-co/), [Barrister and Mann](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/barrister-mann/) (which has a budget \"[Latha](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/latha/)\" line, [Mickey Lee Soapworks](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/mickey-lee-soapworks/), [Tallow and Steel](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/tallow-and-steel/), and [Wholly Kaw](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/wholly-kaw/), though this list is non-exhaustive).\n\n________________\n\nSorry if this was overwhelming and I totally turned you off from this. At the very minimum you should see a huge benefit from using a shaving soap/cream + brush over using canned shaving cream when using a cartridge razor (moreso than using a safety razor with canned ~~shaving cream~~ goop).

Nothing annoys me more than when shoes start to lose their \"shape\". Shoe trees helps prevent that and even helps prevent/reducing creases. I think shoe trees are absolutely essential for dress shoes. You pay a lot for those and you want to make sure they always look great.\n\n* Layering t-shirts. You can find longlined t-shirts for like 20$ from ASOS for example. These are basically an essential in your wardrobe because they're great for layering or even to wear by themselves.\n\n* Patterned socks are a really nice thing to own for when you dress up in a suit or whatnot and it adds some character to your outfit. That may sound silly because some thing you should only be wearing black socks but it's just something in trend. From what my girlfriend says, girls really like it too because it shows that the guy has some character. \n\n* I'm sure I'm not the only one here who has their days where they don't want to deal with their hair so they just throw a hat on.
