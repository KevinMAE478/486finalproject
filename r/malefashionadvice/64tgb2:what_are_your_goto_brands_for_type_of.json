Typically nice laundry with any dress shoes i wear to work, and darn tough when i wear boots/chukkas. The darn toughs are more comfortable and prevent bliters, while lasting forever. The nice laundry are more thin but look nicer for work. Still a good quality sock though. Darn tough is the better value in my opinion though. I still wear pairs from 2010 and they&amp;#39;re completely fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg5qow5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492025299.0, "created_utc": 1491996499.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tgb2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tgb2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tgb2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5q47l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IratePuddle", "parent_id": "t1_dg5dt4o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Seeing a common theme here, thanks all", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing a common theme here, thanks all&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg5q47l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492023898.0, "created_utc": 1491995098.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5dt4o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stathibus", "parent_id": "t1_dg5aaoy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "don't put those in the dryer!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;don&amp;#39;t put those in the dryer!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg5dt4o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995198.0, "created_utc": 1491966398.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tgb2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5cx1a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "th3nightm4ncom3th", "parent_id": "t1_dg5aaoy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Others mileage may vary, but I never dry mine because of the wool content - I've not experienced the issues you mention but I acknowledge that's purely anecdotal and could be a coincidence", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others mileage may vary, but I never dry mine because of the wool content - I&amp;#39;ve not experienced the issues you mention but I acknowledge that&amp;#39;s purely anecdotal and could be a coincidence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg5cx1a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993935.0, "created_utc": 1491965135.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5aaoy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IratePuddle", "parent_id": "t1_dg57pmc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Random place to put this, but I haven't loved my Darn Tough socks, they got all pilly and weird, and some of the pieces of the suck shrunk up in the dryer (the calf elastic area for example) while other parts didn't.
