I ask because, lawyer here, (but not your lawyer haha) unless you were trespassing on the dog owner's property or were teasing the dog, you can probably get very easy money, which you may need for scar treatment/plastics work.  \n\nMost states have very strict rules regarding a dog owner's liability.  Most homeowners policies will cover it, so it won't be like you're taking money directly from the dog's owner, just their insurer.  I'm not even a plaintiff's attorney and I still would encourage you to file a claim and perhaps recoup costs of medical treatment, cost of potential plastic surgery, and compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nHope you're feeling ok though!\n\n**Edit:** So yeah, I saw it's OP's dog.  So obviously no claim.  I saw that OP says he lives in Texas.  Actually based on a very quick check on Texas law, I believe Texas has a less strict law regarding animal bites that what I discussed above, which makes it harder to collect on a bite claim.  A person bit would have to prove the owner was negligent and that negligence caused the bite.  Usually one way to do that is show the owner knew of prior bites and/or aggression of the animal.  Unfortunately, OP, you're now on notice of your dog's aggression and prior bite history, should something happen in the future with that dog.\n\n*This definitely is not meant to be definitive legal advice and does not create a legal relationship between me or anyone*, especially you /u/swyx ....", "edited": 1492193144.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was the dog yours?  I ask because, lawyer here, (but not your lawyer haha) unless you were trespassing on the dog owner&amp;#39;s property or were teasing the dog, you can probably get very easy money, which you may need for scar treatment/plastics work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most states have very strict rules regarding a dog owner&amp;#39;s liability.  Most homeowners policies will cover it, so it won&amp;#39;t be like you&amp;#39;re taking money directly from the dog&amp;#39;s owner, just their insurer.  I&amp;#39;m not even a plaintiff&amp;#39;s attorney and I still would encourage you to file a claim and perhaps recoup costs of medical treatment, cost of potential plastic surgery, and compensation for pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope you&amp;#39;re feeling ok though!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; So yeah, I saw it&amp;#39;s OP&amp;#39;s dog.
