the backside of the 3/4 oz leather, I just could not get it on evenly and when I used a dauber it bleed all the way through to the front, very frustrating, I&amp;#39;m sure a larger operation can dip dye their leather but that isn&amp;#39;t practical for me, I hadn&amp;#39;t burnished the edges yet either when the pictures were taken, I should have done as I went along but I didn&amp;#39;t, I&amp;#39;m going to go back over what I can get but that&amp;#39;s not the way it should be done, the veg tan leather i believe is stiffer than what Saddleback uses, but that is dealers choice, some will like that and some won&amp;#39;t, thanks for the comment!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dg6714m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created":
