It should be right at the outside point of your &lt;a href=\"http://ipushweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Acromion.jpg\"&gt;acromion&lt;/a&gt; where your &amp;#39;horizontal&amp;#39; shoulder falls to your &amp;#39;vertical&amp;#39; humerus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I think that&amp;#39;s a dress shirt? There&amp;#39;s no pocket, and it&amp;#39;s not a OCBD. I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend wearing dress shirts un-tucked as you are, nor tucked into shorts unless both are tailors for a &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.ca/search?q=bermuda+shorts+businessman&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqopT0raXTAhUhr1QKHVm-B4kQ_AUICCgB&amp;amp;biw=1186&amp;amp;bih=775\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt; look. Which you shouldn&amp;#39;t do anyway. OCBDs are either cut with a long torso (to be more easily tucked in, to chinos or something) or slightly shorter to look better when untucked (that OCBD + raw denim look, essentially). Your current shirt is a long-cut dress shirt and isn&amp;#39;t cut to be worn untucked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re rolling your sleeves up, do one or two good and tight rolls (like yours), and then the last --- fuck it, just follow &lt;a href=\"http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/21/how-to-roll-shirt-sleeves/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your shorts are very loose-fitting. For how slim you are, you definitely want to find some slimmer-fit shorts. Club Monaco or maybe Bonobos is your friend. Just search for &amp;#39;slim shorts&amp;#39; in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise your choices are safe, normal, and inoffensive. I mean that in a good way. You&amp;#39;ll fit in most anywhere. Khaki and soft blue is a good color choice and you can spice it up with some fun retro running shoes or a light sweater.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dga45u6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492250101.0, "created_utc": 1492221301.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga3jkw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cantfeelmylegs", "parent_id": "t3_65ddhp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Does this combo work at all?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tTIllJL.jpg", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this combo work at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tTIllJL.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/tTIllJL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "name": "t1_dga3jkw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249264.0, "created_utc": 1492220464.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ddhp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r65t", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ddhp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga4ng0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "coconutgrape", "parent_id": "t1_dga38mj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malefashionadvice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't know exact brand, but it's just a charcoal topcoat.
