I agree with the other poster, check the side bar! But I've got this nifty list of what I consider basics. It's my opinion and style, so obviously change it to suit your needs, but I feel like it's a good place to start!\n\nHere's a list of (what I think are) basics, for summer and beyond, and what I think are the best options:\n\n-White and black under shirts:\nI like Hanes Beefy tees, Stafford heavyweight, left field, and velva Sheen, in order of price points. \n-an Oxford or two:\nGap, Charles Tyrwhitt, Gitman, banana, j crew, etc etc etc. everyone and their mother makes these. They're versatile, but they get a LITTLE bit too much love on here. They're kinda boring. But they're definitely something everyone should own, at least one. Light blue or white. Black if you're more awesome.\n-Jeans:\nI could talk for days about denim. I won't but I could. If you're interested in knowing more head over to /r/rawdenim. Obvious option is Levis 501s. They fit everyone. If you want to go the selvedge/raw option, try Levi's selvedge, LVC, Unbranded, Luther's, Nakef and Famous, or TCB.\n-Chinos:\nLeft field makes the best damn chinos out there. Also check RPM West, Freenote, Gustin, and if you're a preppy bro, Dockers or Vineyard Vines. Start with khaki colors. Go from there if you're adventurous.\n-Suit: \nPeople on here will argue with me, but you really don't need more than one suit, maybe two, unless you work in an office with a business dress code. I don't know much about suiting so someone else will have to help you there. I have two vintage Boss suits that I got custom tailored that I never wear unless someone has died. Perks of working in marketing. Grey and black are safe bets.\n-Shoes:\nOne pair of oxfords, one pair of hi top canvas sneakers, one pair of low top canvas sneakers, one pair of loafers (boat shoes count). In order: Allen Edmonds/Johnston and Murphy, PF Flyers, Converse 70s, Bass/rancourt.\n-Boots:\nOne pair of workhorses, one pair of dressier boots, one pair of casual boots. In order, Chippewa/Red Wing/White's, Allen Edmonds/Trickers/Grenson, Clarks/Rancourt/Astorflex. Don't skimp on shoes/boots. They'll last you a lifetime if you buy quality. Head over to /r/goodyearwelt and they'll help you out.\n-Belt:\nI have one belt. Corter Leather Utility Belt. Tanner also makes good belts, some of which are dressier.\n-Outerwear:\nLeather jacket, Chore coat, denim jacket, winter coat. Each of these could technically have its own category but for sake of time, in order: Himel Bros/Lewis leathers/Schott, Pointer Brand/Carhartt, Levi's/TCB/Wrangler, Army Surplus/Patagonia. \n\nThere's definitely more, but that's my basic guide for ya friend.
