From the appearance and feel of the leather, it is apparent that it was done by hand and not factory made. The leather is smooth and elegant yet durable. The only issue that I have, is that the pair I was sent, had a slight amount of scuffing.\n\nI have never had an issue with the stitching on TAFT products and this shoe is no different. The shoe was built via blake construction and the stitching is concise with no strays.\n\n[Check out TAFT\u2019s wide selection of boots and shoes here!](http://taftclothing.com)\n\n**Size/Comfort**\n\nI regularly wear a size 10 (43) and decided to go with the same with this purchase. The clasps, when properly applied, leave a tight yet comfortable fit. The leather insole is lined with a cushioned air bed, making standing or walking in them very comfortable even when going sockless.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe Lucca Monk in Cognac is another stunning TAFT product that really makes your shoes stand out. The handwoven leather base is beautifully constructed with no expense to the comfortability or fit. I highly recommend picking up a pair of these shoes or other TAFT products.\n\nMonday April 17, TAFT will be having their [spring sale](https://taftclothing.com/products/the-lucca-monk-in-cognac?variant=32781843910) where they are offering 20% off on their entire collection.
