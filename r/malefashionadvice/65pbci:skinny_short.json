It will be much easier to find good advice over there than on mfa since most people can't relate.\n\nI'm 5'6 125 lbs, and I can vouch for Peter Manning NYC - it is a quality brand, and they have a shop in New York so you're in luck my friend. I import their shit to Europe despite the taxing and freight costs. The PMNYC Tribeca field jacket is pretty much a must have for any man of modest size. There are other brands that cater towards short men, but PMNYC is the largest and most reputable of them. Jimmy Au's is also very good quality retailer/brand, but the price tag is quite hefty.\n\nOther options for you to explore are: \n\n1) Online made to measure - [tailorstore.com]\n(http://tailorstore.com) \n\n2) Kids clothing with brands like Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Hilfiger, Gant etc. The fit is usually a bit boxy, so you might have to take upper body clothing in a bit.  \n\n3) Buying xxs or xs and then get the stuff tailored. These items will most likely be to long in arms and body, but it's much easier to get slim fit clothing in the adult sizing system.\n\n4) Learn to do simle alterations on your own. I have started to do this recently and it's so worth it.
