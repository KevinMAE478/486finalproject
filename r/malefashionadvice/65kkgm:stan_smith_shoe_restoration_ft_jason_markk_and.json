If I were to do it again, it&amp;#39;d probably take around 20mins as I know what I&amp;#39;m doing now. (Disclaimer: I am not a painter nor do I have any formal painting education. However, this was nonetheless easy.) I mostly just used one coat of the white paint, a couple spots taking two. I did one half of one shoe, put it aside to dry, one half of the other, and repeat. Then I just touched up a couple spots. I used &amp;quot;White&amp;quot; paint. I have not tried &amp;quot;Bone&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Flat White&amp;quot;, but White works perfectly for Stan Smiths. Along with the Jason Markk and Angelus, I bought some random painting brush set on amazon. I just dapped a little paint on scuffs, and went back and forth to blend it in. In all, this was definately worth it. I didn&amp;#39;t use much paint or cleaning solution, so I think the 4oz solution and 4oz paint will last a long time, no need to buy the bigger paint or solution. I think I will buy some red and black paint soon to fix some Bred Jordan 1.5s, and maybe some other shoes in the future. I will post an update in a month or so about how the paint lasts and how the shoe looks. Note: I did not use angelus deglazer or anything similar, as I read it was really not that necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I decided to finally fix up my Stan Smiths.
