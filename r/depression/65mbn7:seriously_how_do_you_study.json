It's very common for people who are depressed to fall behind in their work and studies. The parts of the brain that control motivation, willpower, decision making are weakened during depression. Your \"focus and get stuff done\" brain muscles are weak when you're depressed.\n\nAre you seeing a therapist? I think that is the best thing you can do. A good therapist will help you work through your issues. This will help you peel away the layers of depression and get your brain working at 100% capacity again.\n\nYou say you've been waking up at 6(pm?) but it takes you hours to get out of bed. Maybe you should consider yourself not awake until you get out of bed. You can try to drinking water and splashing water on your face to help you get out of bed.\n\nWhat helps me focus is that I set a timer (on my phone) for 15 minutes. It seems easier to start working when there is a timer ticking down than when there isn't. Also, getting started is the hardest part. So this trick is great because it helps you get started.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it matters too much what music you have in the background or what location you're at. The important thing is that you start the timer, then start studying, then actually make progress on your studying. When the timer goes off you can restart it for another 15 minutes.\n\nAlso, like anything else, studying gets easier the more you study.
