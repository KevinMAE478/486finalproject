We tend to think of moving on as getting further away from the pain and suffering. But struggling to get away from that suffering is it's own form of suffering. \n\nYour pain makes absolute sense. You are still hurting. Trying to force it away from you (or drown it out, or distract away from it) doesn't make it heal. It can even bring you more pain because you're essentially invalidating your own feeling. \n\nI think of trying to get rid of suffering by eliminating the symptoms of your pain as kind of like trying to get rid of a hole by digging it away. Suffering is the experience of having something stripped away from you. You can't heal it by stripping more away. Holes exist because something was stripped away. You treat the hole by filling it back in. Likewise you mend the emotional pain by filling them back in with what was stripped away. \n\nThat's why it feels like the only thing that would make you feel better is him being back. He was stripped away from you- his love and compassion and connection to you- restoring him would fill the hole. Feeling stuck makes sense because this isn't a viable solution. You can't fill it back in with his care and connection to you, but you can fill it with care and compassion towards yourself. Any time you show yourself some kindness or nurturing or accept kindness from someone else, you are filling it in a little bit at a time. \n\nIt's hard because our default is to return to telling ourselves what we should be doing differently - sometimes even disguised as helping ourselves. I gotta master the coping skills and try harder, gotta be nicer to myself, etc. These can be ways of trying to get rid of the pain by digging it out. When you notice yourself doing that, recognize it for what it is- you're saying that you're hurting. When you're hurting, show yourself compassion. Do for yourself what he would do for you if he was here. In that way, you're refilling the hole with him. \n\nI know you're afraid of losing him again. All the ways to 'fix it' and move on feel like covering the hole with a piece of plywood and walking on like it was never there. Then the only way to feel like there's not a hole is to not think about it, and to not think about him would be losing him. Filling in the hole with self compassion and the care he'd want for you means you're bringing him with you. And you can think about him and be grateful for him and review your memories of him because you're not pretending you never lost him. \n\nIn the moments that you decide you're needing compassion but are resisting it, show that resistance compassion to. What are you telling yourself by not wanting to receive compassion? That the part of you that's blaming yourself is hurting and needs compassion. Compassion can be words of comfort, telling yourself it's ok to feel whatever you're feeling, doing something soothing (music, bath, walk, long drive), allowing yourself time and space from other people, etc. It's OK if find yourself criticizing yourself in the middle of trying to be nice to yourself. It's just you saying you need even more self-compassion. \n\nThis can sound a bit too touchy-feely and not sciency enough. I pushed back on it for a long time.

Allowing myself to feel pain without judgment was compassion in itself. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing someone tell you they want you to move on usually doesn&amp;#39;t help make it happen-- even when you really want to honor the person&amp;#39;s wish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s tricky-- our idea of &amp;#39;moving on&amp;#39; can further trap us where we are. We tend to think of moving on as getting further away from the pain and suffering. But struggling to get away from that suffering is it&amp;#39;s own form of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your pain makes absolute sense. You are still hurting. Trying to force it away from you (or drown it out, or distract away from it) doesn&amp;#39;t make it heal. It can even bring you more pain because you&amp;#39;re essentially invalidating your own feeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think of trying to get rid of suffering by eliminating the symptoms of your pain as kind of like trying to get rid of a hole by digging it away. Suffering is the experience of having something stripped away from you. You can&amp;#39;t heal it by stripping more away. Holes exist because something was stripped away. You treat the hole by filling it back in. Likewise you mend the emotional pain by filling them back in with what was stripped away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why it feels like the only thing that would make you feel better is him being back. He was stripped away from you- his love and compassion and connection to you- restoring him would fill the hole. Feeling stuck makes sense because this isn&amp;#39;t a viable solution. You can&amp;#39;t fill it back in with his care and connection to you, but you can fill it with care and compassion towards yourself. Any time you show yourself some kindness or nurturing or accept kindness from someone else, you are filling it in a little bit at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard because our default is to return to telling ourselves what we should be doing differently - sometimes even disguised as helping ourselves. I gotta master the coping skills and try harder, gotta be nicer to myself, etc. These can be ways of trying to get rid of the pain by digging it out. When you notice yourself doing that, recognize it for what it is- you&amp;#39;re saying that you&amp;#39;re hurting. When you&amp;#39;re hurting, show yourself compassion. Do for yourself what he would do for you if he was here. In that way, you&amp;#39;re refilling the hole with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you&amp;#39;re afraid of losing him again.
