You must watch the film to experience it for yourself. No words I write will do it justice. It will make you think and wonder. It will make you gap in awe.

I have always been fascinated with the concept of the butterfly effect, or infinite parallel lives that stem from every decision we make. Throughout each day I find myself thinking about the infinite number of paths my life could have taken at any given point in time. To be honest, it is overwhelming. Every time I think about what I should do with my life, I start to panic. There are so many choices, what do I choose? What is the best path? What if I choose the wrong path? The second I make a choice, I instantly eliminate an infinite number of other options. I guess the thought of eliminating options is the concept that actually scares me.\nAfter reading your post, I was flooded with emotion. I went through something incredibly similar to how you are feeling. I wondered what is the point to all of this? It would be so easy to just remove myself from the decision making process permanently, because then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about this any more. That to me, seemed relieving on a profound level.\nThinking this way really changed the way I lived my life. When you are contemplating death, everything else seems dull in comparison. My only escape from my head and the stress came from living in the moment. I had to make a conscious effort on a minute to minute basis to focus only on the here and now. Every time I would think about stupid stuff I did, or how stressful the future is. I would tell myself to stop. Then I would open my eyes and look around. I would appreciate all the beauty that I would not be seeing if I had taken my life. I take a deep breath through my nose and think about how wonderful this smell is that I would have never smelled if I had taken my life. Even if it is a wretched smell, I still appreciate it for the experience that could have never been. I choose to appreciate the smallest of things on a minute to minute basis, because I believe there is a version of myself that killed himself and never got to experience any of this.\nThe conclusion I came to is I could look at my life as I am in a sea of infinite possibility and if I swim the wrong way, I could drown. Or I could imagine the infinite number of realities where I have already drowned. I could have died at young age or never have been born, or I could have taken my life when I was feeling down. I like to imagine this is the only one path that made it to 24 years old out of an infinite number of possibilities. I imagine this as the golden path, or best case scenario. When I think of it that way, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem so daunting. No matter what I do, I am still the record holder in an infinite number of possibilities.\nI know this was kind of dark and I blabbered on, but I hope you know you are not alone. There are other people out there that go through these times. You just have to find what mindset allows you to move past it. I choose to believe I am the best possible path taken and the record holder at longest life, lol. I hope this helped.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It's been my favorite film for the last three years (I study film so that has to count for something) and I've been depressed for about five years. \n\nThis is a story about a man finding meaning and purpose.
