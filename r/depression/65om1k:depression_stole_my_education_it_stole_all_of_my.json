I want to be a more helpful person, to not get so caught up in thinking about myself--both my mistakes and unhelpful negative predictions for my future. So if I can say something that is the least bit helpful to someone else when I'm rambling, that's a good thing.\n\nI'm nearly twice your age, so I've \"missed out\" on a lot of stuff I fantasize about. But I keep trying to remind myself that fixating on that regret, on \"what if\" only serves to distract me and let me avoid \"now.\" All it does is create more and more regrets for the future. Even if I don't make much progress, I'd still rather look back and see that I started trying. At 19, you have so very little to regret. I know, you may have suffered, lost people you care about, missed one-time experiences, but a good chunk of your life wasn't even really in your control as a kid. You weren't really you yet, and really, you still aren't (though we're always evolving and growing, so you'll never settle into a permanent version of you anyway). So at 19, you're right and you know that the best is yet to come. But don't blame yourself for your depression. Not that helpful, I know, but take it from everyone here who's older than you, depression and regret might seem to mellow as we age, but most of us wish we'd found help sooner or started trying to be healthier sooner. It's usually one of those regrets we get hung up on. Which is still just depression trying to keep us down.\n\nDon't call yourself stupid. Hey, I know, all of depression feels stupid, especially if you look at people who don't seem to be depressed or who do so much more than you. Maybe they do, but so what? You're not them. Don't try to base your own happiness on their example. Instead, just work on trying to live a life you want to live. I know, seeing happiness in others, seeing material things and success feels like the life you want to live, but it's a little different because it's still more fantasy than actual introspection or prioritization. \n\nIf you're really struggling, especially if it's been going on for a while or isn't tied to a specific event you expect to ease, you should look for help. Talk to a family member or friend you trust some, or at least look into therapy/counseling.

You have a long life ahead of you, and most of what you've been through so far is going to become less and less important. Your 20s and 30s are when you will try so many new things, meet so many new people, and start to figure out what kind of life you want to live. Take it from someone in his 30s, the sooner you work to get yourself in the right mindset, the more you'll be able to experience life when you have the most freedom to change.\n\nIt's not too late for any of us, but those of you who are younger, Hell, you've got even more time to live a better life ahead of you. Don't regret the time you've wasted. Fight to not waste the time ahead of you.

I want to be a more helpful person, to not get so caught up in thinking about myself--both my mistakes and unhelpful negative predictions for my future. So if I can say something that is the least bit helpful to someone else when I&amp;#39;m rambling, that&amp;#39;s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m nearly twice your age, so I&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;missed out&amp;quot; on a lot of stuff I fantasize about. But I keep trying to remind myself that fixating on that regret, on &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; only serves to distract me and let me avoid &amp;quot;now.&amp;quot; All it does is create more and more regrets for the future. Even if I don&amp;#39;t make much progress, I&amp;#39;d still rather look back and see that I started trying. At 19, you have so very little to regret. I know, you may have suffered, lost people you care about, missed one-time experiences, but a good chunk of your life wasn&amp;#39;t even really in your control as a kid. You weren&amp;#39;t really you yet, and really, you still aren&amp;#39;t (though we&amp;#39;re always evolving and growing, so you&amp;#39;ll never settle into a permanent version of you anyway). So at 19, you&amp;#39;re right and you know that the best is yet to come. But don&amp;#39;t blame yourself for your depression. Not that helpful, I know, but take it from everyone here who&amp;#39;s older than you, depression and regret might seem to mellow as we age, but most of us wish we&amp;#39;d found help sooner or started trying to be healthier sooner. It&amp;#39;s usually one of those regrets we get hung up on. Which is still just depression trying to keep us down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t call yourself stupid. Hey, I know, all of depression feels stupid, especially if you look at people who don&amp;#39;t seem to be depressed or who do so much more than you. Maybe they do, but so what? You&amp;#39;re not them. Don&amp;#39;t try to base your own happiness on their example. Instead, just work on trying to live a life you want to live. I know, seeing happiness in others, seeing material things and success feels like the life you want to live, but it&amp;#39;s a little different because it&amp;#39;s still more fantasy than actual introspection or prioritization. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re really struggling, especially if it&amp;#39;s been going on for a while or isn&amp;#39;t tied to a specific event you expect to ease, you should look for help. Talk to a family member or friend you trust some, or at least look into therapy/counseling. Some schools will have ways to help you, but otherwise look to your health insurance provider for help, and if you don&amp;#39;t have health insurance, get it (Medicaid is available still if you can&amp;#39;t afford coverage).

The other part, the part that keeps hurting you, is that it tricks you. Depression *creates an illusion* we keep falling for, where everything looks worse, and where we become convinced we know exactly what's going to happen next, and that it will be bad, based on this egotistical belief we know the future and that dramatic exaggeration that all of the past was horrible. Do we have a lot in our past that makes us unhappy? Sure. Do we wish we'd done things differently? Of course.

Depression wants you to think so. \n\nBut **your education isn't gone**. Life is full of learning, beyond just preparing for one career.  And even someone in their twilight years can start a new career. **Friends lost?** You can make a new friend today, or reconnect with an old one, someone who might just be regretting/missing you. **Motivation?** Figure out what you really, truly want (not what you wish you already had/did, but what you can still do). Motivation comes from striving after what can happen, not hating yourself for what didn't. **Dreams?** Your fantasies for the past are gone, but we're creatures of endless imagination. You need to stop imagining all the ways you've failed and start imagining the things you can still do. Dream new dreams. **Your future, your life, you?** The future's still there, and so is your life. Even if you have a terminal illness, every second left is a second you can try to live better. Whether you're 17 or 70, you can still enjoy today, tomorrow, next Thursday, whatever. \n\nYou can't have everything you ever wanted, but the only thing holding you back from having something is the belief that you can't have anything. Depression encourages that belief. **Fuck depression.** It doesn't know the future. You don't know the future. Depression wants you to hide, to avoid people and places and things, to not see new opportunities and experiences, to not find love and to not overcome sadness. Why would you want to agree with someone who tells you the future is crap? **Depression is a self-fulfilling prophecy**, and unless you want that prophecy to come true, you're the only one who can change things. \n\n**So try.** Try to look forward instead of back. Try to stop hating yourself or pitying yourself for mistakes, or even for suffering. You can't change it. You can apologize, you can heal, you can avoid the things that hurt you. But if you avoid everything, you give all power to your enemy. Stop encouraging the asshole on your shoulder and start listening to the corny dude that says something would be cool. So try not to expect the worst, and keep trying every moment of every day, until it becomes automatic. When you realize you've fallen back, don't hate yourself, just start trying again. Do something you want to do, even if it's stupid and won't change anything, and then feel good that you did it. Live in the moment for now, and don't even worry about the future. The future will be better if you start making now better. Don't know where to start? Get help.\n\nFew of us can dig ourselves out of a pit we dug. Your thinking is what keeps you down, so don't blame yourself when it's hard to think a different way. Get help, from family, friends (old or new), and of course, doctors and therapists.
