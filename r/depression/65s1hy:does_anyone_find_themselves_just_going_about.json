My roommate, who is older than me, got super stressed out and vent to me about it (normally he doesn&amp;#39;t like to vent). But it does get better, he&amp;#39;s an engineer, so he is well off, got a very nice apartment in downtown and enjoying his life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fraternity brother also complain about it too when he got an internship while going to school, but now he&amp;#39;s working for KPMG, which is a pretty big deal for my profession. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for me, my family is not rich, I have to hustle my way through life, though I don&amp;#39;t get as good grades as my roommate and my frat brother. But going to school and working has been my reality since high school, so it doesn&amp;#39;t really phase me that much. Sure I do feel like running away and cry sometimes, but at the end of the day, I have to pick myself up somehow. So what I did was I take my time whenever I could to be by myself in my house and depress a little bit and pick myself up later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last episode was during winter break (no class, no work), I got so low that I gained 10 lbs, my face broke out, I didn&amp;#39;t take care of myself at all. Now I got a decent job, doing semi okay in school, and still go to the gym 5 times a week. I&amp;#39;ve never felt better, I even got some new friends, my mom is so happy to see me at this state that she offer to help me get a new car next year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dgdv7x2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481571.0, "created_utc": 1492452771.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s1hy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdukbq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Erfums", "parent_id": "t3_65s1hy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep, happens frequently.
