Do I want to put a down payment on a car that would look nice for interviews? Do I want to go back to school?  What do I want to do in the long run and how can saving money now help me accomplish those goals?  Make a list of things you want, things you can't achieve, and minor steps you can take one at a time.  You are overwhelming yourself with this, just take a step back and take some time to think stop.  Then think of what is making you stressed?  Your situation right?

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey my first place of my own was a bedroom I rented out from someone&amp;#39;s home for like $300 a month it was a bed, a tv, a work desk, a closet, and a bathroom I shared.  Don&amp;#39;t think about roommates down the road.  If you want to independent you can it just takes a good amount of effort at first after that it becomes easier and easier.  Also your parents may even become more of a support system if you move out, mine was at first.  Happy to see me out of the house and moving on and helped me a little financially on the security deposit.  You&amp;#39;d be surprised how people react when you just start doing your own thing.  Sometimes it attracts people to you, your on your own got your own place you can have whoever you want over do whatever the hell you want and not have to worry about feeling sorry for yourself for living with your parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I would like to say that this trend is actually very common among millennials so don&amp;#39;t be discouraged.  It is a great way to save money and start getting setup financially.  Start saving some money up maybe? See how you feel when you have your first couple grand, do I want to put it into retirement? Do I want to put a down payment on a car that would look nice for interviews? Do I want to go back to school?  What do I want to do in the long run and how can saving money now help me accomplish those goals?  Make a list of things you want, things you can&amp;#39;t achieve, and minor steps you can take one at a time.  You are overwhelming yourself with this, just take a step back and take some time to think stop.  Then think of what is making you stressed?  Your situation right?
