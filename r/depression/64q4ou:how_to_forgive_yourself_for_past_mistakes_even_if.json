But the way I see it, is that the guilt actually is stopping you from growing and becoming better because of those mistakes.\n\nYou cannot hate yourself thin. Hating your own body and bad habits will lead to the depressive thoughts that cause binge eating.  Same for procrastonation.  If you are lazy, you can sit around all day self loathing.  But hating a bad habit, or decision, does not help you fix it. \n\nIn fact, I think the concept that we should all try to be as perfect as possible is incredibly damaging. We are all imperfect, and we all do bad things.  If the only way you can view yourself as a good person is if you never do anything wrong, then you will forever be trapped with guilt and the idea that you're not a good person. \n\nThe first thing someone going to the gym needs to do is accept that they are fat.   The ones who stick through it and build good habits and often the ones who go to the gym because they want to feel healthy,  not because they hate their body image.  In the same way, whenever you are tying to recover from a past mistake, you first need to accept that mistake, and then build positive habits. It is very hard to cut a negative thing from your mind or personality.  You can't just say \"I hate that I have a short temper, so I'm  just not going to get angry anymore.\"   If you have a temper, it's quite possible you will do and say many things that you will deeply regret. \n\nBut no matter how much you hate and regret your actions and yourself, you probably won't change anything by trying to cut the negative parts of yourself away.  Instead you need to focus on positive growth, that can change your behavior, not remove it.\n\n\nI've never met a perfect person before, but it's often the ones who are trying to be perfect who get into the most amount of trouble with guild and self hatred. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with guilt recently too, and have done things recently I would have never thought I would ever do.  But the way I see it, is that the guilt actually is stopping you from growing and becoming better because of those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot hate yourself thin. Hating your own body and bad habits will lead to the depressive thoughts that cause binge eating.  Same for procrastonation.  If you are lazy, you can sit around all day self loathing.  But hating a bad habit, or decision, does not help you fix it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think the concept that we should all try to be as perfect as possible is incredibly damaging. We are all imperfect, and we all do bad things.  If the only way you can view yourself as a good person is if you never do anything wrong, then you will forever be trapped with guilt and the idea that you&amp;#39;re not a good person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing someone going to the gym needs to do is accept that they are fat.   The ones who stick through it and build good habits and often the ones who go to the gym because they want to feel healthy,  not because they hate their body image.  In the same way, whenever you are tying to recover from a past mistake, you first need to accept that mistake, and then build positive habits. It is very hard to cut a negative thing from your mind or personality.  You can&amp;#39;t just say &amp;quot;I hate that I have a short temper, so I&amp;#39;m  just not going to get angry anymore.&amp;quot;   If you have a temper, it&amp;#39;s quite possible you will do and say many things that you will deeply regret. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much you hate and regret your actions and yourself, you probably won&amp;#39;t change anything by trying to cut the negative parts of yourself away.  Instead you need to focus on positive growth, that can change your behavior, not remove it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never met a perfect person before, but it&amp;#39;s often the ones who are trying to be perfect who get into the most amount of trouble with guild and self hatred. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dg4hhen", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956267.0, "created_utc": 1491927467.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4ou", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4heqz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KirbyCassie", "parent_id": "t3_64q4ou", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's a start.
