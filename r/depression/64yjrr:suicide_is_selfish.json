This is what I have learned from mine, and from that my mother's husband ended his.  Others here may have different experiences that lend themselves to different understandings of suicide.\n\nAll in all, I urge you to keep talking and to not do it.  Don't commit suicide.  Find help.

In those cases of assisted suicide, I feel like it&amp;#39;s the kind of thing you can plan out with your family and have the time to say goodbye to everyone so there can be closure and peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With suicide, where someone ends their life because they feel they have no other way out, I feel like there really are very few circumstances where I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider it selfish.  The inalienable fact of life is that no one exists in a bubble or a vacuum - we all have connections to other people whether we like it or not.  Those connections &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; feel the impact of a person&amp;#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to keep this concise, so sorry if I make this too long-winded...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad committed suicide, and I think he was a selfish, weak coward for doing so.  I say this because his act has had an immense negative impact on my life as well as the lives of my brothers and mother.  I say this because I have been in exact same position as him.  I have stared into the abyss, fallen into the abyss, and have wanted to stay there and feel nothing for the rest of time, but I have never NEVER forgotten the hurt and pain he inflicted upon us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time I think about committing suicide and seriously consider doing it, I feel all the images of the people who I cannot deny care about me rushing into my head, and I see them in pain and anguish.  If anything, those images make me feel even more guilty and in more pain in that moment, but they keep me alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this being said, everything is relative.  The idea that suicide is selfish is a tried truth for me, however, I understand that my experiences are my own.  Everyone learns what they will from their own life.  This is what I have learned from mine, and from that my mother&amp;#39;s husband ended his.  Others here may have different experiences that lend themselves to different understandings of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I urge you to keep talking and to not do it.  Don&amp;#39;t commit suicide.  Find help.  I know that reaching out is difficult.  If there is anyone that you can trust, ask them for help.  Ask them to help you find a therapist, and even have them handle the emailing or calling if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dg65mnu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492044924.0, "created_utc": 1492016124.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjrr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6g4g3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ifeelnothing69", "parent_id": "t3_64yjrr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is exactly how I feel, but you kinda have to have gone through some sort of depression or trauma or something in order to understand this cause most normal people seem to disagree, not that I bring the topic up with them or anything.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly how I feel, but you kinda have to have gone through some sort of depression or trauma or something in order to understand this cause most normal people seem to disagree, not that I bring the topic up with them or anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dg6g4g3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055635.0, "created_utc": 1492026835.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjrr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjrr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74pft", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FanimeGamer", "parent_id": "t1_dg70nz8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No. Most parents deny it, claiming youre too young or are being dramatic.
