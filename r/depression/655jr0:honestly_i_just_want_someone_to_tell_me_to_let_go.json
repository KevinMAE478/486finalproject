When words seem to fail to express ourselves, we resort to physical means. This is usually why violence occurs, even if it is self-inflicted. \n\nSo, what is it that you are truly trying to express? Because it sounds like two things. Firstly, it sounds that you want to make an impact on society. You are firstly asking for validation to \"let go\" and to embrace death but then end with how you want to be remembered. So, it shows us that you want to contribute to society or peoples memories in some way. Considering your age, which is less than 30, as you shared, I would assume that you are not sure what your identity or role is in society at this time. \n\nThis is an anomic feeling: no purpose. Anomic suicide is a common and often neglected behaviour that happens a lot. When we're not sure how to contribute or identify in society, it seems that we have no place or role. So, try and play your best card, your life, to make a sort of impact. \n\nBut, this is not your best card. When you're saying that you need someone to tell you that it's ok and to let go, it shows that there is a hesitant part of you. There is a part of you that knows you can make an impact. But, it's scary. It's daunting! Making an impact and finding a role is hard! Yes. \n\nSo, let the right feeling go: social identity. Let that go. You don't need to be something for society. You just need to enjoy life and exist. Depression will seep in and try to infect these feelings at every opportunity, but know that it is like a parasite, ruining what should be a life experience. Having negative thoughts is just as ok as positive. Embrace both and let them go. Then, go dance. Watch a show.
