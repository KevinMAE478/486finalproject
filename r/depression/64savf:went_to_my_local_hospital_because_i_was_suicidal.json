Also, I\u2019m not a native English speaker or writer, but I hope I can convey my thoughts anyway. \n\nFirst and foremost I had this weird idea, but since you have access to a library, is it possible for you to read books? Perhaps just a few pages a day or a couple of times pr. week? Perhaps read some Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Sartre or Camus? Or if that kind of stuff does not suit your taste then perhaps something else, like Lord of the Rings, Moby Dick etc.?  \n(I don't know if the library is free?).  \nIt was just a weird idea I had. Perhaps the world of existential literature or the world of fiction can do something for your view on life or your will to cling to life. Though, it could also worsen your situation. But we (or at least I) can't know that at the moment.  \n\nSecondly, we, as commentators, do not know where you live, how old you are, what your background is, but I don't know if you have any kind of place you could go to either for free counseling or for help to get a job? Where I live we have these places, perhaps you do too in your country?  \n\nThirdly, you have some bank accounts. I don't know if it is possible or relevant, but perhaps someone at the bank could help with a plan to get you unto your feet? It is in their interest to have you back on track since I could imagine if you die, they have lost a lot of money due to your debt (though IANAL or anything related to a bank). Yeah, I know, that connection is hollow and probably not genuine, but it's an opportunity. \n\nFourthly, where I live during their education priests also learn therapy. I've always thought that if I had no place to go, no one to talk to, I would try to contact a priest, just to see if that person would be able to help in any way. \n\nAnd lastly (and I know this probably sound so clich\u00e9 from where you stand) I think you sound like kind of a strong person. Look at your position. You are still alive. You are still fighting, if you were not, you would not have typed out your post. I would even dare assume there is still some hope in you somewhere, at least that's the conclusion I've reached about my own situation: I'm still here, so I must have some kind of hope that it will get better. I might not feel it, I might not be able to see it, but it must be there.  \nAlso, something else, you write that you are not able to continue living the way you do. While that definitely have a high risk negative side, it also opens up for the positive side, that change to the better must happen. A kind of motivation of sorts, even though its origin is dire. Also remember, even though you probably know that, that suicide is not a way to live in another way that you do now, it is an end to life. To many people, at least what I've read, suicide and/or suicidal thoughts are not symptoms of a genuine death wish, but rather a drastic and final solution to a problematic situation. I don't know why I am typing this anymore, I might have lost the point, so I'm just gonna return to what I was going on about before.  \nYou realizing that you can't keep living this way can also be the opening for change that you need. Yeah I know, I'm sounding overly positive here, but at least we can accept the theoretical opportunity, yes?  \n\nIn regards to the health care personal: that was a bummer! There's not much else to say. It happened. It sucks. It hurts. I know the feeling of downplaying suicidal thoughts, but if you can, then at least when dealing with health professionals, try to be honest. Rather than avoiding a stupid and unprofessional person judging you, you might miss a clever and professional person who can help you. Is that not a risk worth taking? I would think it is.  \nAt least it sounds like you have another appointment? If that's true, that's a good thing! And then learn from your past experience and avoid downplaying your situation when you attend that appointment. \n\n\nAlso, as a final thing (yeah I wrote that a while back) try use the internet at the library to see if there are any hotlines (if you can borrow a phone somewhere?), chat services or email services in your country to help people struggling with suicide or to help people struggling in general. And if there is, and you decide to give it a try and call/write, and the people on the other end is just not helpful, please try again at another time until you get another person. And even if no one at that place can help, know that it is an issue with their tools and knowledge, and not with you. \n\n\nI hope you can make it through, that you find some self worth, some motivation, some vitality or what ever you need. It will take time. Maybe a long time.  \nSometimes I live for the beauty of the leaves, the smell of the grass and the longing for walking in the mountains.

Rather than avoiding a stupid and unprofessional person judging you, you might miss a clever and professional person who can help you. Is that not a risk worth taking? I would think it is.&lt;br/&gt;\nAt least it sounds like you have another appointment? If that&amp;#39;s true, that&amp;#39;s a good thing! And then learn from your past experience and avoid downplaying your situation when you attend that appointment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, as a final thing (yeah I wrote that a while back) try use the internet at the library to see if there are any hotlines (if you can borrow a phone somewhere?), chat services or email services in your country to help people struggling with suicide or to help people struggling in general. And if there is, and you decide to give it a try and call/write, and the people on the other end is just not helpful, please try again at another time until you get another person. And even if no one at that place can help, know that it is an issue with their tools and knowledge, and not with you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you can make it through, that you find some self worth, some motivation, some vitality or what ever you need. It will take time. Maybe a long time.&lt;br/&gt;\nSometimes I live for the beauty of the leaves, the smell of the grass and the longing for walking in the mountains. Perhaps you have simply pleasant experiences and dreams too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;br/&gt;\nMyweeawaythrow&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dg55x5d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984650.0, "created_utc": 1491955850.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64savf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64savf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg62uls", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lost4lyf", "parent_id": "t1_dg52pru", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you very much", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dg62uls", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042007.0, "created_utc": 1492013207.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52pru", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ragna12", "parent_id": "t3_64savf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know what to say or suggest but I hope things turn in your favor immediately.
