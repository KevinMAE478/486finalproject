The inherent uselessness of my and everyone else's existence is a source of deep sadness for me. Everyone that I know, that I love, everything that I've ever learned and studied, ever been, ever experienced, will die one day. And the same goes for everyone else. 1.8 billion human beings have died so far. What an absolute waste. My parents have already joined those billions.\n\nAnd even if you have a \"legacy\" and put your mark on our human history, that history will die too, when the sun (a star with an expiration date) implodes in the future and decimates our planet and all other planets in our solar system. That is of course, operating under the assumption that we don't destroy ourselves through sheer greed, or get destroyed by a giant space rock, etc.\n\nAll of the above things have no solution.

It definitely makes me feel less alone, but it&amp;#39;s something that I only want in small amounts. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be surrounded by it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think depression is a very common and natural thing in humanity, and that it&amp;#39;s a reasonable reaction to our increasing knowledge of our existence. In fact, I dislike calling depressed people mentally ill because sometimes I think that not being depressed is the &amp;quot;odd one out&amp;quot;. Happiness seems to be baked from self-deception and self-distraction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could call me an anti-natalist. (&lt;a href=\"/r/antinatalism\"&gt;/r/antinatalism&lt;/a&gt;) I dipped my feet into the subreddit several times and was sort of horrified by the implications (how could anyone advocate for the human race letting itself die out?!), until I realized that it made sense. And I like the idea that we&amp;#39;ve never been contacted by another alien species because they all allowed themselves to die out or ended their existence. It&amp;#39;s a solution to the Fermi Paradox, and makes me feel less alone too, because species more intelligent than us may be ending their own lives due to the same feelings I&amp;#39;m having.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that it is right for people to bring other people into this world. People who cannot be given a choice, who do not know what kind of world they are being born into. I think that if suffering can be prevented by not reproducing, then it&amp;#39;s wrong to reproduce. The inherent uselessness of my and everyone else&amp;#39;s existence is a source of deep sadness for me. Everyone that I know, that I love, everything that I&amp;#39;ve ever learned and studied, ever been, ever experienced, will die one day. And the same goes for everyone else. 1.8 billion human beings have died so far. What an absolute waste. My parents have already joined those billions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even if you have a &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot; and put your mark on our human history, that history will die too, when the sun (a star with an expiration date) implodes in the future and decimates our planet and all other planets in our solar system. That is of course, operating under the assumption that we don&amp;#39;t destroy ourselves through sheer greed, or get destroyed by a giant space rock, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the above things have no solution. And that is where my depression lies. I wish I had never been born, but my survival instinct is too strong at the moment to kill myself. It&amp;#39;s always an option in the future though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dgaou6r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294842.0, "created_utc": 1492266042.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaocdm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "truth_alternative", "parent_id": "t1_dgao7dk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And yet here you are discussing with me :)\n\nI am also getting depressed if i would think about existential issues.
