I had to leave college at the first semester because of it, and I also feel like 2016 happened in a flash, like I was teleported to the future that is, well, now. After all this time of trying treatments and finding out I&amp;#39;m bipolar, I think I&amp;#39;m finally getting better now, and looking forward to go back to college in August. But yeah, it&amp;#39;s funny that I too still think that I&amp;#39;m 18, even though I&amp;#39;ll be 20 later this year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dg8rfoz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173143.0, "created_utc": 1492144343.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6596x3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6596x3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ozww", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nineteenninetysux", "parent_id": "t1_dg8oz3b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "body": "God now I think about it I can't even remember what I did when I was 18.
