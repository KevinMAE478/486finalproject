They're seen as the prize, and it's boys job to win them over.  So women learn make-up and fashion, and boys learn essentially to win them over by being charming and funny and witty.  The initiative is generally on the men, whereas the gatekeeping is generally on the woman.  \n\nFor men this is actually a pretty great deal because men can learn to be charming, witty, and funny no matter how they look.  I've seen some of my weirdest-looking, short guy friends absolutely tear it up in the club.  \n\nThis is also a great deal for super hot women because they just will be pursued naturally.  But it's the medium to lower end women who really suffer here.  It might come across as chauvinistic to rate women on their beauty, but I assure you the world does.  So I think the problem stems from the fact that we don't really teach women who to seduce men EXCEPT by being hot, whereas we teach boys from a young age how to win a girl over no matter how he looks.  \n\nI currently live in Bali.  And the other day we were having a party at our Villa, and these two Australian girls came by.  Both of them were cute, but one of them was so god damn hilarious and charming that, despite there being four or five other girls there, every single dude in the place was sitting at a table just listening to her talk.  It was absolutely mind blowing.  She could've had any dude at the party.  \n\nAfter I thought about it, I realized she'd reversed the dynamic on us.  She had been doing what men do to get women all the time.  She was being charming and witty and funny, and had us hanging on every word, and even though pretty much all of us have been with more beautiful women, any of us would take her over them any day.  \n\nSo, I think maybe if you're having trouble with traditionally feminine styles of dating, maybe look into how we dudes win girls over.  Because after that night, I'm convinced it works both ways.  Women just aren't really taught to do it like men are in Western culture.  \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;#39;ve always found interesting is that we tend to teach girls to be pretty.
