I wouldn't go so far as to say the other woman is responsible for telling the wife she's being cheated on, but it's their responsibility to walk the fuck away.\n\nI had to sit there as a 16 year old girl (ugh) explained to me that what her and my 25 year old husband had was magical and that she thought I should know that he was in love with her. Seemed innocent, right? He preyed on her. He was a \"pedo\". No, he was a piece of crap and she thought it was super cool to be \"awesome enough to break up a marriage\". This doesn't change with age. If a woman is fine with a man cheating on his partner with her, then that shows who she is as a person.\n\nNo one should get a biscuit for being naive, either. I had quite a few of my husband's side conquests boo-hoo to me that they looooved him and that's why they couldn't walk away.
