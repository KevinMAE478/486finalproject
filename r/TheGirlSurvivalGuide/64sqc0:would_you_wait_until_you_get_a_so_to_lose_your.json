In fact, most partners will have even less of an idea about how to please you than you do. You will have to teach them and that is something I wish I had been told before I started being sexually active.

My sex drive went from 0 to a ga-zillion very fast. I read erotic stories, and progressed to online chatrooms. When I was 14 I had a 6 month relationship with an older guy online. It was kinky and my sex drive and confidence loved it. I used a guy at school as a rebound  (my first relationship according to my parents) but discovered that he was no-where near as sexually anything as my previous relationship. He couldn't give me what I wanted and that was sex. Years passed. I stayed online becoming more central in my kink identity. My online \"slutty\" life and my school \"good girl\" life became seperate and defined who I was to a large part. I sent nudes to guys online, wrote erotica,and never had any of the body confidence troubles my friends and classmates had, partly due to the mass of admittedly biased compliments. At school I kept my head down, and blushed at sexual anything lest my online life be caught out. When my friends used placeholder words for various sexual body parts and actions, I genuinely had no idea what they were talking about because I'd always heard (well read) the real terms, and this helped my good girl persona too.

He and I became FWB (Friends With Benefits) and I lost my virginity to him and vice versa. It was sweet, a little awkward, and even though I'd always thought I'd lose it on my wedding night in a four-poster bed, it was kind of magical in it's own way. We went on to have sex regularly until I left high school. In late year 12 I confessed to my friends about the double life, about being kinky, poly, and an exhibitionist which was a great weight off my shoulders.
