I have been slim (age 15, \"ballerina figure\", 105 lbs), overweight (age 20, chubby, 145 lbs, size 12/14), underweight (age 27, quite thin, 105 lbs, size 00), \"model hot\" (age 28, athletic and toned, 110 lbs of muscle, size 0/2), and average (age 31, not toned, 125 lbs, size 4/6).    \n\nFrom age 19-27, I was asked out 0 times. I was flirted with 0 times. I knew guys, I had male friends, but it was like I was invisible to men as a romantic or sexual prospect. There was even a guy friend I had a big crush on, but once he picked up on it he sent me a polite email saying \"I have never found you attractive\" and then disappeared from my life. \"I have never found you attractive\" sums up the male view of me during those years.  \n\nThen I discovered running and nutrition, lost a ton of weight (too much, at one point), and everything changed.  \n\nAt age 27-28, I started rapidly losing weight. I became *underweight*, and guys I'd gone to school with years before started noticing my Facebook pics. Out of the blue, I was asked out twice in three months after being asked out 0 times in 8 years. I continued exercising and started eating more to build muscle, and I ended up with the kind of body a lot of people strive for-- size 0, 32D, incredibly toned legs and butt (thanks, running!), totally flat stomach with a subtle six pack... it was awesome, and I never in my life thought I'd have that body, but there it was, and the guys were still noticing me. A customer I'd been helping at work asked me out for Valentines.  \n\nThen I got complacent, and I also had a round of depression. My weight went up to 115-118. Understand that when you're only 5'3\" and have a small frame, there is a noticeable difference between 105, 110, 115, and 120 lbs. I stopped running, so my abs went away, then my flat stomach, and my butt and thighs lost their tone and got soft. I became invisible to men again from age 28-29, and I'd only gained about 10 lbs. The dates stopped as suddenly as they'd started. Men weren't interested anymore. \n\nAbout halfway through age 29, my depression lifted and the realization that I would soon be 30 set in. I wanted to get my model body back in time for my 30th birthday, just as a symbolic thing. That's how I wanted to kick off that decade. I got back into running, started paying attention to nutrition again, and got back down to about 110 lbs. Again, guys started paying attention to me. A guy jogging down the street actually stopped his run to approach me and ask for my number. A guy I'd grown up with and sort of lost touch with saw me on Facebook and reappeared in my life to ask me out. None of these dates went anywhere-- they were all just the result of my looks, but I need an intellectual connection to really be into a guy, and there just wasn't any chemistry-- but I didn't care! It's so much better to have guys interested in you than to be invisible to them.  \n\nAt age 29, I had sex for the first time, and it was amazing. I can't even believe it. I don't even call it \"losing my virginity\" because, believe me, it wasn't any kind of loss.

I have been slim (age 15, &amp;quot;ballerina figure&amp;quot;, 105 lbs), overweight (age 20, chubby, 145 lbs, size 12/14), underweight (age 27, quite thin, 105 lbs, size 00), &amp;quot;model hot&amp;quot; (age 28, athletic and toned, 110 lbs of muscle, size 0/2), and average (age 31, not toned, 125 lbs, size 4/6).    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From age 19-27, I was asked out 0 times. I was flirted with 0 times. I knew guys, I had male friends, but it was like I was invisible to men as a romantic or sexual prospect. There was even a guy friend I had a big crush on, but once he picked up on it he sent me a polite email saying &amp;quot;I have never found you attractive&amp;quot; and then disappeared from my life. &amp;quot;I have never found you attractive&amp;quot; sums up the male view of me during those years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered running and nutrition, lost a ton of weight (too much, at one point), and everything changed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At age 27-28, I started rapidly losing weight. I became &lt;em&gt;underweight&lt;/em&gt;, and guys I&amp;#39;d gone to school with years before started noticing my Facebook pics. Out of the blue, I was asked out twice in three months after being asked out 0 times in 8 years. I continued exercising and started eating more to build muscle, and I ended up with the kind of body a lot of people strive for-- size 0, 32D, incredibly toned legs and butt (thanks, running!), totally flat stomach with a subtle six pack... it was awesome, and I never in my life thought I&amp;#39;d have that body, but there it was, and the guys were still noticing me. A customer I&amp;#39;d been helping at work asked me out for Valentines.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got complacent, and I also had a round of depression. My weight went up to 115-118. Understand that when you&amp;#39;re only 5&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; and have a small frame, there is a noticeable difference between 105, 110, 115, and 120 lbs. I stopped running, so my abs went away, then my flat stomach, and my butt and thighs lost their tone and got soft. I became invisible to men again from age 28-29, and I&amp;#39;d only gained about 10 lbs. The dates stopped as suddenly as they&amp;#39;d started. Men weren&amp;#39;t interested anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About halfway through age 29, my depression lifted and the realization that I would soon be 30 set in. I wanted to get my model body back in time for my 30th birthday, just as a symbolic thing. That&amp;#39;s how I wanted to kick off that decade. I got back into running, started paying attention to nutrition again, and got back down to about 110 lbs. Again, guys started paying attention to me. A guy jogging down the street actually stopped his run to approach me and ask for my number. A guy I&amp;#39;d grown up with and sort of lost touch with saw me on Facebook and reappeared in my life to ask me out. None of these dates went anywhere-- they were all just the result of my looks, but I need an intellectual connection to really be into a guy, and there just wasn&amp;#39;t any chemistry-- but I didn&amp;#39;t care! It&amp;#39;s so much better to have guys interested in you than to be invisible to them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At age 29, I had sex for the first time, and it was amazing. I can&amp;#39;t even believe it. I don&amp;#39;t even call it &amp;quot;losing my virginity&amp;quot; because, believe me, it wasn&amp;#39;t any kind of loss. I gained experience, confidence, validation of myself as a grown woman, real knowledge of sex... it&amp;#39;s not an exaggeration to say it was life-changing, and it never would have happened if I hadn&amp;#39;t lost that weight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, depression caught up with me again, and I gained weight again. It peaked at 130, but I&amp;#39;m on an antidepressant now, have started running again, started cooking healthy meals again, and now weigh around 118.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the crazy thing I&amp;#39;ve noticed: men are attracted to me when I am 112 lbs or less.

I wasn&amp;#39;t back to college tiny, but I was adorable. I had spent a couple years being the only girl out not getting it on, when I was used to turning away drinks. I went back to being flirted with constantly. I&amp;#39;ve gained a lot back in the last few months due to me being shitty with my health, and I&amp;#39;m kind of back to a place of being overlooked by men. Professionally and socially I&amp;#39;m just another girl now, rather than a hot brilliant woman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A huge part of it is my confidence. I&amp;#39;m very unhappy in my body and it shows. I don&amp;#39;t dress it well. I am great at dressing my size 4 self. Not so good with my size 6/8 (at one point sneaking up on 10) self. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "name": "t1_dg5i3r6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492002303.0, "created_utc": 1491973503.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vfzu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ry4i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5irzm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TalieTerror", "parent_id": "t3_64ry4i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "controversiality": 0, "body": "From 300 lbs to 155lbs.
