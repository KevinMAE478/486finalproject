I got my second one last July and I&amp;#39;m considering getting it replaced. No idea about all the medical science-y stuff behind it but maybe whatever in it &amp;quot;goes bad&amp;quot; after a while? My body seemed to react to the hormones much better (aka no discharge, hardly ever periods) when it was newer...that could also be some kind of conspiracy I&amp;#39;ve made up in my mind, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "name": "t1_dgdn0mi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472419.0, "created_utc": 1492443619.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgda062", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cowtown456", "parent_id": "t3_65tw7o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've had Nexplanon for almost two years now.
