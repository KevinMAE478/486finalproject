It&amp;#39;s absolutely true for most women, but there is a very small minority of women with hymens that are prominent and/or rigid enough to actually tear painfully even with foreplay, or that need to be torn or cut for sex to happen at all. And if there&amp;#39;s enough hymen there and it&amp;#39;s rigid enough, it can absolutely need to more tearing than a childhood accident would cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OP should absolutely try all the tips she can regarding foreplay and lubrication and see if they help, but if they don&amp;#39;t she should see a doctor. In her case the hymen is extremely unlikely to be the source of the problem, but it&amp;#39;s not impossible and only a gynecologist at this point could completely rule it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "name": "t1_dg7pnr3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126371.0, "created_utc": 1492097571.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7avq5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GreenWithLove", "parent_id": "t3_652qja", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just to let you know, you have some misconceptions about hymens.

I know you said you'd done plenty of foreplay, but especially if you are anxious over your first time, there is no \"too much.\" \n\nIt's good advice to make foreplay the whole point and then if/when you get to the point where you are basically begging for sex and no longer anxious, then go ahead. Other people have recommended lube and that helps, but being anxious is can make sex painful even with plenty of lubrication.\n\nAnd one last more physical piece of advice. Instead of having him just push steadily, have him try very gently rocking his hips once he encounters resistance.

I know you said you&amp;#39;d done plenty of foreplay, but especially if you are anxious over your first time, there is no &amp;quot;too much.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good advice to make foreplay the whole point and then if/when you get to the point where you are basically begging for sex and no longer anxious, then go ahead.
