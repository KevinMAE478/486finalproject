You let your feet soak in the provided bootie, and about a week later all your foot skin peels off. It's a little gross but it really helps get rid of the thick skin that accumulates. It would definitely give you a fresh start so you can maintain your new soft feet!\n\nAnother thing you could try is Amope's Pedi Perfect which is an electronic foot file. You can gently file down calluses and rough skin with that. If you have really thick foot skin I like to use metal foot files. They make big flat ones that you can buy on Amazon for less than $10 or you could try the Ped Egg. The one advantage to the Ped Egg is that it traps your foot shavings inside itself, but I shave the skin off over the toilet so this is a non issue for me. \n\nFoot salves and creams are fine as supplement products, but I have to use them in combination with the other products I've mentioned. I usually will periodically slather a LOT on, put socks over it, and make myself rest on the couch for a bit to let it soak in.

You let your feet soak in the provided bootie, and about a week later all your foot skin peels off. It&amp;#39;s a little gross but it really helps get rid of the thick skin that accumulates. It would definitely give you a fresh start so you can maintain your new soft feet!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing you could try is Amope&amp;#39;s Pedi Perfect which is an electronic foot file. You can gently file down calluses and rough skin with that. If you have really thick foot skin I like to use metal foot files. They make big flat ones that you can buy on Amazon for less than $10 or you could try the Ped Egg.
