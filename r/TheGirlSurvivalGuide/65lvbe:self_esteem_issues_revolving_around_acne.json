I used to break out like this when I was 13-15, then I went on birth control at 16 and it cleared up my skin in around 4 months. I got off of hormonal birth control and am now protected with a copper IUD. I went off BC about 6 months ago, then on a round of hormonal birth control about 3 months ago, and had to take Plan B. So between all the fluctuations in birth control methods and hormones, my skin has gone back to how it was when I was entering puberty. Also, I&amp;#39;m the only one in my family to have acne problems. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have spent about $400 on skincare products and makeup in the past couple months to cover and treat the acne. I am planning on spending more today because I broke out more this week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my routine: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shower in the morning and use Kate Somerville Eradikate sulfer acne cleanser, and Tarte Rainforest of the Sea gentle cleanser. I use a Clarisonic brush to exfoliate 3x per week. I tone with witch hazel, and then I use Lush Celestial moisturizer. I wear makeup, and remove it at night with Neutrogena face wipes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eat pretty healthy, I eat a lot of salad and greens, as I&amp;#39;m gluten intolerant, but sometimes I crave sugar and eat chocolate. I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of milk products, soda or juice either. I drink a good amount of water (4 or more large glasses per day) but I suppose I could drink more. I don&amp;#39;t change my sheets as often as I should, so that could be a big factor. I also have been using a towel for 2-3 days before switching to a new one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My skin has clogged, raised pores all over my forehead, chin and I get cystic acne on my cheeks and jawline. I have blackheads on my nose, but those don&amp;#39;t bother me as much. When I squeeze the clogged pores, the sebum comes out fairly easily and either has a white tone and soft texture, or a white tone and is harder, like a blackhead but it doesn&amp;#39;t have the oxidized head. The cystic acne becomes inflamed and I can&amp;#39;t squeeze anything out. I generally do not squeeze or pick much on my face, but my body is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My back and chest are super textured with clogged pores and have the most active zits. They have white heads and are oozy after I pop them. I have scars on my back and chest, and I always mindlessly start picking at scabs and zits or bumps on my back. I&amp;#39;m not excited to get naked in front of my boyfriend, and tend to keep my shirt on during sex. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m going to get a body scrubber and body wash with salicylic acid in it, and a moisturizer. I have noticed my body feels dry and itchy after a shower, so perhaps washing with medicated body wash and moisturizing will help. I also used Acnefree (benzoyl peroxide) for years and it always helped me, so I&amp;#39;m thinking of quitting the sulfer face wash and using that instead with salicylic spot treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice?
