I know I hate it when someone does that to me, so the thought of doing it to him makes me feel like a terrible person. I really try not make it seem as if my attraction to him is dependent on sex, even though sex is important to me. \n\n&gt;I'm getting the impression that he is feeling a lot of pressure from sexual expectations, and this could add to it.\n\nMy stomach feels like a pit when I think about it, because I don't know how not to put that on him. I do compliment him on his appearance, because I do find him really, really attractive, and I know it makes him happy that his efforts are noticed, but I also consciously try to let him know I also admire his intelligence, his sense of humor, and his creativity as well, and that those, too, make up a significant chunk of why I find him attractive. I've told him more than a few times that I understand that he can't manufacture desire, and I think his concerns are valid and I don't want pretend that age and health aren't possible factors. I know they are/can be. But I can't pretend that it doesn't make me feel a certain way in turn.\n\n&gt; I talk about wanting to fuck him and complimenting him on the daily\n&gt;&gt;This is a wonderful compliment to be giving him! That said, right now it may be adding more stress since he is already self-conscious about \"aging\" and underperforming. Every time you mention sex, he probably starts that cycle in his head. The pressure to \"break this dry spell\" sounds like it may be doing a lot of damage to both of your psyches.\n\nGaaaah. This feels like a minefield that I can't avoid setting off. We both talk about sex, a lot, as a general subject. I've only just started to notice the whole thing with him talking about wanting to fuck other people and never directing that sort of thing towards me. The couple of times he's initiated this year were middle-of-the-night \"Hey, you awake\" sort of things. Its appreciated, but not much better than the whole \"Yeah I'll fuck you if you want\".

And I sort of do? I would actually feel better if he straight up said he needed a break and would like to take sex off the table for a while. Then I would actually know where I stand, he wouldn't have to keep fronting like nothing has changed, and I can quit getting my hopes up all the time.

For instance, I'm initiating less often, and focusing on **giving him as many nonsexual touches and signs of affection as possible.**\n\nBut I/we already do this! We're both very affectionate people, so there's non-sexual touch and affection all the time! I've simply stopped initiating for the most part now. I don't even want to try because I want to avoid putting pressure on him and avoid disappointment when he says no. It feels like a catch-22 here. Either I try, and get turned down, or I don't, and end up feeling resentful. That this is happening so soon in the relationship feels like a bad omen.

I never know how much information is necessary, so I thank you for taking the time to respond and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far trying not to put expectations and pressure on him, that has been a significant part of my frustration, because that is exactly what I want to avoid doing, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to avoid doing it.

Even if you have been asking for him to dominate, you probably need to prompt him in the moment, and remind him that you guys are trying something new. Maybe even pulling him into another room when you initiate could be enough to break the pattern and encourage creativity. If he says he's always down for sex, take him at his word and try initiating (but of course also have that talk telling him you want effort from him, as well). Has he been turning you down when you try to initiate?\n\nAlso, he may not realize that you want to be complimented the way he compliments other women. It all goes back to the novelty issue. This could be happening in his brain: \"OP is beautiful but I've told her that tons of times over the X years we've been together, so she knows I find her gorgeous/sexy/wonderful.\" Or it could be an issue of seeing you so often he's taking you for granted. Either way, he probably doesn't know you're craving that validation right now. Even though it can be super hard to ask for those things, I think you may need to try. (The lack of sex + fewer compliments can do a number on your self-esteem, I 3000% empathize.)\n\nMy BF and I have been having similar issues, and it's been very hard on my self-worth.

When were in a relationship with someone, the novelty starts to wear off after a while. Usually sex decreases in frequency a bit, but there are natural ups and downs. It&amp;#39;s easy to get into a comfortable routine where everything becomes almost &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot;. Because of that, it can be really hard to put new ideas into action when we want to spice things up. We can literally forget about it all in that familiar moment and just follow the established pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To change that, it&amp;#39;ll take effort on both your parts.
