I was playing with my clan. We were raiding, and then switching to other games throughout the week. At this time last year we were switching between Destiny and GTA. On guy paid someone to hack the game and get him a yacht. It was kinda funny. Guy doesn\u2019t play any game he can\u2019t cheat. This time last year I was regaining relations with my brother who had done something unforgivable. This time last year, I was sitting in a room with my wife and sister, playing Until Dawn until 6am while my two kids slept on the other side of the house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, the unforgivable thing my brother did was to my sister. Because of the she struggled with severe depression and anxiety this time last year. In a last ditch to maintain sanity and not go back into a healthcare facility she bought a PS4 and a bunch of friends bought her games, of which were Destiny and Until Dawn. So I helped her with Destiny. I still remember trying to show off my mad Legend status on the Queen\u2019s Ransom mission and just ended up dying over and over again. I think she actually carried me through it even though at this time I had over 50 raid completions. I remember helping her through the jumping section after you take the lift. I remember capturing Skolas and making sure she knew to look for the ship when it appeared. I remember traversing the Black Garden and cleansing it with her. I remember all of that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then on Saturday May 7, 2016 at 2:24 PM I was sitting there watching Parenthood (the episode that ends in a motorcycle wreck) with my wife, 2 \u00bd year old son, and 3 month old son. My phone rings, I see it\u2019s my grandparents and I don\u2019t pick up. Meh, I\u2019ll call them back when the show is over. Then my wife\u2019s phone rings\u2026 Okay, something is wrong. I answer\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDid you have any plans for the day?\u201d \n\u201cGrandma, I can already tell. Just tell me what it is. Any plans I may have had don\u2019t matter\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She proceeds to tell me that there has been an accident and all we know is that there has been an accident and my parents are in the hospital. No information on their conditions. The only other bit of information we have is they were on their motorcycle. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister? She has one too. They never go out without her\u201d Her - \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m calling her next.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I throw on clothes. I haven\u2019t had a shower since friday morning. I run out the house barely able to give my wife any information. I speed going 70 in 35. Calling my sister over and over and over. I called at least 20 time. Left 5 voicemails. Sent texts. \u201cShe\u2019s at work.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s busy\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s playing a game\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get to the hospital. I\u2019m looking all over, finally a nurse finds out my grandparents are in a consultation room. I walk in and there are both my grandparents, a chaplain, and a sheriff. I ask if they found my sister. I ask if she called back as I had just finished hanging up from another attempt. She has me sit next to her and takes off my glasses. She gives me a hug, the grandmotherly kind that you don\u2019t know where the strength comes from but you can\u2019t pull away, even if you were the Hulk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey found another motorcycle in the ditch. There was a female; around 20. She didn\u2019t make it. Your sister is gone\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My whole world came crashing around me. My sister was gone. My two parents are in a bed somewhere in the building and we don\u2019t know their condition. We don\u2019t even know 100% that it was my sister, as no one was on site to confirm anything. I didn\u2019t have any option. I couldn\u2019t greve. I had two parents to care for. I planned my sister&amp;#39;s funeral and it was held that Thursday. My brother came into town, but acted the same, and didn\u2019t care about what he\u2019d done. He left after the funeral and I haven\u2019t talked to him since. In 4 days I went from 2 siblings, to an only child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of my parents were out over work for over 3 months. I had to take a month off without pay and have them move in with me just to take care of them. Through all this I never had time to care for me. I\u2019ve since begun to wonder if I struggle with depression and anxiety. I\u2019m about 80% certain of it. It\u2019s affecting my job, my work, my wife, and kids. It\u2019s affecting everything. I needed something. Something to help me cope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I latched onto Destiny back in August. Something about it helps so much. But i\u2019ve come to find out, it\u2019s not the game. It\u2019s the community this game has made. It\u2019s you guys. It\u2019s everyone we run into. We aren\u2019t against each other here. We want to help each other. But I\u2019ve come a long way. I decided I would make improving in the crucible my goal. I\u2019ve gone from 0 flawless cards, to 16. I\u2019ve ended up running a community of 500 and counting. I\u2019ve joined a new clan. I\u2019ve thrived in this community. I\u2019ve thrived in Destiny. I\u2019m forging my Legend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... I still think about how my sister never got to finish Until Dawn. About how we never did a raid together. About how\u2026 About how my sister was never able to become Legend and join me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I strive to be that for her. I will become everything she would have wanted me to be. Here\u2019s to my sister&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Legend that will never be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time last year I was playing games with my sister. This time last year I had two siblings. Now, I struggle to continue and figure out how to deal with being an only child. But destiny has helped me, and I\u2019m glad to have this community. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 6:30AM: so I posted this at 2:00am and more or less when to bed. Thank you all so much for everything you&amp;#39;ve had to say. I&amp;#39;ve read every post and you are all amazing, just like I said above. I&amp;#39;m going to return your favor and respond to every one of you, but I also have to work and so it&amp;#39;ll be throughout that day... again, thank you all for being exactly who I knew you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m writing this\u2026 I think it\u2019s a Thank You letter. \n\nLast year I was having a blast.

Sometimes being a mod means doing things people don't like (actually, most of the time that's what it means). \n\nIt's never personal for us, it's never targeted or done out of spite- the decisions we make on both the individual and team levels are made with the best intentions for this community. We understand that some actions may appear heartless or cold to you at times, however please understand that this is always a balancing act between what we want and what we think is best for the sub.\n\n---\n\nHere are a few sources for the origin and maintenance of Rule 2 as it relates to personal stories:\n\n* [Whats with all the depressing posts about people personal lives?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2uaef7/whats_with_all_the_depressing_posts_about_people/) - subscriber submission with thorough discussion in comments.\n\n* [Original announcement of the rule by Cozmo](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2uvi52/announcement_we_are_updating_the_rules_to_reflect/) - more good discussion in comments; this is from two years ago.\n\n* [State of the Subreddit from November 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3t70zr/its_that_time_again_state_of_the_subreddit_for/) - we asked how people felt about this and solicited feedback on whether the rule should change; again, more discussion in those comments.\n\n---\n\n**We will be revisiting this again in the next State of the Subreddit, tentatively scheduled for within the next month.** \n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, we are always here.

We understand that some actions may appear heartless or cold to you at times, however please understand that this is always a balancing act between what we want and what we think is best for the sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few sources for the origin and maintenance of Rule 2 as it relates to personal stories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2uaef7/whats_with_all_the_depressing_posts_about_people/\"&gt;Whats with all the depressing posts about people personal lives?&lt;/a&gt; - subscriber submission with thorough discussion in comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2uvi52/announcement_we_are_updating_the_rules_to_reflect/\"&gt;Original announcement of the rule by Cozmo&lt;/a&gt; - more good discussion in comments; this is from two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3t70zr/its_that_time_again_state_of_the_subreddit_for/\"&gt;State of the Subreddit from November 2016&lt;/a&gt; - we asked how people felt about this and solicited feedback on whether the rule should change; again, more discussion in those comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will be revisiting this again in the next State of the Subreddit, tentatively scheduled for within the next month.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or feedback, we are always here. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDestinyTheGame\"&gt;You can also send us a modmail any time.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/DestinyTheGame\"&gt;/r/DestinyTheGame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg69y7m", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": true, "created": 1492049292.0, "created_utc": 1492020492.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wlmg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wlmg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6e86x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "superlulz404", "parent_id": "t1_dg5lzi0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "ugh, feels. ;'[", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ugh, feels. ;&amp;#39;[&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg6e86x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492053698.0, "created_utc": 1492024898.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5lzi0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 623, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fantino93", "parent_id": "t3_64wlmg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eyes up Guardian.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyes up Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg5lzi0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492011397.0, "created_utc": 1491982597.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 623}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wlmg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wlmg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wlmg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wlmg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5vegq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheAxeManrw", "parent_id": "t1_dg5spdz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This 100%.
