Imagine if Gjallarhorn in Y1 had only been available from Xur everytime you think about having Xur exclusive exotics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Destiny 2 should have a bunch of quest exotics that don&amp;#39;t involve steps like &amp;quot;wait for armsday&amp;quot;, no 3oC, and more places to get exotics outside of raids and nightfalls. An increased chance at them from nightfalls and a small chance to get an exotic from the postgame rewards on both strikes and crucible matches would be good. If there is something like PoE that should also have a chance at exotics and if there is something like Trials a slightly higher chance for match wins (to prevent people farming losses all weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg9913q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492211483.0, "created_utc": 1492182683.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg978k5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "usafsatwide", "parent_id": "t3_65crya", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bungie is the problem with Xur...there should be a pool of exotics that he can ONLY sell.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bungie is the problem with Xur...there should be a pool of exotics that he can ONLY sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg978k5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209212.0, "created_utc": 1492180412.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65crya", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9xwfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sabishiikouen", "parent_id": "t3_65crya", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a feeling we won't see Xur in Destiny 2\u2026", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling we won&amp;#39;t see Xur in Destiny 2\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg9xwfe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241661.0, "created_utc": 1492212861.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65crya", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65crya", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9he18", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fireheart318s_Reddit", "parent_id": "t1_dg9guu6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not in a while.
