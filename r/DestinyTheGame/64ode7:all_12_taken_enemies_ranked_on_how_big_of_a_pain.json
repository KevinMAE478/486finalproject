[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a random-ass DTG Redditor. Beacon of MLG-ness. Purveyor of shitposts. Bringer of salt. Occasional outright troll.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have been Taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove your hands from the keyboard. Rest your cramped, weary, cheeto-stained fingers. No longer must you answer to others for how wrong they are. Instead, you need only look upon yourself, upon the lulz you have created at the expense of rational conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is it that motivates you to waste countless hours, merely responding to text on a screen? What sort of self-satisfaction is there that is derived from the thoughts of others?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to react. As time slowly consumes all, comments are lost, buried beneath the squall of others, clawing their way to upvotes and top-rated responses. You must be able to stand out. You must create.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a knife for you. It is shaped like [pain in the ass].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take up the knife. Find out whether Phalanxes, Captains, or Psions will top this list. Take your new shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) Taken Thrall: Look, every single Taken enemy is a pain in the ass. But the Thrall are easily the most forgivable, if only because teleporting enemies are pretty much par for the course in this game. They\u2019re still weak, they move slowly when not teleporting, and they don\u2019t swarm you nearly as much as normal Thrall do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: They moved faster or something, idk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) Taken Wizards: You think that Infinite Thrall would be a much larger pain in the ass. But somehow, I\u2019ve never found them to be that bad (and this highly objective list is based solely on my extensive expert observations). The Shadow Thrall are somehow weaker than normal Thrall. With Strike Scoring, Taken Wizards can actually be beneficial, since you get points out of killing the Shadow Thrall, plus you can proc kill perks off them. (Gunslinger\u2019s Trance, Force Barrier, Inverse Shadow, etc.). So really, they\u2019re just void-shielded Wizards with a Solar attack. Not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: Lightswitch still existed (this has the potential to put Taken Wizards in first, even though everything would be made worse with Lightswitch)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) Taken Knights: I ranked &lt;strong&gt;SYLOK&lt;/strong&gt; pretty highly on my PoE list, but vanilla Taken Knights don\u2019t stack up as well. In addition to being relatively rare, the AoE on their flaming barf is pretty small. I think I\u2019ve died to their guns more than their ability, which doesn\u2019t make them any worse than normal Knights, just a bit twitchier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: Well, I think &lt;strong&gt;SYLOK&lt;/strong&gt; answers that question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) Taken Acolytes: I feel like these are the most common Taken enemy. Anyways, they\u2019re pretty weak, and they don\u2019t have the most disruptive ability (Acolyte\u2019s Eye actually procs precision perks, so you can kill them with Firefly off of it). But the few times their eye is a problem, it&amp;#39;s a pretty annoying one. I\u2019ve died to them in the final stages of King\u2019s Fall more often than I\u2019d like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: Taken Adepts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) Taken Hobgoblins: The OG Splicers. Every time you shoot them, they send a nice little trio of \u201cf*ck you\u201d valentines your way. Yet despite proccing every time on all hits, rather than random critical kills, I find them less infuriating than Splicers. Maybe it&amp;#39;s the consistency so you can prepare for it. Maybe it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s one enemy from a 12-member race. Maybe it&amp;#39;s that they\u2019re easy to dodge. Maybe it&amp;#39;s that they don\u2019t slowly, mockingly drift forward while circling around your reticle as you try to shoot them down. I dunno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: Well, I think the Splicers answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Taken Goblins: Honestly, I kinda want to put these guys in last, solely because I feel like they\u2019re the only Taken enemy that isn\u2019t totally busted (or simultaneously boring). Besides Servitors providing miniscule health regen to Fallen, and Taken Vandals with their discount Ward of Dawn, they\u2019re one of few enemies that exists in a support role. But few things are more annoying than a boss or a Consumed Centurion suddenly becoming invincible because of a Taken Goblin hiding behind a rock, so they\u2019ll safely cap off the bottom half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: &lt;a href=\"http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Flyinpenguin117/screenshot/5728270\"&gt;This sh*t&lt;/a&gt; happened more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Taken Minotaurs: In most games, invisibility comes at a trade off. Smaller health pool, weaker or more situational attacks, so on and so forth. But this is Destiny, and nothing is allowed to make sense. Taken Minotaurs are sneaky, tanky, can spawn with Arc shields, have a high-damage explosive spam attack, they teleport, and are often backed up by Taken Goblins levelling on Invincibility shields. And they enjoy attacking in groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: No crit spots, like normal Minotaurs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Taken Centurion: Also harkening my PoE PITA ranking, Noru\u2019usk came in last for just being an upscaled Taken Centurion. But Taken Centurions are pretty notably frustrating. The infinite-tracking-around-corners-axion-dart-spam is probably the least of their problems. Throw in bullet sponge health, shields, teleporting, and a somehow hard to hit crit spot that doesn\u2019t give that satisfying helmet pop like normal Centurions, and Taken Centurions easily hold the number 5 spot. Especially that one. You know the one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worth noting that the top 4 all appear alongside Malooooook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Taken Vandal: You know how when everyone complains about something being OP and overused, and people who overuse that OP thing tell people complaining about it to just use it themselves? Well, the AI actually did that with Ward of Dawn, which they always pop &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; as you\u2019re pulling the trigger of your perfectly aligned sniper shot. Tack on a sniper rifle of their own to ruin all your fun Solar Burn strikes and Taken Psions always swarming to the shield to multiply when it&amp;#39;s up, and Taken Vandals are a serious pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: Oryx also took Helm of Saint-14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Taken Psion: Alongside &lt;a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHDPr07hyzs/maxresdefault.jpg\"&gt;tag team bosses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Escort_Mission_Unmark_9561.PNG\"&gt;escort missions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/photoshop/8/9/9/123899_v1.jpg\"&gt;annoying guide characters&lt;/a&gt;, multiplying enemies are a terrible gaming trope that refuses to die. You know what else refuses to die? That one Taken Psion who somehow always gets away and reproduces into it&amp;#39;s own small army (\u201cI am just a dumb Taken Psion. But we are good at multiplying.\u201d) With how common Arc Burn is, multiplied by how many missions feature Taken Psions, they can be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; infuriating. And don\u2019t even get me started on the Black Spindle mission. &lt;em&gt;shudders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: They were as tanky as Y1 Nightfall Psion Operants. Could be better if: We could &lt;a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-most-elaborate-dick-moves-in-online-gaming-history_p3/\"&gt;contain them in a room, infinitely multiply them, then crash the Destiny servers with Psion Overload until Bungie nerfs them&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Taken Phalanx: Just like Memory of *Jolder, Bungie turned a glitch into a feature (and don\u2019t give me that \u201ctwo sprint charges\u201d BS). We all raged, then laughed, then raged some more every time a Phalanx would launch us into orbit (hm, I wonder if I could enlist some Phalanxes in Kerbal Space Program). And then Bungie made it a real thing. They\u2019re intentionally waiting in all of the absolute worst possible places to Fus Ro Dah you off a cliff, or just into a wall for an Architects death. Being launched back 30 feet isn\u2019t bad enough, no, they &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have to spawn when there\u2019s a place to fall to your death. Plus they still have regular Phalanx\u2019s Falcon Punch melee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: They bombed an orphanage for bunnies&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Taken Captain: &lt;a href=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/002/085/Kornheiser_Why.jpg\"&gt;why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worse if: Light Eater Captains&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, the Reddit Gold I got from my PITA ranking of Strike Bosses expired, so I figured it was about time I put out a new one.
