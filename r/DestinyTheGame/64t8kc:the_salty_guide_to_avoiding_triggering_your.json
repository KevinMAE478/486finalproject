You know very quickly if people are capable of communicating clearly, following directions, and clearing adds. If any one of those three are lacking, you need to find the cause and either fix it or eliminate it. Sometimes it's the *entire group* that's the problem, in which case it's better to find out early and only lose an hour than to struggle and be stuck at Golgoroth for 4+ hours. \n\nI hate being *that guy*, but I've also had to single people out for not pulling their weight, or causing the team to wipe over and over again. There are a few specific instances that immediately come to mind. \n\nOne game, we had a person that for some reason would always forget to run up to Mid, and just stay back killing adds on the Totem until it was a wipe. After politely and repeatedly trying to explain the mechanics, and what to watch for in the kill feed, the player left without saying a word. I don't know if he left because he was singled out, or if he realized he just wasn't ready for the big leagues yet, but once we got a replacement it was smooth sailing from then on.\n\nAnother time at Golgoroth, we had a player get disconnected (Thanks for the Baboon, Bungie...), and before he could rejoin the group a friend of someone on the team just jumped in to take his place. The new guy was under leveled and under equipped, and was barely doing any damage to Golgoroth during the DPS phase. I tried pointing this out, and suggesting that we get the original player back in, but the new guy couldn't take a hint and the fire team leader didn't have the resolve to just boot the new guy from the team. I ended up calling them out on it and leaving, because it wasn't fair to the guy who got disconnected and there was no way we were going to get past the encounter with the new guy not pulling his own weight. It's not easy being the bad guy, but sometimes it just has to be done, or something has to be said. \n\nMy worst and most frustrating King's Fall encounter happened at Daughters. It was pretty obvious that one of the team members just didn't understand what was going on, despite me trying to clarify and explain it again after every wipe. At one point we managed to kill the first daughter, and as I'm directing everyone to their platforms I keep asking who's torn between dimensions with no response. I look around and find the player in question standing on the middle ledge (his original assignment), clearly torn, but just standing there as the clock ticked down. One would think he would have noticed the ghostly shimmer, the black and white vision, and the fact that he couldn't actually *shoot* anything, but he was completely oblivious. The final straw for me was when, after explaining the mechanics in detail *again*, the next time he was torn between dimensions his first question was \"Where am I supposed to go again?\"... \n\nI don't think I've ever been so quick to hit the \"Return to Orbit\" button, because at that point it was a lost cause. I just wished them luck and left without saying another word.\n\nThis is why I love Totems, and am very hesitant to join a group at a later checkpoint. I'd rather get a feel for the group dynamic early on, during an easy encounter, than to struggle and suffer later on.

You know very quickly if people are capable of communicating clearly, following directions, and clearing adds. If any one of those three are lacking, you need to find the cause and either fix it or eliminate it. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s the &lt;em&gt;entire group&lt;/em&gt; that&amp;#39;s the problem, in which case it&amp;#39;s better to find out early and only lose an hour than to struggle and be stuck at Golgoroth for 4+ hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate being &lt;em&gt;that guy&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;#39;ve also had to single people out for not pulling their weight, or causing the team to wipe over and over again. There are a few specific instances that immediately come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One game, we had a person that for some reason would always forget to run up to Mid, and just stay back killing adds on the Totem until it was a wipe. After politely and repeatedly trying to explain the mechanics, and what to watch for in the kill feed, the player left without saying a word. I don&amp;#39;t know if he left because he was singled out, or if he realized he just wasn&amp;#39;t ready for the big leagues yet, but once we got a replacement it was smooth sailing from then on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another time at Golgoroth, we had a player get disconnected (Thanks for the Baboon, Bungie...), and before he could rejoin the group a friend of someone on the team just jumped in to take his place. The new guy was under leveled and under equipped, and was barely doing any damage to Golgoroth during the DPS phase. I tried pointing this out, and suggesting that we get the original player back in, but the new guy couldn&amp;#39;t take a hint and the fire team leader didn&amp;#39;t have the resolve to just boot the new guy from the team. I ended up calling them out on it and leaving, because it wasn&amp;#39;t fair to the guy who got disconnected and there was no way we were going to get past the encounter with the new guy not pulling his own weight. It&amp;#39;s not easy being the bad guy, but sometimes it just has to be done, or something has to be said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My worst and most frustrating King&amp;#39;s Fall encounter happened at Daughters. It was pretty obvious that one of the team members just didn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on, despite me trying to clarify and explain it again after every wipe. At one point we managed to kill the first daughter, and as I&amp;#39;m directing everyone to their platforms I keep asking who&amp;#39;s torn between dimensions with no response. I look around and find the player in question standing on the middle ledge (his original assignment), clearly torn, but just standing there as the clock ticked down. One would think he would have noticed the ghostly shimmer, the black and white vision, and the fact that he couldn&amp;#39;t actually &lt;em&gt;shoot&lt;/em&gt; anything, but he was completely oblivious. The final straw for me was when, after explaining the mechanics in detail &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, the next time he was torn between dimensions his first question was &amp;quot;Where am I supposed to go again?&amp;quot;... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever been so quick to hit the &amp;quot;Return to Orbit&amp;quot; button, because at that point it was a lost cause. I just wished them luck and left without saying another word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I love Totems, and am very hesitant to join a group at a later checkpoint. I&amp;#39;d rather get a feel for the group dynamic early on, during an easy encounter, than to struggle and suffer later on. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg5zlsl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492038452.0, "created_utc": 1492009652.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wd4n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FunctionalOven", "parent_id": "t1_dg53z6l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "See, I *love* totems because it's mechanically demanding but easy for a solid group.
