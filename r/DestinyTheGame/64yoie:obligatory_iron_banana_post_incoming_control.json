I also do a lot of anchoring, even at enemy points sometimes.  If I'm alone, trying to capture the point will likely lead to a 3v1 and my death.  If I guard it, killing them as they trickle in, hopefully one of my randoms will stumble his way onto the point and then I will help him capture it.  After 10-15 seconds of no enemies showing up, I usually end up trying to at least neutralize it by myself though.  \n\n&gt; People somehow haven't realized in over 3 years that control is a game of defense, not offense.\n\nExactly.  I played a ton of Control in y1 particularly.  I am top 2% in Defensive kills.  Of course, this doesn't control for time played, but I am top 7% in overall kills, so I'm defending more than most.  \n\nI also play solo a decent amount.  If you're solo, the best overall strategy is to focus on B (except on maps where B is like a carnival).  It's way more important to hold B (usually) than to do anything else in Control.  The masses think *spawn point  - B - enemy point* in order (because maps are linear, I guess) so they will come at B if they just have one zone.  If spawns flip, hold B and hope your team figures out the rest.  If they can get A or C, you're still at an advantage.  That won't happen if you fail in your quest to dominate B.

I also do a lot of anchoring, even at enemy points sometimes.  If I&amp;#39;m alone, trying to capture the point will likely lead to a 3v1 and my death.  If I guard it, killing them as they trickle in, hopefully one of my randoms will stumble his way onto the point and then I will help him capture it.  After 10-15 seconds of no enemies showing up, I usually end up trying to at least neutralize it by myself though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People somehow haven&amp;#39;t realized in over 3 years that control is a game of defense, not offense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exactly.  I played a ton of Control in y1 particularly.  I am top 2% in Defensive kills.  Of course, this doesn&amp;#39;t control for time played, but I am top 7% in overall kills, so I&amp;#39;m defending more than most.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also play solo a decent amount.  If you&amp;#39;re solo, the best overall strategy is to focus on B (except on maps where B is like a carnival).  It&amp;#39;s way more important to hold B (usually) than to do anything else in Control.
