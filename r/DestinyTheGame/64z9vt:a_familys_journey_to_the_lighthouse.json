I tried to play with my friends and even had a couple of runs that stopped just short of the lighthouse.  I\u2019d get a group of guys and we would get after trials for a couple weeks, but soon after due to dad schedules, beat downs (man some of those weeks were demoralizing) or what-have-you our groups would just fall apart and we would stop playing.  Whenever we needed fill-ins we\u2019d ask my son (even in year one when he was 8) to fill in on some cards.  He\u2019s a gamer and has been since he beat twilight princess at 5.  We would joke about what the salt levels would be like if they knew they just got wrecking balled by an 8yo.  We had some good cards here or there back then, but never managed to get the 9-0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting a feel for what trials was about by seeing us play and the excitement it caused, my daughter\u2019s interest was also piqued.  I told her if she wanted to start paying trials I needed her to practice.  I told her the best way to practice was to play a lot of elimination and rumble.  I really wasn\u2019t thinking she would be too committed, but soon she was playing those game modes a ton and growing in skill level.  She was able to play with me and a friend in trials a couple times, but really wanted to get into it more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Christmas came around this year the kids convinced me to get a 3rd ps4, \u201cso we can all play Trials together\u201d.  We started playing the first week of 2017.  We didn\u2019t expect to go to the lighthouse, we knew it would be a process, especially considering this is when the population really started declining.  We were pretty excited when on our 2nd week we were able to make it to 7 wins without a loss.  Of course we then ran into Lumi and then right after another highly skilled team and we were quickly handed our loss.  It was disappointing, but at the same time we had hope, as we were only those 2 games away from flawless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things didn\u2019t go so easy all the weeks after that.  We\u2019ve had some really rough patches due to various issues (player base drop, not having some important meta weapons, sucking at some maps, only being able to run about 8-10 games(not cards) total a week and only on weekends when we had time to play).  But then something great happened a few weeks back.  My now 12yo daughter mentioned that we were pushing incorrectly in a certain instance.  I said \u201cgreat, why don\u2019t you make all the calls for a while and we\u2019ll see how it goes\u201d.  It went really well, better than I thought it would even.  She has really learned the flow of a trials game, probably better than I have due to her practice sessions.  She made all the calls and while we didn\u2019t do too much better than our average week, it felt good and we were all pretty happy with how it went.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next trials week rolls around and we\u2019re still feeling good about our team and how we were getting better together, but I felt we needed to address our attitudes again.  It\u2019s tough always staying positive when it seems like so many things can get in your way and discourage you from hitting that ultimate goal.  We got together and prayed that we wouldn\u2019t get upset with each other or ourselves too much or even things like lag, and that we would enjoy the experience for what it is, enjoying some family time doing what we love doing and if that means no lighthouse, ok, we\u2019ll try again next time.   We\u2019ve really been able to grow closer together as a family through this trials process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s one thing about this whole process we\u2019re going through.  It turns out trials can be a great way to grow individually and as a family, who knew?  By having family discussions before and after trials we\u2019ve learned things that have improved our patience, positive attitude, focus, teamwork, communication and kindness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We start the week off asking my daughter to direct the flow of the game.  She does it, but I can tell she needs help, she\u2019s making some decisions that are great, and then at other times just taking too long to make a call.  I start asking questions and giving suggestions when needed.  All of the sudden my son starts doing the same and we are all providing decent input and making some good decisions.  At the same time we start trusting each other more to take care of our jobs and things just start coming together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We start filling in our card.   Things seem to be going as well as can be expected and we make it to 7-0 without using our mercy.  A little excitement is building, but we don\u2019t let it overwhelm us.  We get to work excited for another opportunity.  THEN we run into a Red bar god.  It was terrible and one of those sad times where you really feel a love/hate relationship with this game.  We felt we could have beat this team, but they had one player who was almost impossible to kill due to lag.  We killed him once or twice, but his lag was far too strong to compete with.  It was terrible, that\u2019s not how things should go and we all know that, but we didn\u2019t let it get us too down.  We knew we had 1 more chance.  We played the next match and ran into an excellent team.  They smoked us fair and square with an amazing use of team nade placement.  Well another week down and no flawless we thought, but we had fun, we stayed positive and most of all we were LOVING IT.  Yeah that red bar god really soured things, but we were still excited about our teamwork and the fun we were having.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it we had the opportunity to play trials again the next day, this had never happened prior due to schedule conflicts.  To be honest I was playing pretty poorly this day.  However, my kids were being clutch.  We had some crazy comebacks and a lot of big plays.  We again reached 7-0.  But this time, we have a crazy comeback that gets us the win and we are on to 8-0 with mercy still available.  I tell the kids, \u201cAlright I know I\u2019ve been pretty bad today, but I am going to step it up this match, let\u2019s go!\u201d  Somehow I do, and pull out a 7-0 kd and we roll the final team 5-0, we did it, we made the lighthouse!  We all jump out of our chairs and run up to meet one another in the middle of the living room with grins as wide as can be \u2013 high fives and hugs all around - much rejoicing.  It really was a moment I believe we\u2019ll all remember for years to come.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: If you have kids train them to be good at videogames, so they can carry you to the lighthouse.  Dad, 12 year old daughter and 10 year old son get to lighthouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: Thank you all for the positivity and encouragement.
