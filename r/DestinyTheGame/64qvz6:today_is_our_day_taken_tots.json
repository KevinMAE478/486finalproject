And the music gets pumped up in every fight, especially Siege Engine. Ah yes, Siege Engine, the most badass encounter ever. Yes, I want to ram a flame-throwing train through 2 walls so hard that my frame rate drops to 1 FPS. Yes, I want to also drive said train engine into the sunset and off a cliff, then go straight into a technological ghost town where an angry spider alien wants to kill me. Bring it on. Not to mention that the weapons are really solid, change their look according to whether the last perk is applied, make that sweet-ass electric guitar noise when you activate said perk, and give the notion that the Splicers stole foundry weapons from dead guardians and glitched the hell out of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR\u2014 SIVA DENSITY CRITICAL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg5awwr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991187.0, "created_utc": 1491962387.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zvtq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "noob35746", "parent_id": "t1_dg4zu9z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have many times.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg4zvtq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976702.0, "created_utc": 1491947902.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zu9z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Inanimate_CARB0N_Rod", "parent_id": "t1_dg49n80", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You must not use LFG", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must not use LFG&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg4zu9z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976646.0, "created_utc": 1491947846.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49n80", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 75, "report_reasons": null, "author": "noob35746", "parent_id": "t3_64qvz6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a non taken tot kings fall is still my favourite.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a non taken tot kings fall is still my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg49n80", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947148.0, "created_utc": 1491918348.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 75}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvz6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kwwt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "T1germeister", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jn3y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, totes.
