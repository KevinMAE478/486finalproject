For this checkpoint, if you don&amp;#39;t have swords, you&amp;#39;ll want to rely on supers, just different ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stormtrance, Hammers, and tethers are the way to go for swordless guardians.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Aksis part 1&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use literally anything here. This is too easy for groups to struggle. Captains can be downed by Gjally, Golden Gun, Nova Bomb, or fist of havok/ hammers in a pinch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Aksis part 2&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark Drinker is dps king on Aksis, but if you don&amp;#39;t have one, use those cannons (charge them), use any of the Vosik dps weapons (Sleeper / Ex Machina / Spindle) and contribute with some dps boosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Said dps boosters, in order of value, imo: Melting Point (simmering flames + Skullfort version), Weapons of Light, Viking Funeral. I would only use tether if you don&amp;#39;t have a melting point, and would absolutely run Celestial Nighthawk for the extra super charges you get for challenge strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swords are great. Get one. But if you&amp;#39;re just starting the quest, you probably won&amp;#39;t have it in time for this week. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgc698a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492386493.0, "created_utc": 1492357693.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pnio", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pnio", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pnio", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcm1xu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WobblyBits_X", "parent_id": "t1_dgcjmtk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The difference a boss not having an AOE ground pound (or being on the ground) makes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference a boss not having an AOE ground pound (or being on the ground) makes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgcm1xu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492407285.0, "created_utc": 1492378485.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcjmtk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MLP_Saurian", "parent_id": "t1_dgcddf6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "for my group it was more, we thought razelighter had the higher dps output, until we did some more runs and realized dark drinker was the way to go XD \n\nIts funny how the swords are basically worthless in the KF raid but theyre practically required (for a much easier time) in WotM ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;for my group it was more, we thought razelighter had the higher dps output, until we did some more runs and realized dark drinker was the way to go XD &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its funny how the swords are basically worthless in the KF raid but theyre practically required (for a much easier time) in WotM &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgcjmtk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404128.0, "created_utc": 1492375328.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcddf6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "justinlaforge", "parent_id": "t3_65pnio", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I still remember being made fun of the first week in WotM for using a dark drinker on aksis.  \"This #%^%# is going ham on the robot man's ass with a sword.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still remember being made fun of the first week in WotM for using a dark drinker on aksis.  &amp;quot;This #%&lt;sup&gt;%#&lt;/sup&gt; is going ham on the robot man&amp;#39;s ass with a sword.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgcddf6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395905.0, "created_utc": 1492367105.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pnio", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pnio", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pnio", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcn9jh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kid_creme", "parent_id": "t1_dgcj6n0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If anything, it's back to post Taken-Spring.
