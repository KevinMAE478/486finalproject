Perhaps if the damage reduction was buffed/nerfed (not sure which way round that should be?) and the healing component buffed (like three red bar kills heals or one major heals?) - or maybe the base damage before the perk is increased? Or maybe a portion of health is returned on reload but only when the main perk has proc&amp;#39;d?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I think there are tonnes of things they could&amp;#39;ve done (but obviously they aren&amp;#39;t going to now)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgag4pf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492272662.0, "created_utc": 1492243862.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h4yb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahpqe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dest1nyChild", "parent_id": "t1_dgadetz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Actually they didnt . we had killed him and sent him to his throne world. he couldnt do shit then lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually they didnt . we had killed him and sent him to his throne world. he couldnt do shit then lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dgahpqe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492277601.0, "created_utc": 1492248801.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h4yb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h4yb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h4yb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h4yb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaohcm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dessum", "parent_id": "t1_dgamjhn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm no Hive scientist, but I feel like destroying the ship would just destroy the portal to it.
