When you have subclasses that step on the toes of others, you&amp;#39;re not doing it correctly. Homogenizing is not the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, the way to differentiate the subspecs is not by &amp;quot;Sunsinger gets OP grenades&amp;quot; and the like, but rather by introducing niches that each subspec can fill. For instance, perhaps Bladedancer could have an ability that allows him to stab the foot/appendage/whatever of a boss to keep him stuck in place for a few seconds - greatly aiding the ability to do damage to an extremely mobile boss. Perhaps Sunbreaker could have a sort of Blinding Hammer, allowing him to blind great mobs of enemies in LoS for a few seconds - greatly aiding the survivability of his/her raid group when overcome by ads and encouraging coordinated escape efforts. Perhaps Voidwalker could have an alternate Super that summons a type of cleansing voidwell that allies could interact with to rid themselves of debuffs, but also needed to be placed strategically and protected to prevent it from being destroyed - you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just random and probably bad examples, but the point is that classes should bring multiple unique and niche upsides for people to want to bring to a raid, and really feel like they are missing out when they sacrifice that Warlock for the Hunter and don&amp;#39;t have that extra voidwell.

It would be cool if it was more of a healing class, for instance keep the perk tree the same, but give radiance the ability to heal nearby allies. So in CE when your health regen is taken away all the sudden warlocks become extra useful. Everyone getting hammered by boomers? pop radiance to keep them on their feet.
