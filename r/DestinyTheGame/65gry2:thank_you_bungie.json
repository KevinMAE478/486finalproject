I knew it was by Bungie, and their first foray into a &amp;#39;social shooter RPG&amp;#39;.  I had never played an MMO ever, and I liked Halo alright.  It was something new.  Something different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made my character, and hopped into what I learned was called an &amp;quot;instance&amp;quot;.  I shot some dudes, got some glimmer (?), and that was it.  I didn&amp;#39;t think much of it, but I played it the next day.  And the next.  Then the Beta ended, and I wanted more.  I wanted to hear Peter Dinklage offer up more fun quips.  I wanted more things to shoot.  The game inspired in me a curiosity to learn what had happened, and what I would do to help the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the game, and played it day one.  I got up to the Black Garden in a few hours, and slayed the Darkness.  I got my Stranger&amp;#39;s Rifle, and I thought &amp;quot;What do I do now?&amp;quot;.  I shared my experience with coworkers who played a few weeks later, and they said I should get ready to raid the Vault of Glass.  I didn&amp;#39;t know what raiding was, nor what challenges would await me there.  Still, I friended those at work, and went home ready to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, I found out about Levels. And gear. And that I sucked.  But it&amp;#39;s ok, we all suck at first.  My buddy actually said &amp;quot;Eyes up, Guardian.  We got this.&amp;quot;  And we plowed through content, hitting the loot cave, getting ourselves as far as we could.  We hit 27-28, and figured we could do it.  We&amp;#39;re hitting the Vault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After three weeks of hitting our heads against the wall, we did it.  At 3am, all of us shouting and cheering (sorry neighbors), we did it.  All of us were awarded Chatterwhite.  A couple of us got our first Raid weapons, mine being my cherished Vision of Confluence.  One got a sparrow.  We were on top of the world.  We triumphantly stormed the Crucible, clad in white armor, glistening with pride at such a victory.  We won some matches, lost some matches, but we were on cloud nine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, and we all dropped money on the Expansion Pass, and got ready for Crota that holiday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved away, but still played with them despite the time zone change.  We hit up House of Wolves together.  However, our group fell apart around summer.  I found new people, eliminating  Skolas with a now close friend.  We fought through the Crucible until Taken King dropped, and we hit the Dreadnought with a crew we had assembled from all corners of the earth (no, srsly).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We tried Trials.  We got candy and masks.  We raced Sparrows.\nAll of these things we did, making friends as we went.  Making our legends grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few of my old Raid crew came back, and we got our Spindles together.  We discovered the secrets of farming with Three of Coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had both groups play Rise of Iron when it came out.  We got our swords, as new Iron Lords.  We spent hours getting that damned SIVA fragment at the top of Felwinter Peak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this past winter, they welcomed me back from a brief hiatus from moving again to the Dawning.  Now, in the Age of Triumph, we&amp;#39;re hitting our old Raids, taking a moment to remember all those precious memories we made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what this is.  It&amp;#39;s not a story of good vs evil.  It&amp;#39;s about us.  About the legends we make.  About helping Nepal after a disastrous earthquake.  About helping sick kids at Seattle Children&amp;#39;s.  About finding those lost guardians and bringing them back to the light.  Whether it&amp;#39;s through Raid after Raid, or shooting the shit while taking pot shots in the Divide, waiting for a Taken Champion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife laughs at me when I say this : Destiny is the best game experience I have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I play a lot of stuff.  Hell, I&amp;#39;m trying to split time between Persona 5 and Destiny, while helping a friend in Diablo III.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, rain or shine.  Buff or nerf.  Broken loot or glitched mechanics.  I&amp;#39;ve been here.  I have traversed the solar system, taking out the Darkness with my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what all you misfits are.  To me, everyone here is family.  Even you, you Mapador shotgunners.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bungie, thank you.  Thank you for taking our feedback, both good and bad, and making something wonderful from it.  Thank you for putting up with us.  For making a place where we can be with our friends, not worrying about our lives for just a little bit.
