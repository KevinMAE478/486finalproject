Played a really toxic fireteam (lots of t-bags and emotes after every kill), my team was down pretty bad but we got pretty frustrated with them and turned it on and ended up smoking them. Got some messages afterwards from the team, typical git gud stuff. After I blocked him, I started getting messages from random people saying &amp;quot;You suck at Destiny&amp;quot;. after the 3rd or 4th I invited one of them to a team and asked why he sent that. He said he was responding to my post for free trials carries on LFG. I told him I had no idea what he was talking about then found out that the dude I blocked posted my gt on an lfg site. Found the post and reported it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People really take this thing too seriously sometimes. Even if its just a prank on a friend its really not funny, and things can get out of hand pretty quick. 5/7 would not recommend doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg9434m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492204674.0, "created_utc": 1492175874.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6592a4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94aio", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UndiscoveredBum-", "parent_id": "t3_6592a4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If I see people posting crap like that I usually don't bother 9 times of 10 they are either trolling or a bunch of kids", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I see people posting crap like that I usually don&amp;#39;t bother 9 times of 10 they are either trolling or a bunch of kids&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg94aio", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492205004.0, "created_utc": 1492176204.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6592a4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94d72", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BoomStik012", "parent_id": "t3_6592a4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "this is so sad... lets all be friends instead come on guys", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is so sad... lets all be friends instead come on guys&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "name": "t1_dg94d72", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492205127.0, "created_utc": 1492176327.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6592a4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9671r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Soulrakk", "parent_id": "t3_6592a4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Any time someone is requesting a certain message, just don't.
