I was a skeptical hippo at first like everyone else because Datto&amp;#39;s Aksis dps video clearly shows the Dark Drinker being the best option. I waited for the proof like everyone else from &lt;a href=\"/u/Pantsman1084\"&gt;u/Pantsman1084&lt;/a&gt; but unfortunately nothing came up. So in the inspirational words of Thanos (from Marvel) I thought - &amp;quot;Fine, I will do it myself&amp;quot;. I couldn&amp;#39;t break down the numbers as well as Datto because the damage text from cluster bombs all overlay in a single frame. So I gave both the Dark Drinker and the Warpath the chance to do as much &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; dps as they possibly could during Aksis&amp;#39; 3rd stun phase. I also had my clan buddy (Masaru) throw siva charges to initiate the stun phase since the charges also do damage. Keep in mind I didn&amp;#39;t use any weapons of light, tethers or etc and also had the perk &amp;quot;warrior of light&amp;quot; enabled on the Dark Drinker for increased damage for the R2 attack.

Another consideration is that you are only looking at DPS for the third teleport for a limited amount of time.  In a real run when you're damaging Aksis through all of his teleports, you will go through your 8 rockets very quickly and then you will be using special, then primary.

In other words, it's more important that you have a PVE god-rolled Sniper, can land your shots, and always have adequate special ammo to do so.  The Memory of Radegast artifact can boost your sword ammo capacity to 88 provided that you have the sword out when you use a synthesis or pick up heavy ammo.  This increased heavy ammo means you can deal more damage per heavy synth with Dark Drinker vs. Warpath (albeit over a longer amount of time).  Damage per ammo scarcity is just better for Dark Drinker.  Finally, you're less likely to suicide by using Dark Drinker on the boss.\n\nThe post seems correct though, in that Warpath does beat out DD in terms of pure burst DPS.

Everyone gathers at the Weapons bubble most groups have agreed to place at Aksis' feet. If you have a 2nd Titan, it is also more practical for him to occasionally interrupt his swording to quickly apply 2-3 Melting Point melees.\n\n4- Rocket launcher suicides happen. Especially if several people are gathering around a Weapons bubble for extra damage, as mentioned by /u/TheHawkNY . In struggling groups, this can often lead to chaos and an eventual wipe.\n\nThe Warpath is an interesting substitute for those who don't have Dark-Drinker, or people who just enjoy explosions.

I appreciate the work and thought he and &lt;a href=\"/u/pantsman1084\"&gt;/u/pantsman1084&lt;/a&gt; have put into this, however let&amp;#39;s consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- Dark-Drinker can also be used as a simple and effective way way to kill captains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- If Warpath needs armor perks to achieve 8 rockets, then it&amp;#39;s only fair to compare it to a Dark-Drinker with 88 ammo with Radeghast artifact (82 once you&amp;#39;ve killed your captain).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- The testing shows unbuffed damage numbers. &lt;del&gt;I believe (admittedly without video proof) that Cluster Bombs, like Wolfpack rounds, are not affected by the likes of Weapons of Light.&lt;/del&gt; ( &lt;strong&gt;Edit - see OP&amp;#39;s edit #6 for proof of WoL and Tether affecting Cluster Bombs&lt;/strong&gt; ) Also, applying damage buffs is easier with a team of 6 Dark-Drinkers VS 6 Warpaths. Everyone gathers at the Weapons bubble most groups have agreed to place at Aksis&amp;#39; feet. If you have a 2nd Titan, it is also more practical for him to occasionally interrupt his swording to quickly apply 2-3 Melting Point melees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4- Rocket launcher suicides happen. Especially if several people are gathering around a Weapons bubble for extra damage, as mentioned by &lt;a href=\"/u/TheHawkNY\"&gt;/u/TheHawkNY&lt;/a&gt; . In struggling groups, this can often lead to chaos and an eventual wipe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Warpath is an interesting substitute for those who don&amp;#39;t have Dark-Drinker, or people who just enjoy explosions. It also frees up an exotic slot.
