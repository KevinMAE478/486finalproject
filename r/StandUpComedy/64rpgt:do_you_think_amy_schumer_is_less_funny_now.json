Especially the comedians who got really big, there's a pressure there to put out something new quickly. Call it the \"Louis CK\" model or the \"Carlin\" model or the \"Netflix\" model or whatever but not everyone can do that.\n\nHell for me personally, I thought CK's special before this one, Live at the Comedy Store, suffered from not being as polished as it could have been, and not quite up to par with his other specials - given his schedule around that time (including putting a lot of stand-up into his show) and how quickly he was putting stuff out,  that didn't really surprise me. Aziz at the height of his fame put out Live at Madison Square Garden which IMO wasn't quite up to par with his earlier stuff. Bill Burr is my favorite comedian working right now but a lot of people agreed Walk Your Way Out was a step down from his earlier stuff. That's not really a surprise when you consider Burr is simultaneously developing F is for Family, Aziz at the time was developing Master of None and on Parks and Rec, etc.\n\nI think my favorite special this year so far has been Neal Brennan's 3 Mics and surprise, it's something he's been working on, solely focusing on standup, for years. Louis CK's 2017 was also extremely funny and you notice he's over a year removed from Horace and Pete, and hasn't been doing his FX show for almost 2 years. He's pretty much considered a genius and for him to knock it out of the park it requires a pretty singular focus and ignoring a lot of those other duties. If it's hard for him it's gonna be just as hard for people like Schumer that aren't on his level.\n\nSo \"duds\" to me aren't all that surprising, especially when you're talking about these people at the top who have insane schedules, other commitments, usually a TV show or movie they're developing, etc., on top of that to tour and polish and perfect an hour of comedy over a year's time just isn't always going to work. \n\nI'm not one of those people who thinks Schumer has never been funny, I enjoyed her stuff when she was focused solely on stand-up, but I think she's fallen into this trap of the \"big comedian\" who has got a bunch of pots on the burners and is still trying to tour new hours and put out specials.
