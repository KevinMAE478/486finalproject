First, some remasters are free if you already own the game (Bioshock remasters, Skyrim).

I know Skyrim isn't.)  \n\nSecond, remasters serve much less of a purpose on PC than they do on console.  Even with backwards compatibility on Xbox, my 360 version of gears of war looks like it did when I played it on my 360.  It does not benefit from being played on a current gen system.  On the other hand, Gears of War remastered looks significantly better.  If I play a last gen game on PC, however, the graphics and performance improve whenever I improve my hardware.  Skyrim got a significant performance boost on ultra settings when I got a new GPU.  I downloaded the remaster on steam for free, and it does not look/perform significantly better than original skyrim.  My PC version of 2013 tomb raider improved with my new GPU and now it looks/performs just as well as the ps4/xbox one version, if not better because of my improved PC hardware.\n\nThird, remasters on both console and PC serve as a great entry way point for new gamers that either weren't gaming when the game originally was released.  For example, I was not playing PC games when Planescape Torment was released, so if I want to play it for the first time now, the enhanced edition would be perfect for me.
