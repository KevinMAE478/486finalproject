Categories like FPS, RPG, and RTS encompass such a wide range of games, appealing to such different people for such varied reasons, that they often seem designed to mislead as much as inform. I also noticed that a lot of what passes for videogame criticism is often just an expression of a particular gamers&amp;#39; preference for a particular style of game. They might say that a game is pointless or lacks depth or complexity, but often what that really means is that it lacks the kind of complexity or meaning that they happen to prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I got to thinking about the fundamental things that we do in games and decided upon two criteria.

Creative-Strategy is &amp;#39;Medium&amp;#39; because of the semi-open narrative structure that allows the player to create their own character and essentially co-author the story. Taken independently, the gun turret and swoopbike racing mini-games would score higher on Objective-Dexterity, but they&amp;#39;re a sufficiently minor part of the whole experience that I would still classify the game as &amp;#39;Low&amp;#39; overall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Strategy&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to KotOR, Mass Effect trades some Objective-Strategy gameplay for Objective-Dexterity with the introduction of real-time combat mechanics. It retains the semi-open narrative structure of KotOR for &amp;#39;Medium&amp;#39; Creative-Strategy. The addition of a fully customisable face adds a high Creative-Dexterity element, though it&amp;#39;s insignificant in the context of the whole game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Strategy&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternate modes can radically change the type of game Minecraft is. Survival mode increases the Objective-Strategy game mechanics, while Creative mode strips away everything but the Creative-Dexterity gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Strategy&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; is that it combines high levels of Objective-Dexterity and Objective-Strategy gameplay, but thereby limits its audience to people who like both. The &amp;#39;Medium&amp;#39; Creative-Strategy element comes from its emphasis on exploration and narrative interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some games, like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; have alternate modes that can radically shift gameplay style. For example, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt; features a &amp;#39;Hardcore&amp;#39; mode that significantly ramps up the Objective-Strategy side of the game. Yet other games may allow the player to engage with them in radically different ways. For example, people who play &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of simply completing everything and maxing out all their stats may hardly engage with the creative, role-playing, or narrative elements of the game at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can make categorising particular games quite difficult and somewhat arbitrary. In fact, it would perhaps be easier to categorise gamers themselves rather than the games they play. While most gamers like at least a little bit of each type of gameplay, they usually prefer one or can tolerate only so much of another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency for those who are often called &amp;#39;hardcore gamers&amp;#39; to prefer games with lots of Objective-Strategy gameplay. Games, or elements of games, that are more creative or expressive are dismissed as superficial or meaningless. For example, when Lionhead decided that clothing and armour would have no practical utility in &lt;em&gt;Fable II&lt;/em&gt;, but would merely be an aesthetic choice, some accused the game of &amp;quot;dumbing down&amp;quot;. However, it might be better to interpret the game as shifting your choice of apparel from Objective-Strategy to Creative-Dexterity gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable II&lt;/em&gt; offered a wide range of different clothing options that could be applied in many different colours and combinations. &lt;em&gt;Making a cool-looking character was hard&lt;/em&gt;. You could discover screenshots online of cool-looking characters other people had created and wonder why yours still looked so dumb and stupid. The game no longer rewarded or punished you for your choices about what to wear, because there were no longer any stats associated with performance, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean there was less depth than before, but just a different kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written enough words for now. Mostly, I just kind of wish people would adopt this as a common linguistic framework for discussing types of games, gameplay, and gamers. As things stand, our shorthand labels and categories for these things seem clumsy and confusing. In any case, feel free to let me know what you think--that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m posting this here, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Like many, I've long been somewhat dissatisfied with the traditional genres of gaming.

The addition of a fully customisable face adds a high Creative-Dexterity element, though it's insignificant in the context of the whole game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Minecraft*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|Dexterity|Strategy\n--:|:-:|:-:\n**Creative**|High|Medium\n**Objective**|Medium|Low\nAlternate modes can radically change the type of game Minecraft is. Survival mode increases the Objective-Strategy game mechanics, while Creative mode strips away everything but the Creative-Dexterity gameplay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Dark Souls*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|Dexterity|Strategy\n--:|:-:|:-:\n**Creative**|Low|Medium\n**Objective**|High|High\nPart of the challenge of *Dark Souls* is that it combines high levels of Objective-Dexterity and Objective-Strategy gameplay, but thereby limits its audience to people who like both. The 'Medium' Creative-Strategy element comes from its emphasis on exploration and narrative interpretation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome games, like *Minecraft* have alternate modes that can radically shift gameplay style. For example, *Fallout 4* features a 'Hardcore' mode that significantly ramps up the Objective-Strategy side of the game. Yet other games may allow the player to engage with them in radically different ways. For example, people who play *Skyrim* with the goal of simply completing everything and maxing out all their stats may hardly engage with the creative, role-playing, or narrative elements of the game at all.\n\nThis can make categorising particular games quite difficult and somewhat arbitrary. In fact, it would perhaps be easier to categorise gamers themselves rather than the games they play. While most gamers like at least a little bit of each type of gameplay, they usually prefer one or can tolerate only so much of another.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is a tendency for those who are often called 'hardcore gamers' to prefer games with lots of Objective-Strategy gameplay. Games, or elements of games, that are more creative or expressive are dismissed as superficial or meaningless. For example, when Lionhead decided that clothing and armour would have no practical utility in *Fable II*, but would merely be an aesthetic choice, some accused the game of \"dumbing down\". However, it might be better to interpret the game as shifting your choice of apparel from Objective-Strategy to Creative-Dexterity gameplay.\n\n*Fable II* offered a wide range of different clothing options that could be applied in many different colours and combinations. *Making a cool-looking character was hard*. You could discover screenshots online of cool-looking characters other people had created and wonder why yours still looked so dumb and stupid. The game no longer rewarded or punished you for your choices about what to wear, because there were no longer any stats associated with performance, but that doesn't necessarily mean there was less depth than before, but just a different kind.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've written enough words for now. Mostly, I just kind of wish people would adopt this as a common linguistic framework for discussing types of games, gameplay, and gamers. As things stand, our shorthand labels and categories for these things seem clumsy and confusing. In any case, feel free to let me know what you think--that's why I'm posting this here, after all.\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65n0lg", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nomenym", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65n0lg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.truegaming", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/truegaming/comments/65n0lg/types_of_games_and_types_of_gamers/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492339551.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/65n0lg/types_of_games_and_types_of_gamers/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Types of Games and Types of Gamers", "created_utc": 1492310751.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 5, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n0lg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd86hi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Racecarlock", "parent_id": "t3_65n0lg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, you put a lot of effort into it, that's for sure.
