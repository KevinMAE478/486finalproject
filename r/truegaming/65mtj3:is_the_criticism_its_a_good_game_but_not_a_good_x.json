This time, though, I believe the rhetoric is not reasonable. People are expecting this single game to make them feel as invested as a whole trilogy did previously, and it's just not a reasonable expectation. The other issue is that there are many bug and balance problems. However, the die-hard fans of the original trilogy had years to play after many of the bugs had been resolved, making them forget how many bugs the originals also had. There are definitely issues that need fixed in the new game, but because people are comparing a single new game to a whole trilogy that was actively supported years after release, they have unrealistic expectations. Therefore in the case of ME:A, this rhetoric is not valid most of the time. I believe that as time passes, many bugs will be patched, and subsequent games will flesh out the Andromeda story line.

I can point to several games it definitely was a valid criticism for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suikoden Tierkries comes to mind immediately, which effectively killed its series in addition to being a massive disappointment in both sales and reviews. It&amp;#39;s decent on its own merits, but has basically nothing to do with the Suikoden series. I still don&amp;#39;t know why they attached the name to it, and fans of the series suffered because of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actual spinoffs, however, that are obviously just flavoring a completely different genre with their original universe, probably shouldn&amp;#39;t qualify. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mega Man Soccer, way back on the SNES, is a great example; it&amp;#39;s very mindlessly fun, but it&amp;#39;s in no way a normal Mega Man game. When Mario Kart first came out, this was a widely-seen criticism of it too; it was a fun racing game, but not a Mario game. (It was universally recognized as ridiculously fun, though, hence becoming its own series.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither of these were marketed or expected to be mainline entries in their series. Tierkreis, MGSV, and Breath of the Wild were, and that&amp;#39;s where a lot of people understandably have issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "truegaming", "name": "t1_dgcnem5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492409068.0, "created_utc": 1492380268.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mtj3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3ntl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "whatamidoing11", "parent_id": "t3_65mtj3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think it's mostly bullshit.
