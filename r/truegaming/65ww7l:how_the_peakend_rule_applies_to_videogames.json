Look at its metacritic summary:\n\n&gt;Summary: Super Meat Boy is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated cube of meat who's trying to save his girlfriend (who happens to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux.\n\nor its reviews:\n\n&gt;Super Meat Boy's difficulty will likely turn off some gamers. But if you like your 2D platformers challenging and rewarding then you'll be hard pressed to find a better game out there.\n\n-\n\n&gt;This game is most certainly not for everyone--if you can't handle extremely hard games, you're better off marveling at this spectacle from a distance--but those who can stomach the difficult and appreciate the bizarre will take every ounce of punishment Super Meat Boy dishes out and beg for more.\n\n-\n\n&gt;Even though Super Meat Boy will make most casual players shy away from it due to its extreme, raw (pun intended) level of difficulty, there's plenty of content to dig through and it's all well worth the effort.\n\nLater levels in Super Meat Boy require a level of precision in their jumps that most gamers are not used to.  Almost nothing in Dark Souls follows this: the vast majority of gameplay is not intended to be timed to the frame or difficult mechanically.  Combat is just basic movement, shielding, dodging, and attacking; none of this requires any kind of real precision, and you can watch even basic players pick it up and play it relatively quickly.\n\nFurther, there is very little in Dark Souls that requires any kind of significant increase in mechanical skill, even SL1 runs.  The actual mechanics don't change much, it just requires you to be very, very consistent; this is a skill in and of itself, but it's a different skill.  It's about being able to precisely execute a relatively simple set of commands time and again without a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, Bayonetta or any other character action game generally requires a much tighter set of timing.  The game moves much quicker, and there's much less time to react to a larger amount of stimuli.  On the default difficulty for these games, this is mitigated by them not being terribly punishing; you can take a number of hits without dying, and there are plenty of items that can heal you up that can be purchased from the shop.  This means most players can get through the game, even without being particularly proficient, but that doesn't change the fact that the skill set required is a different one than Dark Souls.\n\nAnd that's my central point: it's not that Dark Souls is an easy game.  It's not.  But it's less difficult than it is punishing; very little in it is overly difficult to perform, even on harder difficulty levels, but failure to perform results in extremely harsh consequences.  By contrast, games like Bayonetta or DMC possess a great number of mechanics that require an extremely high level of dexterity.  As the difficulty level goes up you fight faster enemies with different mechanics (ie, Devil Trigger enemies are faster and nearly impossible to stagger on Dante Must Die difficulty), and the result is that you must be able to perform a very high number of precise actions in a very short span of time.  I have no hard evidence, but I would posit that consistently performing a few simple actions repeatedly is less difficult than consistently performing a high number of more complicated actions repeatedly.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the point you&amp;#39;re making and I can agree with part of it, but there are a number of points I have to disagree with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;indeed SMB is insanely popular and its fame isn&amp;#39;t for its difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is absolutely where it&amp;#39;s fame came from, especially early on.  Look at its metacritic summary:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Summary: Super Meat Boy is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated cube of meat who&amp;#39;s trying to save his girlfriend (who happens to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or its reviews:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Super Meat Boy&amp;#39;s difficulty will likely turn off some gamers. But if you like your 2D platformers challenging and rewarding then you&amp;#39;ll be hard pressed to find a better game out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This game is most certainly not for everyone--if you can&amp;#39;t handle extremely hard games, you&amp;#39;re better off marveling at this spectacle from a distance--but those who can stomach the difficult and appreciate the bizarre will take every ounce of punishment Super Meat Boy dishes out and beg for more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even though Super Meat Boy will make most casual players shy away from it due to its extreme, raw (pun intended) level of difficulty, there&amp;#39;s plenty of content to dig through and it&amp;#39;s all well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later levels in Super Meat Boy require a level of precision in their jumps that most gamers are not used to.  Almost nothing in Dark Souls follows this: the vast majority of gameplay is not intended to be timed to the frame or difficult mechanically.  Combat is just basic movement, shielding, dodging, and attacking; none of this requires any kind of real precision, and you can watch even basic players pick it up and play it relatively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, there is very little in Dark Souls that requires any kind of significant increase in mechanical skill, even SL1 runs.  The actual mechanics don&amp;#39;t change much, it just requires you to be very, very consistent; this is a skill in and of itself, but it&amp;#39;s a different skill.  It&amp;#39;s about being able to precisely execute a relatively simple set of commands time and again without a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Bayonetta or any other character action game generally requires a much tighter set of timing.  The game moves much quicker, and there&amp;#39;s much less time to react to a larger amount of stimuli.  On the default difficulty for these games, this is mitigated by them not being terribly punishing; you can take a number of hits without dying, and there are plenty of items that can heal you up that can be purchased from the shop.  This means most players can get through the game, even without being particularly proficient, but that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that the skill set required is a different one than Dark Souls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s my central point: it&amp;#39;s not that Dark Souls is an easy game.  It&amp;#39;s not.  But it&amp;#39;s less difficult than it is punishing; very little in it is overly difficult to perform, even on harder difficulty levels, but failure to perform results in extremely harsh consequences.
