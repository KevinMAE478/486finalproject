They don&amp;#39;t do anything, so if you don&amp;#39;t worry about missing them, they don&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;#39;t think it was a good idea to include these collectibles at the beginning of Uncharted 4.  The game has an intense fast paced opening 3 hours, and hunting for collectibles in these story sections would kill the story&amp;#39;s pacing.  Personally I ignored the collectibles entirely in these areas, but I can imagine a player that wanted to find them spoiling the opening hours of the game for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there really wasn&amp;#39;t that much Naughty Dog could do about this.  If they didn&amp;#39;t put any collectibles in these sections, players wouldn&amp;#39;t actually know that, and they would go looking anyway.  If they removed collectibles from the game entirely, players might still go looking for them based on expectations that there would be collectibles since there were in the previous games.  Plus, when the game later becomes more focused on the environments later, I think collectibles make the game better for some players, as it encourages them to explore places they wouldn&amp;#39;t normally go and makes the enviroments feel more alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "truegaming", "name": "t1_dgcb440", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392916.0, "created_utc": 1492364116.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc6149", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dunge", "parent_id": "t3_65pjv8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Took me a while to realize you mentionmed Max Payne as an exemple of games that DON'T have any.\n\nYour feeling is generally widespread.
