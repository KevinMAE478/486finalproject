Public transit is lacking, requiring cars for large portions of the North American Population.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I personally find most of the games that seem have any quality to them end up being JRPG&amp;#39;s.  This is especially the case with smartphone games.  I have yet to find a non Jrpg/non re-release(looking at you final fantasy) that isn&amp;#39;t a timewaster game.  I don&amp;#39;t mind paying the 10-15$ for a game of the quality of say, bastion, transistor, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The micro-transaction filled games seem to be doing fine, and so few full price games are made.  The smartphone controls are, limiting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The jump to a portable(my last was the gameboy color), is a non insignificant startup investment, and quite honestly a pain in the ass to carry yet another device.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love some mario games on the go, but Nintendo kind of botched that with the recent Android Mario release title, showing us that they don&amp;#39;t want to give us a full experience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we are left with clickers, micro-transactions, and the rare good(usually jrpg) title, buried in a metric ton of shit games, often with cover images blatantly ripped from other (often pc) titles that in no way relate to the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "truegaming", "name": "t1_dgcdqht", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492396392.0, "created_utc": 1492367592.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8gw1o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 30, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MarduRusher", "parent_id": "t3_656rwd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think there is a stigma, but there are a few reasons they might not be used as much in the west.\n\n1.
