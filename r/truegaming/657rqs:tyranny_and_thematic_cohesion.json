So it&amp;#39;s no surprise that I really enjoyed tyranny. But, I also remember really disliking pillars of eternity, and so I tried to figure out why. And this also required me looking back at other games I really enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I found out is that Tyranny, unlike pillars of eternity, has many more unifying themes and elements. Even though it has less fleshed out lore, everything in the game serves some sort of purpose, nothing is put in the game just because it seems cool or would make the game more marketable. The features of Tyranny may be cool and marketable, but they also serve to further narratives and themes in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, tyranny has a very large theme of language creating power, but also tries to show how the flexibility of language can undermine that power. And so, tyranny&amp;#39;s magic system has pre-determined core effects that correspond to symbols, but in order to turn them into spells you need to use expressions that modify how the spell is cast. This makes sense thematically, since magic in the game is itself closely related to language. There are other examples of this, like how powerful weapons in the game get stronger the more famous the weapons get. This makes sense, because the meaning of a symbol is of course determined by how people think about it and talk about it.  It&amp;#39;s not particularly deep, but everything in the game seems to be deliberately put in to service greater themes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas in pillars of eternity, the lore is incredibly expansive and the world is massive, but this makes the game feel thematically empty. It seems to have so much going on that it feels like it says nothing. The world is built well, but the features of the world seem to be put in for no reason other than the fact that they seemed interesting. In moderate use, that&amp;#39;s fine, but in such profusion that type of design philosophy undermines the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also true of other games I really didn&amp;#39;t enjoy, like skyrim. Skyrim can be fun sometimes, but it just feels so empty. It doesn&amp;#39;t say anything because it just seems to pack its world with things that seem cool and interesting, without really paying attention to what those things say. Now, morrowind isn&amp;#39;t perfect at this, but I think it was better - things like the progression system and the more free-form quest system served the mysterious lore. The lore in morrowind and in the elder scrolls in general is mysterious, sometimes contradictory, and hard to decipher. This was also reinforced by the mystical, somewhat whimsical environment of morrowind as well. These things overall served the themes of the interaction and clash between super-natural and natural elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to spin this a bit bigger - I think games in general have this problem where developers will try to put in &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; they think sounds interesting and can fit in with a time and money budget.  When I look at games that a like such as: the stanely parable, antichamber, undertale, fallout 1,2 &amp;amp; NV, transistor &amp;amp; bastion and deus ex, they all share the trait that most of the features of the games serve to further develop important themes and reinforce certain motifs. This is also true of games with more sparse narratives, like shovel knight, banjo kazooie, street fighter, TF2. While it may be easier to do so in games with sparse narratives, the small details start to matter more and more with sparser narratives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some difficulty here, because at some level the thematic cohesion in a game is more due to the player viewpoint than the the developers design. That said, I think that there are lots of cases where it&amp;#39;s obvious that the developers weren&amp;#39;t thinking about the overall themes of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So lastly, let me kick-start some discussion. First off, do you agree with the idea that games have a cohesion problem? Why or why not? How much impact do you think the large sizes of development teams has on thematic cohesion? Do auteurs develop more cohesive games? How can large studios create games with more developed themes, or are certain games doomed to say nothing from the start?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm a fan of RPG's, especially cRPG's, and I'm also a big fan of obsidian.
