So in GvG we would all go to the guild hall on our classes that we were playing, make a party and start a match. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As such, there wasn&amp;#39;t really a huge complaining about not playing the meta, since (At least the levels I played at) if you weren&amp;#39;t playing what was best for the strategy you were trying to do, the match wouldn&amp;#39;t start and you&amp;#39;d probably get replaced if you were being too much of a pain about it. I imagine in lower levels guilds just kinda let people play whatever the hell they wanted, as long as it was within the role they were supposed to be doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Actually, I do remember having a ranger in my guild getting kicked during a period where they weren&amp;#39;t very good. He was fantastic as ranger, and refused to play anything else, but the meta had shifted away from splitting with them and usually ran an ele/mesmer mix for the midline instead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would agree with you that the previous concept of maining, and the new version are quite different these days - I just don&amp;#39;t really think the concept of it came around from League/DoTA when people have been maining single character well before then. It just wasn&amp;#39;t an -issue- until recently. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "truegaming", "name": "t1_dg522yy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491979500.0, "created_utc": 1491950700.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg51qxa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bvanplays", "parent_id": "t1_dg515vv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's fair then.

There are &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; heros and &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; ones, with the whole &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot; concept that came out just several years ago and almost all competitive games seem to revolve around these days, as if its some impossible task for some reason to actually make a game where every hero is as useful as the next. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;#39;t in the &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;, well you are wasting your time and your teams time basically, which is a shame because maybe you like playing that hero for any number of reasons. Its almost laughable to think you can&amp;#39;t play a character in a video game because of its perceived usefulness. Its just a video game. However, because of eSports culture and every game having a ladder and ranked mode, everyone and their mother thinks they are the next eSports star if only they didn&amp;#39;t get unlucky and &amp;quot;always gets shit teammates&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe there always was a &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;, even in games like the original team fortress or Smash on N64, or any other game where you pick from a variety of classes or heroes. The difference was however, 10+ years ago not as many people cared and just played for fun. Or even if they did care, no one else really did or they just assumed people were bad at playing that character/that character was deemed harder to play since it was harder to do well with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "truegaming", "name": "t1_dg5te5b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492030440.0, "created_utc": 1492001640.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5aqzc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MikaMania", "parent_id": "t1_dg57p4y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can tell you why.
