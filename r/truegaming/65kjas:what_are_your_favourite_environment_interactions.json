Nah, just kiddin.'\"  Also, if you start smashing the environment with no enemies around, he goes \"the kid just rages for a while.\"\n\n\nThe reason Bastion is great is not just because the narrator is great (he is), but because it incorporates him into the world and story well.\n\nI also have a funny one: the **Prince of Persia** game is centered around the ability to turn back time, ultimately rendering mistakes irrelevant.  At one point, I had jumped over a spike pit, but my companion had failed the jump and fallen in.  This led to a kind of hilarious moment where I was minding my own business bantering with her, then seconds later it just suddenly cuts to a view of her corpse in a pit of spikes.  Anyway, it turns out between her jumping into the spikes and actually landing and dying, I hit a save point.  When the companion dies, you fail and it jumps back to the previous save point, but in my case this was an infinite loop of returning to the moment where she jumps to her death over and over again.   It was an unintended but narratively amusing event where I had omnipotent power to go back and fix everything yet in the end, I, the player, was trapped a in time loop.\n\nEdit: one more: everything about **ABZU**.
