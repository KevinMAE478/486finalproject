It's still early in the year, but I'm reasonably confident that it'll be my GOTY.

This comment is going to be spoiler free.\n\nWall of text incoming:\n\n* The voice acting is piss poor. Sorry guys, but the only character with good voice acting is Rivaldi. Both Zelda and Mipha are monotone, and Daruk's timing is bizarre. Others are pretty easy to forget.\n\n* The writing for the voiced segments is kind of poor. The monologs after beating every divine beast aren't great, and they always have a segment where the champion talks about how they're ready to take down Ganon. It's like, \"yeah, I don't need you to say that. There's already a laser coming out of your beast!\"\n\n* I know there were some complaints about there being stretches of land without combat or significant structures, but I think that it provides a valuable cooling off period for the player. \n\n* Every location that you feel might have something significant on/in/nearby and are compelled to explore ultimately does have something for you in the form of a korok seed or chest.\n\n* I would've liked more types of enemies. For the most part, there are three types of enemies with increasing difficulties based on their colors. There are others, like Chus, but they are few and far between, and they're mostly just nuisances rather than something to seriously fight.\n\n* Lynels take entirely too long to beat. Even with some of the strongest weapons in the game by the time I got to Hyrule Castle and getting every possible flurry attack, it still took an obscene amount of time. Nintendo really took the sponge approach on increasing difficulty. The problem is, of course, that this doesn't actually increase difficulty, just the required time investment.\n\n* The final boss is shit, to be totally blunt. It boils down to \"shoot the glowing weak spot and don't stand directly in front of the boss,\" and was ultimately the worst fight of the entire game, period. My first fight with the first trash mob of the game was more exciting.\n\n* Cooking was tedious: enter menu, navigate to food category, press X to hold, stack five items, exit menu, place in pot, listen to jingle, hit skip, still put up with a 1 second black load screen, repeat ad nauseam until inventory is full. Why can't I just make food in batches? I'm going to be making 10 of the same item anyway.\n\n* Similarly, upgrading armor was annoying. Let me upgrade multiple pieces at once. No, I don't want to watch the fairy blow kisses, thank you.\n\n* Side quests (not shrine quests) are more or less worthless. They're either too trivial or the rewards aren't worth the effort. The only one that was interesting enough to keep me entertained was Tarry Town.\n\n* The easter eggs, though minor, are pretty good. It's always nice to recognize a nod to specific games and people.\n\n* People treating you differently based on clothing is a novel and mildly amusing concept.\n\n* I wish shrines were more integrated into the world. They felt like I was in a very distinct place every time I went into one. I can't help but be reminded of the \"secret\" areas in Super Mario Sunshine. Ultimately, I found the best shrines to be the ones which require puzzle solving in the overworld rather than in the shrines themselves.\n\n* I liked the taming mechanics, but horses didn't feel useful enough. The fact that they're left behind when teleporting and the absence of a magic whistle meant that for the vast majority of the game I was running, gliding, or riding a shield across fields rather than riding my horse like I should've been.\n\n* I wish the dragons did more. The first encounter with the first dragon you find is incredible. The change in music and the way it flies around have a magical quality. Unfortunately, it doesn't interact with the player at all, and is essentially an item farm. Their charm wears off very quickly.\n\n* Weapon durability **sucks**.

Ultimately, I found the best shrines to be the ones which require puzzle solving in the overworld rather than in the shrines themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I liked the taming mechanics, but horses didn&amp;#39;t feel useful enough. The fact that they&amp;#39;re left behind when teleporting and the absence of a magic whistle meant that for the vast majority of the game I was running, gliding, or riding a shield across fields rather than riding my horse like I should&amp;#39;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish the dragons did more. The first encounter with the first dragon you find is incredible. The change in music and the way it flies around have a magical quality. Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#39;t interact with the player at all, and is essentially an item farm. Their charm wears off very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weapon durability &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;. I just ended up hoarding my best weapons and I think I might&amp;#39;ve used two of the 12 for the final boss fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "truegaming", "name": "t1_dg5l3r3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492008986.0, "created_utc": 1491980186.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pevs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pevs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pevs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pevs", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5uvg7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SuperNanoCat", "parent_id": "t1_dg4u0o8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/truegaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think having an animation would be the best solution.

It certainly adds a lot of replayability;\n\n- Visuals: This game is the ultimate proof for me that state of the art graphics are not what is needed to make a beautiful game. Really, I just can't think of a game that has a world so alive and well cared like the one in BOTW. The details you see when is raining, when is night, when is snowing etc makes everything refreshing.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n- Weapon durability: I know that the intention here was to make the players experiment all the different kind of weapons. But making all of them breaking so fast is really a chore after some time. Hell, even the Master Sword, the sword that will banish all evil, breaks very quickly. It surprised me that it didn't break the moment that Link got it. Anyway, I think that a repair system or something of the kind would work well here.\n\n- Dungeons: At first, I thought that the twist of making the Divine Beasts being the dungeons was very welcome. But after some thought, I just realized that the Divine Beasts were just bigger versions of the shrines. And worst, if you place the shrines and Divine Beasts side by side, all you have is physics puzzles all around. By the first 10 or so hours it feels refreshing, but after that it starts to become a chore. I really missed the classic dungeons with different items and such.\n\n- Bosses: Maybe the biggest disappointment for me. When I first found the Cyclops one (forgot his name), I just thought: \"I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE OTHER ONES AROUND THE WORLD\".

It certainly adds a lot of replayability;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visuals: This game is the ultimate proof for me that state of the art graphics are not what is needed to make a beautiful game. Really, I just can&amp;#39;t think of a game that has a world so alive and well cared like the one in BOTW. The details you see when is raining, when is night, when is snowing etc makes everything refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;#39;t like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weapon durability: I know that the intention here was to make the players experiment all the different kind of weapons. But making all of them breaking so fast is really a chore after some time. Hell, even the Master Sword, the sword that will banish all evil, breaks very quickly. It surprised me that it didn&amp;#39;t break the moment that Link got it. Anyway, I think that a repair system or something of the kind would work well here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dungeons: At first, I thought that the twist of making the Divine Beasts being the dungeons was very welcome. But after some thought, I just realized that the Divine Beasts were just bigger versions of the shrines. And worst, if you place the shrines and Divine Beasts side by side, all you have is physics puzzles all around. By the first 10 or so hours it feels refreshing, but after that it starts to become a chore. I really missed the classic dungeons with different items and such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosses: Maybe the biggest disappointment for me. When I first found the Cyclops one (forgot his name), I just thought: &amp;quot;I CAN&amp;#39;T WAIT TO SEE THE OTHER ONES AROUND THE WORLD&amp;quot;. And then as I explored I found another boss...the same cyclops with a different color. And then another. And then another. Eventually I found the big rocky one and that was it.
