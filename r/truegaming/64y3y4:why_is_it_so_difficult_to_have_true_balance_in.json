All that said, something that continues to bother me is the idea of the &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tier lists&amp;quot; for heroes/champions/classes, etc. in class-based games. It is something that has arguably always been around, even as far back as the original fighting games on SNES and SEGA genesis. But the difference between now and then is the formulation and popularity of eSports, and the visibility of someone&amp;#39;s gaming in the form of streaming on twitch and youtube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, its not as if everyone was ignorant to the fact that some classes were better than others, but the attitude of someone playing the &amp;quot;lesser&amp;quot; characters was dramatically different. Instead of seeing those lesser characters as useless, they were usually deemed more difficult to play, as if people gave the developers the benefit of the doubt. Now adays, in MOBAs especially but also in games like Overwatch and For Honor, there are your good characters, your situational characers, and then there are the untouchables. Playing an untouchable is basically heresy and will be met with vitriol and caustic behavior from your teammates. How dare you play this useless characters, all you are doing is bringing the team down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now there are a few things wrong with this attitude, but besides talking about the ones that people always seem to talk about on here and other message boards, lets talk about the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it so difficult to make every class useful in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets compare competitive class based games with something else that is &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; based outside of gaming. How about baseball? In baseball you have offensive and defensive characters, much like in Overwatch.  Unlike Overwatch however, in baseball everyone is both an offensive and defensive character, the difference is that they are capable of playing both sides regardless of their role. The second point to touch on is that in baseball, every role is useful/needed. And even if someone has already taken your role, outside of the pitcher and the catcher, anyone else could really take on the role of anyone else; because in the end you are attempting to catch the ball and chances are you have to throw the ball, the difference is just your placement on the field. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then maybe we start to think, is the problem the way in which gameplay is developed in these games? Is it in the characters themselves? Maybe its a little bit of both. Rocket League is a perfect example of a very popular game that gets around both of these problems, because it models itself off of a sport, instead of a traditional video game. In rocket league, there are not classes, but rather roles you play -- just like in baseball. Every car is as fast as another, and besides slight differences in the shape of their car build, they are the same. The main difference is the game is about positioning and timing, and on overall level its just about skill. Because no playable character or entity in the game is better or worse than one another, everyone is on an equal level playing field -- the only thing that separates them, is each others skill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t want every game to be like rocket league, right? Isn&amp;#39;t what makes Overwatch and LoL/DotA and For Honor so appealing is that who you choose to play is different in terms of what they can do and how they play? Of course it is. But what troubles me is how these characters and classes are designed. I really think its a lack of imagination to say that torbjorn from overwatch, can&amp;#39;t be as useful as Soldier 76. Everyone says &amp;quot;well its because of how their kits work inherently&amp;quot;. Then why not change how torbs kit works so he can be versatile like soldier 76? Keep the &amp;quot;essence&amp;quot; of the character, which for torb is that he lays turrets and gives out armor, but make changes to what he does so that he can be useful in any situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe its easier said than done, or maybe its by design. Perhaps classes and heroes are made the way they are with the intention to have a tiered system. Give casual/not technically skilled people a set of characters they can play, give regular people a set they can play, give wannabe eSports players and true eSports players a set they can play. That seems to be the underlying philosophy to class design these days, but I&amp;#39;d argue in the overall scheme of things, its not the best one. With more careful design, I think developers could make a game like Overwatch or LoL or DOTA where everyone is easy to play, but difficult to master, and most importantly -- useful. It just might take a little more time, effort, and imagination to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Edit: Sorry most of my replies aren't under the corresponding post, I was on my phone and didn't realize it was doing this I will attempt to fix them.\n\nThis discussion question came to fruition after reading the thread on the \"trend of mains in multiplayer games\".\n\nLike many of you, I'm in my 30s and have gamed for most my life blah blah etc. etc. so we all know what took place in the past and what takes place now.

It's one of the main reasons why Dota is able to have so much more of its character roster viable than League or Overwatch percentage-wise.\n\nFor example, mobility is usually a high value feature of a character. In League, pretty much every viable character has some form of mobility built into their moveset (outside of supports and even then...). This basically automatically makes characters without mobility in their moves worse. You could try to balance them with more damage, but you can already buy damage items so it's much better to just augment damage and have mobility because the alternative is not available.\n\nDota on the other hand has mobility items that *do* augment the character's movement in significant ways. This opens up the possibility of having characters who are not mobile, but have great attacks and makes them viable. In addition to allowing this strategy, it allows additional strategies by choosing those characters, creating the threat of buying the mobility items, and then veering off in a different direction. Every additional strategy becomes multiple strategies because now you can bluff too.\n\nSo in the case of balance in general around most games, they just aren't going to be complex enough to support a huge cast while keeping them all viable unless they are only marginally different in superfluous ways. Look at MMOs for good examples. WoW has gotten more homogenous as they've started sharing more buffs. All melee DPS is basically the same, all ranged DPS, etc. The only reason to choose a mage over a hunter is for specific class differences that are really only superfluous (buffs, debuffs, etc.). If you look at Guild Wars 2, it becomes even more obvious that giving every class everything means nobody cares about anything.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it so difficult to make every class useful in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another factor that you left out is that the game itself must be complex enough to have a variety of different attributes be useful. It&amp;#39;s one of the main reasons why Dota is able to have so much more of its character roster viable than League or Overwatch percentage-wise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, mobility is usually a high value feature of a character. In League, pretty much every viable character has some form of mobility built into their moveset (outside of supports and even then...). This basically automatically makes characters without mobility in their moves worse. You could try to balance them with more damage, but you can already buy damage items so it&amp;#39;s much better to just augment damage and have mobility because the alternative is not available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dota on the other hand has mobility items that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; augment the character&amp;#39;s movement in significant ways. This opens up the possibility of having characters who are not mobile, but have great attacks and makes them viable. In addition to allowing this strategy, it allows additional strategies by choosing those characters, creating the threat of buying the mobility items, and then veering off in a different direction. Every additional strategy becomes multiple strategies because now you can bluff too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the case of balance in general around most games, they just aren&amp;#39;t going to be complex enough to support a huge cast while keeping them all viable unless they are only marginally different in superfluous ways.

The point of balance isn't to make things fair, it's to make things interesting.\n\nTechnically speaking having just one overpowered character is perfectly balanced. Everyone picks that character and no one has an advantage over the other. The original Street Fighter behaves like this. It was boring. What makes things interesting is variety. The mix of characters, the clash of ideas, these are what keep an audience engaged, not a \"fair fight\".\n\nThis is where the true difficulty of balance lies. When creating an asymmetric cast the goal then is to find a nice curve where people feel rewarded for their efforts. That curve is different for everyone among a myriad of different axis. It changes based on skill, personality, mood both personal and within the public.

The point of balance isn&amp;#39;t to make things fair, it&amp;#39;s to make things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking having just one overpowered character is perfectly balanced. Everyone picks that character and no one has an advantage over the other. The original Street Fighter behaves like this. It was boring. What makes things interesting is variety. The mix of characters, the clash of ideas, these are what keep an audience engaged, not a &amp;quot;fair fight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where the true difficulty of balance lies. When creating an asymmetric cast the goal then is to find a nice curve where people feel rewarded for their efforts. That curve is different for everyone among a myriad of different axis. It changes based on skill, personality, mood both personal and within the public.
