The same question pops up in games like Dungeons and Dragons, which heavily emphasize XP gain to level up, and it becomes an issue when, say, a player can't show up one week but the rest of the players want to continue without them. It feels wrong to give the one player XP even though he didn't actually show up or participate. But if you don't, then that player is now less powerful than the rest, meaning either the gm has to tailor challenges to that player and make things super easy for everyone else or tailor to the rest of the players and leave that player feel useless as they struggle to contribute to a challenge above their level.\n\nHere's how I've considered tackling this, but bear in mind that I haven't been able to field test this yet: First, decide what gameplay mechanics you want to base your game around. It doesn't have to be combat or even one thing only, but you need to identify what these are so you know what challenges your players are going to overcome. \n\nSecond, give every character/class a niche, one of those obstacles that only that character/class can overcome and that, without someone to overcome, the party is fairly heavily hampered in achieving the level's overall goal or even totally blocked off if the level is optional. So, for example, in a cyberpunk game, you can beat the level without a hacker, but that means you have to find some other way to disable the automated turrets which will definitely eat up more health or other resources than if you had a hacker who could just make it go away. In this scenario, you would still need your hacker to be of a certain skill level to overcome the challenge, but since the challenge is specific to hackers, even a low-level hacker is better than no hacker at all. \n\nLastly, for when you want to use a character who fills the same niche as another but is a lower level, I would implement some kind of team-up mechanic where two players that fill the same niche can work together to overcome challenges that neither could overcome on their own.\n\nI'd cap all of that off with a basic rubber-banding mechanic that rewards characters that participate in missions above their level with bonus XP so they can more easily get to the same level as the rest of the party.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe not what you were asking about, but I&amp;#39;ve been pondering this question with regard to tabletop RPGs.
