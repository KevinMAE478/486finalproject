Starting in 2008, there was a massive crackdown on people who weren't filing their FBARs (something you're supposed to file to tell the US govt that you have foreign accounts).

But it required you to admit wrongdoing. It was not terribly popular, because of the penalties, and the record it left.\n\nBy the time I, in 2012, found out about it, and realized that in my years living abroad, I was supposed to be filing FBARs, even though I filed my taxes every year, showing all my income, which was foreign, and obviously not in a US bank (I thought I didn't need to file it, because it's all the same money\u2014different department, it turns out), there was a third way: General amnesty for all the middle-class expat nitwits who hadn't been filing. Just give us the last few years' numbers and a letter saying, \"Sorry; I'm a nitwit,\" and we're good.\n\nHell, they even let you file the last 3 years of taxes if you hadn't been filing, like a bigger nitwit friend of mine. \n\nI was initially so scared about this, though, that I stopped eating and lost a ton of weight, because I thought I was looking at being completely wiped out of the savings I'd worked so hard to build up... That I would have been safer if I'd just spent all my money on hookers and blow. But then I talked to three different tax lawyers, and all of them were like, \"No way. They just want the data. They aren't looking for you.

The only people who get swept up in crackdowns on evasion are people who don't have enough money to have a team of accountants and lawyers that keep them out of trouble, and many of them aren't even aware that they are breaking the law.\n\nFinally, I have to point something out, because whenever I explain this, people are all, \"You had secret offshore money!!! You owe taxes!!!\" No, I don't, any more than you do on your bank balance.
