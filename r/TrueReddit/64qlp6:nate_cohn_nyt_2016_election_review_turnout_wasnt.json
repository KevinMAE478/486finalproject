It\u2019s been trending this way for a while, but this was a pretty stark split. And that\u2019s a big part of why Clinton\u2019s gains among well-educated whites didn\u2019t pay off as much in the battleground states, even as she ran up the score in coastal states like Washington State, California and Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but these gains were off set by her poor showing with white working class voters who switched to Trump in large numbers or voted for third parties, it is also stressed that Jill Stein&amp;#39;s green party candidacy doesn&amp;#39;t cover the loss of Clinton in key sates and she may still have lost if Stein didn&amp;#39;t run. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over all, almost one in four of President Obama\u2019s 2012 white working-class supporters defected from the Democrats in 2016, either supporting Mr. Trump or voting for a third-party candidate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to at least partially settle the post election debate over whether the Clinton defeat was due to poor turn out or the desertion of large numbers of working class whites who had previously voted for Obama  to the Republicans and  Trump. It makes me think of the famous Chuck Schumer quote about Democratic party stratergy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "name": "t1_dg47r1l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491944441.0, "created_utc": 1491915641.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qyt6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qlp6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gp0g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anonanon1313", "parent_id": "t3_64qlp6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Makes sense in that in a populace with high dissatisfaction with the status quo in both elections, the \"change\" candidate got a bump, Obama in 2008, Trump in 2016.
