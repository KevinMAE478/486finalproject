However, there are ways to handle this. A long-term solution championed by some researchers is to make \"bodies-on-a-chip\" instead of \"organs-on-a-chip,\" where some or all of the important human organs are represented experimentally. This is barely feasible at the moment, but it's important to note that for most drugs, there are only four organs that typically matter: the heart, the liver, the intestine, and the organ targetted by the drug. The heart and liver matter because they are the major sites of toxicity for most drugs. The intestine and liver matter because they're the limiting factors for the absorption and metabolism of most drug.\n\nAn easier, less complete solution is to bathe the engineered tissues in human serum, ideally matched to the donors who provided the cells. The various organs of the human body \"communicate\" with one another primarily through the blood, and using human serum is a way to mimic the signals provided by distant organs. What's great about using minimal tissues is that you don't need to feed them very much serum - it's entirely reasonable to set up experiments where less than several hundred microliters of serum are required, in comparison to the tens or hundreds of milliliters produced from a single blood draw. The big limitation here is the absence of feedback between the drugged tissue and the rest of the body.\n\nWhen it comes to simulations, I think their greatest value is looking at the specific aspects of biology that are very well-understood, like the binding affinity of a drug to specific proteins with known crystal structures.

However, there are ways to handle this. A long-term solution championed by some researchers is to make &amp;quot;bodies-on-a-chip&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;organs-on-a-chip,&amp;quot; where some or all of the important human organs are represented experimentally. This is barely feasible at the moment, but it&amp;#39;s important to note that for most drugs, there are only four organs that typically matter: the heart, the liver, the intestine, and the organ targetted by the drug. The heart and liver matter because they are the major sites of toxicity for most drugs. The intestine and liver matter because they&amp;#39;re the limiting factors for the absorption and metabolism of most drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An easier, less complete solution is to bathe the engineered tissues in human serum, ideally matched to the donors who provided the cells. The various organs of the human body &amp;quot;communicate&amp;quot; with one another primarily through the blood, and using human serum is a way to mimic the signals provided by distant organs. What&amp;#39;s great about using minimal tissues is that you don&amp;#39;t need to feed them very much serum - it&amp;#39;s entirely reasonable to set up experiments where less than several hundred microliters of serum are required, in comparison to the tens or hundreds of milliliters produced from a single blood draw. The big limitation here is the absence of feedback between the drugged tissue and the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to simulations, I think their greatest value is looking at the specific aspects of biology that are very well-understood, like the binding affinity of a drug to specific proteins with known crystal structures. That&amp;#39;s valuable information for lead validation, and while it&amp;#39;s much less complete information than you&amp;#39;d get using a mouse or engineered tissue, it&amp;#39;s much faster and a massive number of simulations can be done in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "name": "t1_dgdy3se", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484831.0, "created_utc": 1492456031.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcg3ai", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "interestme1", "parent_id": "t1_dgce3xb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; In my opinion, the correct answer is human tissue engineering.\n\nThis is interesting, however don't you still have the parameter problem?
