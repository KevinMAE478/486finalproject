Actually, every new luxury condo that goes up deprives the vast majority of working stiffs of an affordable smaller scaled building that could&amp;#39;ve been there - six stories instead of twelve, a shared driveway and small front yards instead of something called &amp;quot;a communal green space&amp;quot; that looks like a grass square behind a commercial skyscraper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe the City needs to or should be larger than 9 million people, accounting for birth rates, death rates, and people who move away.

Like everything they&amp;#39;re subject to numerous factors, and have gone up pretty high, then fallen, then rise, then leveled off. Tokyo is a very different beast from Chicago. There are also a lot of wards in Tokyo where current residents strongly advocate their quality of life not suffer due to rampant over-building, and the City in many cases tries to address and respect that legitimate concern as much as possible. It&amp;#39;s not all skyscrapers - look at &lt;a href=\"https://encrypted.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=611&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;q=Tomigaya+houses&amp;amp;oq=Tomigaya+houses&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3...7081.7559.0.7687.6.5.0.1.1.0.125.488.3j2.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.96...0i24k1.Mx7p42PjvFQ#imgrc=FA1wxdyhhng_EM:\"&gt;Tomigaya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://marketurbanism.com/2012/06/28/tokyos-surprising-lack-of-density/\"&gt;outsiders love to tell the people there they need to embrace density even more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pile of sand metaphor is clever, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t argue that veto powers from &amp;quot;hyper local&amp;quot; (wtf does that mean? I live somewhere all my years, and care passionately about it, I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;hyper local&amp;quot;?) should be stripped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather, you have CB meetings, you try to ensure current residents are satisfied, but that their voice isn&amp;#39;t the only one that dominates decision-making. For ex here in NYC CB (outside of supremely wealthy enclaves) don&amp;#39;t get much say, the City can already do whatever it pleases without regard for current residents. And that leads to a lot of unwelcome changes. &lt;strong&gt;The relentless hype for housing and progress leads to sterile prison-cities with perfunctory parks, no street culture, no real diversity, no grit - just rows of glass pencils and chain-stores.&lt;/strong&gt; (Isn&amp;#39;t that the criticism leveraged at suburbs!?) Renovating and retro-fitting and in-filling AND preservation do far more good to keep people where they are, while still allowing some influx of newcomers, than simply the raze, raze, raze and rebuild it-higher mentality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "name": "t1_dg4on1p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491964102.0, "created_utc": 1491935302.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4behp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Varnu", "parent_id": "t1_dg48fxj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Where I live in Chicago, there's a few in-demand neighborhoods near the lake.

This behavior is undertaken, with eminent sincerity, in an effort to confront the abundant racial inequality in contemporary America. But like so much else in our society, the practice has ultimately worked not to undermine structural racism \u2014 the putative aim \u2014 but merely to deepen the self-regard of the educated white elite.\n\nThis article is very much a piece with that.
