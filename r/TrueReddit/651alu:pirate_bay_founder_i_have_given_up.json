Better known as the Decolonize Movement, the Commune in oakland was an excellent example of autonomous commons that came up through anarchist organizing and bloomed into a large, organic network of many radicals all over oakland. It achieved resistance through the spontaneous communization of resources and space, and the autonomy of the people and communities in the commons to engage as they saw fit and as the whole commons needed them to. It was wildly successful, but as we know, did not survive the militarized response from the police. However, its spirit achieved the beginning vision of what the commons would look like on a macro scale for many in the community.\n\nIt has been said by many present that the believed threat was A) the ability of the community to provide for all its material needs without outside intervention, including defense, food, sleep, medicine, etc. B) the autonomous nature of the space which allowed for real dismantling of power and administration, and thus, the organic organization of spontaneity, which filled all gaps when they appeared without defined authority C) through the dismantling of power, the ability to confront, deconstruct, and heal from social oppression, and the natural rejection of authoritarian types. It was the success of these things, and the inability for the infiltrators to undo that autonomy, that likely lead to the militarized response.\n\nAnother example I like to look to is the Oceti Sakowin resistance camp in North Dakota. This also was unable to survive militarization, but it brought forward a different type of autonomous space: although there were community agreements and systems of organization, this too was driven by both freedom of association and ownership by the community. Any leaders, which exist in those communities (as councils, elders, etc), are afforded respect and positions of leadership through their actions and the consent of their people. All things that happened in camp happened through the Lakota cultural principles of Generosity (and other principles), which essentially models communism for us. Lakota principles are basically \"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need\" style. No one owns land, property, or space - thus, no one is unhoused. No one owns food, water, or medicine - thus no one goes hungry or sick. But all are expected to give as much as they can, and thus the environment builds itself in abundance.\n\nThere is also the question in those communities of cultural healing, which carries the confrontation of racial, gendered, and ability-based violences. People are expected to reconnect with their traditional ways, which necessitate respect for all, and reparations for violence against fellow community members.\n\nBoth of these camps embody excellent principles of communism/the commons/autonomy. The question becomes, for me, how do we transcend militarization and the territories they set?\n\nThe idea post-dispersal of the Oceti Sakowin camp is that the fire was lit in the hearts of all, and carrying those Lakota principles and the resistance to all corners of the world is the next step. The hope is that this revival of communal spirit will spread, and thus negate capitalism in time. \n\nBut how do we spread communal spirit, but through experiencing and embracing it on a personal level? These camps function as gateways to communism in that sense, but they have limited exposure. But I ultimately think that the transformation of humanity culturally toward autonomous, communal principles is ideal. It's just a matter of HOW, and what to do about militarized reterritorialization etc. Or how to create a movement so enormous that reterritorialization becomes ineffectual.\n\nEDIT: also, wanted to say, someone I know was telling me that Rojava had a very good reorganization method for growing autonomist cultural practice within their populace that was very effective. It might be worth looking into that!\n\nThese are my instant, \"can write in under 20 min\" thoughts lol. I think, for what it's worth, that we are on our way there... It is said that most young people these days are much more sympathetic to \"communism\" or at the very least, equitable societies than previous generations.

Lakota principles are basically &amp;quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need&amp;quot; style. No one owns land, property, or space - thus, no one is unhoused. No one owns food, water, or medicine - thus no one goes hungry or sick. But all are expected to give as much as they can, and thus the environment builds itself in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also the question in those communities of cultural healing, which carries the confrontation of racial, gendered, and ability-based violences. People are expected to reconnect with their traditional ways, which necessitate respect for all, and reparations for violence against fellow community members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these camps embody excellent principles of communism/the commons/autonomy. The question becomes, for me, how do we transcend militarization and the territories they set?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea post-dispersal of the Oceti Sakowin camp is that the fire was lit in the hearts of all, and carrying those Lakota principles and the resistance to all corners of the world is the next step. The hope is that this revival of communal spirit will spread, and thus negate capitalism in time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how do we spread communal spirit, but through experiencing and embracing it on a personal level? These camps function as gateways to communism in that sense, but they have limited exposure. But I ultimately think that the transformation of humanity culturally toward autonomous, communal principles is ideal. It&amp;#39;s just a matter of HOW, and what to do about militarized reterritorialization etc. Or how to create a movement so enormous that reterritorialization becomes ineffectual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: also, wanted to say, someone I know was telling me that Rojava had a very good reorganization method for growing autonomist cultural practice within their populace that was very effective. It might be worth looking into that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are my instant, &amp;quot;can write in under 20 min&amp;quot; thoughts lol. I think, for what it&amp;#39;s worth, that we are on our way there... It is said that most young people these days are much more sympathetic to &amp;quot;communism&amp;quot; or at the very least, equitable societies than previous generations. In part because capitalism is in SUCH CRISIS that we can&amp;#39;t really ignore it.

Both sexes together do not form a whole since something is irretrievably lost in the very division of sexes. We can even say that, in making the choice, I assume the loss of what the other sex doesn\u2019t have, i.e., I have to renounce the illusion that the Other has that X which would fill in my lack. And one can well guess that transgenderism is ultimately an attempt to avoid (the anxiety of) castration: thanks to it, a flat space is created in which the multiple choices that I can make do not bear the mark of castration. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or his racist garbage:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we encounter here the old paradox: the more marginal and excluded one is, the more one is allowed to assert one\u2019s ethnic identity and exclusive way of life. This is how the politically correct landscape is structured. People far from the Western world are allowed to fully assert their particular ethnic identity without being proclaimed essentialist racist identitarians (native Americans, blacks\u2026). The closer one gets to the notorious white heterosexual males, the more problematic this assertion is: Asians are still OK; Italians and Irish \u2013 maybe; with Germans and Scandinavians it is already problematic\u2026 &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be a few things in there you could say are somewhat reasonable, if fundamentally flawed... but so much of it so deeply offensive, misogynist, transmisogynist, racist, and reductionist towards the very brilliant, important work of actually queer (and poc) theorists. He&amp;#39;s disguising very heinous bigotry against these groups of people, and denial of their own stated experiences and complete theories, within a theory that quite honestly chops and screws so much contradictory comparison into a narrative that suits his ideology but that does not stand up to reality.
