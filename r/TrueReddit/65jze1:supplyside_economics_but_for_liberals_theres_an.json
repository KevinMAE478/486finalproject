This will tend to contract labor supply (or improve a worker\u2019s bargaining position), putting an upward pressure on the wage. Whether or not wages are increased is an empirical matter: there is evidence that the initial roll-out of the food stamps program across counties in the 1970s lowered work hours, consistent with an increase in the reservation wage. The key point is that it is difficult to imagine how food stamps would lower wages.  And if they don\u2019t lower wages, they can\u2019t be thought of as subsidies to low wage employers. The same logic applies to other means tested programs like energy or housing assistance.

Therefore, SNAP is likely to raise, and not lower a worker\u2019s reservation wages\u2014the fallback position if she loses her job.  This will tend to contract labor supply (or improve a worker\u2019s bargaining position), putting an upward pressure on the wage. Whether or not wages are increased is an empirical matter: there is evidence that the initial roll-out of the food stamps program across counties in the 1970s lowered work hours, consistent with an increase in the reservation wage. The key point is that it is difficult to imagine how food stamps would lower wages.  And if they don\u2019t lower wages, they can\u2019t be thought of as subsidies to low wage employers. The same logic applies to other means tested programs like energy or housing assistance. Moreover, these conclusions hold in a wide array of models of the labor market, including ones that emphasize bargaining or efficiency wage concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://arindube.com/2015/04/19/public-assistance-private-subsidies-and-low-wage-jobs/\"&gt;https://arindube.com/2015/04/19/public-assistance-private-subsidies-and-low-wage-jobs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "name": "t1_dgbe7eg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492330305.0, "created_utc": 1492301505.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb50sg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 188, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_new_west", "parent_id": "t3_65jze1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So wait, if I have a safe place to sleep and an adequate supply of food, then I'm more likely to find and keep a job?
