They really do. They don't make you a better person. They fuck you up.\n\nIt's not that I think that there's anything *philosophically* or *ethically* wrong with poly relationships. It's just that philosophy and ethics have fuck-all do to with mating instinct. The problems with poly relationships are all *practical.*\n\nI'm a liberal, but I'm also a realist. On either end of the liberal-conservative spectrum, you basically find fantasists. Utopians. People who believe that, if we all just change our way of thinking, nature will snap into line with our ideology, and everything will be peachy keen. Check out the history of any communist country for the disaster this leads to, writ large (especially the Great Leap Forward in China). The problem with poly is that we can't change our hardware. We, especially males, seek to control the mating behavior of our mates. We are hardwired for scarcity, and the idea of raising another's offspring is not one we are naturally inclined to. All sorts of things slide when in a time of plenty (and in the developed world, that's why we even have these conversations), but the moment things start getting tough (scarcity in resources, scarcity in mating options), the meat raises its head, and all the intellectual goatee-stroking in the world isn't going to win in the face of millions of years of natural selection.\n\nSo that's why I always react negatively to these things. They are fantasies that look like they work for a brief time, during which people enjoying them write articles and blog posts, and then they come crashing down with much pain and legal fallout, but to write an article about how poly fucked up your life is just not going to play with the audience who read the first one. You'll lose friends.

It destroys relationships the moment one of them either tires of it or simply isn&amp;#39;t keeping up. I&amp;#39;ve watched it happen in my friend group many times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Divorce and breakups suck, guys. They really do. They don&amp;#39;t make you a better person. They fuck you up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I think that there&amp;#39;s anything &lt;em&gt;philosophically&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ethically&lt;/em&gt; wrong with poly relationships. It&amp;#39;s just that philosophy and ethics have fuck-all do to with mating instinct. The problems with poly relationships are all &lt;em&gt;practical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a liberal, but I&amp;#39;m also a realist. On either end of the liberal-conservative spectrum, you basically find fantasists. Utopians. People who believe that, if we all just change our way of thinking, nature will snap into line with our ideology, and everything will be peachy keen. Check out the history of any communist country for the disaster this leads to, writ large (especially the Great Leap Forward in China). The problem with poly is that we can&amp;#39;t change our hardware. We, especially males, seek to control the mating behavior of our mates. We are hardwired for scarcity, and the idea of raising another&amp;#39;s offspring is not one we are naturally inclined to. All sorts of things slide when in a time of plenty (and in the developed world, that&amp;#39;s why we even have these conversations), but the moment things start getting tough (scarcity in resources, scarcity in mating options), the meat raises its head, and all the intellectual goatee-stroking in the world isn&amp;#39;t going to win in the face of millions of years of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s why I always react negatively to these things. They are fantasies that look like they work for a brief time, during which people enjoying them write articles and blog posts, and then they come crashing down with much pain and legal fallout, but to write an article about how poly fucked up your life is just not going to play with the audience who read the first one. You&amp;#39;ll lose friends. You&amp;#39;ll end up having to publish it in &lt;em&gt;Focus on the Family&lt;/em&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The poly lifestyle is a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "name": "t1_dga6pd5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492253768.0, "created_utc": 1492224968.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6m4r8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mastjaso", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ivim", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;if they're lashing out because it's the lifestyle they always wanted but never attained\n\nI think this is a little crass and pessimistic.

I actually don&amp;#39;t know but I DO know that it&amp;#39;s at least possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know how it works, you aren&amp;#39;t going to enlighten me with anything you picked up from some liberal pro-sex blog.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you are seriously mis-characterizing sexover30 as a &amp;quot;liberal pro-sex blog&amp;quot;.

Much like the LGBT folks before they could be out in the open I suspect that a lot of the misery you see is generated because society won&amp;#39;t accept who people are and what they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: We&amp;#39;ve had AMAs with &amp;quot;Bulls&amp;quot; before and their experience didn&amp;#39;t track with yours.

He was lonely and horny, but not ready for another real relationship, and that's what she offered... This is a change of the deal.\n\n2. He is uncomfortable with the gender politics of their relationship. Her husband makes a lot of money. She is highly-educated, a professional, but one working in a capacity that makes very little money. So is she looking for one man to meet her material needs, and another to meet her emotional and sexual desires? As a man, this doesn't sit right with him.\n\n3.
