What are the chances that one political party has somehow correctly identified the best positions on every issue? Given issues A, B, and C, the left says A1, B1, and C1 are best, while the right says A2, B2, and C2 are best. Yet regardless of what these variables represent, would&amp;#39;t it be very coincidental if reality was such that the correct answers were always 1 or always 2?
