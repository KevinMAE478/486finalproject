(Mind you that whilst yourself might have read that, it is important to stress for the comment readers).\n\n\n\n\n&gt;9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. This is only not evident because we are currently not at war. \n\nI think that the definition of war has changed a fair bit, in a way that resembles doublespeak. The USA hasn't been at war since WO2. Whilst its true that pacifist don't get slandered by the governement, there *is* a tendency towards 'others' to shame them for not supporting the US 'war' effort: \"Who is not with us, is against us\" and \"freedom fries\" when the French didn't support the Iraqi intervention. It is true that that hasn't happened under the Trump administration, but the mechanism is tried and tested.\n\n\n\n&gt; 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero, with emphasis on a heroic death. Radical Islam is the best example of this one. \n\nI think that this box is and has been repeatedly checked (in different 'wars' and against different foes by the poweful propaganda-machine know as Hollywood. To be honest, most of this propaganda has the heroes surviving (and therefore not truly glorifieing sacrifice), but secondary characters often get glorified in this way (jumping on a grenade to save friends, for instance). Whist the hero often lives, arguably most of their actions are borderline su\u00efcidal, in that way glorifying self-endangering hero\u00efsm for the 'greater good'. The hero lives because of his American values, as he is a metaphor for the country. But the reality of 'boots on the ground GI's' is vastly different.\n\n\n\n&gt;13. Selective Populism. \"There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\u201d \n\n\n\nI respectfully disagree. The American media are the most finely tuned consent and 'news fatigue' machines out there. To the point where comedians like Colbert and Stewart were often the only truely critical voice in the mediasphere. The saving grace is that Trump is so polarizing that he is not in charge of this machine and that dissenting voices are way more prominent then under previous administrations. Mainly as he has a complete disrespect for the media (like not frequenting the correspondents dinner).\n\n\nOne must, however keep in mind that control of the powerful mediasphere in the USA is *not out of reach* for someone like Trump. Whenever that happens, though, things might go pearshaped very. very quickly. Isolationism is a way this can be archieved and I think that the turmoil Trump manages will quite easily change the global, political field, where long-time allies can be coerced to withdraw support leaving America 'to tend to it's own'. \n\n\nTrump is already downplaying America's role as 'keeper of the global peace' and trying to monitize it's contribution towards the UN. It might not be that Trump is the real fascist we need to look out for. He might just be the fall guy for whomever gets to clean up his mess.

(Mind you that whilst yourself might have read that, it is important to stress for the comment readers).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. This is only not evident because we are currently not at war. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that the definition of war has changed a fair bit, in a way that resembles doublespeak. The USA hasn&amp;#39;t been at war since WO2. Whilst its true that pacifist don&amp;#39;t get slandered by the governement, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tendency towards &amp;#39;others&amp;#39; to shame them for not supporting the US &amp;#39;war&amp;#39; effort: &amp;quot;Who is not with us, is against us&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;freedom fries&amp;quot; when the French didn&amp;#39;t support the Iraqi intervention. It is true that that hasn&amp;#39;t happened under the Trump administration, but the mechanism is tried and tested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everybody is educated to become a hero, with emphasis on a heroic death. Radical Islam is the best example of this one. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that this box is and has been repeatedly checked (in different &amp;#39;wars&amp;#39; and against different foes by the poweful propaganda-machine know as Hollywood. To be honest, most of this propaganda has the heroes surviving (and therefore not truly glorifieing sacrifice), but secondary characters often get glorified in this way (jumping on a grenade to save friends, for instance). Whist the hero often lives, arguably most of their actions are borderline su\u00efcidal, in that way glorifying self-endangering hero\u00efsm for the &amp;#39;greater good&amp;#39;. The hero lives because of his American values, as he is a metaphor for the country. But the reality of &amp;#39;boots on the ground GI&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; is vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Selective Populism. &amp;quot;There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\u201d &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I respectfully disagree. The American media are the most finely tuned consent and &amp;#39;news fatigue&amp;#39; machines out there. To the point where comedians like Colbert and Stewart were often the only truely critical voice in the mediasphere. The saving grace is that Trump is so polarizing that he is not in charge of this machine and that dissenting voices are way more prominent then under previous administrations. Mainly as he has a complete disrespect for the media (like not frequenting the correspondents dinner).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One must, however keep in mind that control of the powerful mediasphere in the USA is &lt;em&gt;not out of reach&lt;/em&gt; for someone like Trump. Whenever that happens, though, things might go pearshaped very. very quickly. Isolationism is a way this can be archieved and I think that the turmoil Trump manages will quite easily change the global, political field, where long-time allies can be coerced to withdraw support leaving America &amp;#39;to tend to it&amp;#39;s own&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump is already downplaying America&amp;#39;s role as &amp;#39;keeper of the global peace&amp;#39; and trying to monitize it&amp;#39;s contribution towards the UN. It might not be that Trump is the real fascist we need to look out for. He might just be the fall guy for whomever gets to clean up his mess.

Cult of tradition - I would say Rojava does not idealise it's tradition. The prominence of feminism and the abolition of Sharia law stand in stark contrast to the area's conservative Islamic and Patriarchal past.\n\n\n2. Rejection of modernism / enlightenment ideals - I would say again, they are against this as they see the [libertarian municipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_municipalism) ideology as the method to fulfill Enlightenment concepts such as equality, fraternity through collectives and direct democracy and liberty through the absence of a centralised government.\n\n3. Irrationalism - Given that the Rojava paradigm was formed through self-criticism of the perceived failure of Marxism-Leninism, I think the opposite might be true, they are basing their revolution on analysis and theory first, although in some ways their hands are forced when it comes to action simply because they have to fight ISIS.\n\n4. Disagreement as treason - [TEVDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_a_Democratic_Society) was designed to be inclusive of other political ideas even whilst the state is formed around the [Communalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communalism) ideal\n\n5. Fear of difference - The [Rojava constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Rojava) enshrines the multiethnic/multicultural nature of the country,  much like their approach to political diversity.\n\n\n\n5. Appeal to a frustrated middle class suffering from debasement, political humiliation, difficult economic circumstances - Rojava probably doesn't fit the standard model for what imagine a society being based on, what little middle class they have at this point probably isn't doing too well given the war. With that being said, the formation of the economy around cooperative economics may create a different structure from what we are used to in terms of working and middle classes. I think it will take more time to see how this plays out.\n\n6. Obsession with a plot, including both the appeal to xenophobia but also the appeal to an enemy from within, whether it is World Jewry or the concept of a New World Order. - Not sure whether this applies.\n\n7. Pushing the idea of the enemies enjoying some ostentatious wealth or great power, simultaneous with the idea the enemy is weak and can be overcome by force - You could make a tenuous argument that they do this with regard to capitalism but I'm not sure.\n\n8. Pacifism as trafficking with the enemy. - They're arguably guilty of this since there has been some conscription of peasants to fight in the militias against ISIS, however given the existential threat to the South it's difficult to come down on them too hard for this.\n\n9. Popular elitism, where the elite are those who are strong and the plebians are the weak. - Since Rojava is designed with egalitarianism in mind I don't think this applies.\n\n10. A hero cult where everyone is educated to become a hero, with emphasis on heroic death. - They are guilty of this, IMO, those who fall in battle against ISIS are viewed as martyrs etc. but then that is also true in our countries' conflicts to an extent.\n\n11. Machismo, contempt for women and nonstandard sexual habits - I don't know how LGBTQ people are treated in Rojava, but their [approach to feminism](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/kurdish-woman-building-feminist-democrac-fighting-isis-at-the-same-time-syria-kurdistan-rojava-new-a7487151.html) is unique in the region. \n\n12. Selective populism, an appeal to the 'voice of the people' where the people are only a certain demographic. - Whilst Rojava rejects parliamentary democracy as we know it, I think in some ways the concept of confederation of small, direct democracies offers a less selective approach. It's populist in that direct democracy is valued above representation, but since decisions are made at the grassroots level it doesn't seem to take the same course as say, populism in the United States.\n\n13. Newspeak, a new sociolect which limits the capability for complex critical reasoning. - Within Communalist thought there's definitely been a creation of a new sociolect with a lot of borrowed terms from leftist theory and analysis generally but I don't believe this is designed to limit dissent as much as conceptualise certain ideas.\n\nJust to be clear I don't intend this to be convincing about Rojava, as I don't want to come across as writing a propaganda piece, and as you can probably tell I am sympathetic to the ideas Rojava is founded on, but I do think it is an interesting example of a society that is being built with anti-fascist ideas incorporated into it's structure, which is pretty interesting IMO.", "edited": 1492023800.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think all liberal democracies as we know them reject some or all of these points to varying degrees but I think they can also be somewhat lame ducks in how they respond to them as they appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m showing my biases here likely but I have been paying attention to the territory of Rojava in norther Syria for a few years and I am interested in the ideology of their &amp;#39;country&amp;#39;, if it can be said to be such (there is no formal state to speak of, by design).\nI&amp;#39;m going to run through the 14 points and see how they relate to the Rojava project:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cult of tradition - I would say Rojava does not idealise it&amp;#39;s tradition.
