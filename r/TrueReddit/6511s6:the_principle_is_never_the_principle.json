Class is neither race, nor wealth, but behavior, though different socioeconomic classes have distinctive behaviors that identify their members.

The equally disdainful term \"white trash\" applied to lazy and dissolute whites shows that class is not solely, or even mostly, determined by race. The problem with meritocracy is there has to be a definition of merit.
