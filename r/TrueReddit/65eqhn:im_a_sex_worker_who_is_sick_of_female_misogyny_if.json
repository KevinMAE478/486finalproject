money a sex worker makes goes straight into her pocket.\n\nNot entirely sure what you're implying here. This is true for most jobs in the developed world. Taxes are a thing.\n\n&gt;sex work can be a feminist concept but one cannot deny how strongly it's rooted in people being exploited by the patriarchy.\n\nAre you arguing that this person's view is *not* one of those cases where it's a feminist stance? Seems like that would be skirting on the edge of a No True Scotsman fallacy. This person made a conscious choice and is getting flak for that choice from people who claim to be feminists. If that isn't supported by feminists and isn't an accurate representation of what feminists stand for then other feminists need to speak out against such treatment in order to make their position clear.\n\nIt's the same problem that BLM has had, an individual does something bad in the name of BLM (like shoot a cop) and then BLM leaders and members don't comment on it. That is an opening for the media and people who disagree with the movement to say BLM tacitly supports such actions. Whether BLM does or not is irrelevant if they don't comment on it and leave others to interpret their silence as complicity.\n\n&gt;as long as there's no a \"trade union\" of some sort we won't know what the needs of sex workers are and what their stances on legalisation or decriminalisation are.\n\nI'm all for decriminalization of sex work (and certain regulation wouldn't hurt either) as that makes it safer for those that make the choice to go into the industry *and* those that see it as their only choice.\n\n&gt;opinion pieces are usually written by those who have given the opportunity to make that choice.\n\nPretty much anything you read on the internet is going to be. Unless you're going to go talk to these people directly you're not going to get the more \"real\" story. And if you don't have that \"real\" story then it would seem premature to try and interject yourself into the whole process and claim to champion those individuals.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand that people need advocates in the public eye - but make sure they want and/or need those advocates as well as understand what their needs truly are before you jump in to claim you know better than those speaking out.\n\n&gt;it's good there are women in western countries who are able to do that but don't pretend that most sex workers aren't economic migrants or forced into that position because of their social/economic marginalisation.\n\nFor the most part feminism backlash towards sex workers is only a problem in those Western countries, and that's what is being discussed here. Trying to say that areas outside of NA/EU/AUS have it worse is trying to direct the conversation to an irrelevant topic area.\n\nThat's not to say that immigrant sex work isn't an problem in NA/EU/AUS, but not to the degree that it exists elsewhere. On top of that decriminalization would help immigrants who are taken advantage of as well as residents/citizens.\n\nThere's also [not a large amount of trustworthy data on the ratio of immigrant sex workers to citizen sex workers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_sex_work#Problems_in_data_and_research) also note that article points out the common issue of conflation between sex work and sex trafficking.\n\nThe [ACLU notes that the US Department of State has it's estimate](https://www.aclu.org/other/human-trafficking-modern-enslavement-immigrant-women-united-states) of few than 20,000 individuals in the US who are involved in some form of human trafficking. Depending on your definition of \"sex work\" and who you include, that might be a very small minority of sex workers.\n\n&gt;legalisation has proven to devalue sex work thus those who have no other option to go to would have to find other measures (selling organs, drug trafficking idk). i just don't see why would you willingly want to support a system like that?\n\nIf you have a source on that I'd be interested in seeing it.\n\nThe other problem is that there's always the question of whether legislation on something has been effectively implemented or not. For example legislation regarding the ISPs in recent years hasn't had the \"teeth\" included in the bill it needed to enforce some of the specifics, and so the ISPs have gotten away with skirting the law and cheating the system. \n\nContrast that with how Colorado has handled decriminalization of marijuana - crime is down, revenue is up, and a chunk of the tax from sales goes to the state education fund.

Seems like that would be skirting on the edge of a No True Scotsman fallacy. This person made a conscious choice and is getting flak for that choice from people who claim to be feminists.

That is an opening for the media and people who disagree with the movement to say BLM tacitly supports such actions. Whether BLM does or not is irrelevant if they don&amp;#39;t comment on it and leave others to interpret their silence as complicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;as long as there&amp;#39;s no a &amp;quot;trade union&amp;quot; of some sort we won&amp;#39;t know what the needs of sex workers are and what their stances on legalisation or decriminalisation are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m all for decriminalization of sex work (and certain regulation wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt either) as that makes it safer for those that make the choice to go into the industry &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; those that see it as their only choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;opinion pieces are usually written by those who have given the opportunity to make that choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty much anything you read on the internet is going to be.
