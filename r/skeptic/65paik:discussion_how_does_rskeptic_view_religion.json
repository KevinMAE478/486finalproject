Take your pick.  Better yet, provide an example of &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; of their philosophical arguments in favor of a religious claim and I&amp;#39;ll demonstrate its flaw.  Not trying to be arrogant, that&amp;#39;s just how certain I am that there aren&amp;#39;t any good arguments - because I&amp;#39;ve been through way more of them than I can count, in trying to retain belief as well as just exploring my views or responding to others trying to win me back to religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems like a weird standard to have. Surely the criteria should be that there is evidence for a claim, not that there is absolute proof.\nOtherwise the same could be said of your position, that it can&amp;#39;t be true as nobody has conclusively proven gods don&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See above about what I mean by atheism, but I didn&amp;#39;t say &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; proof either - I just said proven.  If all we&amp;#39;re doing is arguing that something is likely feasible or not impossible, then anything can be argued.  I don&amp;#39;t find such debates to be useful, at least given my limited time.  For example, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; argue that it&amp;#39;s possible there&amp;#39;s some civilization living on Mars that uses advanced tech to avoid detection by our probes and telescopes, etc., and there would be a feasible argument to show that it&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s extraordinarily unlikely and a waste of time to debate, aside from entertainment value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then why do mathematicians disagree with you on this point?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t know, don&amp;#39;t care.  Math began with simple concepts like 1+2=3, not high theory math.  All the later math builds on earlier concepts.  So I&amp;#39;m not sure how anyone could seriously argue that math isn&amp;#39;t founded in concepts related to empirical facts...  Sure, it moves beyond concepts that are strictly empirical, but the foundations are empirical.  And those that don&amp;#39;t at least relate to something empirical (i.e. they can be used to solve a problem or increase our understanding of the universe) aren&amp;#39;t very useful.  They might be interesting, in that things like art and poetry are interesting, but they&amp;#39;re not useful IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, empirically prove a logical claim then.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logical claim: My pen exists in the physical world.  If I drop my pen, it will fall to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I really need to post a video of a pen falling?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean there aren&amp;#39;t logical puzzles people can come up with that don&amp;#39;t relate to empirical facts, but that if empirical facts and your logic don&amp;#39;t agree, your logic is the part that&amp;#39;s faulty, not the empirical facts - unless you&amp;#39;ve messed up your gathering of said facts (faulty data, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the anti intellectual rant, let&amp;#39;s just stick to ethics then. Empirically prove what value system we should adopt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;anti-intellectual&amp;quot; lmao, just not &lt;em&gt;useful to me&lt;/em&gt;.  Lots of words, not many solutions, at least that&amp;#39;s what I find of most philosophical discussions.  Many just seem to be &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s see how much we can impress other people with our vocabulary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the ethics thing, I meant the two as areas that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; useful in philosophical discussions: those that tie to empirical things, and those that relate to ethics.  Not that ethics are empirical.  They&amp;#39;re not empirical, they&amp;#39;re just rules we choose to live by in order to make society function better, because we are a social species.  There&amp;#39;s no empirical basis to them other than the fact that society functions better and more people thrive when we have some code of ethics that limits things like murder and theft.  There&amp;#39;s no objective reason why murder is wrong, it&amp;#39;s just better for everyone if we all agree that it is.  I&amp;#39;ve read some people arguing for an objective basis for morality based on minimizing harm, but haven&amp;#39;t been convinced yet - it&amp;#39;s a challenging argument to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not going to be responding much/in depth beyond here, as I&amp;#39;ve got a busy day tomorrow (work + taxes), and a busy week, not much time for Redditing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skeptic", "name": "t1_dgd2r3h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492430202.0, "created_utc": 1492401402.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwlce", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mrsamsa", "parent_id": "t1_dgcvt58", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skeptic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;The claim that religion is correct (let alone a specific one) is actually the far bigger claim.\n\nEven if that's true, that doesn't justify your claim.
