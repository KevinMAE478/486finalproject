I can protect her better than anyone.&amp;quot; Alex Jones told the judge Thursday morning, failing to realize parenting was more than just physical protection of a child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the judge replied with confusion, Mr. Jones had to explain himself. &amp;quot;Yeah. You know the one from the&amp;quot;--interrupting himself mid sentence by a loud, wet burp--&amp;quot;movies. The Terminator. From the future. It&amp;#39;s the only way I can explain my ability to know conspiracies...&amp;quot; Alex Jones had to pause in delivering his case to the judge for another gross belch, &amp;quot;Because they&amp;#39;ve already been discovered in the future, and I&amp;#39;ve been sent back in time to uncover them before they do damage. It also explains my insane alpha maleness. Unlike that liberal foreigner, what&amp;#39;s his name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When asked for comment after the first day&amp;#39;s court session, Mr. Jones was kind enough to give us a moment of his time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh the burps? Yeah I ate way too many jalape\u00f1os over the lunch break. You know they really don&amp;#39;t give you much time to eat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our reporter in the field also asked about the disparity between his animated and emotional radio show and the complete lack of emotion the Terminator was portrayed to have in the movie, to which he replied, &amp;quot;Why would you believe everything you see in the movies? What are you, an idiot?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skeptic", "name": "t1_dgdf5ab", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492461097.0, "created_utc": 1492432297.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdd0mf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fasnoosh", "parent_id": "t3_65tc7f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skeptic", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I don't see this story in any of the major news outlets...not sure I trust its veracity yet", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see this story in any of the major news outlets...not sure I trust its veracity yet&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skeptic", "name": "t1_dgdd0mf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492456116.0, "created_utc": 1492427316.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tc7f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65tc7f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdggx5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xoites", "parent_id": "t1_dgd9jh2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skeptic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "$$", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skeptic", "name": "t1_dgdggx5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492463516.0, "created_utc": 1492434716.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd9jh2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_65tc7f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skeptic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skeptic", "name": "t1_dgd9jh2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492444610.0, "created_utc": 1492415810.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
