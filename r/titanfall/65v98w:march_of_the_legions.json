He will likely hide behind his particle wall, in which case just take cover until it times out or keep sending the missiles into the wall, you get a lot of charge for this.\n\nScorch: just keep backing up while hitting him with everything you have, thermite is slow enough to dodge and you have more movement capability than him.\n\nRonin: if he gets the drop on you, you're dead (nothin personnel and all that jazz) you don't have the kit capable of dealing with a progenji in close.

The hip fire uses no energy and does decent damage so spam that as much as you can at all ranges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases you should be using laser shot while dipping in and out of cover.  Despite needing to &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; laser shot does the same amount of damage whether you just tap it or hold it (this was different in the beta).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trip mines are great because they do a ton of damage and will instakill pilots in a huge radius (seriously it&amp;#39;s way bigger than you&amp;#39;d think.  You can also pop them over low hanging walls into high pilot traffic areas or trap pilots with them in buildings (the central courtyard of eden is perfect for this).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only real difficulty with ion is being cognizant of how much energy you have.  In 90% of situations you want to conserve enough energy to use vortex shield effectively when you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Titan vs Titan matchups:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legion:  poor guy...literally just vortex his bullets until he stops firing, then shoot them back at him. Rinse repeat.  Legion is straight up hard countered by ion, in a 1v1 it&amp;#39;s not unheard of for an ion to 0-death a legion while taking less than a bar of damage. With full energy you can just outlast his defensive and return all the bullets when he&amp;#39;s done, or just shoot them at his exposed leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tone:  ion is a soft counter to tone, you will take chip damage from the 40 while returning fire with hipfire splitter shots, but if you are smart with your energy and know how to count, you can vortex his missiles back.  He will likely hide behind his particle wall, in which case just take cover until it times out or keep sending the missiles into the wall, you get a lot of charge for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scorch: just keep backing up while hitting him with everything you have, thermite is slow enough to dodge and you have more movement capability than him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ronin: if he gets the drop on you, you&amp;#39;re dead (nothin personnel and all that jazz) you don&amp;#39;t have the kit capable of dealing with a progenji in close.  The key is to engage as far as you can away and chip at his health with laser shot and hip fire as he attempts to approach laying down trip wires can force out arcwaves and phasedashes leaving him very vulnerable while you continue to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Northstar: lol, outsnipe him with lasershot, feed on northstar tears. Northstar is in a bad place right now vs ion who seems to be better suited for most long range engagements.  If you have full vortex energy you can literally vortex back every missile from flightcore...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ion:  this gets weird because you want to vortex his laser shot but it&amp;#39;s really hard to know when it&amp;#39;s coming to time it right, basically both pilots play this vortex guessing game until both are out of energy and then start splitter rifling each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "titanfall", "name": "t1_dgdvjfh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481931.0, "created_utc": 1492453131.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdttso", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danjr321", "parent_id": "t1_dgdha7o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/titanfall", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just started playing Ion after loving Legion, Northstar, and Tone...
