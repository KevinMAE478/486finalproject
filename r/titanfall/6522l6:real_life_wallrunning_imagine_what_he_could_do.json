If we only think about wall running (Well Achtually... A wall Run means a vertical movement up the wall in parkourish but lets use it for moving forwards, horizontaly on the wall because we are in a Titanfall and not parkour forum) I can see a jump kit helping. The problem with wall runs is that when you leave the ground and start running on the wall, you can't gain any more energy towards the wall. Your feet hitting the wall give you some extra energy forwards and maybe even upwards if there's enough friction but at the same time absorb your momentum towards the wall and start pushing you off the wall. Three step wall run on a totally vertical, medium friction wall is a thing that can be used so that the last step still retains actual power for combo move like a push off the wall to a ledge or to another wall. More steps can be added for purely cosmetic reasons if there's no desire to maintain any power in the sequence but I think that it looks a bit silly because they don't look like real steps just feet doing zig zag motions.

If the kit had several multi directional jets, some might be used to combat gravity to further extend the run (in real life you can still have a bit of upwards momentum when you exit the run on the third step). I don't dare to hazard actual numbers (If I really had to, say on gunpoint I'd say any even number between 2 and 8 steps more on the wall depending on the tech) for the benefits because I don't think we have the tech to pull this right now but the core principle seem solid enough for me.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished a night shift and am going to bed.

Any force exerted on an object (wall) will result in a force (dubbed normal force) of opposite direction and equal magnitude exerted to the person, which occurs and diminishes just as well as the exertion of the force does. \n\nTo be able to go forward, the soles of the pilot must generate friction against the wall to move forward. To generate friction, a normal force must occur on the pilot. The pilot pushes his feet away from the wall to generate a normal force (See Newton's 3rd law), but doing so will also push the pilot away from the wall. \n\nTo anchor the pilot onto the wall the pilot must use his jumpkit to thrush himself against the normal force (Towards the wall) so that he will not be pushed away (The net force of the axis perpendicular to the wall is zero).
