I tried different lighting settings before and it turned Angel City from a sunny day into a cloudy afternoon (except for sun and skybox).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that there isn&amp;#39;t any work involved. In my example some areas still looked unnatural due to them being created for one specific light setting but changing the lighting of a map is by far easier than having to create 4 different versions of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One final point, while I doubt different lighting styles will be implemented I hope that not every upcoming TF2 will have the same sunny day setting to it.
