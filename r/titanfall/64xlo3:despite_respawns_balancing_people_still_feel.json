Here are my suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laser shot: The hit box for it has now been increased to hit whatever is on your screen and acts like a real laser so no more of those pesky pilots getting into cover. Another buff is if you look straight up your laser will power up a satellite which in turns shoots multiple lasers from orbit that hit everything on the field with pin point accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Splitter rifle: Splitter Rifle&amp;#39;s default mode now the secondary and hitting anything(Including the air around you.) Instantly regens your energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laser trip wire: Laser trip wire&amp;#39;s hitbox will be increased so you can be on the other side of the map and be hit. No more wasted energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laser core: In addition to acting like an actual laser and cutting through things the hit box is now the size of the laser shot too. And looking up and hitting the satellite will super charge the satellite. IT will release a gigantic laser tat encompasses the entire battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tone: Apparently going back to pre nerf isn&amp;#39;t enough so a few added buffs on top of pre nerf.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40mm: 40mm tracker cannon will now be a 400mm tracker cannon. The 400mm rounds now track the closest target and will maneuver around cover to hit their target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;rockets: Rockets salvos will be replaced with blue shells to hit who ever is top on the enemy team. How Respawn will get the rights to do that is up to them, but I am confident they can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;particle wall: Particle wall in it&amp;#39;s current state is a bit too easy to take down so it will be replaced. When particle wall is activated Trump himself will walk onto the field and build a glorious impenetrable wall(paid for by Mexico of course) that only you and your teammates can cross and shoot through. IT will also amp out going shots, and if enemy somehow flank around will become a dome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salvo core: Each missivle will be replaced with a nuclear warhead and instead of being laser guided will auto target enemies be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ronin: I hear a lot of Ronin being too squishy so I took a lot fo time to think of some good buffs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sword: Ronin&amp;#39;s blade is now sharper than ever and will slice through anything within a 40ft of his sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phase Dash: Instead of just dashing through the upside down Ronin will now be able to travel in the upside down and come out at will. HE is also able to see enemies in the upside down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arc wave: Arc wave will be replaced by arc storm. When ability is activated a thunderstorm will start. Lighting randomly strikes the map dealing great damage to whatever is hit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shotgun: You have a sword. Who needs shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sword block: It now negates 100% of damage and reflects damage back to the person who was dealing damage. Fixed railgun going through sword black bug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sword core: Ronin points his sword to the sky and lightning will strike it granting him great power. He smites Zeus and bitch slaps Thor with his sword. Ronin is now the god.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Legion: This one took a bit of thought since everything revolves around his gun.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Predator cannon: Smart core will be his default firing mode and boolets can track targets around cover. He has infinite ammunition and stealth positions. Damage fall off is removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gun shield: Gun shield is now dome shield. Legion is encompassed in an impenetrable dome than can be sot through and amps shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smart Core: By drinking a bottle of vodka Legion&amp;#39;s smart core becomes the smartest core. Put down your controller because Smartest core plays the game for you as if you had hacks. Will engage the enemy in a game of chess and if Smartest core wins they win the match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Northstar: No comments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Railgun: Now instant charge up and hitscan. Does as much damage as an actual rail gun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cluster missile: Who needs that weak ass cluster missile. Pushing the button that activates cluster missile now calls in a bombing run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tether traps: Now cannot be destroyed and can lock on to pilots too. Deals a continuous arc grenade effect and damage over time until it explodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hover: Northstar can fly like Viper at Mach speeds. You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flight core: &lt;strong&gt;TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING!!!&lt;/strong&gt; Turn the map into Bikini Atoll&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scorch: This one is my favorite. Right now Scorch is really weak so I had to come up with some special buffs to make him viable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scorch: Assault Chip Scorch is now 10x more terrifying than he already is. Get out of your titan because Scorch leaves his previous throne as Satan and wages a 100 year war on the heavens only to smite down Ronin in the end and take over as the god of thermite. Scorch bores of his rule and leaves to conquer the multiverse. Scorch hits the gym and shaves off a about 30 tons before setting out on a long journey to conquer and learn about the multiverse. He learns about spiral power, combining with other mechs, and much more. Scorch has learned many lessons throughout his journeys and comes back with a new outlook on life. Scorch has become the god of gods and rules for eternity. Peace spreads through the multiverse under his gentle fist and his name is remembered through the ages. After 10,000 years Scorch gives up his spot on the throne, much to the dismay of everyone, and ascends. He becomes a being beyond thought and comprehension. He is eventually forgotten, and becomes but a mere legend recited to children to scare them into obedience, but he is still there, but also not there. Encompassing the universe in his warm embrace. His pilot is left confused wondering where his titan went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think of these buffs? Too much? Too little?
