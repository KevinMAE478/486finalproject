Yes the blow was enough to knock him unconscious, but the reason you don&amp;#39;t move someone is due to concern from cervical spine instability, and that is usually because the first responder did not witness the mechanism of injury. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see someone slip and fall on their head, that is not the kind of injury that causes c-spine instability, the same can be said about what happened in this video. He should have a full physical exam by a doctor, but in this case It does not appear that a neck brace was warranted.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Witness and unwitnessed events do determine what kind of medical intervention a patient receives.
