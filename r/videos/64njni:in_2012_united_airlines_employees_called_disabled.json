I said fuck em, they don't know. \n\nWell then I went to join. Walked into the recruiters office to join the reserves to get money for school so that I could become an officer. They paid me no attention. \"Yeah yeah, another wannabe. Don't you know the military is cutting back on enlistees?\" Then I took the test. I scored in the 99th percentile for math among other high scores. They pushed and pushed me to go a certain route. I later learned this affected their comp plan (commission). All of a sudden they told me I couldn't do reserves (was a lie). Then they told me I had to go ship out within two weeks to michigan if I was ever going to be in the service (lie #2). Then after I said I wanted to take some time to think about it all they then started to bombard me with calls.\n\nEventually, the head of the branch called me and told me that I had 3 warrants out for my arrest and that I had duped him and that I had better join quick or i'd be in a ton of trouble. I was so scared that I hung up on him and started calling every county and city that i'd been to over the past year (maybe I had an overdue parking ticket). Nope. Lie #3.\n\n\nIt was after this that I realized that this is what my fate in the military would be. Just lie after lie. An ineffective organization from the ground up. In my opinion, an organizations effectiveness can be measured by the integrity of it's lower rungs. Every action of every employee is a reflection of those that have the highest authority over them. It was upon the realization of knowing that my fate could possibly be in the hands of such chaos that I could never be apart of such an organization.\n\n\nHopefully with this you will make a wiser decision. Plus, will you possibly get enough benefits to assume such a grand risk of death, dismemberment, or psychological trauma? I think not. Go to lineman school. You'll get paid handsomely.\n\n**EDIT**: I'd like to throw this out there. There are only two sides to any war. Those who fight it, and those who wage it.

Don&amp;#39;t you know the military is cutting back on enlistees?&amp;quot; Then I took the test. I scored in the 99th percentile for math among other high scores. They pushed and pushed me to go a certain route. I later learned this affected their comp plan (commission). All of a sudden they told me I couldn&amp;#39;t do reserves (was a lie). Then they told me I had to go ship out within two weeks to michigan if I was ever going to be in the service (lie #2). Then after I said I wanted to take some time to think about it all they then started to bombard me with calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the head of the branch called me and told me that I had 3 warrants out for my arrest and that I had duped him and that I had better join quick or i&amp;#39;d be in a ton of trouble. I was so scared that I hung up on him and started calling every county and city that i&amp;#39;d been to over the past year (maybe I had an overdue parking ticket). Nope. Lie #3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was after this that I realized that this is what my fate in the military would be. Just lie after lie. An ineffective organization from the ground up. In my opinion, an organizations effectiveness can be measured by the integrity of it&amp;#39;s lower rungs. Every action of every employee is a reflection of those that have the highest authority over them. It was upon the realization of knowing that my fate could possibly be in the hands of such chaos that I could never be apart of such an organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully with this you will make a wiser decision. Plus, will you possibly get enough benefits to assume such a grand risk of death, dismemberment, or psychological trauma? I think not. Go to lineman school. You&amp;#39;ll get paid handsomely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;d like to throw this out there. There are only two sides to any war. Those who fight it, and those who wage it. You&amp;#39;ll get caught up in patriotism, but at the end of the day you will only be risking your life for those that have a vested interest in war and not necessarily those who need to be protected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg41yq3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491931005.0, "created_utc": 1491902205.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3zw57", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Grizz_Warrior", "parent_id": "t1_dg3zt6f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for taking the time to write this.

Even when people thank you when you come back, they're not thanking *you*, they're thanking what you represent for their selfish beliefs, usually. When a white woman pushing a cart outside Safeway says \"thank you for your service young man\", she's patting herself on the back for \"standing behind\" our troops. It's fuel for an argument she uses against people who she disagrees with. \"**I** support our troops, do you?\"  \nAnd on the other side, you have people who literally blame you for the decisions that are made layers and layers above your pay grade. You're going to learn a few things, very very fast when you enlist. I am not a veteran, but I have yet to meet a veteran who doesn't know these things (they're who I learned them from):  \nYou have to treat it like it's a job. Because you're going to get orders and you just have to follow them. In an ideal world, as the fictional Captain America says, \"You know who you're fighting\" and that's it. It's not like that anymore. Now it's \"insurgents\" and \"terrorism\" and digital warfare. Now it's bombs hidden in health kit boxes, kids with AK47's, regular people just looking for a safe place to hide, unmanned aircrafts, proxy wars. The day a regular enlistee has a say in what his orders are and *how* to follow them is the day I shit diamonds and gold.  \nYou're not going to be able to \"clear this up\" with facts anyway. When you're in the middle of this shit, you're not right or left, you're a person with a job and your orders aren't blue or red, they're just orders. Not following them is *literally* illegal and will get you put in serious shit. And when you hear people saying what they think the troops are doing or not doing or what they think, you're going to WANT to talk about how you really feel or what you're really doing over there, but you *can't*. You can't say shit. But there's one thing you'll know that the rest of us can't seem to get a grasp on.  \n**None of us who never enlisted know a fucking thing about what it's like to be enlisted in the military, to the same extent as an enlistee**. That is something you can ALWAYS say and I never try to defend myself from having it said to me. For all the shit I *know*, I still don't know shit.  \nSo at the end of the day, what are you doing and what do we have to thank you for? Well, that's easy.  \nYou're not over there protecting our freedom. Let's clear that shit up, **quick**. No one in America is in any danger from people from Syria. lol. Like seriously at all. The day one of the poorest countries in the world poses a threat to geographical America is the day you witness the fastest ending \"war\" in the history of wars. Seriously, NO ONE is going to mount an attack on us and get shit out of it. 9/11? That shit doesn't even scratch the surface of how many people diabetes kills every month, so let's not call that an \"attack\" so much as a sucker punch that ended up turning the middle east and our economy into a Fallout style post-apocalypse.  \nWhat you're doing is protecting America's **political interests**. That's it. THAT is what you're doing. But we still have to thank you.  \nWe have to thank you because:  \nIf the US *was* in any danger, you'd be the first to step up. You would throw your life on the line when the boots and the bombs are coming.  \nSecondly, because you *stepped up*. If you and every other enlistee didn't step up, the United States would draft to get people to go or enforce a mandatory military law like South Korea has. You and every other enlistee took this job so that we wouldn't have to and we HAVE to thank you for that.  \nSo when you come back, if you enlist, and if I happen to see you, notice your haircut and demeanour and I say, \"Thank you for serving\", I'm genuinely thanking you. I'm thanking *you* for losing Christmas and your birthday while you're on tour in the middle of fucking nowhere. I'm thanking you for taking an underpaid job that's going to treat you like shit after you finish, so that us regular people wouldn't have to. I'm thanking you for risking your life so a bunch of suits can play global chess with Russia. I'm thanking you for eating the shitty food and being stuck on a boat for 7 months with shitty WiFi not being able to jerk off in peace because you're bunked. I'm thanking you for the shit that I hope you'll never have to do, but that you signed up to do on our behalf anyway.  \nI'm not thanking you for \"protecting freedom\", because I know after you've done that shit for four years, you won't think that's what you were doing anyway.  \nAnd for the love of fucking everything, please take advantage of the college tuition benefits. Seriously. Go to fucking school. Do NOT let this job deflate you from protecting yourself and your future. Get a god damned degree. If you don't think it's worth it or \"I don't need a degree for what I planned\", fucking look up unemployment statistics for veterans without a degree and tell me I'm wrong. Between that and suicide rates, going to college will do you WONDERS. I finished college when I was 30 years old so don't think you'll be too old when you get out.  \nAnd the GI Bill is very very good in terms of paying for school.   \n**Edit**: thank you for gold stranger!  \nAs a final word, I would ask that those of you who felt moved by what I shared please take the time to view the following petitions and consider supporting them:  \n[This petition is asking for a reform to claims processing so veterans who need urgent care will not be stuck behind months of inefficient claims processing delays](https://www.change.org/p/the-department-of-veterans-affairs-overhaul-the-claims-processing-create-mandatory-claims-deadlines). Some veterans have taken their own lives because they felt like no one cared after repeatedly asking the VA for help.  \n[This petition is asking that we fund service dogs for veterans who are suffering from PTSD](https://www.change.org/p/the-u-s-senate-provide-service-dogs-to-veterans-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder). A dog can have such a tremendous effect at reducing panic, stress and anxiety and has a tangible effect on healthcare costs.  \nThere are dozens of other petitions and movements to support veterans. They didn't choose their fights, voters and politicians did. Even if you don't agree with what some of them were doing, guess what? A lot of them didn't either.
