Also, putting more in to start means your hits will be denser meaning you wont have to take as long of hits as youll be getting more in one hit than you would at a lower overall dosage. So that means that you will get say 10 to 15 mgs per hit in say a 10 second hit if you put 50 mgs in total where as to get 10 to 15 mgs per hit if you put 30 mgs total, youd have to to take a 15 to 20 second hit because youre vaping less \"per second\" when you put more in less in. Like i said you can always put the pipe down when youve had enough anyway. When you start vaping i always start with a \"melting hit\". It takes about 5 to 10 seconds for the dmt to melt and the stone on top of the dmt to warm up properly. But for those first few seconds its a waste of a hit. So as soonas you see or taste or feel ANY white vapor coming, stop, exhale fully, THEN take your first real hit as now you can restart with empty lungs and more or less as soon as you start youll get dmt vapor as opposed to wasting the first half of your first hit. You get used to it after a while and muscle memory kind of takes control but when you first start vaping dmt, you start to forgot what you need to be doing in order to actually vape it as in how close the lighter needs to be, how to angle the lighter, evem how fast or slow to breathe in. Dont worry you wont forget to breathe while on dmt, its just when you vape it, its not exactly just normal breathing as you could imagine since youre hitting a pipe. With the lighter, i angle it down and into the pipe with my thumb UNDERNEATH and to the side of the flame, not on top. you can rotate it or whatever, just as long as your thumb isnt above because its not like weed where you just light for a second and pull away, your thumb and lighter are there the whole time youre taking a hit, constantly adjusting to how much vapor is coming in and how hot you think its getting. it sounds complicated but its really not. its all pretty obvious once you get going. happy travels\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vapor Genie Glass Sherlock with a mesh liquid pad is the BEST thing out there by far.

BOOM my friend right next to me gets smaller with a smile on his face, he's there but he's really not. The trees, start taking form, it's like a kaleidoscope, the sky is blue but it's a different color that I have never seen. My hands turn to little hands within my palms. I am in awe of everything, my heart is pounding and I can hear the sounds so clear, everything so vivid. Finally I hear a voice and it's my friend still with a smile on his face telling me to go down to his basement. I get up and I'm in this box like a house of mirrors, I try moving left and it's the same thing, I move right and it's the same thing. I was stuck and I could not move. But then I remembered that I was on DMT. \"You are high, focus Christian\" finally I get out of this box and I walk downstairs. I see faces on the walls, smiling at me.

I'm in space, I see lots of stars, a tunnel. The stars start shape shifting, forming into objects. I'm traveling at the speed of light. All the colors, finally the stars form into a golden trail, the trail leads onto a mountain top. There's 2 people with their backs turned, a mysterious man with long hair and another man looking at the edge. As soon as they look towards me, they disappear and turn into flying doves into the space sky. I opened my eyes still feeling the effects, I'm coming down, but the feeling. I still have it. I have never tried anything like this, but the feeling, maybe because of my younger years, I felt right then and there that I needed to die at that very moment for me to stop feeling this feel of highness. I thought I was never going stop being high. Finally 30 mins later, I came down completely. Just feeling changed. I don't know what I felt or what I saw. But that feeling, who knows what it was but it was more, did I feel complete? Not a bit, but I felt like I needed more in this life.
