But it will take me a while to explain. \n\nApple has several test programs that test individual components in a machine - Apple Service Diagnosic, for example, and are machine specific. They would routinely say a temp sensor is bad or similar.  But who gives a fuck. Because...\n\n- People don't solder components. So this idea that \"people\" could \"fix\" this problem is fucking stupid as fuck.  Lots of people wear watches - most people don't have a loupe and Watch tools - *nor know how to use them* - to fix it if their mechanical Watch needs a spring replaced or adjusted. \n\n- Apple is a 1st party shop, similar to a Mercedes shop. And similar to a car dealership, Apple doesn't try to bondo patch a bumper on a Mercedes, they replace the bumper. And shops that do work on specialty-made devices (these aren't Asus motherboards in an ATC case full of standard parts - each board is a custom part), they have to invest heavily in weird tools and special manuals to work on them - so thinking of Apple laptops as an SLR camera (full of weird boards and odd assemblies, though less so than 10years ago) rather than a white-box PC is a better analogy. People don't tear open their Nikon trying to fix the shutter mech, and most people couldn't fix a MLB in a Mac book air. \n\n- A third party shop, as I used to be in the long-long ago will also *usually* not have techs that can solder components, especially very small ones. I have replaced caps on logic boards. Sometimes the cap replacement works and sometimes it doesn't because the parts they fed shitty voltage to has been destroyed. There is no way for normal computer techs to diagnose a failure beyond that. If the computer can't operate well enough to load a bios/OF/EFI based diagnostic program, then you can't diagnose it with software. Secondary problems, like sensors or a bad SATA controller or similar are easily diagnosed, but not major problems where the machine can't get past POST or is a \"no power\" situation - so this particular problem falls into a category of a *small problem on a big, expensive assembly* but that is not always the case - nor is it so easy to know that your problem will be solved by a single component being replaced. This particular sensor failure is conveniently the best-case scenario for his argument, but falls apart with other, murkier failures, usually involving a \"small amount\" of coffee that got in the case through the touchpad. \n\n- A third party shop on an out of warranty machine will purchase refurbished boards from a refurbisher to install in a computer if they can't repair a module, like a logic board. Refurbishers buy palletes of computers that have been damaged/unwanted, dismantle and repair components, then sell the parts/modules (with a warranty!) to the shop to install in the customer's machine. They get the old bad one and refurb it for sale to someone else. This *core discount* for getting the old part back is common in third party automotive repair and lowers the cost to the consumer. \n\nAlso, Back in my day, a tier 4 repair was only for machines with obvious damage - and they would repair **everything** to make it right. This is well beyond what a third party tech shop would do. \n\nSo my points: \n\n- people don't solder. \n- apple is first party, they replace.\n- 3rd party shops don't solder, they replace with OEM or refurbished \n- refurbishers *do* solder and repair things at a component level.\n- refurbishers can test repairs and warranty them. This is necessary for customers and shops to buy refurbished parts. \n\nSooooo.  People with skills to actually do this soldering *are doing this soldering* and *already have a business* doing this. They pass the savings onto the repair shop who can *properly* disassemble, swap, and reassemble the unit without killing it, and pass that savings onto the customer. Is it 2 dollars? No. It costs hundreds of dollars. But it is not the 700 for tier-4 \"I dropped it on the train track\" repair that Apple offers to make it as perfect-as-new again. People with a soldering station won't fix a rando's computer for free - there is gonna be labor and parts and a premium for the insurance in case you ruin someone's computer. \n\nThe only people who this really affects is people with a dead Mac, a lots of free time, and soldering stations and the skill to use them, which is a *vanishingly small* amount of Apple owners.\n\nWhich is why this video is shit.
