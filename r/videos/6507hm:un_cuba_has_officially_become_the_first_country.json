My parents both came to the US in their late teens, not speaking a lick of English. I didnt learn English myself until I started Kindergarten. My mom used to tell me that she'd walk by the American Embassy everyday as a kid and everyday she'd feel the urge to jump the fence, even though she knew it didn't work like that. She wanted nothing more than to leave that hellhole. \n\nFood is rationed and minimal. If you tried to acquire food by other means, you were jailed. It happened to my grandfather who tried to buy an extra cup of beans for his family. Sometimes they ran out of food, if you made a scene about it, you were jailed. This happened to my great uncle. His mistake was to criticize the government during this scene. He was jailed for a year in a cell with no windows, naked. He had no where to go to the bathroom and had to live in his own feces. The guards would torture them, play mind games and let them think they were going to be killed. Some were. \n\nDuring the summer months, all children were required to go to \"camp\" which was essentially child slave labor. Need to go to the bathroom? Find a hole in the ground and find the nearest leaf to wipe with. My mom recalls working long hours on the farm in the blistering sun. She'd get terrible sunburns because there was no sunblock available. The food that was given to them often had little pieces of rock and/or worms in it. \n\nFor the sake of \"equality\", you would have to go through a lottery to buy ONE item for your child for Christmas. If you got the first number, you might be able to buy your kid a rag doll but if you were last.. you could have fun with your pack of pencils until next year. My dad recalls being ELATED when he received a game of plastic jacks one year. \n\nIn school, you weren't allowed to choose your career path. It was chosen for you. Everyone is \"paid\" the same, janitor, doctor, etc. If you wanted medical care, it was a good idea to bring what items you owned to entice the doctor to take a look at you sooner. Needed to go to the hospital? You better bring your own bedsheets and pillows because they aren't available here. You want to talk about how great the medicine is there? Tell that to my grandmother who would break down in tears on the anniversaries of the death of her two infant sons who weren't able to be treated in time. \n\nMy dads cousin was in jail for 30 YEARS for simply having anti-communist propaganda in her possession. She was one of the lucky ones, other people just \"disappeared\".\n\nYou know how there are life events (e.g., 9/11) where everyone can recall exactly where they were and what they were doing? In addition to 9/11, for me, was when Elian Gonzalez was sent back to Cuba. I won't get into the legality of it or whether it was right or wrong. That's not my point. It had such a strong impact on my family because of the suffering they had endured themselves in Cuba. I remember waking up and seeing my dad, this manly man truck driver, in front of the TV sobbing. \n\nI feel so privileged to have been born into this country.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I won&amp;#39;t change your mind but I&amp;#39;ll post this to inform others: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandparents, parents and several of my extended family members were fortunate enough to leave Cuba and I have been told countless anecdotes regarding the oppressive regime. My parents both came to the US in their late teens, not speaking a lick of English. I didnt learn English myself until I started Kindergarten. My mom used to tell me that she&amp;#39;d walk by the American Embassy everyday as a kid and everyday she&amp;#39;d feel the urge to jump the fence, even though she knew it didn&amp;#39;t work like that. She wanted nothing more than to leave that hellhole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Food is rationed and minimal. If you tried to acquire food by other means, you were jailed. It happened to my grandfather who tried to buy an extra cup of beans for his family. Sometimes they ran out of food, if you made a scene about it, you were jailed. This happened to my great uncle. His mistake was to criticize the government during this scene. He was jailed for a year in a cell with no windows, naked. He had no where to go to the bathroom and had to live in his own feces. The guards would torture them, play mind games and let them think they were going to be killed. Some were. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the summer months, all children were required to go to &amp;quot;camp&amp;quot; which was essentially child slave labor. Need to go to the bathroom? Find a hole in the ground and find the nearest leaf to wipe with. My mom recalls working long hours on the farm in the blistering sun. She&amp;#39;d get terrible sunburns because there was no sunblock available. The food that was given to them often had little pieces of rock and/or worms in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the sake of &amp;quot;equality&amp;quot;, you would have to go through a lottery to buy ONE item for your child for Christmas. If you got the first number, you might be able to buy your kid a rag doll but if you were last.. you could have fun with your pack of pencils until next year. My dad recalls being ELATED when he received a game of plastic jacks one year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In school, you weren&amp;#39;t allowed to choose your career path. It was chosen for you. Everyone is &amp;quot;paid&amp;quot; the same, janitor, doctor, etc. If you wanted medical care, it was a good idea to bring what items you owned to entice the doctor to take a look at you sooner. Needed to go to the hospital? You better bring your own bedsheets and pillows because they aren&amp;#39;t available here. You want to talk about how great the medicine is there? Tell that to my grandmother who would break down in tears on the anniversaries of the death of her two infant sons who weren&amp;#39;t able to be treated in time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dads cousin was in jail for 30 YEARS for simply having anti-communist propaganda in her possession. She was one of the lucky ones, other people just &amp;quot;disappeared&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know how there are life events (e.g., 9/11) where everyone can recall exactly where they were and what they were doing? In addition to 9/11, for me, was when Elian Gonzalez was sent back to Cuba. I won&amp;#39;t get into the legality of it or whether it was right or wrong. That&amp;#39;s not my point. It had such a strong impact on my family because of the suffering they had endured themselves in Cuba.
