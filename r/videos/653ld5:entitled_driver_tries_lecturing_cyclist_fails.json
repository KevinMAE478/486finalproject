This seemed to anger him yet even further as he did a little dance while shaking his head and clenching his fist in an attempt to intimidate me into thinking he was about to do something, so to calm the situation I said &amp;quot;think about what you&amp;#39;re doing here, you&amp;#39;re in the middle of the street arguing with a cyclist because you were driving like a cunt, and now you want to threaten violence in front of multiple witnesses (I pointed out 2 women staring at the commotion) instead of learning from your mistake and moving on.&amp;quot; I stood there and stared at him for a few seconds (with my bike between us for defence in case he tried anything) until he decided it was in his best interest to get in his car and fuck off. As he pulled away he shouted something out of his window but I couldn&amp;#39;t hear it so I just stuck my finger up at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never saw him again after that. He probably felt stupid about the whole thing after he had calmed down a bit and decided to take a different route to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg7m6wt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492122500.0, "created_utc": 1492093700.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653ld5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653ld5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653ld5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgav1fz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AKAShmuelCohen", "parent_id": "t1_dg7wkge", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah those cops that write tickets along the wiggle should be doing something better with their time.
