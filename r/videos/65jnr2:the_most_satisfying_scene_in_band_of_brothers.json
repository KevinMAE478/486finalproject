He was an insufferable ass with them, perhaps more than necessary, and quite unfair, which basically made him the &amp;quot;villain&amp;quot; of the beginning of the series. In addition to that, he was pretty incompetent as a field leader in the exercises, so in the end of his character arc in the series he was deemed unfit to lead a squad or whatever when the new soldiers were sent to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The soldiers he trained went on to Europe though, and some moved up in rank above Captain Sobel&amp;#39;s. That&amp;#39;s where you get this scene when the former trainees, now veterans, meet Captain Sobel again, who&amp;#39;s now below them in rank, and they demand the respect they deserve from him due to their higher rank. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dgb0t5u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492311692.0, "created_utc": 1492282892.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jnr2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbckrt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "campoanywhere", "parent_id": "t1_dgazkay", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WATCH BAND OF BROTHERS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
