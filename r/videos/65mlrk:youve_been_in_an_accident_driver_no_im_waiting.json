I believe it has to be thicker walled than a normal safe too. In addition to this, you need to show up to your gun club meetings every 3 months. If you are ever stopped by a police officer, you have to know exactly where your weapon is (even if it's not on you), and if they challenge you and it's not where it is, no more license. If you aren't signed off on the club visits, no more license.\n\nTo top this off, I'm pretty sure some NZ Police didn't even have firearms on them or even in their car until the early 2000's (I remember something in highschool). Pretty sure every car now has a rifle in it, but it's under lock and key in the boot, and if they open the box - they need to write up a report deeming exactly why they needed to do so.
