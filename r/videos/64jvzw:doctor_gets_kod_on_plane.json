As many have pointed out, a ticket is not a guarantee of a flight. If a pilot or crew want you off, you have to leave. They have to reimburse you, of course, but you have to leave. When you refuse the crew, you become a disturbance to the flight and law enforcement will step in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the accountability to the patients, if the flight was not overbooked, but there was instead a page dog bank, would the airline be accountable even though he had a ticket?  In fact I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they&amp;#39;re not as financially responsible as they are if they bump you, and the outcome would have been the same, namely the doctor would need to find an alternative to get back to his patients. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg3bj0v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491888802.0, "created_utc": 1491860002.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg39o1h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SnuggleDouglas", "parent_id": "t1_dg33why", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you forcefully drag a doctor off a plane because you wanted to fit some of your own workers on an already over booked plane, are you accountable for the well being of that doctors patients that he had the following morning?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you forcefully drag a doctor off a plane because you wanted to fit some of your own workers on an already over booked plane, are you accountable for the well being of that doctors patients that he had the following morning?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg39o1h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491886725.0, "created_utc": 1491857925.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg33why", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GitEmSteveDave", "parent_id": "t1_dg2ntt0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So if you call the cops on me, does that mean that you are accountable for anything they do to me ?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you call the cops on me, does that mean that you are accountable for anything they do to me ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg33why", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491880727.0, "created_utc": 1491851927.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2ntt0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 252, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eclifox", "parent_id": "t3_64jvzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This reminds of the time United Airlines smashed a doctor's head into a armrest for not volunteering their seat", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds of the time United Airlines smashed a doctor&amp;#39;s head into a armrest for not volunteering their seat&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg2ntt0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491863317.0, "created_utc": 1491834517.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 252}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64jvzw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64jvzw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64jvzw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg345ug", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mlsweeney", "parent_id": "t1_dg30uwv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1.
