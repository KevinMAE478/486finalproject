Wholeheartedly.* Conviction is a strong ally. People don't believe things when you don't believe yourself. People can see it, the doubt, the anxiety in your eyes.\n\n2. Don't drop them willy-nilly. If you lie all the time, then you're problem isn't that you lie, it's that you've completely rejected honesty. You don't feel comfortable in reality. You create fickle fantasies because you're weak and can't face even small truths, like how you actually spilled the coffee on your mothers nice table cloth. *You're downfall here isn't lies being negative or positive, rather, a complete and utter detachment from truth and reality.*\n\n3. Deploy honesty when it works better. Sometimes you drop a lie, but the narrative works in such a way that truths can be knit together with lies like a blanket. A quilt, even.
