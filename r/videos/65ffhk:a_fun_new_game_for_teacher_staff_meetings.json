After the meeting I always ask friend that suffered through it if I missed anything answer is most likely not otherwise it can be summed up within 30 seconds for an hour meeting. \n\nI worked at a large company and quickly learned to stand in the back of a 500 person meeting and go to the bathroom a few minutes in unless the tone felt serious and not come back. I would get an extra hour or two of work done and would only go to most meetings if I thought it was likely that me or my team was going to likely get an award, were it could be noticed I was missing. I did go to the meetings that they kept track of who was there or if they have lunch every time, on occasion a vendor would actually know his shit and know more than me about their own product. I would then go to that vendors meetings if I actually learned how to do my job better even without food or if I could not go and not be noticed missing but that was rare.\n\nI also learned to give a very difficult question to a visiting tech vendor whose products we sold off the bat to see how they handled it like a litmus test. You would be surprised how many people will try to bullshit and lie on a hard question rather than to be honest that they don't know, I would much rather hear that is a great question I don't know but I will find out and get back to you with that information and have them get my team's or my contact info and then actually follow up. Still like 75% of the time I would never hear back and I always remembered. If I saw that vendor a 1/2 or full year later you better believe I already knew if I was going to daydream.

After the meeting I always ask friend that suffered through it if I missed anything answer is most likely not otherwise it can be summed up within 30 seconds for an hour meeting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked at a large company and quickly learned to stand in the back of a 500 person meeting and go to the bathroom a few minutes in unless the tone felt serious and not come back. I would get an extra hour or two of work done and would only go to most meetings if I thought it was likely that me or my team was going to likely get an award, were it could be noticed I was missing. I did go to the meetings that they kept track of who was there or if they have lunch every time, on occasion a vendor would actually know his shit and know more than me about their own product. I would then go to that vendors meetings if I actually learned how to do my job better even without food or if I could not go and not be noticed missing but that was rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also learned to give a very difficult question to a visiting tech vendor whose products we sold off the bat to see how they handled it like a litmus test.
