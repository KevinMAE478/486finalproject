Economics isn't a zero sum game, this policy if implemented correctly creates wealth and happiness. You can create a game where everyone wins. In fact, in this example you could give the person $18,000 in compensation for not being able to catch their flight and the airline still profits. I'm sure most people wouldn't mind catching a flight where there is a 5% chance I get paid $17,000. And remember in my example if you would rather catch the flight than get $18k, you can certainly do that, its only up to the most willing person to decide. \n\nThe obvious problem with the united airlines case was the implementation of their policy, not the policy itself.

Remember this doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the average amount, it has to be the amount to satisfy the person on the flight that is most easily satisfied. For the sake of argument let&amp;#39;s say that this number is $2000. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can now calculate the value of overbooking. It will make the airline $1000 more 95% of the time and cost them $2000 5% of the time. That means they make $850 more for the overbooking policy. And in this situation, who exactly is unhappy? Economics isn&amp;#39;t a zero sum game, this policy if implemented correctly creates wealth and happiness. You can create a game where everyone wins. In fact, in this example you could give the person $18,000 in compensation for not being able to catch their flight and the airline still profits. I&amp;#39;m sure most people wouldn&amp;#39;t mind catching a flight where there is a 5% chance I get paid $17,000. And remember in my example if you would rather catch the flight than get $18k, you can certainly do that, its only up to the most willing person to decide. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The obvious problem with the united airlines case was the implementation of their policy, not the policy itself. If they are offering a price nobody wants to take, they aren&amp;#39;t offering enough. And it&amp;#39;s competent unforgivable to do what they did to the poor guy of course. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg4bcrg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491949345.0, "created_utc": 1491920545.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 46}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qqka", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4b4if", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "foltaggio", "parent_id": "t1_dg4a0bp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Isn't that just called flying standby?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that just called flying standby?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg4b4if", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491949061.0, "created_utc": 1491920261.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qqka", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4c4wn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Satafly", "parent_id": "t1_dg4a0bp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Watch the video before commenting.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video before commenting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg4c4wn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491950285.0, "created_utc": 1491921485.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qqka", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hxvl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigetto", "parent_id": "t1_dg4a0bp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "From my understanding, they hope to gain extra money from every person on the plane to help reduce the ticket cost.\n\nAs he explains, airlines have realized all people care about is the price of the ticket, regardless of comforts.
