Four passengers were selected to be bumped, and three left without incident, Mr. Hobart said.\n\n&gt;He would not say whether the bumped passengers were chosen by a computer, human or some combination of the two. But factors can include how long a customer would have to stay at the airport before being rebooked, he said, and the airline looks to avoid separating families or leaving unaccompanied minors.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe explained the scenario to the customer,\u201d Mr. Hobart said. \u201cThat customer chose not to get out of his seat.\u201d\n\n&gt;In a statement, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of United Airlines, called the episode \u201can upsetting event to all of us here at United.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cI apologize for having to re-accomodate these customers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened.

Grabbing someone by the hands and yanking them with all your weight is not controlled. You could get injured, they could get injured. There's no control.
