The four words 'voiceless alveolar lateral affricate' are basically axes and each sound is a point on that graph. \n\nVoiced vs voiceless tells you if your vocal cords vibrate when making the sound. It is the difference between 'p' and 'b'.\n\nAlveolar describes the shape of your mouth. There any many different shapes your mouth can be, but basically the axis moves from the front of your mouth to the back. At the very front are your lips, which are called labial meaning both lips are used to make the sound. It goes all the way back to glottal. Alveolar means that your tongue sits on your alveolar ridge. That's the first step to making the sound.\n\nNext, let's look at lateral affricate. These two words together describe the airflow through the mouth. For example, nasal means no flow through the mouth and all flow through the nose. Lateral is hard to describe, but it basically means the air is flowing on the sides of the mouth. The best example is the 'L' sound where you hold the sound. Your tongue is touching your alveolar ridge, blocking air from going down the middle. If the word lateral is not included, then it's assumed the air is flowing down the middle.\n\nFinally let's look at an affricate. An affricate is between a stop and a fricative. A stop is a sound that requires a build up and release of air. 'T' is a good example. You can't hold a 't' because it needs the release of air. A fricative on the other hand, you can hold indefinitely. An example is 'sh' which is why you can shush someone. Another example is the 'L' sound I described for lateral. Combining 't' and 'sh' gives 'ch' which is an affricate. If you hold a 'ch' sound, it'll just be the same as 'sh'.\n\n'T' is the the alveolar stop. 'L' is the lateral fricative. What we want to to produce this sound is combine them. Before we can do that though, we need to unvoice 'L'. That just means don't activate your vocal cords. This makes a sound that just sounds like weird breathing. Add a 't' sound to the beginning to get a voiceless alveolar lateral affricate.\n\nFor more info about IPA, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\n\nFor this sound in particular, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_affricate", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any given sound, you need to know a few things to identify how to reproduce it.

Put your hand on your Adam's apple (which is your larynx, or voice box) and pronounce the sound \"zz\". Now pronounce the sound \"ss\". You should notice that for \"zz\", you could feel some vibration, while \"ss\" didn't produce any vibration. \"zz\" is a voiced sound, while \"ss\" is a voiceless sound. A \"voiceless\" sound is a sound made without vibrating the vocal cords.\n\n**Alveolar**: Trace your tongue from the back of your front teeth to the bony ridge(s) right behind them. That's called the alveolar ridge, and it's the place your tongue is when you pronounce sounds like \"t\", \"s\", or \"l\" (sometimes). An \"alveolar\" sound is a sound made by the placement of the tongue on the alveolar ridge. \n\n**Lateral**: Speech sounds are generally divided into categories based on (among other things) how air passes through the mouth during enunciation. In a \"lateral\" sound, air flows around both sides of the tongue at the same time  (or sometimes just one side). The only lateral sound in English, and in most languages, is \"l\" - try pronouncing a \"l\" sound and notice where your tongue is. Compare this to \"r\", which in most English dialects is \"central\" - air passes through the center of the mouth, not around the sides. A \"lateral\" sound is a sound where air passes through one or both sides of the mouth.\n\n**Affricate**: Another sound categorization based on the way air moves through the mouth. \"Fricatives\" are sounds like \"s\" or \"f\", which are created by blowing air through a small hole. \"Plosives\" or \"stops\", on the other hand, are sound like \"p\" and \"t\" that require an airtight seal to be made before the release of air. An \"affricate\" sound, like the \"ch\" in \"chase\" or the \"j\" in \"joke\", is kind of like a combination of the two. In an affricate, you first make an airtight seal like a plosive and then follow it with a fricative. Compare the words \"chin\" and \"shin\". The only difference in pronunciation between the two is that for \"chin\", you first had to position your tongue as if you were about to make the \"t\" sound before moving your tongue back to make the \"sh\" sound, whereas in \"shin\" your tongue was in position to make the \"sh\" sound from the beginning. In fact, the affricate \"ch\" is written in IPA as t\u0361\u0283, literally a \"t\" sound followed by a \"sh\" sound.\n\nPutting it all together, a voiceless alveolar lateral affricate is the sound made when the tongue goes to the alveolar ridge, makes an airtight seal, then pushes air around the sides of the mouth, all without vibrating the vocal cords.
