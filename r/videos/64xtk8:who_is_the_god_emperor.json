If you&amp;#39;re looking for more action oriented games instead of strategy games there is Warhammer Vermintide (which is like left 4 dead but with ratmen, magic, black powder and steel) and if you feel like playing an unstoppable super soldier than Space Marine by THQ is loads of fun, if you find it enjoyable you could try Eternal Crusade which is a meh f2p 3rd person shooter. There&amp;#39;s plenty more fun shit in the universe that I&amp;#39;m neglecting to mention such as Mordheim and Bloodbowl, as well as a load of tabletop rpgs that are fun to play if you&amp;#39;re looking for something other than D&amp;amp;D. I haven&amp;#39;t played the tabletop in years and don&amp;#39;t plan to but I still have a load of fun playing games set in the fantasy/40k universes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg67x2v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047232.0, "created_utc": 1492018432.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtk8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64q7s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "arrrghzi", "parent_id": "t1_dg5xhnc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "15 Horus Heresy books and The Emperor's Will are on Humble Book Bundle for 15 dollars though there is only 1 hour 20 mins left as of this comment", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 Horus Heresy books and The Emperor&amp;#39;s Will are on Humble Book Bundle for 15 dollars though there is only 1 hour 20 mins left as of this comment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg64q7s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043988.0, "created_utc": 1492015188.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtk8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xtk8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg66klx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WarbossTodd", "parent_id": "t1_dg64zrr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Black Library Audio Dramas are great as wel", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Black Library Audio Dramas are great as wel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg66klx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045885.0, "created_utc": 1492017085.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64zrr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lannister80", "parent_id": "t1_dg5xhnc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just read the fiction books.

You probably already know of it, even if you do, anyone that&amp;#39;s reading this, if you liked the big lore on this W40K video on this and are a fan of fantasy, check this book, it&amp;#39;s regarded among the best. It is a 10 book series by Steven Erikson, and Ian Esslemont made some books based on the lore too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lore is so dense it&amp;#39;s actually insane, I&amp;#39;m going through the first book and it&amp;#39;s pretty hard to get anything after you read it, half the way in everything starts to click though. But it starts with like 3 pages of dramatis personae, the world is huuuuge, and once you climb the big steep hill, you&amp;#39;ll see that the lore is actually really good, there is an imgur post that explains some things that I would recommend to read after reading the first book. If someone gets bored by the start of the book or doesn&amp;#39;t get things, don&amp;#39;t worry, it&amp;#39;s gonna get a better explanation later and you&amp;#39;ll get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we base ourselves on this video with that moral indicator, most of the characters are defined with the grey part. GoT is kind of like that, except for some good characters and extremely evil characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading the first book is the equivalent of learning how to play Dwarf Fortress, kind of hard to start but really rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg6oyco", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065651.0, "created_utc": 1492036851.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ykln", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dillatrack", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wa1i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I love getting into the more expansive/dark lores, GoT was the first that really sucked me in and dark souls is another favorite.  \n\nWhen it comes to 40K lore contradictions they have the whole \"history is written by the victors\" aspect that is convenient for dealing with inconsistency but they also get to play around with it in a cool way.
