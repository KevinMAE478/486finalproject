I lost one of my dogs to this. ):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: my mom is a veterinarian and I have raised and trained hunting dogs with my dad&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I stomach flip is also incredibly hard to detect for anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t have any experience with it. To a person without a degree in veterinarian medicine is just looks like the dog is acting or feeling a bit funny.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "videos", "name": "t1_dg3v01h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491914056.0, "created_utc": 1491885256.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64kjo5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3gvn7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Knathan82", "parent_id": "t3_64kjo5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sucks this happened, but flying with your pet in the cargo hold is risky business.
