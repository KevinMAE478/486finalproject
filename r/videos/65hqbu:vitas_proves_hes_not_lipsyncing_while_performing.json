And the bigger the concert, the more challenging it becomes to the point where lip-synching becomes necessary in order to maintain the performance. The truth is simply that for most large acts, you are more than likely seeing them lip-sync.\n\nIdeally in order to sing properly you need to be able to hear yourself properly in order to keep your pitch and breath control normalized. And coming out of a big PA system doesn't help because it's slightly delayed and you are constantly trying to correct for what you hear from that PA system. That makes you sound like shit... and often it'll make you sound just as bad as you see in that video you linked. He's trying to sing along but he can't actually hear his own singing.\n\nYes, there are ways that some bands try to work around it. Good sound-isolating earphones with a feed directly to the singers mic is one way, but even then there's this very slight delay that can be very difficult to train yourself to ignore. Not saying it can't be done, but it literally takes years of practice to get to that point and some people just can't do it. In particular falsetto is very hard because you don't hear it in your head the way you do most normal singing... you feel it in your skull as a vibration. But on stage it's so loud that EVERYTHING is vibrating and you can't really control the pitch as well.\n\nTo be honest also OP's video doesn't prove Vitas isn't lip-syncing... it just proves they're using the isolated recorded vocal track and in order to \"prove he's not lip-syncing\" they have some guy whose job it is to move the volume slider as Vitas moves his microphone around. If it's been well planned that would be relatively easy.\n\nSOURCE: Ex studio sound engineer who's also done some stage singing but don't have the range I had in my teens and 20's any more :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fairness to Vitas, singing on stage is vastly different and more challenging than singing in a studio.
