It's risky though and no, not legal if it is being sold as new with logos. \n\nYou can talk to the vendors over facebook, we-chat, or skype. Most of the sales team are super cute girls and they know english well. They get recruited right out of university and promised good pay and life in the big city. They are aggressive and driven but very polite. They also know the market well. If you need a special part the company does not have they will walk down to the street vendors or go to the parts mall and find it for you. \n\nIt is quite easy to place orders through email or right on facebook. Sending money is via paypal / wire transfer etc. The buying process has an interesting dynamic to it. Doing business with China is built around relationships. Once you become a good customer you will gain access to more and higher quality parts. Your sales rep will send you presents and takes great care to learn about you and your family. It's not uncommon for them to add goodies in your orders. I often find things for my kids. Could be treats or fun electronics toys that they find in the street markets. I have also learned about my sales reps and their families and the Chinese culture. It is always interesting to talk to them about the way America is perceived. They share music and TV shows with me too.   \n\nGoing to China is a once a year or every few years type thing to cement relationships. Often times your sales rep will offer to host you in their home and be your tour guide. Getting a Visa is about $180 if you expedite it. Airfare in coach is about $800. So if you were just flying over to get an iPhone it would be more cost effective to just grab a used on off ebay :D \n\nSo all of that sounds pretty cool right? Well, the legality of the whole thing is,... it's not exactly. Part shipments can and do get seized. Anything having to do with Apple is gray market. If the parts have an apple logo on them they will get seized. Ordering any parts that have the apple markings is ultra risky. Not go to jail risky but a $10,000 order can vanish and there is no refunds for a seized shipment. Thus an entire industry that \"copies\" the parts and leaves off the apple logos was born. These copied parts will almost always make it stateside. \n\nWhen buying phone parts one has to be aware that there are quality levels. They range from B or C grade which is junk to A, AAA or A++, also called High Copy (high quality copy) and Original or OEM. Original parts and OEM parts in the market are often Apple Quality Control rejects or \"fell off the truck\" and come from Apple contracted factories. These high-quality parts are sought after by everyone, thus in short supply. Apple has conducted some raids and put a lot of people in jail over in China trying to keep this under control. About 2 years ago there were a few raids of shops in port cities and the shop owners lost all their merchandise. Nobody I know of went to jail but getting half a mil of inventory confiscated was a shock and put a few folks out of business. Newsflash to Apple - It didn't slow anything down.  \n\nOver the years employees have/had gotten very good at sneaking the technology out of the factories. The locals were building the same machines found in legit apple factories but they used cheaper parts. After a bunch of rapid prototyping, they figured it out. Now by the time a new iPhone comes out there is a full blown knock off factory making screens and parts for the new phone. Many times I have seen pictures of functional copy parts long before the new iPhones are launched. The vendors know that Apple will hunt them down if they leak out too much information so they do a pretty good job of keeping their own processes under wraps until after the phones go on sale. Chances are if you get your phone fixed at a small shop, you have these copied parts in your phone. SO its a copy part made using copied machines. \n\nWhat separates a good shop from a bad shop is the relationship they have with their suppliers in China. The Chinese are extremely loyal and if you take care of them they will take care of you even if you are not a huge company. Often times the sales rep will take the time to go sit in the testing lab or hand pick your parts if you ask them to. This is the only way to get really good stuff. Someone on the inside has to help you and be your representative. Because the truth is that many of the, mostly men, behind the scenes who run these operations do not give a shit about people like me. They see sneaking a few defects into your order as a way of business. They think if you as the buyer don't care enough to check your order when you get it, that's your own fault. It becomes almost a game. They are very accommodating if you point out the issue and will send you replacements. This is why the sales reps are sooooo important. They can stop this from happening.  In a business that runs on word of mouth and is extremely competitive on price, this is where you as a consumer can win big. If your local shop gets good parts and has reasonable prices that probably means they pay 20-40 percent more for their parts. They also have trusted people on the ground in China. If your shop buys them from the local importers down by the docks or from a big wholesaler they are making lots of money off you and selling you shit. The number one thing to look at is the warranty. Solid vendors will stand behind the parts and the shop will pass the same warranty to you. The stuff I get has a lifetime warranty. Some of my competitors that charge more than me and for whom I have had to do reworks offer 15 days and use B or C grade parts. None of my contacts in China have ever even heard of them. \n\nIf you buy phone parts on eBay, Amazon or through any USA based wholesaler website you are probably buying shit. B grade parts passed off as higher quality. These guys buy in massive quantities and, or invest in the copy factories and have parts produced to a certain standard which cuts some corners. They focus completely on volume and don't care much about quality. This is shifting a little bit after some backlash from the repair shops. We worked hard to help the China market troubleshoot issues with screen separation, color accuracy, and brightness. We want our customers to have a good experience and feel safe using our businesses. Unfortunately, some of the big chains in the USA didn't care about that and just wanted to make quick money grabs. I won't name names but these reasons above are why you should be asking where your local shop gets their parts and how they procure them.  \n\nThe newest generation of copies in the 6s and 7 was quite good at launch. In the past, we knew that the first few batches would have some issues because of the speed at which the whole process moves. It's really fucking cut throat over there. Just missing a launch window by a few days could kill a startup screen copy business. So shortcuts are made. But they are learning. Fast. The phone accessory market is the same way. I can get otter boxes both legit and copies before they even hit the market. What's funny is that getting a case with a Disney or Professional Sports logo is more dangerous to me and them than trying to get functional iPhone motherboards. If I got caught with one of those cases in my store I could lose everything.  \n\nOther manufacturers do not hammer down as hard on the gray market. Samsung will even let large wholesalers buy directly from them.  There is a copy market for Samsung but because Samsung embraces repair in a small way, there is a higher likelihood that if you get a Samsung screen fixed in the USA, you are getting a real Samsung part. Samsungs are a bitch to work on though. The parts are also much more expensive because there is less demand and the technology is all based on OLED not LCD.  \n\nI could go on and on. The battery market is super interesting too. Most replacement laptop and phone batteries on eBay and amazon are just used, reset to 0 cycles using a hack, then reskinned. Some batteries are built from old unsold merchandise. China also has an astonishing footprint on E-Bay and Amazon. You have to be really careful with the stuff you are buying. For example those hoverboards. Fucking horrendous quality control. Because they were born on the streets of china. Literally put together with knock-off electronics, knock off batteries and hot glue. Nothing about them UL listed or certified. The sheer volume of stuff imported from china, especially electronics means that almost nothing is certified or inspected to be safe. You are probably ok with little toy electronics run on battery but you couldn't pay me to use anything that plugs into the wall if it was off the street in Shenzhen. \n\nWhat is even more disturbing is you saw how fast they can laser etch branding and serial numbers on something. Making stickers and etching in plastic is that easy too. Counterfeit stuff is EVERYWHERE. The phone cable and charger industry are even worse. Most of the stuff at Walmart, the dollar store, local gas station or the grocery store is pure rubbish. Dangerous rubbish. Not UL listed. Zero safety inspections. Zero safety features. Yet I bet every single American household has several of these potential fire hazards in every bedroom, car and junk drawer. These things fry your phone slowly and are the leading cause of charge port and phone electrical issues.     \n\nEdit to add. \n\nThere is also a vibrant screen recycling industry here stateside. They do what the guy in the video did but with better machines and inside clean rooms. I sell all my apple screens to one of these places and they refurbish them. These are awesome because the part is all apple and has better reliability than even the best copies from china. \n\nEdited for spelling and grammar.

My phone was under a contract so I needed to change it to his name. I work with my coworker as a translator in order to figure out exactly what I need to do. They tell me I need a copy of my identity card (in color, which was a real pain) and my friend's signature. So we go there and try to do all this. The woman tells me it isn't possible. Why? Because it just can't be done.\n\nSo for the next 20 minutes we debated with this woman that we were told over the phone exactly what was needed and we have everything, just change the name and contact details. Still, can't be done. So finally I am fed up and I tell her that I am leaving the country, I still owe over $400 on the phone, and if they don't transfer the name I'm just stealing it out of the country. This, FINALLY, gets her to contact her boss who tells her exactly what to do. She didn't want to look like she didn't know what to do, because that would be against \"face\".\n\nExample 2: While at the bank I wanted to do... something. Details are long gone, but I knew it was possible. Again, have a translator. I sit down at the teller and translate everything required. I get told I can't do it, it's not possible. Okay. Stand up, walk to the teller right next to the first teller, and request the same thing. No problem, situation resolved in minutes.\n\nNow, for some people, this could just be a minor quirk of a different society.

One friend asked if the dish he wanted had any peanuts in it. The waitress said no. The friend asked if she could check with the chef, because he is very allergic and wanted to make sure. She waved it off and again said that it did not involve peanuts. Friend, basically pissed at this point, tells her \"If I consume peanuts I will die. Will you please go and ask the chef?\" So she finally left to go and check. And yes, it used ~~peanut oil~~ something that would kill him (detail has long left brain).\n\nEdit 2: Since a lot of people are latching onto the idea of \"just lazy\", I want to share a cultural problem with Confucianism.\n\nA major tenet of this type of thinking is the idea that the person above you has higher authority and knows better.
