There's only one way to explain why cutting works. \n\nCutting makes it stop.\n\nFeeling like your heart is gonna jump out of your mouth you're so anxious? Cutting makes it stop. Can't focus because you keep hearing the same voice over and over from that one day that never leaves you? Cutting makes it stop. Feeling so empty you don't see why you should bother doing anything? Cutting makes it stop.\n\nMedication helps. Support and love make it easier to endure. Therapy helps you work through it over time. But cutting makes it *stop*. \n\nAnd when all you want is to make it stop, it's really, really hard to remember why scarring yourself is such a bad thing. Who cares if you have to wear long sleeves in summer? Who cares if it makes your mom cry? Who cares if your boyfriend threatens to call the police to stop you from hurting yourself? They just don't understand what you're dealing with. If they did, they wouldn't bother you. Wouldn't they rather you make it stop? Don't they want you to feel better, even if only for a moment? Making it stop is all that matters, and cutting makes it stop.\n\nAnd then all of the sudden you look around, with your knives and safety pins and needles stashed in every conceivable location, with little marks all over your body in red and pink and finally white, that you realize that maybe cutting *doesn't* make it stop. Maybe cutting just makes you forget about it for a minute. Because if cutting makes it stop, why don't your fingernails do it anymore? Why are you pulling out clumps of hair instead of individual strands? Why did you have to go from a scratcher to a pin to a knife to a serrated one just to get the same relief? \n\nSo you stop for a while. You work the program, go to therapy. You cry a lot. You scream. You fight. You draw in red, you clench ice in your fist, you tell yourself you don't wanna go back to that again. And eventually you have your coping mechanisms. You've started opening up to people. You take your medication every day. You're doing better.\n\nAnd then you have one flashback, one panic attack that throws you for a loop. You're crying, hyperventilating, collapsed on the ground. You're trying to catch your breath. You underestimate your distance to the wall when you go to lean on it and bang your head a little. \n\nSuddenly, relief. Your body remembers that flood of relief. You bang your head again. A little more relief. \n\nYou know it's not gonna help, not really. You know in the morning you'll look back and be mad at yourself. But you need that relief right now. You can't live like this, but you don't wanna die. \n\nYou wrap a strand of hair around your fingers and pull. Your heart rate slows just a little. You take a full breath for the first time in an hour. \n\nYou tell yourself you'll regret it, but you don't care. All the old tricks come rushing back. Fingernails in your arm, head on the wall, hand in your hair, whatever it takes. You don't care about tomorrow. You don't care about a minute from now. You just want to make it stop. And cutting makes it stop.\n\nSorry this got really rambling. I didn't realize how much I need to get this out. I haven't self harmed in a month or two now. I started 7 years ago.
