You would have to clean it from the top of the land in areas where the radiation was at unacceptable levels. Your daddy's shop-vac won't be up to the task.\n\nSince nuclear weapons are more likely to be deployed over areas with buildings and things that rise from the ground and have complicated geometries, cleaning everything by sweeping or vacuuming up the dust is not likely to work very well.\n\nRinsing the area with rain or other water will carry the dust away from the populated areas, and concentrate it in canals, rivers, streams, lakes, and so on. As long as it doesn't dissolve into the water, radiation won't be a tremendous concern.\n\nA big problem will be what soaks into the soil. Soil soaking won't carry it deep enough to absorb most of the radiation, and worse yet, plants will pick it up and carry it back above soil level.
