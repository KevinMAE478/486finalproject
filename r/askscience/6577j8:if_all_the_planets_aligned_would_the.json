And this is happening all the time, you don't need the planets to align. The changes in orbit are usually very small, but there's still a possibility for dramatic catastrophe in our Solar System in the future.\n\n----------------------\n\nLonger answer:\n\nA planet having only one 'orbit' is only true there is only the sun and the planet and nothing else in the universe. (And if you ignore things like general relativity decaying the orbit.) Once you add more than one planet around a star, the orbits are technically always changing and in a way that we cannot predict. This is known as the [N-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem).\n\nIn our own solar system, that means Earth's orbit is slightly changing *all the time* due to the very small tugs from the other planets (I believe Jupiter is actually the dominant factor on the Earth's orbits despite being so far away). We usually ignore this because the changes are so small, but we're actually starting to think about this a lot because of the way we detect exoplanets.\n\nThe effects of the tiny tugs from other planets means that Earth arrives at the same spot in its orbit a few minutes early or late every year. This means if some other civilization were observing the sun and watched the Earth [transit](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/656348main_ToV_transit_diag_full.jpg) in front of the Sun, they'd see it happen at slightly different times and could therefore conclude the presence of other planets like Jupiter or Venus even if they didn't see those planets transit.\n\nThis is in fact exactly what *we* are doing with exoplanet systems and how we measure things like the masses of planets by measuring the strength of those little tugs away from a perfect orbit.\n\nIn the long term, this also means that Earth's orbit has changed. Our eccentricity has and will continue to vary on million year timescales, which affects climate models.\n\nAnd because of the chaotic nature of the N-body problem, that means we can't predict the future of the Solar System more than a hundred million years or so in advance. Which is why we have to simulate the Solar System millions of times and see what possible outcomes there could be. In most of the cases, not much happens -- but our Solar System is not formally stable. There is a chance (of order ~1% I believe) that something crazy happens like Mercury being completely ejected out of the Solar System or colliding with Venus and making the whole Solar System unstable within a few billion years (before the Sun dies).\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.
