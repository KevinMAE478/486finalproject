The more massive a black hole, the bigger this zone is. The more massive a black hole (bh), the less hawking radiation (hr).\nNow my problem: If hr occurs at the event horizon, the virtual particle escaping it would need to travel close to the speed of light but would be a lot of energy for a random occurence with very little energy (?). \nIf it occurs millions of km away and the escaping particle just barely hits just the distance from the bh where it&amp;#39;s velocity would allow it to not instantly get dragged back, wouldnt it just go into orbit around the bh and then not be hr?

(not the event horizon) Virtual particles are not affected by gravity in any way. The virtual particle annihilating in the bh just happend to travel right into the surface when it was created while the other one just happend not to, because it went the other way and continues to do so beacause it&amp;#39;s counter part found another counter part in the bh.

So physicists say that we can assume it&amp;#39;s a singularity because it is a waste of time to think about the properties of something we cannot ever measure. But in this case it might make sense to theorize about a black hole&amp;#39;s volume. I mean why would a neutron star to which you add a lot of mass suddenly lose all it&amp;#39;s volume and become a 0 dimensional singularity instead of just becoming denser and smaller?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg9gr97", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492220327.0, "created_utc": 1492191527.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg967hw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iHaveAgency", "parent_id": "t3_65bmlv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I assume that a black hole is a spherical piece of mass such as a neutron star, just denser\n\nNot correct.
