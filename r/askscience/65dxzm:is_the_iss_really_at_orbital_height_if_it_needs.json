Just like the ISS needs re-boosting to maintain orbit, so would any other object that is at or crosses that altitude. Thus, any debris that could possibly hit the ISS will degrade and burn up in weeks or months at most, instead of staying in orbit for decades or more. This helps keep the ISS safe from impact by orbital debris.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg9xjv3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241202.0, "created_utc": 1492212402.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dxzm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgafrnj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_65dxzm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": 1492248872.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgafrnj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492271633.0, "created_utc": 1492242833.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
