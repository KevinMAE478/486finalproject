Therefore you can not claim that having 5 or 6 people out of 20 on this list indicates over-representation among the world's peoples.\n\nHowever, what *is* significant is how many black people there are on the list from the United States, from among the African Diaspora. The odds of randomly having just more than one person from the US, *between Africans*, on that list already are less than 1%.
