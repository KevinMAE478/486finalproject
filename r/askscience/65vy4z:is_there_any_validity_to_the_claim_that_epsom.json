This is for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;much smaller bather load (usually one, but some places allow for couples floats - but it&amp;#39;s rare)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;children are much less likely to use them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a LOT less likely to ingest the water or get it in your eyes (it&amp;#39;s very uncomfortable to do so with that much epsom salt).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Water treatment is actually incredibly easy and there are no reported cases of anyone ever contracting a disease from a float tank (that I&amp;#39;m aware of). The tanks are filtered in between each session, although regulation standards to vary quite a bit. Typically it will be some combination of UV, hydrogen peroxide, o-zone, chlorine, and/or bromine. The industry standard is trying to move towards a combination of UV and peroxide because the other systems have issues with off-gassing which is an issue for an enclosed space that pools don&amp;#39;t have to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This off-gassing isn&amp;#39;t an issue for the average user, but instead for the employees who experience constant daily exposure. Plus, the benefit of UV/peroxide is that the byproduct is literally water and it has been proven effective enough to even treat wastewater and recycle it into drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgdsvnw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478996.0, "created_utc": 1492450196.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgds9q5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "alystair", "parent_id": "t1_dgdpoir", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How difficult is it to filter/\"clean\" the water compared to a normal pool?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How difficult is it to filter/&amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; the water compared to a normal pool?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgds9q5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478313.0, "created_utc": 1492449513.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vy4z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vy4z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdsyql", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jungletigress", "parent_id": "t1_dgdsepb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1.
