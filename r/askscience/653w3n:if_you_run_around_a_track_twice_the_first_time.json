I was going to write it as a formula but I see at least one other person has done a really good job of that, so you've got several good explanations of why infinite speed is the correct answer.  \n  \nBut here's why 'If you run the first lap at 6 km/h and then the second lap at 18 km/h you get an average of 12 km/h. That average is 2v1' is not correct - simply put, to get an average of 12 km/h from running at 6 km/h and then speeding up to 18 km/h you would have to run at each speed for the same length of time, eg. running at 6 km/h for one hour means you've run 6 km, then running at 18 km/h for one hour means you've run another 18 km - that's a total of 24 km in 2 hours, or 12 km/h, as you said. The problem with applying that to this example is we're talking about laps of a fixed length - so if a lap was 6 km and you ran at 6 km/h you would do the first lap in one hour. But then if you ran the second lap at 18 km/h it would only take you 20 minutes, not the one hour required to get your average speed up to 12 km/h. You've still covered a total of 12 km but you've only been running for 80 minutes, or 1.33 hours, giving you an average speed of 9 km/h. So that is why what you wrote is incorrect.  \n  \nSo now consider this - if you ran the first lap of 6 km at 6 km/h, taking one hour, then did the second lap at 36 km/h (twice the 18 km/h in your example) you would do the second lap in 10 minutes, so again a total of 12 km but this time in 70 minutes, for an average of 10.29 km/h. Double that again, running the second lap in 5 minutes at 72 km/h for a total of 12 km in 65 minutes, you'd get an average of 11.08 km/h. So doubling the speed gains you an extra 1.29 km/h average speed but then doubling it again only increases the average by 0.79 km/h - the more you increase the speed of the second lap, the less you gain in average speed overall (if you graphed it out, it would be an asymptotic curve, like a half-life).

But, wait, we just established that we need 2 minutes to do 2 laps at 60 miles per hour. With the 30 mph lap, we&amp;#39;ve already &amp;quot;used up&amp;quot; our 2 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we want our average to stay at 2 minutes, how fast would we have to do the second lap? Infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re thinking &amp;quot;NO, the answer is 90!&amp;quot; then I want you to look at this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 mile at 30 miles per hour? Takes 2 minutes, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about 1 mile at 90 miles per hour? 40 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we just took 2 minutes and 40 seconds to do 2 miles. We need to average 2 miles in 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if we hit the nitrous for the second lap and did it at 200 miles per hour? 18 seconds. That&amp;#39;s still 18 seconds too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if we slingshot around the sun for the second lap, and did it at 0.5c? 10.7 microseconds. That&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;still too slow&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;#39;s 2 minutes and 10.7 microseconds. To do 2 laps at 60mph, we need to do it in &lt;strong&gt;2 minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s why it needs to be infinite.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg84e0w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142122.0, "created_utc": 1492113322.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653w3n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg84zms", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "leonprimrose", "parent_id": "t3_653w3n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's a question of time.
