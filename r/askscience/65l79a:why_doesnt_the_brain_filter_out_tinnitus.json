Now updated.**\n\nThe best answer for this question is simply that the neuroscience of tinnitus is still poorly understood. [Here is a review from 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073522/) (no paywall) and [another from 2015](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v16/n10/full/nrn4003.html) that focuses on human neuroimaging (paywall), but both of these reviews say that more research needs to be done. Part of the problem is that tinnitus is very heterogeneous. People can perceive very different types of sounds, and it can affect/distress people in very different ways. This makes tinnitus a difficult thing to study.\n\nWith that disclaimer, let's jump in.\n\nThe filtering mechanism you're referring to is called [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation) and there are versions of it in every sensory system, including hearing. For example, in the presence of loud noise, [the medial olivocochlear system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivocochlear_system) is a neural circuit that helps to shift the sensitivity of the sensory cells in the [cochlea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea) to maintain a good dynamic range, i.e. it helps your ability to hear despite the presence of noise. However, there are different types of adaptation that occur at multiple levels in the auditory system, from the most peripheral parts in the cochlea to the most central parts in the cortex. My point here is that just because one type of adaptation exists (like your vision example) does not mean the brain is able to adapt perfectly to *any* input.\n\n**Edit** \n\nIn most cases, tinnitus is associated with some type of hearing loss, and usually, the perceived sounds occur near the affected frequency range. The most commonly proposed explanation for these cases is that damage in the cochlea leads to reduced input into the brainstem structures that first process the sound. Here, plastic changes occur in order to compensate for the reduced input. It's thought that these types of changes lead to abnormal activity that are eventually interpreted by higher-level areas as phantom sounds. \n\nBut as I said earlier, higher-level areas in the cortex have their own adaptation processes, so you may ask why can't those adaptive processes prevent tinnitus even if the sub-cortical adaptive processes are damaged. It turns out that many non-auditory areas do have abnormalities in people with tinnitus, e.g. parts of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system (this is from the second review I linked). These areas are involved with a wide variety of functions and *may* be involved in how distressing people find their tinnitus. \n\nIn other words, people who are not bothered as much by their tinnitus may have more effective filtering due to adaptive processes in these non-auditory parts of their brain. Conversely, these areas may not be as effective in people with more severe tinnitus. To quote the second review I linked: \" ... the sound percept itself could be the result of increased activity in the auditory pathways and permitted or even facilitated by interactions of auditory brain areas with non-auditory brain networks.\" \n\n**Edit 2 [tl;dr]**\n\nTinnitus is a complicated disorder that likely involves many parts of the brain and is still poorly understood. The brain's ability (or inability) to \"filter\" out tinnitus may be related to how distressing people find their tinnitus. People that are less distressed by their tinnitus may have more effective adaptation processes that involve the interaction of non-auditory and auditory parts of the brain. \n\n ", "edited": 1492368441.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed this thread is becoming filled with speculative answers (even after being unlocked), so I am prematurely submitting this with only a few sources and will be adding more soon.

This makes tinnitus a difficult thing to study.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that disclaimer, let&amp;#39;s jump in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The filtering mechanism you&amp;#39;re referring to is called &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation\"&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt; and there are versions of it in every sensory system, including hearing. For example, in the presence of loud noise, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivocochlear_system\"&gt;the medial olivocochlear system&lt;/a&gt; is a neural circuit that helps to shift the sensitivity of the sensory cells in the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea\"&gt;cochlea&lt;/a&gt; to maintain a good dynamic range, i.e. it helps your ability to hear despite the presence of noise. However, there are different types of adaptation that occur at multiple levels in the auditory system, from the most peripheral parts in the cochlea to the most central parts in the cortex. My point here is that just because one type of adaptation exists (like your vision example) does not mean the brain is able to adapt perfectly to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases, tinnitus is associated with some type of hearing loss, and usually, the perceived sounds occur near the affected frequency range. The most commonly proposed explanation for these cases is that damage in the cochlea leads to reduced input into the brainstem structures that first process the sound. Here, plastic changes occur in order to compensate for the reduced input. It&amp;#39;s thought that these types of changes lead to abnormal activity that are eventually interpreted by higher-level areas as phantom sounds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I said earlier, higher-level areas in the cortex have their own adaptation processes, so you may ask why can&amp;#39;t those adaptive processes prevent tinnitus even if the sub-cortical adaptive processes are damaged. It turns out that many non-auditory areas do have abnormalities in people with tinnitus, e.g. parts of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system (this is from the second review I linked). These areas are involved with a wide variety of functions and &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be involved in how distressing people find their tinnitus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, people who are not bothered as much by their tinnitus may have more effective filtering due to adaptive processes in these non-auditory parts of their brain. Conversely, these areas may not be as effective in people with more severe tinnitus. To quote the second review I linked: &amp;quot; ... the sound percept itself could be the result of increased activity in the auditory pathways and permitted or even facilitated by interactions of auditory brain areas with non-auditory brain networks.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2 [tl;dr]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is a complicated disorder that likely involves many parts of the brain and is still poorly understood. The brain&amp;#39;s ability (or inability) to &amp;quot;filter&amp;quot; out tinnitus may be related to how distressing people find their tinnitus. People that are less distressed by their tinnitus may have more effective adaptation processes that involve the interaction of non-auditory and auditory parts of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgc8npi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492389709.0, "created_utc": 1492360909.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l79a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbmc70", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_65l79a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgbmc70", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492342204.0, "created_utc": 1492313404.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l79a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l79a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc6ies", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YaBoyMax", "parent_id": "t1_dgc5jsz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This doesn't account for why we're able to \"filter out\" other constant background noises.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t account for why we&amp;#39;re able to &amp;quot;filter out&amp;quot; other constant background noises.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgc6ies", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492386834.0, "created_utc": 1492358034.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5jsz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrTurner45XO", "parent_id": "t3_65l79a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tinnitus could be from a number of causes.

Since you mentioned you know about adaptation/attenuation and u/shiftyeyedgoat has covered the general distinction between primary and secondary causes, I will talk about the simple version of the mechanism of signal transduction.  First, I want to make it clear that here are many possibilities based on the models we have floating about right now. We simply do not know the mechanistic nature of tinitus. Because of this, its not exactly possible to know which interaction leads to what on an experimental level. We can still discuss the theoretical implications based on the various known signalling mechanisms. I will give a high level overview of those possibilities. If you would like to talk about the low level mechanisms from various studied examples, I recommend skype/discord.\n\nFrom school you know most nerves in our body are actually very poor sensory organs. We have evolved specialized receptors at the tips of our nerve endings that can respond to various organic and inorganic cues (like neurotransmitters, electromagnetic fields, mechanical stimulation etc.). This only solved a small portion of our sensory problem, because those chemical cues are not always directly available in the environment. So to bridge that gap there are sensory organs throughout our body which can react to common stimuli in the environment and translate it into one of the signals the receptors on our nerves can pick up. These sensory organs can be large aggregates, like our eyes or small aggregates like [mechano/thermo-receptor](http://www.starsandseas.com/SAS%20Physiology/Neurology/Touch.htm) that are spread over your entire body.  When the type of environmental stimulus a sensory organ can pick up is present, it releases something (doesn't mater what) that can interact directly (currents, chemical gradients etc.) or indirectly (molecular receptors  ) with the nerve that will carry the signal.\n\nNow, once a nerve picks up its signal there are quite a few criteria that need to be met before that signal will carry. Since you know about attenuation, I'm going to assume you know the basics like whats an action potential, de/re-polarizing events, how the axon strives to reach equilibrium after every depolarizing event etc. etc. so I can focus on the criteria.\n\nFor simplicity I'm going to focus on indirect signal transaction, but it applies to direct transduction too (for the most part). Once a molecular signal binds to its receptor, the first two criterion in cellular signal transduction are tested. First, does the bound ligand interact in all the appropriate ways to achieve complete signal transduction ? If not, the receiving cell may not respond correctly to the signal, and transduction may not even initiate. This means the cell will either not respond, incompletely respond, be left unable to respond or in crease rare cases like in Eph receptor mersylation, always/continuously respond. The second criteria is whether enough of the signaling molecule is present. If a certain level of receptor activity is not picked up, the cell will not respond even if the signal is there. There are however, ways around this, through the first criteria. If a signal transduction is successful, the pattern on receptors a cell displays can change. This can make it express more receptors (which can make it more sensitive to signals), internalize receptors (decreasing sensitivity),  change the mechanism of transduction to other signals making them more or less sensitive to other signals in the environment, express entirely new receptors etc etc etc. To get a better understanding of this go back to action potentials, and read about their molecular mechanisms, specifically about the CREB mechanisms role in changing the sensitivity of signals. Once these dynamic criteria worked out, the cell will either be ready to depolarize or not, but it has changed.\n\nNow comes the fun bit, in cases of tinitus that impacts the sensory organs or the pathways involved in cellular communication, it is possible to have an always active signal. One signalling mechanism might be telling the nerve ending to express receptor A and B and C in X quantity etc etc. And at different times A, B and C might independently trigger depolarizing events, but because they are different signals they keep being transmitted.  There are so many nerve bundles that cyclic activation can keep them permanently activated.\n\nNow for cases of tinitus that impact the nerve cell it self, it can directly bypass the nerve signaling mechanisms, and directly depolarize the cell somewhere along the axon, and if the depolarizing event is strong enough the signal will keep traveling. But thats not usually enough for a signal to be always on. Think about it this way, a nerve cell isn't a perfect conductor. There are always some leaky events happening that create a certain amount of background noise signal in the cell. Conditions that impact how leaky a cell becomes always change the intensity of this background noise. It can become easier or harder for signals that normally would or wouldn't make it through to just be transmitted. Signal detection theory tells us that a signal must be above background noise to be noticed. If it is not, the signal is still there and only adding to the background noise. Depending on how the cellular signal transduction or a secondary condition has changed the nerve cell, the ceiling of what is considered noise can be increased. But because the intensity is now high enough, the noise it self counts as the signal and be persistently transmitted. But things are stranger still.\n\nNormally you think of signals as something that must be actively transmitted. But thats not always the case. The absence of a signal can also be interpreted as a signal. When nerve cells are active, it can be interpreted as normal behavior. But if transduction or a secondary condition has caused them to behave differently from their always on state, it can also be detected as a permanently active signal. Depending on which conduction pathways is impacted, and how it has been impacted, a similar spectrum of possibilities arises from the absence of signals as with he presence of signals discussed above.\n\nNow it gets even weirder still. Normlly you think about signals being picked up from the environment and heading to your brain. But what about the noise you brain generates ? One of my favourite examples of this is a big bang/thunder thud sound patients report hearing, but there is no activity found in the auditory pathway. A sound that completely exists in your head. Some work suggests that it may be due to [paroxysmal depolarizing shifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy3jF2-nCaA). Normally these are vents that occur over large areas of the brain can propagate to result in seizures. But they can happen in small regions and be more docile resulting in various problems. If they happen along your auditory processing centers, a persistent and cyclic tinitus is possible. But there are many things that can happen in yourt auditory sensory region. It is after all a bundle of cells. The same complexities of signal transduction I mention above can also form an entire new spectrum of events at this level leading to tinitus. \n\nOverall, the notion of a signal that just dies out is false. A neuron may become fatigued (the rate at which it establishes equilibrium after a shift but be lower that the rate it which it is asked to depolarize, or genetic/molecular level changes impact signal transduction etc.).  The recovery of these cells happens at a tremendous pace, and although a signal transduction even may lead to a cell changing strength at which it responds to a signal, it is rarely eliminated. Tinitus happens over a relative short range of high frequencies, but each of those frequencies has its own cells that respond that stimulus. Over the range of the active tinitus, it is  possible for a signal to always make it through. In fact, if you ask tinitus patients to describe it, the usual answer is a high pitched whine of some sort. But if you ask for a more detailed description, patients can tell you the that the intensity of the pitch changes when they focus on it, it goes up and down within a small range, almost like producing different notes. This isn't exactly supporting evidence, but considering the nature of the condition its difficult to say much else. Sure when the cause of the tinitus is in a measurable region of the auditory pathway, we have instruments that can define that range, but as you now know, the signal or lack thereof can originate and propagate from almost anywhere. The attenuation you have learned about really only reflects the fatigue an axon suffers to a single persistent stimulus. But there are a host of changes that impact this transmittance.
