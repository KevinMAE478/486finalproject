So depending on the direction of the polarisation filter in your glasses, this either cuts out reflections or increases them (relative to the other light passing through). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see why this wouldn&amp;#39;t apply to UV light?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think I may have misunderstood your original point.
