The reason why this happens is, that there is some energy stored in the magnetic field inside your inductor, which causes the voltage spikes. The amplitude of the voltage is directly related to the inductance of the load.\n\nIf we take a look at the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor):\n\nv=*L* di/dt\n\nI would say that the rise/fall times of transistors would be a good estimation for the time in which your transistor will turn off. The resulting spike will easily be high enough to cause damage to the transistor.\n\nIf you're using relays to turn off your inductive load it's hard to tell, as there will generally be some arcing between the contact, when you're trying to disconnect. Also, there is a big difference if the current is AC or DC, but your relay datasheet should give you the maximum load that can be switched safely.\n\nBonus question regarding loudspeakers:\nThey actually have some significant inductance. The value is the actual *impedance* of the speaker, not it's DC resistance. The DC resistance for an 8 Ohm rated speaker would usually be around 6 Ohms or something like that. For any audio application, you would not generally have a DC component that you would want to turn off suddenly- this would not be very nice music at all, but yes, if you went out of your way to drive a loudspeaker with DC and suddenly (let's say withing microseconds or even quicker) turn the current off, you could very well damage your transistors.\n\n\nThankfully, there is a very easy way to prevent any kind of damage to your electronics and this is to just connect a diode in parallel to your inductive load, but oriented so that it is polarized in reverse by your typical driving voltage. When you disconnect the load, the current will instead flow almost unimpeded in the other way through your diode and no significant voltage spike will be generated.
