I'm seeing a lot of esoteric answers in this thread which certainly make some contribution, but I'm pretty positive that this is the most correct answer. I work in electrochemistry so I wanted to elaborate a bit. \n\nA DC voltage will give you a very quick spike in current, which decreases rapidly as the ions in solution migrate to opposite ends of your cell, producing an EMF to counter the applied voltage. The vast majority of the current being carried through the water (at low voltages anyway) is due to movement of ions, so once ions quit moving *en masse*, your current nearly stops. Any remaining current after this point is going to be due to things actually reacting electrochemically (primarily water splitting into H2 and O2), and that's going to require a certain minimum voltage to happen, explaining why you only get a DC current after about 250mV.\n\nAn AC voltage, on the other hand, constantly reverses polarity, so ions can move to one side, then back to the other, then back again, and so on. This reduces the polarization issue (in more precise terms, impedance due to capacitance is proportional to the inverse of the frequency). The result is a higher AC current measured by your voltmeter. The higher the frequency, the lower the impedance, although since it's an inverse relationship, there's a point of diminishing returns, as your data shows.\n\nThere actually is a *lot* on this matter on the web, it's just mostly in technical terms. You basically did a homebrew Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy experiment. You can read in more detail about it [here](https://www.gamry.com/application-notes/EIS/basics-of-electrochemical-impedance-spectroscopy/) but it's fairly mathy. If you want a good visual representation of what I'm talking about, scroll down to figure 20. This is a parametric graph of impedance (due to capacitance on the y axis, and due to resistance on the x axis) which goes UP in frequency as you move to the LEFT, and it describes a pretty similar to system to yours. Basically, notice that at very low frequencies (DC being the extreme limit), impedance is pretty high, and gets lower as you go up in frequency. In your frequency range here you're probably mostly in the linear region, but if you kept pushing the frequency higher, at a certain point you (EDIT: might) see the current actually *decrease* as you hit the \"hump\" in impedance, then *increase* again as you keep going.\n\nEDIT: Actually now that I look carefully, your data actually shows this exact thing! 50Hz is on the right side of the \"valley\" here but 500Hz is probably on the hump somewhere, giving you slightly higher impedance and thus a slightly lower current.\n\nEDIT 2: It's also entirely possible that the different slopes are just an artifact of this being an imperfect test setup *e.g.* you accidentally holding the two ends of the voltmeter slightly further apart on the high frequency test or something like that.

This is a parametric graph of impedance (due to capacitance on the y axis, and due to resistance on the x axis) which goes UP in frequency as you move to the LEFT, and it describes a pretty similar to system to yours. Basically, notice that at very low frequencies (DC being the extreme limit), impedance is pretty high, and gets lower as you go up in frequency. In your frequency range here you&amp;#39;re probably mostly in the linear region, but if you kept pushing the frequency higher, at a certain point you (EDIT: might) see the current actually &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; as you hit the &amp;quot;hump&amp;quot; in impedance, then &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; again as you keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Actually now that I look carefully, your data actually shows this exact thing! 50Hz is on the right side of the &amp;quot;valley&amp;quot; here but 500Hz is probably on the hump somewhere, giving you slightly higher impedance and thus a slightly lower current.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: It&amp;#39;s also entirely possible that the different slopes are just an artifact of this being an imperfect test setup &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; you accidentally holding the two ends of the voltmeter slightly further apart on the high frequency test or something like that. The difference in current should probably be pretty minimal anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg79xfa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492096637.0, "created_utc": 1492067837.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5mlwq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aero_ch", "parent_id": "t1_dg5dkvk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A really good, and unique, point.
