In a car crash, the total energy is large, but the energy in each individual interaction is low---on the scale of the chemical interaction, and not on the scale of, say, the nuclear interaction.  The reason the total energy is so high in a car crash is because there's ~ Avogadro's number of particles in a car.  In fact, if nothing catches on fire, the majority of a car crash happens at the scale of material deformation, which is a lower energy scale than the scale required for a chemical reaction---the energy needed for a rearrangement of covalent or ionic bonds.\n\nWhen the energy in individual interactions becomes larger, then you have to start to wonder: is my theory of physics still valid when those large energies are involved?  This is the question behind the philosophy that leads to [effective field theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory).  Here's a great question:  we don't have a unified theory of physics, so how is it that we're able to make *any* progress *at all*?!  I mean, we can design bridges and rockets and all SORTS of stuff, and yet we don't have to teach anything about the Higgs boson to engineers.  Why not?  It's because Newton's laws are valid irrespective of what's going on \"down there\".  We don't have to teach engineers relativity because the speed of light is ENORMOUS.  If the speed of light were 100 miles per hour, every car company would worry about relativity.\n\nWhen do we know that we don't have to worry about relativistic effects?  When the velocities involved are much less than the speed of light.  Answers calculated with relativity will differ from answers derived from Newton's laws by a very small amount, as long as v, the velocity of the car (in this example) is much much less than the speed of light.  Newtonian answers are like (v/c)^0, which makes sense because it's independent of c.  The leading corrections to the Newtonian answer go like (v/c)^2.  But even if you incorporate those corrections you still don't have the full relativistic answer.  The next correction is (v/c)^4 and the next is (v/c)^6 and so on.  So you can see that if (v/c) = (speeds relevant to automobiles / speed of light) is small, we have to care less and less about the corrections.  However, you can see that when v/c is not small the successive terms can make a big difference!  If v/c = 0.99, the first correction is of a comparable size to the Newtonian answer.  So are the other corrections.  Even the 50th correction is of a scale (0.99)^100 ~= 0.36---a correction on the scale of 36% of the Newtonian answer!  So if we ignore relativity we're making a BIG mistake, but only if the velocities are large.\n\nWhen physicists talk about \"energy scales\" they mean something similar---a scale at which you ought to be suspicious that you're making a mistake, and that you need a new theory to feel comfortable.  Notice that it typically doesn't matter if you change an energy scale by a factor of 2---if you were OK before you're probably still OK.  But if you change it by a factor of 10 or 100, look out!\n\nMoreover, energy scales are often widely separated.  For example, chemistry happens at the eV scale, nuclear physics at the MeV scale (a million times as much energy).  The mass of the proton is 1 GeV, and the mass of the W, Z, and Higgs bosons are ~ 100 GeV (not exactly, but close!).  This is what allows us to formulate an effective theory and to ignore the complication of the whole underlying theory.  At each of those scales our \"previous\" (lower-energy-scale) description is no longer of any use.  In chemistry we don't talk about pions (which are important to nuclear physics), and to describe nuclear physics we don't worry about the Higgs, and we usually don't have to worry about electrons, either!  Moreover, all of the physics that depend on the same explanation happens roughly at the same scale (for example, the mass of the W is ~ 80 GeV, Z is ~ 91 GeV, Higgs is ~ 125 GeV; another example: most nuclear energy splittings are of the same rough scale).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An energy scale is where something &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; happens or is expected to happen.  In a car crash, the total energy is large, but the energy in each individual interaction is low---on the scale of the chemical interaction, and not on the scale of, say, the nuclear interaction.  The reason the total energy is so high in a car crash is because there&amp;#39;s ~ Avogadro&amp;#39;s number of particles in a car.  In fact, if nothing catches on fire, the majority of a car crash happens at the scale of material deformation, which is a lower energy scale than the scale required for a chemical reaction---the energy needed for a rearrangement of covalent or ionic bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the energy in individual interactions becomes larger, then you have to start to wonder: is my theory of physics still valid when those large energies are involved?  This is the question behind the philosophy that leads to &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory\"&gt;effective field theories&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&amp;#39;s a great question:  we don&amp;#39;t have a unified theory of physics, so how is it that we&amp;#39;re able to make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; progress &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;?!  I mean, we can design bridges and rockets and all SORTS of stuff, and yet we don&amp;#39;t have to teach anything about the Higgs boson to engineers.  Why not?  It&amp;#39;s because Newton&amp;#39;s laws are valid irrespective of what&amp;#39;s going on &amp;quot;down there&amp;quot;.  We don&amp;#39;t have to teach engineers relativity because the speed of light is ENORMOUS.  If the speed of light were 100 miles per hour, every car company would worry about relativity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When do we know that we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about relativistic effects?  When the velocities involved are much less than the speed of light.  Answers calculated with relativity will differ from answers derived from Newton&amp;#39;s laws by a very small amount, as long as v, the velocity of the car (in this example) is much much less than the speed of light.  Newtonian answers are like (v/c)&lt;sup&gt;0,&lt;/sup&gt; which makes sense because it&amp;#39;s independent of c.  The leading corrections to the Newtonian answer go like (v/c)&lt;sup&gt;2.&lt;/sup&gt;  But even if you incorporate those corrections you still don&amp;#39;t have the full relativistic answer.  The next correction is (v/c)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and the next is (v/c)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and so on.  So you can see that if (v/c) = (speeds relevant to automobiles / speed of light) is small, we have to care less and less about the corrections.  However, you can see that when v/c is not small the successive terms can make a big difference!  If v/c = 0.99, the first correction is of a comparable size to the Newtonian answer.  So are the other corrections.  Even the 50th correction is of a scale (0.99)&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; ~= 0.36---a correction on the scale of 36% of the Newtonian answer!  So if we ignore relativity we&amp;#39;re making a BIG mistake, but only if the velocities are large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When physicists talk about &amp;quot;energy scales&amp;quot; they mean something similar---a scale at which you ought to be suspicious that you&amp;#39;re making a mistake, and that you need a new theory to feel comfortable.  Notice that it typically doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you change an energy scale by a factor of 2---if you were OK before you&amp;#39;re probably still OK.  But if you change it by a factor of 10 or 100, look out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, energy scales are often widely separated.  For example, chemistry happens at the eV scale, nuclear physics at the MeV scale (a million times as much energy).  The mass of the proton is 1 GeV, and the mass of the W, Z, and Higgs bosons are ~ 100 GeV (not exactly, but close!).  This is what allows us to formulate an effective theory and to ignore the complication of the whole underlying theory.
