The more electrons with the same spin (up) and no countering spin (down), the more magnetic the atom can be. Each orbital has two electrons in it - one of each spin. A valence shell has X number of orbitals in it, and each shell has more orbitals than the one before it and a higher energy level, but the higher the shell is, the narrower the energy level difference is between them. Each shell fills each orbital with an up electron first until the shell is half full, then the lowest orbital gets a down electron, then the next, etc. When shells' energy are close enough, adjacent orbitals in the nearby shells will also fill with up electrons before the down ones come into play. \n\n\nIron is in this sweet spot where the electrons can fill out several orbitals with up electrons without being countered by down electrons, and, because of the properties of paramagnetism, these \"ups\" can be matched with the \"ups\" of surrounding atoms when a magnetic field aligns them. Basically this means that iron can be stably filled with electrons without filling any of the outer orbitals with two electrons, and interactions between these shells of ups induces the same direction of up in nearby atoms. When this happens, the magnetic field has multiple contributions from different atoms and forms a larger magnet, and can continue to align nearby atoms with the same properties. \n\n\nChromium and other metals don't have as many \"exposed\" or disparate valance orbitals. Other metals usually have fewer exposed orbitals and/or the spins of the up electrons are mitigated by the spins of the down electrons in the same orbitals. \n\n\nThink of magnetism as a disparity caused by quantum spin.

The more electrons with the same spin (up) and no countering spin (down), the more magnetic the atom can be. Each orbital has two electrons in it - one of each spin. A valence shell has X number of orbitals in it, and each shell has more orbitals than the one before it and a higher energy level, but the higher the shell is, the narrower the energy level difference is between them. Each shell fills each orbital with an up electron first until the shell is half full, then the lowest orbital gets a down electron, then the next, etc. When shells&amp;#39; energy are close enough, adjacent orbitals in the nearby shells will also fill with up electrons before the down ones come into play. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iron is in this sweet spot where the electrons can fill out several orbitals with up electrons without being countered by down electrons, and, because of the properties of paramagnetism, these &amp;quot;ups&amp;quot; can be matched with the &amp;quot;ups&amp;quot; of surrounding atoms when a magnetic field aligns them. Basically this means that iron can be stably filled with electrons without filling any of the outer orbitals with two electrons, and interactions between these shells of ups induces the same direction of up in nearby atoms. When this happens, the magnetic field has multiple contributions from different atoms and forms a larger magnet, and can continue to align nearby atoms with the same properties. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chromium and other metals don&amp;#39;t have as many &amp;quot;exposed&amp;quot; or disparate valance orbitals.
