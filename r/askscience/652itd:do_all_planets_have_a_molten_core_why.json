There are a couple reasons for this:\n\nOne is that contracting matter into a condensed form naturally releases energy. It has to because the process reduces the gravitational potential energy of the arrangement, so the energy has to go somewhere. In practice that gravitational potential energy is translated into kinetic energy (impact energy) as the object accretes. The heat tends to build up enough to cause melting for objects once they start getting up to kilometer dimensions. This is where metallic asteroids come from. Protoplanets were formed in the early solar system and they became molten because of this heat energy from accretion, and in a molten state they were able to differentiate into layers of different materials based on density and solubility with an interior of metals (nickel, iron, gold, iridium, etc.) and silicates and other rock-like stuff closer to the surface. Then they cooled and became no longer molten, but at some point they experienced a large impact which broke them into pieces, leaving some pieces that were primarily metallic.\n\nWhich gets to the second point, how heat is retained or lost by a planetary body. Space is a vacuum so it's like a thermos bottle, which is why stuff in space takes so long to cool down even though it can be very cold in space otherwise. This is because objects in space can only get rid of their heat via radiation (glowing into the blackness of space and slowly, slowly losing energy over time). And that rate scales relative to the surface area of an object. However, the amount of energy released by gravitational contraction of an object during accretion scales relative to its mass which will relate to its *volume*. As a protoplanet grows larger the ratio of its surface area to mass (or volume) goes down, because surface area scales by r^2 but mass/volume scales by r^3 . So the larger a planet/protoplanet becomes the more heat it will have built up from formation and also the longer it will retain that heat (because it loses it at a lower relative rate than smaller objects). This is why asteroids and small moons in the solar system do not have molten cores but many large planets do (or very hot cores, even if \"molten\" doesn't quite apply in every case).\n\nAdditionally, over geological time scales the radioactive decay of natural isotopes forms a new source of internal heat for many planets and can keep the interior molten much longer than if it had no other heat than from its formation. And this source of heat scales relative to the amount of mass in the planet, which again builds up relative to r^3 even though loss of heat builds up as r^2 . Some of these isotopes have half-lives in the billions of years (Potassium-40, Uranium-238, Thorium-232) so they can provide sources of heat for very long periods of time.\n\nAnother source of internal heat inside a planetary body (though more typically a moon) can be tidal forces. Objects in space naturally experience tidal forces relative to one another but these can be significant sources of heat energy in certain cases. An important example being the inner 3 Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) which are in orbital resonance with each other and experience significant tidal heating (so much so that Io has volcanoes despite being a small moon).\n\nHowever, there's still a lot we don't know about planetary interiors and their evolution over time, and there is a lot of complexity involved in certain cases. Indeed, Earth is in many ways an unusual example comparatively. The Moon, for example, was long thought to be completely solid, but it seems that it contains some amount of molten material surrounding the core. Also, the Earth itself does not have a molten core, the temperatures are extremely high in the core but so are the pressures, and the pressure causes the inner core to become solid surrounded by a molten outer core. For large planets such as the ice giants (Neptune and Uranus) they likely contain a mixed silicate / metallic core that is probably hot enough to be molten. For even larger planets such as the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) the internal temperatures and pressures at the core are so high (tens of thousands of degrees, megabars) that terms like solid or liquid no longer apply, they are closer in structure to the interior matter of stars, very high temperature ionized plasmas. Interestingly, Jupiter continues to generate internal heat not from its measly supply of radioactive materials (it's 99% Hydrogen/Helium) but rather from Helium condensing further towards the center, essentially a form of further gravitational contraction that has been continuing for billions of years.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, but most planetary bodies have experienced periods of molten material internally as a natural consequence of the process of formation.

For large planets such as the ice giants (Neptune and Uranus) they likely contain a mixed silicate / metallic core that is probably hot enough to be molten. For even larger planets such as the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) the internal temperatures and pressures at the core are so high (tens of thousands of degrees, megabars) that terms like solid or liquid no longer apply, they are closer in structure to the interior matter of stars, very high temperature ionized plasmas. Interestingly, Jupiter continues to generate internal heat not from its measly supply of radioactive materials (it&amp;#39;s 99% Hydrogen/Helium) but rather from Helium condensing further towards the center, essentially a form of further gravitational contraction that has been continuing for billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg8sq69", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492175545.0, "created_utc": 1492146745.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652itd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652itd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gz8n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WazWaz", "parent_id": "t1_dg71ay2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Short wrong version.
