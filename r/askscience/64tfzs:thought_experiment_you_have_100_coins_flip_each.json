Let Z*_n_* = # of individuals in population at generation *n*. Let E*_n_* be the event Z*_n_* = 0, i.e., the population is extinct by generation *n*. Let *E* be the union of all E*_n_*, which is simply the event that the population goes extinct.\n\nSince E*_n_* is an increasing sequence of nested sets, the probability of extinction is\n\n&gt; P(E) = lim*_n--&gt;\u221e_*P(E*_n_*)\n\nRecall that p*_n_* = probability that a given individual has *n* successors. So p*_0_* = probability that an individual has no successors. If p*_0_* &gt; 0, then it is possible the population goes extinct in the first generation because P(E*_1_*) = p*_0_*. Since P(E*_n_*) is an increasing sequence of numbers, it follows that P(E) \u2265 p*_0_* &gt; 0. **Hence if it is possible to go extinct, extinction will occur with some strictly positive probability.** But extinction is not necessarily guaranteed, because this does not prove that P(E) = 1.\n\nThe extinction time is *T* and is defined to be the minimum value of *n* such that Z*_n_* = 0. If the population does not go extinct, we say T = \u221e. It follows that\n\n&gt; P(T \u2264 n) = P(Z*_n_* = 0) = P(E*_n_*)\n\n&gt; P(T = n) = P(E*_n_*) - P(E*_n-1_*)\n\n&gt; P(T &lt; \u221e) = P(E) =  lim*_n--&gt;\u221e_*P(E*_n_*)\n\n&gt; P(T = \u221e) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - lim*_n--&gt;\u221e_*P(E*_n_*)\n\n---\n\n&gt; The thing with \"breeds\" I wanted to show is that inf works oddly...

That's a more complicated question, but can ultimately be answered by looking at the probability generating function G(z).\n\nIf we consider the case where a coin that turns up heads is removed and a coin that turns up tails stays put, then extinction occurs with probability 1. Extinction occurs on generation *n* with probability P(T = n) = 2^(-n). For a more general coin-tossing problem, calculating P(T = n) is much more complicated, very likely impossible to get an exact value.\n\nIf we instead consider the case where a coin that turns up tails has 3 successors (itself plus 2 more new coins), then extinction occurs only with probability P(E) = 0.618.

The only thing we can say about p that it is very close to 0, but not 0\n\nI really don't know what this means. Do you understand that P(T = n) depends on *n*? The probability of extinction at generation *n* can be different for each *n*. Do you understand that we don't need P(T = n) to be equal to 0 for all n &gt; M for some M? That is, we don't need it to be impossible to go extinct after some number of generations. Indeed, if p*_0_* &gt; 0, then P(T = n) &gt; 0 for *all* *n*.

Many problems are phrased with words like \"you\" or \"imagine you do this\". There is no expectation that you take the question literally. The OP asks whether this process terminates, which is a meaningful question and has nothing to do with any life expectancy of some fictional participant.\n\nHowever, if you want to know what the expected extinction time actually is, that's a meaningful question. Consider a branching process with almost sure extinction. Let *T* denote the extinction time, i.e., the first generation for which the population is 0. Suppose the branching process has probability generating function G(z). Then\n\n&gt; P(T \u2264 *m*) = G^(m)(0)\n\nwhere G^(m) denotes the *m*-fold iterate of *G*. So, for instance P(T \u2264 2) = G(G(0)). It follows that\n\n&gt; P(T = *m*) = G^(m)(0) - G^(m-1)(0)\n\nHence the expected extinction time is\n\n`[; E(T) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}{m\\cdot P(T=m)} = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}{m\\cdot(G^m(0)-G^{m-1}(0))} ;]`\n\nGenerally speaking, it is pretty much not possible to find a closed-form formula for the iterates of *G*.

The generating function is\n\n&gt; G(z) = (1 + z)/2\n\nThe *m*th iterate of *G* is\n\n&gt; G^(m)(z) = (2^(m-1)-1 + z)/2^(m)\n\nIt follows that P(T = m) = 2^(-m). Hence\n\n&gt; E(T) = 0\\*1 + 1\\*(1/2) + 2\\*(1/4) + 3\\*(1/8) + 4\\*(1/16) + ... = 2\n\nSo the population goes extinct, on average, in generation #2.\n\n---\n\nOkay, now what about the case with N = 1? The generating function is\n\n&gt; G(z) = (1 + z^(2))/2\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know of any closed-form formula for the iterates of *G*. Nevertheless, we can use a computer to estimate the value of E(T). Using MATLAB and summing the first M terms gives the following:\n\n\nM | E(T)\n---|---\n10^1 | 1.85\n10^2 | 5.39\n10^3 | 9.79\n10^4 | 14.37\n10^5 | 18.97\n10^6 | 23.58\n10^7 | 28.18\n10^8 | 32.75\n\nThis suggests that the true value is E(T) = \u221e. There is some literature on bounding P(T &lt; m) for various distributions, which in turn give bounds on E(T). This is very much like the symmetric random walk in one dimension. The probability of returning to the origin is 1, but the expected time of return is infinite. (This problem is not exactly a random walk, so the same analysis doesn't quite carry over.)\n\n---\n\nNow that's all starting with just 1 coin. For an initial generation with any number of individuals, the analysis is a bit more complicated, but not too much. Suppose we start with *C* individuals. Let *T**_k_* be the extinction time of the *k*the genealogical line, i.e., the extinction time of the population whose initial ancestor is the *k*the individual. Since each individual produces offspring with the same distribution, all of the T*_k_*'s are iid random variables.\n\nWhat is the extinction time of the entire population? This requires that all genealogical lines go extinct. So we want to know the time at which the *last* surviving line goes extinct. In other words, we want to know the *maximum* value of all the T*_k_*'s. If we know the distribution of T*_k_*, then we can find the distribution of the max. (The cdf, pdf, and characteristic function of the max are all easily calculated in terms of those of T*_k_*.)  It's trivial to see, for instance, that if E(T*_k_*) is finite, then E(max T*_k_*) is also finite.\n\n\nIn the coin problem with N = 0 (the case where E(T) is finite), we can calculate the distribution of the maximum extinction time explicitly. Recall that the distribution of T*_k_* is given by\n\n&gt; P(T*_k_* \u2264 m) = 1 - 2^(-m)\n\nIf T = max*_k_*(T*_k_*), then the distribution of *T* is\n\n&gt; P(T \u2264 m) = (1 - 2^(-m))^(C)\n\nIt follows that the expected extinction time is\n\n`[; E(T) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}{m\\cdot\\left[(1-2^{-m})^C-(1-2^{-m+1})^C\\right]} ;]`\n\nYou can sum this up for any value of *C* you wish.

Since the events E&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are increasing (i.e., E&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a subset of E&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n+1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), the probability of &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is simply the limit of the probabilities of E&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way extinction has probability 1 is if the expected number of offspring of an individual is less than or equal to 1 (with the single exception of the case where individuals have exactly 1 offspring with probability 1).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg6nshc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492064208.0, "created_utc": 1492035408.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6hfku", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rdrunner_74", "parent_id": "t1_dg5aeon", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; There is a (very slightly greater than) 50% chance this process terminates\n\nI know when calculating with infinity, you get \"odd results\", but the thread starts with 100 coins... so shouldnt the propability of extinction be slightly above 1/2^100 and not slightly above 1/2?

Indeed, no matter how many coins you add because of tails, there is always at least a 50% chance the process terminates. The process terminates with probability 1 if and only if a tails results in the addition of either 0 or 1 new coins.\n\n**Long version:** This type of problem is called a *branching process*. Classically, a branching process models a population in which offspring in one generation is produced from the previous generation with some probability distribution. These models are usually simplified to make the problems much more tractable. For instance, although the analogy of reproduction is useful, we assume that the individuals can reproduce asexually and we are really only interested in the distribution of direct successors to a given individual.\n\nIn your particular problem, in the language of a branching process, we would say the following:\n\n&gt; p*_0_* = probability of an individual having 0 direct successors = 1/2 (i.e., probability of the coin flipping heads)\n\n&gt; p*_101_* = probability of an individual having 101 direct successors = 1/2 (i.e., probability of the coin flipping tails)\n\n&gt; p*_k_* = 0 otherwise (because a coin has either 0 or 101 successors only)\n\nThe reason a flip of tails gives 101 successors is that the coin itself is not removed (1 sucessor) and 100 new coins are added (100 more successors). The reason a flip of heads gives 0 successors is that the coin itself is removed (i.e., the coin \"dies\").\n\nIf X*_n_* = # of individuals in generation *n*, we are primarily interested in the *extinction probability*:\n\n&gt; p = lim P(X*_n_* = 0) as n --&gt; infinity\n\nIn the context of your question, the extinction probability is the probabilty that the process terminates. You can read all of the details of how to solve this problem online. This is a standard problem in a graduate or advanced undergraduate course on probability or stochastic processes. The central object of interest is the probability generating function\n\n&gt; G(z) = p*_0_* + p*_1_*z + p*_2_*z^(2) + ... + p*_k_*z^(k) + ...\n\nIn our problem, the generating function is\n\n&gt; G(z) = (1/2)(1 + z^(101))\n\nThe extinction probability is found by solving the equation G(z) = z. (The proof of this statement uses one of my favorite theorems in all of applied mathematics, the *contraction mapping theorem*. If z*_m_* denotes the probability of extinction of a particular genealogical line at or before generation *m*, then G(z*_m-1_*) = z*_m_*. Hence the extinction probability is given by taking the limit of z*_m_* as *m* --&gt; infinity. The contraction mapping theorem shows that this limit always exists and is must necessarily solve the equation G(z) = z.)\n\nNote that since p*_0_*+p*_1_*+p*_2_*+... = 1, it is always the case that G(1) = 1. So there are exactly two cases:\n\n * G(z) = z has a solution *w* with 0 \u2264 *w* &lt; 1. In this case, *w* is the extinction probability.\n * G(z) = z has no solution *w* with 0 \u2264 *w* &lt; 1. In this case, the extinction probability is 1.\n\n(Note that if p*_0_* = 0, then it is always the case that G(0) = 0, in which case the extinction probability is 0. This makes sense since the equation p*_0_* = 0 means that every individual always has at least one successor. So extinction is not only almost surely never going to happen, it's actually impossible.)\n\nOkay, so what about our case? We are in the first case: there is a root of G(z) = z between 0 and 1. The root is approximately z = 1/2 (to many decimal places). This can be seen in a handwavy manner: since 101 is very large, (1/2)^(101) is extremely small. So the expression \"G(1/2) = 1/2\" reads \"1/2 + small = 1/2\". So there is a root near z = 1/2. You can use the intermediate value theorem and/or mean value theorem to prove that there is a root to G(z) = z just beyond z = 1/2.\n\nSo there is about a 50% chance of extinction.\n\nWhat if we added 1000 coins on a tails? 100,000? one million? What about just 1?\n---\n\nIs that surprising to you? Maybe. Even though it's easy to see it's possible for the process to terminate, getting even 1 tails increases the number of coins so much. So it gets harder and harder to go extinct as the process continues. In fact, let's modify the problem slightly. Instead of adding 100 coins, let's say you add *N* coins where *N* \u2265 0. Then the generating function is\n\n&gt; G(z) = (1/2)(1 + z^(N+1))\n\nWith a little bit of work, you can show the following:\n\n&gt; G(z) = z has no solution between 0 and 1 if N = 0 or N = 1\n\n&gt; G(z) = z always has a solution between 1/2 and 1 if N \u2265 2\n\nThis means the following:\n\n&gt; If a result of tails means you add either 0 or 1 new coin, the probability of extinction is 1.\n\n&gt; If a result of tails means add at least 2 coins, there is a greater than 50% probability of extinction.\n\n&gt; No matter how many new coins you add because of a tails, there is *always* a probability of at least 50% of extinction.\n\nSome useful facts about general branching processes\n---\n\nIn fact, if you study branching processes in general you will find that there are only two possibilities: either the population dies out or it survives and the population becomes arbitrarily large. That is, the population either goes to 0 or to infinity. There is no stable finite population somewhere in the middle.\n\nYou can also show that the probability of extinction is 1 if and only if the individuals, on average, have *less than or equal to 1 offspring*. (The only exception is if individuals always have exactly 1 offspring, in which case G(z) = z identically.) This is equivalent to the condition G'(1) \u2264 1. Note that in our case G(z) = (1/2)(1 + z^(N+1)), hence G'(1) = (N+1)/2. So the probability of extinction is 1 if and only if N \u2264 1, which we already found out earlier. Note, however, that if G'(1) &gt; 1, we only know that the extinction probability is *not* 1; we don't know whether the extinction probability is 0 or positive.\n\nHow hard is it to go extinct, really?\n---\n\nAgain, we only start with 1 coin. If z*_m_* is the probability that the population is extinct at or before generation *m*, then it is true that G(z*_m-1_*) = z*_m_*. Since we start with 1 coin, clearly z*_0_* = 0. To get the extinction probabilities at each generation, repeatedly apply the function *G*. For sake of definiteness, suppose each tails brings in 100 new coins.\n\n&gt; z*_1_* = 1/2\n\n&gt; z*_2_* = 1/2 + 3.9 x 10^(-31)\n\n&gt; z*_3_* = 1/2 + something even smaller\n\nSo if *N* is rather large, the greatest risk of extinction is right in the first generation. This is no surprise since there's only 1 individual. But look at how hard it becomes to go extinct in just 1 generation. The probability of going extinct in generation 2 is about 3.9 x 10^(-31), an extremely small number. For future generations, the extinction probabilities are even smaller.\n\nWhat if we only added 2 new coins at each tails? We know the extinction probability solves z = (1/2)(1+z^(3)), which is about z = 0.618, or a 61.8% chance of extinction. What are the extinction probabilities at each step?\n\n&gt; z*_1_* = 0.5\n\n&gt; z*_2_* = 0.5625\n\n&gt; z*_3_* = 0.5890\n\n&gt; z*_4_* = 0.6022\n\n&gt; z*_5_* = 0.6092\n\nSo, again, most of the risk is in the very first generation. But notice that the chance of going extinct in generation 2 is not *that* tiny, it's 6.25%.\n\n\nOkay... now what if you start with any number of coins?\n---\n\nWe already know the extinction probability of a particular genealogical line, i.e., starting with 1 coin. Each genealogical line is independent and identically distributed. So if you know the chance of extinction with 1 coin is, say, 61.8%, then the chance of extinction with a starting generation of 10 coins is (0.618)^(10) = 0.0081 = 0.81%. Small, but not zero.\n\nSince there is always at least a 50% probability of extinction no matter how many coins you add on a tails, there is always a *positive* probability that entire population goes extinct. For instance, if you start with *C* coins, then the probability of extinction is at least (1/2)^(C). Extinction is still guaranteed (probability 1) if you add only 0 or 1 new coin on a tails (because the individuals have no more than 1 offspring on average).\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1491978105.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What if you started with only 1 coin?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short version:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a (very slightly greater than) 50% chance this process terminates.

Hence the extinction probability is given by taking the limit of z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; --&amp;gt; infinity.

We are in the first case: there is a root of G(z) = z between 0 and 1. The root is approximately z = 1/2 (to many decimal places). This can be seen in a handwavy manner: since 101 is very large, (1/2)&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; is extremely small. So the expression &amp;quot;G(1/2) = 1/2&amp;quot; reads &amp;quot;1/2 + small = 1/2&amp;quot;. So there is a root near z = 1/2. You can use the intermediate value theorem and/or mean value theorem to prove that there is a root to G(z) = z just beyond z = 1/2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there is about a 50% chance of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What if we added 1000 coins on a tails? 100,000? one million?

Note that in our case G(z) = (1/2)(1 + z&lt;sup&gt;N+1&lt;/sup&gt;), hence G&amp;#39;(1) = (N+1)/2. So the probability of extinction is 1 if and only if N \u2264 1, which we already found out earlier. Note, however, that if G&amp;#39;(1) &amp;gt; 1, we only know that the extinction probability is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; 1; we don&amp;#39;t know whether the extinction probability is 0 or positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How hard is it to go extinct, really?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, we only start with 1 coin. If z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the probability that the population is extinct at or before generation &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;, then it is true that G(z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m-1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) = z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Since we start with 1 coin, clearly z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0. To get the extinction probabilities at each generation, repeatedly apply the function &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;. For sake of definiteness, suppose each tails brings in 100 new coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 1/2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 1/2 + 3.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 1/2 + something even smaller&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is rather large, the greatest risk of extinction is right in the first generation. This is no surprise since there&amp;#39;s only 1 individual. But look at how hard it becomes to go extinct in just 1 generation. The probability of going extinct in generation 2 is about 3.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt;, an extremely small number. For future generations, the extinction probabilities are even smaller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if we only added 2 new coins at each tails? We know the extinction probability solves z = (1/2)(1+z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which is about z = 0.618, or a 61.8% chance of extinction. What are the extinction probabilities at each step?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5625&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5890&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.6022&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;z&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.6092&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, again, most of the risk is in the very first generation. But notice that the chance of going extinct in generation 2 is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; tiny, it&amp;#39;s 6.25%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Okay... now what if you start with any number of coins?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We already know the extinction probability of a particular genealogical line, i.e., starting with 1 coin. Each genealogical line is independent and identically distributed. So if you know the chance of extinction with 1 coin is, say, 61.8%, then the chance of extinction with a starting generation of 10 coins is (0.618)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0081 = 0.81%. Small, but not zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since there is always at least a 50% probability of extinction no matter how many coins you add on a tails, there is always a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; probability that entire population goes extinct. For instance, if you start with &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; coins, then the probability of extinction is at least (1/2)&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. Extinction is still guaranteed (probability 1) if you add only 0 or 1 new coin on a tails (because the individuals have no more than 1 offspring on average).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg5aeon", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491990514.0, "created_utc": 1491961714.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 114}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tfzs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tfzs", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7drek", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RepostThatShit", "parent_id": "t1_dg5srh2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It isn't equivalent to a random walk, not 3-dimensional and not 2-dimensional.\n\nThis experiment *can terminate on any round* by just producing as many heads as you have coins.
