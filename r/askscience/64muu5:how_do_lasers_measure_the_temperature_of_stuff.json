Just in case you haven&amp;#39;t had the courses, I&amp;#39;ll supplement it with a little background. When we say a substance has a given temperature, we&amp;#39;re saying that it has a distribution or histogram of energies that has a specific shape.  This distribution is like a bell curve that has a high energy tail. The mean of this distribution is known as the temperature.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now depending on the type of atom or molecule that makes up the substance, energy is contained differently. If the substance is made of atoms, then only the 3D kinetic energy of the atoms define the temperature. If the substance is molecular and linear like co2, then the molecule can rotate as well.&lt;br/&gt;\nAs echemnerd said, rotational motion is quantized and the distribution of individual  rotational states can be probed for simple molecules using IR spectroscopy. This allows us to determine the temperature of the rotational energy in the molecule. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg3tdev", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491911433.0, "created_utc": 1491882633.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3pive", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChipotleMayoFusion", "parent_id": "t1_dg3pdhv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huh, that is super cool!

For example, if you see someone wearing a green shirt, you see that because the dye in that shirt absorbs mostly red wavelengths while all other wavelengths of light are reflected. The light that is being reflected or absorbed is coming from another source (e.g. The sun or a light bulb). So the coal, before heating, absorbs most wavelengths of light, making it appear black. When heated, the coal itself becomes an emitter (actually even before heated it is an emitter, we just don't see this because IR is not detectable by the human eye) and when hot enough begins to emit in the visible spectrum. So black body radiation does correlate to the temperature. The disconnect here is the source of light (the sun or the coal itself) and the wavelength that the coal is emitting. As far as pointing one of those thermometers at the sun, I doubt you would see anything interesting as these detectors are limited to a certain range of wavelengths. So it wouldn't be able to detect the visible wavelengths from the sun that it could then convert to a temperature reading, although it would pick up any background IR radiation. \n\nEdit: after rereading that I wasn't very clear. Everything is an emitter. Even the green t-shirt mentioned above is emitting wavelengths in the IR spectrum, but we cannot see that.

Scattering, absorption, and emission of light via your analyte or some constituent of the environment you&amp;#39;re trying to measure will yield local temperature measurements, e.g. point, line-of-sight, or a sheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few examples to boot: Rayleigh scattering produces a spectrum centered at the laser frequency whereby its Doppler broadening is proportional to temperature (as well as its lineshape). The absorption of a signal is a function of the sample&amp;#39;s concentration/number density, which through Boltzmann statistics can yield thermodynamic temperature. Laser-induced fluorescence signal is also dependent on the number density of the excited species, which in turn is dependent on the various rate factors of the two-level system process, which when you combine with two or more lines can yield a temperature dependent spectrum via Boltzmann statistics again. Coherent Anti-Raman Stokes spectroscopy (CARS for short) is another very popular diagnostic for measuring temperature with very high precision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are some examples which I hope will help you understand a little better the ways in which we can measure temperature with lasers through an understanding of the processes we induce.
