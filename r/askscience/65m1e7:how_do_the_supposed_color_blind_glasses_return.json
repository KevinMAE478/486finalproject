There's some partial overlap between the sensitivity of each type, so any given wavelength of light will trigger them in some combination: http://michaeldmann.net/pix_7/cone_sen.gif\n\nYour brain interprets these combinations as colors. So for instance, if you see a light source with a wavelength of 650nm, it stimulates the \"red\" cones much more than the \"green\" ones, and the light source appears red. A wavelength of about 560nm stimulates red and green equally, and appears yellow. These three types of cones explain why light appears to have three primary colors.\n\nNow, color-blindness is caused by a mutation in a gene that codes for one of the types of photoreceptors. If, say, the \"red\" cone type fails to develop, then you only end up with one type of cone that responds to the entire range from red to green. It gets stimulated equally well by any of those colors, so they all appear the same. If one type of cone is totally absent, there's not much that can be done: you'll only ever be able to see two different \"dimensions\" of color.\n\nBut it's also possible to have a less severe mutation, which alters the response of one type of cone and makes it very similar to another type. This causes the two cones to give *almost* the same signal to the brain over a range of different wavelengths, which means colors in that range appear washed-out and hard to distinguish. In this case, you can wear glasses with a special color filter that blocks most of the light in the region of overlap, and lets it through in the regions where the cones have slightly different sensitivities. This exaggerates the differences between the two color channels, kind of like turning up the saturation on an image in Photoshop.
