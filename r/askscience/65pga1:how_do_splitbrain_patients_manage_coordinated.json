These cases hint at the kind of thought process lateralization that occurs. A hallmark of right side damage is a reduction in non-conscious spatial processing sometimes resulting in the strange phenomenon of &amp;quot;left neglect&amp;quot; where patients seem to be unaware of things on their left side in the broadest sense--the left side of pictures, themselves, or even imagined spaces. Left side damage is more commonly linked with consciousness level deficits in language and symbol processing, hinting at the close relationship between language and conscious thought. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgdjn1l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468261.0, "created_utc": 1492439461.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pga1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcmqlo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FRedington", "parent_id": "t1_dgc4u45", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Julian Jaynes, \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\", 1978\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Origin-Consciousness-Breakdown-Bicameral-Mind/dp/0618057072\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jaynes\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Jaynes, &amp;quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&amp;quot;, 1978&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Consciousness-Breakdown-Bicameral-Mind/dp/0618057072\"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Consciousness-Breakdown-Bicameral-Mind/dp/0618057072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jaynes\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jaynes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgcmqlo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492408194.0, "created_utc": 1492379394.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4u45", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 70, "report_reasons": null, "author": "infernotongue", "parent_id": "t1_dgc49ev", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But is anything known about the nature of the 2 independent thought processes that arise to perform, e.g. shoe binding.
