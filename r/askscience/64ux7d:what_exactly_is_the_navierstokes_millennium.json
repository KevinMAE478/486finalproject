But these are all numeric approximations, or restricted in some way to provide a solution. None of these provide a general solution to these equations. \n\nIf you look at the fluid without really zooming in that much, then you'll have a fairly coarse view of the fluid. This can allow you to approximate solutions to these equations and get good models of physical things because fluids are not, in reality, infinitely fine, they are made of things of discrete size. But if you take these equations and allow for infinite zoom, then you're treating these fluids as infinitely fine things. Since these equations allow for turbulence (because that is a thing that happens to fluids), this infinite fineness can produce some chaotic results. A small nonuniformity at one point in time can blow up into a hugely compounding distortion that breaks the smoothness of the fluid. You can get infinite peaks of density or velocity within the fluid and loose nice things like differentiability. \n\nSo far, every attempt at solving these equations looses one of these nice things we typically associate with fluid. We either lose the smoothness or it can become unboundedly energetic. \n\nThe Navier-Stokes Millennium Prize Problem is then the question of whether or not this differential equation can be solved without losing these nice things we associate with fluids. It could very well be that these equations admit no actual solution, so they don't actually describe how fluids behave. But we already know that they don't, because fluids are not infinitely fine.

A solution to the Navier-Stokes Equations then represent a possible way that fluid can flow. These equations are applied all over the place to generate models of fluid flow. But these are all numeric approximations, or restricted in some way to provide a solution. None of these provide a general solution to these equations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at the fluid without really zooming in that much, then you&amp;#39;ll have a fairly coarse view of the fluid. This can allow you to approximate solutions to these equations and get good models of physical things because fluids are not, in reality, infinitely fine, they are made of things of discrete size. But if you take these equations and allow for infinite zoom, then you&amp;#39;re treating these fluids as infinitely fine things. Since these equations allow for turbulence (because that is a thing that happens to fluids), this infinite fineness can produce some chaotic results. A small nonuniformity at one point in time can blow up into a hugely compounding distortion that breaks the smoothness of the fluid. You can get infinite peaks of density or velocity within the fluid and loose nice things like differentiability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, every attempt at solving these equations looses one of these nice things we typically associate with fluid. We either lose the smoothness or it can become unboundedly energetic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Navier-Stokes Millennium Prize Problem is then the question of whether or not this differential equation can be solved without losing these nice things we associate with fluids. It could very well be that these equations admit no actual solution, so they don&amp;#39;t actually describe how fluids behave. But we already know that they don&amp;#39;t, because fluids are not infinitely fine. The question is whether or not this assumption is a thing that breaks the model. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Details of the problem are &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a good exposition about the troubles involved with solving it are &lt;a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/03/18/why-global-regularity-for-navier-stokes-is-hard/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, differential equations are really hard to solve, and we have no real general method to attack them. The reason why this problem is so important is because a solution to it is expected to provide us with new, more powerful and more interesting tools with which to study differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg5ck6l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993436.0, "created_utc": 1491964636.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 81}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ux7d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg57fn5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64ux7d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dg57fn5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491986654.0, "created_utc": 1491957854.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ux7d", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ux7d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5winb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Henry_Alfred_Kissing", "parent_id": "t1_dg5p5qj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nope, its for existence and smoothness of solutions.
