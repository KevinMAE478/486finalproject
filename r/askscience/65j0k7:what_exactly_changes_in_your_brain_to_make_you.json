I&amp;#39;m somewhat sure this is more of an aesthetics thing rather than an anti-sleep strategy because this is an older car (late 1990s model) and the manufacturer&amp;#39;s newer models include different colours of panel lighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgbdhfi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492329312.0, "created_utc": 1492300512.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j0k7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgblb0v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Recon2df", "parent_id": "t1_dgb165q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, what I've learned is that red light helps you maintain sufficient night vision when in darkness.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, what I&amp;#39;ve learned is that red light helps you maintain sufficient night vision when in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "askscience", "name": "t1_dgblb0v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492340624.0, "created_utc": 1492311824.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb165q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Admiral_obvious13", "parent_id": "t1_dgasfxn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That could create new problems like distracting drivers or otherwise impairing their vision.

The passage you quoted can be better described like this:\n\nThe longer you stay awake, the greater the need to sleep becomes. As you stay awake and burn calories and therefore make ATP for your body, you also build up adenosine as a byproduct of glycolysis itself. So the depletion of glycogen itself is not a cause for sleepiness but it does causes a build up of adenosine. \n\n* Adenosine is your friendly nucleotide that also has a huge role in the way signals propogate in certain cellular systems. There are many receptors for adenosine (A1,A2a, A2b,A3) but we will talk about A1 mostly.  \n\n* It appears that binding to A1 receptors in the [basal forebrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_forebrain) **inhibits** neurons that primarily use acetylcholine to communicate (cholinergic neurons).  These neurons appear to produce wakefulness, so inhibiting them should make you less \"wakeful\", even if not outright sleepy just yet. \n\n* So adenosine accumulates around wakefulness promoting cholinergic neurons which ends up inhibiting those neurons ability to \"send\" acetylcholine to the Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). This area of the brain is inhibited by acetylcholine while you are awake. But as adenosine builds up, less and less acetylcholine gets to the VLPO, which *dis-inhibits* or reverses the inhibition on the VLPO. So now that there is no acetylcholine stimulation on the VLPO it is free to do as it pleases. \n\n* The VLPO itself, even though it receives acetylcholine (and serotonin), uses GABA and galanin to communicate with other parts of the brain. Those neurotransmitters are generally inhibitory and will start to \"reduce\" activity in parts of the brain by inhibiting the firing of other neurons. This begins the suppressing of other parts of neural circuits that promote arousal. \n\n* So as you stay awake and burn calories, adenosine builds up, which turns anti-turns off (turns on) the VLPO, which begins turning off systems of arousal. And we should note that even before the VLPO is turned on, the decrease in cholinergic signals from the basal forebrain (caused by our adenosine build up) also \"reduces\" the activity of motor centers in the brain, making us less likely to use our muscles at full capacity. \n\n* While you are asleep, adenosine is metabolized by adenosine deaminase which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine and adenosine to deoxyinosine and inosine. With the reduction in the Adenosine content the body is excited from sleep slowly. So we **need** a certain amount of sleep to flush enough adenosine out of our brains. We have to give those enzymes enough time do its work (whether or not we can speed up this process is still fairly unknown). \n\nSo adenosine is really only half the story. It's our introduction to sleep, where everything starts getting slower and more **relaxed**. \n\n\n\nNow if we really want to fall asleep we need a bigger push. Here's where we start really considering our circadian rhythm and it's influence on what we call the **homeostatic sleep drive**, which is just a fancy term to describe our need to sleep to maintain homeostasis. \n\n\n\nThere are a lot of important components to regulating our circadian rhythm but we'll focus on a big one, the [Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus). Named because it lies **above** the [optic **chiasm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasm) (a chiasm is where large bundles of neurons cross each other, like with the optic nerve)\n\nThe SCN is uniquely sensitive to signals from special ganglion cells in the retina. These retinal ganglion cells contain *melanopsin* which makes them particularly sensitive to **blue light**. \n\nAccording to Holzman: \n\n&gt;other researchers explored the neural pathways that arise from the melanopsin cells. Roughly 40% of these cells\u2019 axons project to the SCN.\n\nSo these projections from the retina are very strong and they influence the SCN greatly. While you can see blue light, those retinal neurons are inhibiting the SCN from doing much of anything. But once you stop seeing blue light (which traditionally only comes from the sun), the SCN is free and **uninhibited**. \n\nOnce the SCN is free, it can now send signals to other important parts of our circadian rhythm controllers like the hypothalamus and pineal gland, which will produce cortisol and melatonin, which leads to a lowering of our body temperature. \n\nMelatonin is interesting because it acts like an anti-oxidant, helping take up radical (dangerous) molecules in our brain (that might end up poking holes in neuron membranes). It also helps regulate immune functions in the brain too, which seems to be very important in making sleep a rejuvenating experience for people. \n\nBinding melatonin to melatonin receptors appears to help synchronize our circadian rhythms properly, setting the stage for when we need to wake up, also helping to ensure that our sleep is peaceful and relaxed. \n\n\nSo in this very generalized two-phase model of sleep, we primarily focus on the roles of adenosine and melatonin (as well as their targets). \n\nAdenosine helps our body know when we are physiologically \"tired\" and melatonin helps guide our circadian rhythm in-sync with our environment, as well as protecting DNA and neurons themselves in our brain while we sleep. \n\n\n**TL;DR:** Being awake builds up adenosine, which turns off the anti-arousal brain circuits, which makes you fatigued. Then when you stop seeing blue light, the SCN gets turned on and tells other parts of the brain to make melatonin and other sleepy signalers.

The passage you quoted can be better described like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The longer you stay awake, the greater the need to sleep becomes. As you stay awake and burn calories and therefore make ATP for your body, you also build up adenosine as a byproduct of glycolysis itself. So the depletion of glycogen itself is not a cause for sleepiness but it does causes a build up of adenosine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adenosine is your friendly nucleotide that also has a huge role in the way signals propogate in certain cellular systems. There are many receptors for adenosine (A1,A2a, A2b,A3) but we will talk about A1 mostly.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that binding to A1 receptors in the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_forebrain\"&gt;basal forebrain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;inhibits&lt;/strong&gt; neurons that primarily use acetylcholine to communicate (cholinergic neurons).  These neurons appear to produce wakefulness, so inhibiting them should make you less &amp;quot;wakeful&amp;quot;, even if not outright sleepy just yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So adenosine accumulates around wakefulness promoting cholinergic neurons which ends up inhibiting those neurons ability to &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; acetylcholine to the Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). This area of the brain is inhibited by acetylcholine while you are awake. But as adenosine builds up, less and less acetylcholine gets to the VLPO, which &lt;em&gt;dis-inhibits&lt;/em&gt; or reverses the inhibition on the VLPO. So now that there is no acetylcholine stimulation on the VLPO it is free to do as it pleases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VLPO itself, even though it receives acetylcholine (and serotonin), uses GABA and galanin to communicate with other parts of the brain. Those neurotransmitters are generally inhibitory and will start to &amp;quot;reduce&amp;quot; activity in parts of the brain by inhibiting the firing of other neurons. This begins the suppressing of other parts of neural circuits that promote arousal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as you stay awake and burn calories, adenosine builds up, which turns anti-turns off (turns on) the VLPO, which begins turning off systems of arousal. And we should note that even before the VLPO is turned on, the decrease in cholinergic signals from the basal forebrain (caused by our adenosine build up) also &amp;quot;reduces&amp;quot; the activity of motor centers in the brain, making us less likely to use our muscles at full capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you are asleep, adenosine is metabolized by adenosine deaminase which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of 2&amp;#39;-deoxyadenosine and adenosine to deoxyinosine and inosine. With the reduction in the Adenosine content the body is excited from sleep slowly. So we &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; a certain amount of sleep to flush enough adenosine out of our brains. We have to give those enzymes enough time do its work (whether or not we can speed up this process is still fairly unknown). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So adenosine is really only half the story. It&amp;#39;s our introduction to sleep, where everything starts getting slower and more &lt;strong&gt;relaxed&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if we really want to fall asleep we need a bigger push. Here&amp;#39;s where we start really considering our circadian rhythm and it&amp;#39;s influence on what we call the &lt;strong&gt;homeostatic sleep drive&lt;/strong&gt;, which is just a fancy term to describe our need to sleep to maintain homeostasis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of important components to regulating our circadian rhythm but we&amp;#39;ll focus on a big one, the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus\"&gt;Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)&lt;/a&gt;.
