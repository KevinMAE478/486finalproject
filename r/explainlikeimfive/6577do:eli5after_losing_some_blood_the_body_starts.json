Every medical professional I have spoken to has confirmed that I should be doing this. If I wait the standard period, my HCT will back to it's full level by the time I can donate again. The blood center tells me that a simple letter from my DR is all I need. It can state a a new wait time or simply state \"may donate at any time\". The blood center checks your HCT before you donate and won't take your blood if it's too low.\n  \nI also have a testosterone deficiency. (T = 120) I'm 43 btw. My Endocrinologist won't raise my hormone replacement dosage (300mg im per month); won't even discuss it. \"Nope\", was his one word answer the last time I asked.

Yet, he doesn't feel the need to have me increase my blood donation schedule.  \n  \nNot really happy with my Endocrinologist these days. He also will not allow me to give myself my monthly intramuscular injection. I have to pay him out of pocket $25 a month just to have him jab me. He hasn't really explored the cause of my Polycythemia or Hypogonadism; he says he \"THINKS\" its related to my high BMI.

Not sure where to post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have too many red blood cells (&lt;a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/polycythemia_high_red_blood_cell_count/article.htm\"&gt;Polycythemia&lt;/a&gt;). (&lt;a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hematocrit/details/results/rsc-20205482\"&gt;HCT = ~47&lt;/a&gt;) I donate 2 units of red blood cells as often as they will allow me. Cool machine (&lt;a href=\"http://www.thebloodcenter.org/donor/AlyxFacts.aspx\"&gt;Alyx&lt;/a&gt;), it pumps most of the plasma, platelets, etc, back into you and just collects your red blood cells. I&amp;#39;m O-, its a win/win for everyone. They love me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I need to donate more often, &lt;a href=\"http://www.centralbloodbank.org/donate-blood/donation-types-and-qualifications/therapeutic-phlebotomy\"&gt;therapeutic phlebotomy&lt;/a&gt;. Every medical professional I have spoken to has confirmed that I should be doing this. If I wait the standard period, my HCT will back to it&amp;#39;s full level by the time I can donate again. The blood center tells me that a simple letter from my DR is all I need. It can state a a new wait time or simply state &amp;quot;may donate at any time&amp;quot;. The blood center checks your HCT before you donate and won&amp;#39;t take your blood if it&amp;#39;s too low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a testosterone deficiency. (T = 120) I&amp;#39;m 43 btw. My Endocrinologist won&amp;#39;t raise my hormone replacement dosage (300mg im per month); won&amp;#39;t even discuss it. &amp;quot;Nope&amp;quot;, was his one word answer the last time I asked. The problem he related to me was that testosterone will increase my HCT. Yet, he doesn&amp;#39;t feel the need to have me increase my blood donation schedule.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really happy with my Endocrinologist these days. He also will not allow me to give myself my monthly intramuscular injection. I have to pay him out of pocket $25 a month just to have him jab me. He hasn&amp;#39;t really explored the cause of my Polycythemia or Hypogonadism; he says he &amp;quot;THINKS&amp;quot; its related to my high BMI. My favorite encounter with him was when he told me, &amp;quot;all this stuff &amp;lt;reffering to my antidepressants and the testosterone&amp;gt;  are useless, you just need to snap out of it.&amp;quot;. He knows I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder\"&gt;Major Depressive Disorder&lt;/a&gt;; I&amp;#39;m actually on &lt;a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10029.pdf\"&gt;SSD&lt;/a&gt; due to my MDD. He is not a mental health specialist but, I find this a completely unprofessional and ignorant statement, especially for an MD! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a lay person but, I always try to be an informed patient and take an active role in my health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advice? See a hematologist? Look for a new endocrinologist? Any and all suggestions, corrections, and questions would be so welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "name": "t1_dg96luq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492208376.0, "created_utc": 1492179576.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6577do", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9580q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eriqray", "parent_id": "t3_6577do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Batterybutter is right.\n\nbut if you look at a cellular level, there's such a thing as a feedback mechanism. the body has a system to keep everything in check and in balance. that's why balance is the key. and they say that too much of something is bad for you. \n\nbasically if any thing is too small in amount, the body is stimulated to produce said hormone, blood product, etc. if it's too much, the body stops producing it. and let the thing reach it's half life or lifetime. \n\nin diseases, such as leukemia, the feedback mechanism is pathologic or does not work. that's why you produce too much WBC in leukemia. or any type of cancer for that matter (too much growth is left unchecked)\n\nalso, there's such a thing as DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation/coagulopathy) where the blood products are destroyed at a fast rate and the body is stimulated to produce the products to replace it. but then it goes haywire, since the body is producing too much blood product, the body senses that it has too much of something and is forced to \"coagulate\" (basically destroy the blood product the body produced eg rbc) the blood to reach normal levels = feedback mechanism at work.\n\n but since from the start, the body is already lacking something, it is still producing. in essence, it is producing and destroying the said thing at the same time = reverse feedback mechanism at work.\n\nhope you got what i was saying. lol.  wouldve used a hormone model to explain it but you were asking about blood. besides baterrybutter already used a hormone model.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batterybutter is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but if you look at a cellular level, there&amp;#39;s such a thing as a feedback mechanism. the body has a system to keep everything in check and in balance. that&amp;#39;s why balance is the key. and they say that too much of something is bad for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;basically if any thing is too small in amount, the body is stimulated to produce said hormone, blood product, etc. if it&amp;#39;s too much, the body stops producing it. and let the thing reach it&amp;#39;s half life or lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in diseases, such as leukemia, the feedback mechanism is pathologic or does not work. that&amp;#39;s why you produce too much WBC in leukemia. or any type of cancer for that matter (too much growth is left unchecked)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also, there&amp;#39;s such a thing as DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation/coagulopathy) where the blood products are destroyed at a fast rate and the body is stimulated to produce the products to replace it. but then it goes haywire, since the body is producing too much blood product, the body senses that it has too much of something and is forced to &amp;quot;coagulate&amp;quot; (basically destroy the blood product the body produced eg rbc) the blood to reach normal levels = feedback mechanism at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but since from the start, the body is already lacking something, it is still producing. in essence, it is producing and destroying the said thing at the same time = reverse feedback mechanism at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;hope you got what i was saying. lol.  wouldve used a hormone model to explain it but you were asking about blood. besides baterrybutter already used a hormone model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "name": "t1_dg9580q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206423.0, "created_utc": 1492177623.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6577do", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94u1u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "narcwhalberg", "parent_id": "t3_6577do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Your body does has a thing we call a negative feedback cycle.
