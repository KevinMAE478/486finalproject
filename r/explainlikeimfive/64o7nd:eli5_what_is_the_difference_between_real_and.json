This thing about a number being in sizewise relation is one of the main draws of having numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, complex numbers make up for this in plenty of ways if you do math. There are areas of math that kinda require complex numbers to be used to be &amp;quot;whole&amp;quot;, they are the logical end point of expanse from whole numbers, 1, 2, 3, ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Complex numbers can be thought to have two components. Real and imaginary. Those are just labels, don&amp;#39;t read any particular meaning to them called real or imaginary, that&amp;#39;s just a name. The same way if you met mr. Mike Mountain you hopefully wouldn&amp;#39;t try to climb him just because of his name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the big kicker of complex numbers is that imaginary unit squared equals -1. In other words, i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1. There is no real number which you can square to get -1, so that&amp;#39;s the big difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is actually the only assumption we make to define complex numbers. Everything else just follows from arithmetic we already have established. &amp;quot;wouldn&amp;#39;t it be cool if a number did this?&amp;quot; Bang! Math happened, and now you have one, and now you got complex numbers as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, imaginary numbers are like real numbers, except that multiplication with real numbers corresponds to stretching and rotation with either 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. Multiplication with imaginary number(complex number without real component) corresponds to stretching and rotation with 90\u00b0 or -90\u00b0. Basically, you can think of multiplication by -1 as turning the number 180\u00b0 on the number line. Complex numbers establish all the other rotations as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "name": "t1_dg3zs9b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491924440.0, "created_utc": 1491895640.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o7nd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg46pvv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "koi_polloi", "parent_id": "t3_64o7nd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Short answer:\nReal numbers are normal numbers.
