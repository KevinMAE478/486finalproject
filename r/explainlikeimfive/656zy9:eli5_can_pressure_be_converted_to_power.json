Yes, pressure can be converted into electricity and heat and anything you like. It often is in engines.  \nHowever, when you convert A into B, you are losing A. If you were to convert ocean pressure into energy, you are \"taking away pressure\" from the bottom of the ocean. What does that physically mean? What does an ocean without pressure underneath look like? It has no meaning lol. Pressure is just another way of saying weight (roughly). It's like asking if we can \"convert the weight of something into energy\". We can, but only until it reaches the ground. Ocean pressure is caused by gravity, the literal weight of the water sitting on the earth like an object. If you were to put any object underwater to harvest \"pressure\", it would function by lowering the height of the ocean surface by a small amount, but you would've had to raise the ocean by that same amount to put the harvester there in the first place. So no gain.  \nTechnically, ocean currents are classified as pressure, and we have ocean turbines to harvest those, but I don't think that's what you meant.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One version would sound like this.
