Our body's alerting stimulus fights against this building sleep pressure during the day, so we stay awake when it's light out.  When our body senses it's dark, it drops its alerting stimulus and lets the sleep pressure win out, and we go to sleep.\n\nFrom the second we wake up in the morning, you begin to accumulate sleep pressure, and it typically takes around a full solar day to accumulate to the point where it overpowers your body's alerting stimulus.  When we nap, it's because our alerting stimulus (for whatever reason) has dropped to a point where our sleep pressure is the more powerful force.  This is common in the afternoon, around 2 pm, as our alerting stimulus experiences a natural drop off, called the \"post lunch dip\".  Once you decide to nap, you lay down and fall asleep and let the sleep pressure dissipate.  Typically it won't take much to relieve the sleep pressure to the point where your alerting stimulus is now the stronger force, and you'll wake up after a few cycles of sleep.  With your sleep pressure lessened, you feel awake and refreshed from your nap.\n\nFor those of you that wake up from naps groggy and disoriented (I am one of those people), try to time the length of your nap to coincide with the length of a sleep cycle, typically around 90 minutes.  Waking up right at the end of a sleep cycle is best.  If you miss that wake-up window, you'll typically feel gross, grumpy, and worse off than from before you tried to nap.\n\nThis is a very simplified model, as there are a lot of other factors that go into our body's circadian rhythms, but the gist of it is, we sleep when our bodies can't keep us awake any more.
