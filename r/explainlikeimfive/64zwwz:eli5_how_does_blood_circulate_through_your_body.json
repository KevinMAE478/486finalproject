Veins have little structures in them that act like one way valves so blood mostly moves in one direction instead of moving up, then back down in between beats. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a limb is amputated, or an organ is removed, there may be left over blood vessels that used to connect to it. They are either removed with the muscle or organ, or attached to different muscles or organs in order to ensure proper blood flow to the rest of the tissue. In fact when the blood supply to tissue, or an organ is damaged and it causes cell death that is cause for amputating in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the limb is amputated the doctors may redirect blood flow and reconnect or change the route of different arteries and veins in order to ensure the remaining tissue has adequate blood flow to stay alive. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "name": "t1_dg6nynh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492064420.0, "created_utc": 1492035620.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zwwz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6u8f6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fishwhispers17", "parent_id": "t3_64zwwz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So this was all pretty needlessly complicated, but you all succeeded in making my phantom limb sensation in my amputated leg go all crazy.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this was all pretty needlessly complicated, but you all succeeded in making my phantom limb sensation in my amputated leg go all crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "name": "t1_dg6u8f6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492072177.0, "created_utc": 1492043377.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zwwz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg70uzh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PerlenketteFurDich", "parent_id": "t3_64zwwz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not as well. \n\nPeople who've had amputations run hot.
