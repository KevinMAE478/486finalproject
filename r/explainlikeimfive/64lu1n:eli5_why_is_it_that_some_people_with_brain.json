All children, whether developmentally \"typical\" or not, have some areas where they are ahead of other kids their age (e.g. a 2 year old might have the vocabulary of a typical 3 year old based on a standardized test) and some areas where they are behind other kids their age (e.g. That same 2 year old might have the fine motor skills of a 1 year old). Regardless, for most typically developing kids, the deficits and strengths they have are not more than a few months removed from their actual age. What I mean is, there are tests you can give a child to see where their skills compare to other kids their age. These tests usually involve observing the children do different tasks that would be developmentally appropriate for their age (e.g. Something that most children their age should have the skills to do). These tests have been done with LOTS of children, and so are \"standardized\"- meaning that you can compare one child's score with how all these other kids did, and know if the child's score is similar.
