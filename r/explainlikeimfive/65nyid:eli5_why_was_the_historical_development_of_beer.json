In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast).  This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find.

The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode.

With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony.

I'll put a couple quotes from the book below:\n\n\"Beer, lest we forget, is the world's oldest recipe, first scribbled on a clay tabled by the Ancient Sumerians. It sustained early civilization; it helped build the Pyramids; it oiled the wheels of the Industrial Revolution in Britain; it stoked the fires of discontent that sparked the American one; it's what Elizabeth I had for breakfast; it's what Winston Churchill drank regardless of the time of day; it was the heartbeat of the British Empire; it started wars and it finished them; it was the drink of Henry VIII and Homer Simpson; and it is as Jack Nicholson so succinctly pointed out, 'the best damn drink in the world.'\"\n\nWhen Jesus Christ turns water into wine at a wedding \"It's his finest trick yet it fails to withstand even the most rudimentary form of scrutiny. Jesus would never have done that. We're not saying it couldn't be done, but if Jesus was going to turn water into any alcoholic beverage at a wedding, then it would definitely have been beer.\nYou don't have to delve deep into dusty tomes dating back centuries, as we have done, to know that Jesus was a beer guy. Just look at his clothes. As anyone who's ever been to a Real Ale festival will testify, Jesus bore all the hallmarks of a beer boffin--a beard and sandals. And he hung around with other men who had beards and sandals.\nLet's hit you with some historical fact here: Ancient Israel, where Jesus lived, was flanked by Egypt and Mesopotamia--both big beer nations. Mesopotamia was where the Sumerians first scribbled down the formula for brewing and in Ancient Egypt, beer was used as both an enema and currency (not the SAME beer). The chaps that built the Pyramids were paid with 10 pints of ale every day--which is why they forgot to put any windows in.\nGeographical evidence? In Ancient Israel, barley was grown and consumed in big quantities and not used only for bread-making. The soil was better suited to growing grain than grapes and regardless of gender or class, every Ancient Israelite would have drunk beer in Jesus's day.\nThe Bible is rife with references to beer (shekhar). Yahweh, God of Israel and the Judah kingdoms, drinks around 4 pints of beer every day (and even more on the Sabbath day), beer is eulogyzed as a medicine for melancholy (Proverbs 31:6), and moderate beer drinking is recommended--Isaiah 5:11, 28:7 Proverbs 20:1, 31:4) with over-indulgence discouraged.\nDespite numerous mentions in the original scriptures, beer often goes missing in modern translations. Why? Well, the etymological bone of contention centres on the Hebrew word shekhar, meaning \"strong drink\".

I&amp;#39;ll put a couple quotes from the book below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Beer, lest we forget, is the world&amp;#39;s oldest recipe, first scribbled on a clay tabled by the Ancient Sumerians. It sustained early civilization; it helped build the Pyramids; it oiled the wheels of the Industrial Revolution in Britain; it stoked the fires of discontent that sparked the American one; it&amp;#39;s what Elizabeth I had for breakfast; it&amp;#39;s what Winston Churchill drank regardless of the time of day; it was the heartbeat of the British Empire; it started wars and it finished them; it was the drink of Henry VIII and Homer Simpson; and it is as Jack Nicholson so succinctly pointed out, &amp;#39;the best damn drink in the world.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Jesus Christ turns water into wine at a wedding &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s his finest trick yet it fails to withstand even the most rudimentary form of scrutiny. Jesus would never have done that. We&amp;#39;re not saying it couldn&amp;#39;t be done, but if Jesus was going to turn water into any alcoholic beverage at a wedding, then it would definitely have been beer.\nYou don&amp;#39;t have to delve deep into dusty tomes dating back centuries, as we have done, to know that Jesus was a beer guy. Just look at his clothes. As anyone who&amp;#39;s ever been to a Real Ale festival will testify, Jesus bore all the hallmarks of a beer boffin--a beard and sandals. And he hung around with other men who had beards and sandals.\nLet&amp;#39;s hit you with some historical fact here: Ancient Israel, where Jesus lived, was flanked by Egypt and Mesopotamia--both big beer nations. Mesopotamia was where the Sumerians first scribbled down the formula for brewing and in Ancient Egypt, beer was used as both an enema and currency (not the SAME beer). The chaps that built the Pyramids were paid with 10 pints of ale every day--which is why they forgot to put any windows in.\nGeographical evidence? In Ancient Israel, barley was grown and consumed in big quantities and not used only for bread-making. The soil was better suited to growing grain than grapes and regardless of gender or class, every Ancient Israelite would have drunk beer in Jesus&amp;#39;s day.\nThe Bible is rife with references to beer (shekhar). Yahweh, God of Israel and the Judah kingdoms, drinks around 4 pints of beer every day (and even more on the Sabbath day), beer is eulogyzed as a medicine for melancholy (Proverbs 31:6), and moderate beer drinking is recommended--Isaiah 5:11, 28:7 Proverbs 20:1, 31:4) with over-indulgence discouraged.\nDespite numerous mentions in the original scriptures, beer often goes missing in modern translations.

The reason for this is simple: it&amp;#39;s really easy to make them. All you really need are access to fermentable sugars (grapes, barley, apples, honey) and a bucket. If you put those in a bucket with water, the naturally occurring yeast on the skins of the fruit, in the air, and in the bucket will ferment them for you. Nowadays, we add yeast, but it&amp;#39;s not necessary to do so--that&amp;#39;s just for quality control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard liquors, on the other hand, are harder to make. For those, you need more than just naturally occurring fermentation. Fermentation has an upper limit for ABV (around 25% with specially bred yeast; with primitive processes, probably in the 15-20% range). To get above that limit, you need special equipment and processes, either through freezing or boiling. As a result, these spirits developed much later than fermented ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "name": "t1_dgc9dpl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390633.0, "created_utc": 1492361833.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nyid", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc71n4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TragedyZeroZero", "parent_id": "t3_65nyid", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Beer, especially the lower alcohol (1-2%) unfiltered stuff, is essentially liquid bread.
