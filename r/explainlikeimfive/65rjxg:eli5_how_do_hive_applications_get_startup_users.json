Otherwise no matter how many people download your app, the newcomers will just leave if people are just trickling in, which means the app will be perpetually unpopular. The key then is to get a large number of users *at once*, so that the network becomes sustainable.\n\nHowever, this answer only leads to more questions because it creates a paradox that many people refer to as \"the chicken and the egg problem.\" How can you convince the first users to sign up when no one else is around? Unfortunately, there's no easy answer, which is why businesses are willing to pay an incredible amount of money just to buy an existing social network. If you've ever wondered why Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are worth so much even though they have no clear business model, this is exactly why (social networks are valuable because they are very difficult to create).\n\nNevertheless, here are a few guidelines that can help create a network. They don't always work (e.g. Google+ have tried and failed), but these are characteristics that successful social networks share:\n\n1) Start with a small but concentrated population. For example, Facebook was initially only available to Harvard students. Once it reached a critical mass of users there, it then expanded to other ivies, and then to all colleges, and finally to everyone. The same can be seen for dating apps like Coffee Meets Bagel, which first started off in NYC, and then gradually expanded to other cities before opening up to everyone. \n\nWhen you start off with a localized population, you lower your marketing costs and you get more mileage out of word of mouth. It's much easier to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in one city than it is to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in a thousand cities.\n\n\n2) Rely on users to recruit other users. Social apps become more useful when more people sign up, which means the users themselves are interested in helping advertise the app. For example, Venmo isn't very useful if your friends don't use it, so there's already an incentive for you to get your friends to install it. This growth will happen slowly over time, but because a critical mass requires a lot of simultaneous new users, you can speed up the process by rewarding existing users who help you expand your network. Venmo did this with a $20 referral bonus to both the new user and the friend who referred them. Other apps reward in-app currencies or features, such as letting you message more people on dating apps.\n\n3) Minimize sign up costs for users. If you've ever wondered why many computer games (e.g. League of Legends) and mobile games are free to play, it's because the very presence of a user is valuable. A multiplayer game would be unplayable if no one else is there. Thus, companies will literally pay new users (e.g. Venmo example above) to sign up. Of course, this is very costly, so the next best thing is to offer the app for free.
