Sometimes it's because we have to maintain a presentation. I'll try to make a list.\n\n\nReason 1 - the allocator or size analyst at corporate messed up and ordered too many in those sizes or not enough in the others and its not selling down evenly (it happens). Maybe this style runs bigger than they expected, so people are buying a size down? Maybe when they were looking at historical sales they used the wrong comp style or wrong time period (people wear bigger clothes in winter, because they layer more)? Maybe they keyed in the wrong number? \n\n\nReason 2 - the vender messed it up. Or maybe they even had extra units they offered at a discount. Also, the venders have about a 5% tolerence on units we order versus units they send us (by size) so if they were under 5% in the smaller sizes, and over 5% in the larger sizes, my size curve is now broken.\n\n\nReason 3 - more allocator error during the allocation. Even if the size profile was right, maybe when the allocator was sending it to the store he just sent too many. I allocated product to over 120 stores, some of my coworkers in other divisions had 600, and some retailers have thousands. There was one time i accidently sent 20 XL units to a store instead of 2. Oops, lol.\n\n\nReason 4 - presentation. Sometimes we sent units to a store in a size we knew they wouldnt sell, because we had to maintain a certain number of units in store to make it look full.\n\n\nReason 5 - customer satisfaction. We also had to send a minimum number of each size to each store. I knew some of our smaller stores would not sell any XXL units, but had to send them anyways so the store wasnt size broken right away.\n\n\nReason 6 - somebody complained that a store didnt have their size, they were persistent, the store manager called us and asked (see - complained that we were making her miss sales and demanded) that we send more in that size.\n\n\nThat's all i can think of for now. I'll come back later if i have any more.\n\n\nSource: Worked in retail at the corporate level doing merchandise allocation for a multi-billion dollar retail corporation.
