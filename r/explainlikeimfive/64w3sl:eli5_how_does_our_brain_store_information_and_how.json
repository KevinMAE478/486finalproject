The neurons are tied together in different circuits. Scientists know that electricity flows through these neurons and can trace the flow. Scientists can also study individual neurons, but because there are so many of them, they can only study a selected few at a single point in time.\n\nOne part of the brain contains a special circuit, called the hippocampus. One patient once needed surgery because there was some misswiring of the neurons, which caused epilepsy. Today, this type of surgery is a rare choice of treatment, but the doctors had no better option back then in trying to relieve the patient from the suffering that his epilepsy caused. They removed the hippocampus. The consequence was that the today famous patient - Henry Molaison - could not remember things in the long-term.\n\nScientists know that the hippocampus is crucial for long-term memories, but despite decades of research, little is known about the nature of the storage of memories. One very likely explanation is the formation of very small proteins that grow on the tree-like part of the neuron - the dendrites.

When the light hits the grid of optical sensors, each sensor responds differently. This response signal is then interpreted. You have to somehow get from \"this is a pattern of lights\" to \"this is an apple and an orange\". That's where your memory comes in. Your system has some idea of what an apple is. That idea is called a model and is comprised of the different features of an apple. Apples are red or yellow, have a certain shape, taste, and feel. Your apple model accounts for the variances of size, texture, taste, etc. so you're not keeping a perfect record of every apple you've ever encountered but instead a record of the types of apples and their characteristics. The same is true for an orange. When your system assesses the image, it's not looking for an apple or an orange; it's looking for characteristics that tell them apart. If it sees red instead of orange, it can stop looking for characteristics of an orange. Once it has determined that that portion of the image contains an apple, it updates its apple model to account for the new experience. Sometimes it's a big change but most of the time no change is required. \n\nYour human brain works the same way.
