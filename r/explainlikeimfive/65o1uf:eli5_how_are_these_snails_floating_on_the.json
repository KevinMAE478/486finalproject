The Betas (a.k.a. \"fighting fish\") are native to a flood plain that only really floods seaonally. So they \"fight\" for the depressions because most of the tiny divots can not support two fish for the dry season.\n\nThey also produce a thick slime/mucus that floats to the surface of their fist-sized dollop of water. This mucus layer slows evaporation and so increases the chance that their little blob of water will survive until the next rainy season.\n\nThis is why you can keep a beta in a literal cup (eight fluid ounces) of water for months at a time.\n\nThe mucus is quite thick and slimy.\n\nThe snails are very small, so they can stick to that mucus layer and crawl along it quite easily.\n\nNow other fish have similar mutations for similar reasons so in a still water tank you'll get surface scum where various material joins with the water's \"surface tension\" to make a surprisingly strong layer of one composition or another.\n\nIt's not strong compared to your finger, but it's strong compared to the more-or-less neutrally buoyant snail's means of propulsion.\n\nAnd even in clean water with virtually no scum the water's surface tension is pretty strong to start with, and the mucus from the snail's foot is going to let it create the needed thickness.\n\n---\n\nBeneath all this is the question of \"what is surface tension\" in water.\n\nIf you look at an water molecule it's one Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms. This forms a little \"V\" shape because the Oxygen atom is about eight times larger than the hydrogen. The Oxygen needs to \"borrow\" an electron from each of the Hydrogens so it gets very minus-ee, and the hydrogen's one electron each spends so much of it's time servicing the Oxygen atom's needs that the two hydrogens get very plus-ee.\n\nBasically if you draw that \"V\" shape and put two little pluses, one on top of each horn of the \"V\" and put a big minus under the point at the bottom, you've done a decent job of making a \"charge map\" of the water molecule.\n\nNow the plus-ee parts of any one \"V\" are going to be attracted to the minus-ee parts of another V. This is called the \"hydrogen bond\". So if you made a bunch of these V, like if you printed a bunch of large \"V\"s and cut them out, you could make shapes by lining up the pluses and minuses.\n\nIt turns out that the water molecule shape is slightly wider spread than most Vs in fonts. In particular if you put six together plus-to-minus it would make a circle with six outward-pointing pluses. (This is why snowflakes are six-pointed if they are flat, more minuses stick to the six outward pointed pluses, and so on.\n\nSo in the full thickness of the water the V's are arranged in three dimensions. They are pointed in every conceivable direction.\n\nBut at the surface of the water they don't want to point their pluses up into the air. So at the surface they tend to form a \"mat\" Some of their pluses point down into the water, and the rest are horizontal.\n\nSo the surface of the water is a tightly laced arrangement of pluses stuck to minuses. This interlocked mat of molecules is so strong that it can hold up things. Heavy things like bugs (look up \"water strider\") and sewing needles (a fun science experiment).\n\nWhat's strong from above is strong from below.\n\nSome things, like particular mucuses, can make this barrier extra strong and thick. While other things, like soaps (e.g. \"surfactants\" as in \"surface actors\" but in academic speak) can weaken and break this tension.\n\nSo the snails may be small enough to just use the surface tension...\n\nOr they may be adding to the surface strength with their own snail slime.\n\nOr something else, like a fish or decaying plant matter, may have already added some structural reinforcement to that surface tension.\n\nTL;DR?
