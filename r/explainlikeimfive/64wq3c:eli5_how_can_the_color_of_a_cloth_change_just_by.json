Pet it that way, and they look smooth (and enjoy it). Pet them tail to head however, and their fur sticks up weird and they are mad. Their fur has a nap direction.\n\nOn a cloth, there is an underlying structure. For wovens (e.g. The pants in the video), the fibers are crossed over like a lattice fence. Now imagine if that fence were laying in the grass - the grass sticks up at a nearly perpendicular angle. Of course in a fabric, it's not grass but that actual woven fibers are either kinda hairy, or it's a special cloth with long parts. Other fabrics are knitted, like tshirts are knits. There are some velours that are knitted and have nap.\n\nSo with the cat analogy, we understand that the hairs sticking out can be brushed in different direction. With the fence analogy, we can see that the fence doesn't change regardless of which way we brush the grass. Now if the light source is really low, the grass will look bright on one side and dark if you're looking from the other side. That's pretty much why fibers look different depending on where the light is. The light bounces off the up fibers differently to the down fibers.\n\nWhen velvet clothes are made, it is so the fibers stick out and trap more light (reflect less light). So a black velvet dress is as black as possible. Jewelry is displayed on black fabric for this reason - so the jewelry can scatter light and sparkle, and you don't get distracted by the background. In photography, black velvet is considered to be the hardest fabric of all to photograph.

Aside from velvet and velour, and fur, other things with brushsble nap include cut carpet (not the loopy kind), toweling, snake scales, feathers on a bird, and other fabrics like the new two toned sequinned fabric [see a gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6UBjjZl6wY88GPJu/giphy.gif)... [or a video](https://youtu.be/mY9Ln8zHDBs). In these sequinned fabrics, the sequin is made with one side that is one color, and the other side another color. Sequins are flat discs with a single hole like a record. The thread holding it down is loose enough that the sequin can be moved to show one side or the other.
