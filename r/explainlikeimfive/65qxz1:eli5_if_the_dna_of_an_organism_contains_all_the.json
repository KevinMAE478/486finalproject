So, the circuit breakers are full of switches and DNA is full of genes.\n\nIn my house's circuit breaker panel, we only turned on the switches for things that the house needed. So for example, we turned on the switches that powered the kitchen, the laundry room, and the bed rooms. We didn't keep chickens in the house, so we turned off the switches for the chicken feeders and chicken water fountain.\n\nIn the chicken house, we turned on the switches for chicken feeders and water fountains, but since there's no bed room, kitchen, or laundry room in there we turned those switches off.\n\nSo far this only describes DNA and genes in the context of a building and it's circuit breaker panel.
