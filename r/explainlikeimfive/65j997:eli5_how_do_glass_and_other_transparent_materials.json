The light\n interacts less with the molecules. Detail below:\n\nFirst, we need to understand that light is weird. It's neither strictly a wave, nor a particle. Under certain metrics it behaves like one or the other. This is called the \"wave-particle duality\". When referring to light when it behaves like a particle we call it a photon.\n\nNext, light of different colours has different wavelengths. Each individual photon has a specific wavelength, and light is essentially made up of a constant stream of photons. Smaller wavelengths are more energetic (this may seem counterintuitive when first introduced to the concept but you can think of a smaller wavelengths as vibrating faster). Blue has a smaller wavelength than red, thereby giving it more energy per photon. Similarly, ultraviolet has more energy then blue. The spectrum of light ranges from radio waves (1km+) to gamma rays (1nm-). The smallest wavelengths are incredibly energetic, enough to break apart chemical bonds and can even cause damage to a person's DNA. Visible light is approximately in the 500-1000nm range.\n\nWhen an opaque object is struck by these photons, the energy is absorbed. For each photon absorbed, a corresponding electron is bumped up to a higher energy state. The \"space\" where that electron used to \"fill\" is called a hole. These holes generally want to be filled again with electrons. After a very brief delay (incredibly brief for almost all materials), the electrons that are energized \"fall\" back into the hole. When this happens, they are no longer in a high energy state and need to expel the excess energy that they absorbed earlier. Depending on from what energy level they fell from, different amounts of energy needs to be expelled. This energy is released as new photon. However, the electrons don't fall back down in one step. There are only certain ranges of energy levels that electrons are allowed to be in (depending on atomic/crystal structures). This is different for every material. The electrons falls back down in a few steps and emits a photon for each jump down. For many objects, the energy between these gaps results in photons that have an energy level that puts them in the visible spectrum. Some have multiple jumps in the visible spectrum, and to the human eye they'll appear white or brown or some other \"non-rainbow\" colour.\n\nNow let's look at transparent objects. In glass (SiO), the bands of allowable energies that the electrons can have is quite limited. When a photon strikes the glass, it wants to give it's energy to an electron so it can jump up in energy levels. However, since the gap between allowable electron energies is so large, there would be nowhere for such an energized electron to go. Thus, the photon does not get absorbed and remains the same colour as it entered the glass and passes through unchanged in wavelength. (A percentage of photons may change direction due to reflection/refraction, but the colour remains the same) Photons that have a higher energy level may be able to overcome this bandgap. They will be absorbed and re-emit new photons just like if the glass were opaque. However, this isn't within the visible spectrum and can't be seen.\n\nSidenote: The energy absorbed when the photon strikes an object doesn't have to ALL be re-released as new photons. It can also create \"phonons\" which are essentially molecular vibrations that increase the thermal energy (heat) of the object. That's why objects that don't re-emit the light (appears black to the human eye) get hotter when exposed to light.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially the answer is one of your suggestions.
