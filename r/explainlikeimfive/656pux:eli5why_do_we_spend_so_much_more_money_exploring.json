For exploration that's a big fucking deal.  Unlike Columbus they don't leave Europe thinking they're going to hit India. With undersea exploration it's the same problem. The points of interest in the sea aren't bright shining stars or planets that you can see from across the solar system. Biologically, eyes work in space but they don't work underwater. The technological challenges to observe and monitor phenomena are harder when you're blind.  Yes, the seafloor is just a few miles away, and not in the Andromeda galaxy, but for all intents and purposes it might as well be on the moon. It's more difficult to observe and monitor with Hubble-like clarity.\n\nBecause of eyes and the emptiness of space, all Galileo needed was a $50 telescope and an abacus or whatever. As a space explorer, he not just mapped the solar system but he modeled the orbits. He mapped both distance and _time_, space-time.  Exploration-wise, that's like the whole ballgame. Since things move and change, it's important to be able to plot where stuff will be and what the conditions will be in the future.  It's difficult to engineer solutions without reliably predicting that stuff. \n\nSince most of space is, well space, devoid of matter, the is no friction and water mass moving things around, just gravity. The math and physics of gravity are so simple Galileo could do it and Apollo could do it with slide-rules. But the ocean, like the weather, is governed by fluid dynamics as well as gravity. This is a much more computationally intensive type of physics to math out. It's hard to the measure and describe dimensions of a blob of liquid.  Validating a model of how a blob of water moves in relation to temperature and gravity is more difficult than watching a few individual planets interact gravitation-ally.  So if you want to know where an undersea current is going to move a sandbar or a fishery in the water column, you can't simply plot its orbit with relatively simple arithmetic.  So mapping and modelling is a big problem. With today's super computers we've just barely begun to create reliable 'Galileo-level' weather models. Hydrodynamic models are a unconquered frontier of science and computational power. \n\nCommunication is another line of sight problem. Apollo can phone anyone on Earth from the moon with radio signals because he can see the whole thing. Radio doesn't work underwater terribly well. On the surface you need to bounce off satellites to get around the curvature of the Earth.  It sounds like a dumb, solvable problem but the physics of a large mass of water between you and where you want to go is a stubborn, unrelenting obstacle. Yeah, the vacuum of space sucks, but it's kind of a stable, unchanging environment compared the the dynamic, interacting, multi-factorial oceangraphic, geological, biological, meteorological ocean processes.\n\nWhile escaping Earth's gravity is difficult, once you're in space, the frictonless travel means you can cover great distances in orbit without an ongoing expenditure of energy. Unmanned probes need more care and feeding at the bottom of the ocean. Things at great depth on the seafloor fail because the forces exerted by the water are greater than those in a vacuum. Think of the failure of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventor. Difficult to say whether the oil companies have a bigger budget than NASA when it comes to undersea exploration for oil...\n\nSo I would argue that we don't necessarily spend more money on space exploration or have more success colonizing space. It's just that the money we do spend generates a lot more exploration than a similar expenditure can achieve at exploring and monitoring the undersea environment. Like exploration is more than just getting there. You have to be able to write home and describe how the New World works. Want me to send my ship to an ice moon? Better know how geysers and shit works.  You have to be able to understand its forces to engineer operational solutions. You need to be able to leverage its advantages for your gain. \n\nWe've explored ways to do that at the surface. But blindness underwater is a stubborn problem.
