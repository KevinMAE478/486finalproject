The work that was done in 2012 was a single measurement of two galaxy clusters. This is a statistical measurement which can actually be compared to simulation because a stacked measure is far more robust. A single system can be tidally disrupted, the clusters can not relaxed and ultimately you don&amp;#39;t know if this system is representative. That told you very little. No, this measurement here has much higher scientific value. Yes there are models for filaments but these models are based on models of cosmology and different cosmologies give different models. Different types of dark matter for example can change the width of filaments for example. The fact that something can be described in a model does not mean that tells you anything about the real universe. This is a neat measurement, it is not just a pretty picture.
