Each night we went up to the dome and did some observing. During each session Jack was communicating with his telescope at his house in this community in Arizona via Internet, instructing it on what to look at and having it take photos. It was a very impressive set up. He built the motorized done himself. He's actually one of the only amateurs to have been granted time on Hubble - just a few orbits worth, but enough to take some pretty amazing pictures of a pair of colliding galaxies that he has framed and hanging at the house in BC.
