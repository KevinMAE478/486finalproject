Reddit, and rightly so if I must be honest, is giddy about discussing cast iron. But most people here are going to overcomplicate it for you, as they did for me when I first started.\n\nHere is what you need to season, and really, you don't need anything more as it will not make a noticeable difference.\n\nSeasoning:\n\nAfter using your cast iron for cooking, do the following:\n\n1. Clean the pan. Whether you want to do it the old-school, traditional method of just scraping off the excess gunk and then patting dry with a paper towel, or the most clean and hygienic method of actually using soap and warm water with a sponge. Both will work, just depends on your preference. Soap and water is [okay](http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/09/how-to-clean-maintain-cast-iron-pan-skillet-cookware.html),\n contrary to popular belief.\n1. Dry the pan after cleaning. Very important part of the process here. Dry the pan with a towel well until there is no more visible water on it. Then, place it on the stove to allow it to further dry while being heated. This will cause any water that's still present to evaporate for complete dryness. Again, no need to overcomplicate. Just turn the stove on high and let it heat. You will turn off the heat once you can notice some smoke coming off of the pan. You'll probably be able to smell it too, and you should notice a faint difference in color of the pan due to it now being completely dry with all water evaporated.\n1. Let the pan cool off for 5-10 mins.\n1. Next step is **seasoning**. This is what you wanted to learn more about. Again, no need to make this complicated. People here are going to say use lard, bacon, flaxseed oil, coconut oil, raccoon blood, etc. Just ignore all that. Use simple vegetable oil or canola oil, something basic you have on hand. Drop about a teaspoon of oil into the skillet and then use a paper towel to spread the oil around the entirety of the skillet. Put priority for the inside of the skillet, but you can also coat the outside and bottom as well. Add more oil if you feel like you didn't do enough, it's okay. Just don't go too crazy.\n1. Reheat on the stove. Again, turn the stove on high and allow the oil to cook (\"polymerize\"). This basically means it's creating a cooked-on layer of fat to protect the iron from rusting. Leave on the heat until, again, you start to see it smoking. Here, the only thing you want to do is make sure your oil has been spread on evenly and the pan has a nice shine to it without having any puddles or circles of obvious leftover oil. If you see something like that, just buff it out with a paper towel.\n1. Turn off stove and allow to cool to touch before putting away.\n\nThat's it. This was an exhaustive, step-by-step but I did it to break it down as much as possible. You don't need any special type of fat or oils, and you don't need to turn it upside down, right side up, left side right. Nor does it need to cook for 2 hours in the oven. Just follow these steps and you'll be fine.\n\nedit: spelling\n\n", "edited": 1492019391.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favor and simplify a process that does not need to be overcompicated.

If you don't wash yours for awhile, or even scrub the fuck out of it, you're gonna be fine. Archaeologists have discovered cast-iron pans from a millennia ago. Cast iron can take a hell of a cleaning.\n\nSeasoning is something you should do pretty regularly to your cast iron. Think of it as biodegradable Teflon. Not going to go into the chemistry of it at the moment, but it basically involves exposing cooking oil to high heat until it breaks down and bonds with the metal. Every time you do it, you'll notice the pan get a little shinier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is while you're cooking something else in the oven. Use a teaspoon of canola, vegetable, or olive oil (Bonus: For that professionally shiny look that TV shows get, use flaxseed oil for seasoning, the kind you need to refrigerate) for a 10\" pan, coat the pan surface using a tissue, and then let it heat up along with the oven before you put the food in. Let the pan cool in the oven until you can touch it, otherwise the coating will be tacky and won't set properly.\n\nDo this when you're done with cooking on the stove as well - I have a spray bottle of oil and a brush, and cleaning your cast iron while it's hot, and then putting down a layer of oil, is remarkably quick. The seasoning is maintained, and even builds up over time.\n\nDon't let your cast iron air-dry. Wipe off the moisture, or put it back on the stove and turn up the heat until the water evaporates. Otherwise your cast iron will rust, and you'll have to scrub it off with steel wool. \n\nAll of these things are tips, they're not mandatory. You don't need to do anything to 'extend' the life of your cast iron - It'll last for millions of years, literally. \n\nMANDATORY NOTE\n***\n\nDO NOT TOUCH YOUR CAST IRON WITHOUT A TOWEL OR COOKING GLOVE. \n\nGet into the habit of handling your cast iron with a towel even when it's cold. The one time you put your whole hand/fingertips on cast iron fresh from the oven or stove, you will always remember, but I'm still telling you now.", "edited": 1491998569.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey friend, a few tips on cast iron:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iron is made in the heart of stars.
