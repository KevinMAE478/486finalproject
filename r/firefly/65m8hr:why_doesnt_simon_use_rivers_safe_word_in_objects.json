With her simply holding the gun in &amp;#39;Objects in Space&amp;#39; there was still the chance at diffusing the situation since they were in a contained environment with only friendlies around and she hadn&amp;#39;t hurt anyone yet.  In &amp;#39;Serenity&amp;#39;, however, she&amp;#39;d just laid waste to dozens of people - probably killing some - they were in a strange area where at any moment someone could pop up and shoot her, not to mention it seemed way more likely that she was about to kill Mal (or be killed by).  At that moment I imagine Simon felt it was better to risk whatever happening to her because if he didn&amp;#39;t the likelihood of them just walking out of there with her safely was way less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "firefly", "name": "t1_dge7b1m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492495469.0, "created_utc": 1492466669.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8hr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8hr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8hr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbjq9b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ARejectSoShy", "parent_id": "t1_dgbfyru", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/firefly", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep. \n\nIn Objects In Space', River hasn't yet killed (that Simon is aware of and is shortly addressed later in the episode) and while it could go south he truly didn't believe she would harm anyone. \n\nIn 'Serenity' the movie she's out of control and that line of thinking is out the window. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Objects In Space&amp;#39;, River hasn&amp;#39;t yet killed (that Simon is aware of and is shortly addressed later in the episode) and while it could go south he truly didn&amp;#39;t believe she would harm anyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In &amp;#39;Serenity&amp;#39; the movie she&amp;#39;s out of control and that line of thinking is out the window. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "firefly", "name": "t1_dgbjq9b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338310.0, "created_utc": 1492309510.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8hr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbg56b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Brother_Farside", "parent_id": "t1_dgbfyru", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/firefly", "controversiality": 0, "body": "got me. forgot about that. guess he just didn't feel the need at that time.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;got me. forgot about that. guess he just didn&amp;#39;t feel the need at that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "firefly", "name": "t1_dgbg56b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333097.0, "created_utc": 1492304297.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbfyru", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 31, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kevlarus80", "parent_id": "t1_dgbfpuw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/firefly", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i thought that the safe word was introduced by the scientists experimenting on River.
