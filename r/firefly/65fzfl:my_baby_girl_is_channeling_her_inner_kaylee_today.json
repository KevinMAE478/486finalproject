I'd frame forward on the DVD, until I had screencaps of every second rib in roughly the same position, kind of a NNW angle; so 24 ribs, 12 screencaps.\n\nI imported the screencaps into Photoshop. There, for each image, in succession, I would:\n* extrapolate the intersection of the ribs at the center by tracing the path of several ribs and triangulating, identifying the central intersection point, hidden by the central hub, \n* then I'd set that point as the 0x,0y origin, with the ruler units set to pixels (rather than mm or inches),\n* then use the ruler tool to measure along the selected rib, from the center point to the edge of the parasol, making note of how many pixels from the center point each transition from one color to the next, as the spirals passed that rib,\n\nThen it was time for the math. I measured the parasol's radius in mm, divided that by the length in pixels of each selected rib in its screencap (this varied slightly from cap to cap), divided the pixel length by the actual mm length to get a result (mm/pixels) that I could multiply each noted pixel measurement to achieve a mm measurement, which I wrote down on a [sketch of the spirals and ribs](http://imgur.com/a/PKdRa).\n\nPenultimately, I measured the radius of the central hub (23mm) took my tailors measuring tape, and folded it at 23 mm taping down the extra. Then for each other rib (twelve of the twentyfour), I marked the mm measurements for each color transition.\n\nFinally I sketched curved lines from each measurement on one rib to its appropriate adjoiner on the next rib, using a [lesbian rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian_rule), and painted each spiral leaving about a 5mm margin unpainted at the edges, so I didn't compromise the glue holding the flaps of paper canopy to the supporting thread.\n \nFor the paint, I used water-thinned (because Kaylee's painting doesn't look super bright and bold) Acrylic paint, as it's more waterproof than tempra paint, when dried. \n\nI used\n* Liquitex (brand) Cadmium Red Light Hue (UPC 0 94376 97489 8), for the red/orange\n* Liquitex (brand) Cadmium Yellow Light Hue (UPC 0 94376 97475 1) for the yellow\n* and a blend of Liquitex (brand) Light Green Permanant (UPC 0 94376 97481 2) and Apple Barrel (brand) 21482E Bimini Blue (UPC 0 28995 21482 0)\n\nLiquitex was purchased from Amazon.com, Apple Barrel, from Walmart (USA)\n\nIf your parasol has 24 ribs, and is close to 425mm from rib center to edge, my measurements would probably work for you. Feel free to contact me if you need clarification, want more details, or need the measurements transcribed (my handwriting can get messy).\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Wphl4\"&gt;Image of the Finished Parasol.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Process:&lt;/strong&gt; (warning, I went a bit anal on this, but I do think the results speak for themselves)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I Played the episode Serenity, on my PC, with Photoshop open, and took several screen captures of Kaylee talking to Book. I&amp;#39;d frame forward on the DVD, until I had screencaps of every second rib in roughly the same position, kind of a NNW angle; so 24 ribs, 12 screencaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imported the screencaps into Photoshop. There, for each image, in succession, I would:\n* extrapolate the intersection of the ribs at the center by tracing the path of several ribs and triangulating, identifying the central intersection point, hidden by the central hub, \n* then I&amp;#39;d set that point as the 0x,0y origin, with the ruler units set to pixels (rather than mm or inches),\n* then use the ruler tool to measure along the selected rib, from the center point to the edge of the parasol, making note of how many pixels from the center point each transition from one color to the next, as the spirals passed that rib,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for the math. I measured the parasol&amp;#39;s radius in mm, divided that by the length in pixels of each selected rib in its screencap (this varied slightly from cap to cap), divided the pixel length by the actual mm length to get a result (mm/pixels) that I could multiply each noted pixel measurement to achieve a mm measurement, which I wrote down on a &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/PKdRa\"&gt;sketch of the spirals and ribs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Penultimately, I measured the radius of the central hub (23mm) took my tailors measuring tape, and folded it at 23 mm taping down the extra. Then for each other rib (twelve of the twentyfour), I marked the mm measurements for each color transition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I sketched curved lines from each measurement on one rib to its appropriate adjoiner on the next rib, using a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian_rule\"&gt;lesbian rule&lt;/a&gt;, and painted each spiral leaving about a 5mm margin unpainted at the edges, so I didn&amp;#39;t compromise the glue holding the flaps of paper canopy to the supporting thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the paint, I used water-thinned (because Kaylee&amp;#39;s painting doesn&amp;#39;t look super bright and bold) Acrylic paint, as it&amp;#39;s more waterproof than tempra paint, when dried. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used\n* Liquitex (brand) Cadmium Red Light Hue (UPC 0 94376 97489 8), for the red/orange\n* Liquitex (brand) Cadmium Yellow Light Hue (UPC 0 94376 97475 1) for the yellow\n* and a blend of Liquitex (brand) Light Green Permanant (UPC 0 94376 97481 2) and Apple Barrel (brand) 21482E Bimini Blue (UPC 0 28995 21482 0)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liquitex was purchased from Amazon.com, Apple Barrel, from Walmart (USA)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your parasol has 24 ribs, and is close to 425mm from rib center to edge, my measurements would probably work for you. Feel free to contact me if you need clarification, want more details, or need the measurements transcribed (my handwriting can get messy).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "firefly", "name": "t1_dgcsdnb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415840.0, "created_utc": 1492387040.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fzfl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fzfl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd09s3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "elves86", "parent_id": "t1_dgcskxi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/firefly", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is it my cakeday today?
