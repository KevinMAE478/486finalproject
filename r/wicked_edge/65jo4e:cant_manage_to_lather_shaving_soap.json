See my comment below. As I said, it's just a rule of thumb; if you've never heard of the maker, and olive oil (or sodium olivate) is the first ingredient, there's a decent chance you're trying to shave with bath soap.\n\nThis is because most artisans use similar formulas for their bath soaps. Matter of fact, it's the recipe I use: more olive oil than any other kind, followed by palm oil (or tallow) and coconut oil, a little bit of castor oil, and water, lye, fragrance, and any \"special\" ingredients the artisan may choose to add (eg, exfoliants like oatmeal or a superfat like shea butter).\n\nThe problem with most artisan \"shave\" soaps use is that they use the same formula but add a little clay. Not because it makes good shave soap, but because somebody told the artisan that adding clay to bath soap turns it into shave soap. The artisan has no reason to disbelieve this, since s/he has probably never made lather with a shave brush and is more likely than the rest of the population not to shave at all.\n\nThat isn't to say that you can't make a great shave soap with olive oil (or clay, for that matter). But the tie-dye-clad vendor at your local hippy fair is probably selling a soap that has been formulated primarily for hardness and cleansing, and maybe skin conditioning. Slickness is not even a consideration; to the extent you get it it's an accidental by-product.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So have I. See my comment below. As I said, it&amp;#39;s just a rule of thumb; if you&amp;#39;ve never heard of the maker, and olive oil (or sodium olivate) is the first ingredient, there&amp;#39;s a decent chance you&amp;#39;re trying to shave with bath soap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is because most artisans use similar formulas for their bath soaps. Matter of fact, it&amp;#39;s the recipe I use: more olive oil than any other kind, followed by palm oil (or tallow) and coconut oil, a little bit of castor oil, and water, lye, fragrance, and any &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; ingredients the artisan may choose to add (eg, exfoliants like oatmeal or a superfat like shea butter).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with most artisan &amp;quot;shave&amp;quot; soaps use is that they use the same formula but add a little clay. Not because it makes good shave soap, but because somebody told the artisan that adding clay to bath soap turns it into shave soap. The artisan has no reason to disbelieve this, since s/he has probably never made lather with a shave brush and is more likely than the rest of the population not to shave at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t to say that you can&amp;#39;t make a great shave soap with olive oil (or clay, for that matter). But the tie-dye-clad vendor at your local hippy fair is probably selling a soap that has been formulated primarily for hardness and cleansing, and maybe skin conditioning.
