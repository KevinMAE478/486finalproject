I&amp;#39;ve been DE shaving for a few months, and I caught the bug big time. For the first couple of months I spent way too much on samples. I bought everything offered, or close to it from Stirling, Maggards, Soap Commander, and just recently, Barrister and Mann. I finally decided that it was time to calm down and buy full size pucks since I had a good idea of what scents I liked. The timing was perfect, without voicing this decision, my wife surprised me with my first two full sized pucks as birthday gifts.

(Which is why she bought Don Marco as a safe backup scent.) Night Music is the first soap I&amp;#39;ve ever actually been nervous to try. I had a couple of days going back and forth, opening it up, smelling it, liking it and then putting it away. Then I&amp;#39;d open it again, not like it, and put it away. One night I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep, so at 2 am I got up, and decided to try a hand lather. I had a little too much water and it exploded (the soap is basically filled to the brim of the container, very little room for lather to form). I liked the scent so much that I cleaned up, went back to bed and kept smelling my hand, it was wonderful. The next morning, my wife told me that when she rolled over I shoved my hand in her face an sternly told her to &amp;quot;smell my hand&amp;quot;, this did not make her happy. I don&amp;#39;t remember doing this at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning I decided to do a full shave with it. It lather&amp;#39;s extremely easily, I did a 15 second load with an almost dry boar brush, before going into a face lather. I only added water a couple of times before it reached peak slickness and volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a strong scent, at first all I smelled was the musks, it was a little over powering, it smelled almost dirty. Smelled it again and the sweet floral notes started coming through. Once I lathered, everything started to combine, the musk got softer and the sweetness of the vanilla and bergamot with the slightest undertone of strawberry (mostly just a slight fruity scent, barely detectable) started coming through. Once everything combined it was a whole new experience than when it&amp;#39;s sitting in the container. The scent is this sweet, raw, sexy, raunchy aroma that inspires an intoxicating, carnal lust that keeps you coming back for more. I like to smell the soap on my brush or in the bowl once I&amp;#39;ve lathered it to get a full sense of the scent. Night Music is the first soap that I&amp;#39;ve not just smelled, but actually inhaled for a minute, to get the depth of what this soap is. It&amp;#39;s so intoxicating, I almost forgot to shave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The performance was stellar. Night Music, like all of the other soaps I&amp;#39;ve tried from B&amp;amp;M all perform admirably. They&amp;#39;re slick, have great cushion, and leave your skin wonderfully soft post shave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s definitely a different scent, it&amp;#39;s one you&amp;#39;ll either love or hate, but it&amp;#39;s absolutely worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Night Music from Barrister and Mann taught me that it is actually possible to get deeply aroused from the scent of a shave soap.
