I placed my order at 3:00 in the afternoon on Tuesday and received my delivery today (just 48 hours later). \n\nThere are several different scents available and as a first time buyer I chose just one scent that jumped out to me.  The scent I chose is called Strengthening and according to the website it is a blend of Rosemary, Frankincense, Peppermint, Spearmint and Lemon. Has a fresh, minty, herbaceous scent with a camphoraceous, woody undertone. This stimulating blend helps sharpen mental clarity and awareness. May provide an extremely mild cooling sensation from the natural menthol content in the mint-based oils.  I actually love this scent.  It is fresh, crisp, clean and even a bit antiseptic smelling. In my options this is a great warm weather scent.  And great for a wake-up shave.  \n\nThe soap can be purchased as a standalone 3 oz.  puck for 7.50 or as a 6 oz. tub for 17.95. Matching witch hazel based aftershave splashes are available for $11.95 for 4 oz. \n\nAs for performance, the soap loads and lathers amazingly fast and voluminous. Seriously light years faster than any other soap I have ever tried.  I'm guessing that's the mainly glycerin base (I was surprised to see the soap was translucent when I first opened the tub). Also it was by far the slickest soap I've ever used as well.  I know these sound like grandiose claims but I am seriously impressed (enough to write my first review).  \n\nThe aftershave splash was nice and refreshing and toning as well.  \n\nI truly am impressed by this soap from its Amazon Prime like speed of delivery to its performance and lasting smell.  \n\nI highly recommend checking Em's out if you're looking for a new soap to try. \n\nI'll do my best to answer any questions if anyone has them. \n\nI've linked a few pics of the just opened tub, the initial brush load and after about 30 seconds of lathering.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/cxGng", "edited": 1492117537.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for some lesser known artisan shave soaps and came across Em&amp;#39;s shave soaps (shaveplace.com). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While their website could use some updating/modernizing the service was impeccable.
