Be mindful that your lather may dry out sine your straight razor passes take more time. Reapply or shave in sections.\n\n5. Do not hone your own razor. Send it out to a reputable honemeister.

This is probably true. You will reach milestones that help your spirits. \n\n10-15 shaves you won't be nicking yourself much\n\n20-30 shave get a lot more comfortable and closer. I am just past this point. I do not have to use a DE any more. While not completely BBS, my shaves are very good.
