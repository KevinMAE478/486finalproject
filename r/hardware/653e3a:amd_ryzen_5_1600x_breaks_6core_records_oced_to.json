To keep digital logic working, you are primarily worried about meeting two timing constraints: setup time and hold time.

Second of all, the relationship between temperature and logic speed is not very clear these days. In old processes, it used to be that chips ran faster when they were colder, and slower when they were hotter. In modern processes, that can be reversed, or it can be reversed for p-type transistors, but not for n-type transistors, or different depending on different transistor parameters, so it's not easy to predict without detailed process and design knowledge.\n\nAnyway, when most people start overclocking, they increase frequency until they hit a setup violation, then increase voltage to see if that resolves the issues, then keep increasing frequency. Assuming they can keep the processor in a normal temperature range, why can't they just keep doing this? \n\nWell, this is where hold time comes in. Hold time violations occur when signals propagate through the chip *too quickly*, and cause data corruption. Raising voltage speeds up the slow paths, but it also speeds up the fast paths. So at some voltage, things may just stop working regardless of frequency, due to hold time violations. At this point, the only option you have is to lower the voltage, *or to try to find a temperature which fixes the hold time violations*.

It s becoming exponentially more difficult to increase per core perf so the Gap bewteen Intel and AMD on per core perf will narrow mathematically as they both approach the asymptote .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good analogy is the maximum speed of high speed trains. Most of the high speed Trains (Japan&amp;#39;s Shinkansen, France&amp;#39;s TGV, Germany&amp;#39;s ICE) competed in the late 90&amp;#39;s for maximum speed but they all plateaued at maximum operating speeds of around 330 km/h because that s the technical limit that everyone eventually reached. (TGV has the absolute record at 574.8 km/h but that s with only the locomotive so it s just for bragging right, a bit like LN2 overclocking :) )&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hardware", "name": "t1_dg7i7o6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492117277.0, "created_utc": 1492088477.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh18", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653e3a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh18", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653e3a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg863qc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "I_need_a_user_name", "parent_id": "t1_dg7iloa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hardware", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am too.

An instruction for a CPU goes through various paths before spitting out the result, for example, lets take a simple instruction:  \n`ADD R1, R2, R3`  \nThis instruction means: add register `R2` and register `R3` and put the result in register `R1`. In order for the CPU to process this instruction, it has to go through a few steps, such as getting the values of `R2` and `R3` from the register, adding the values, then saving the values into `R1` (it is more complicated than this, but this example is sufficient for our explanation).\n\nA naive method of doing this, is to just try and execute the whole instruction in one clock cycle. The issue with doing it that way is that the electrical signal would then have to take a rather long route from the start to the end, and it must complete it all in one clock cycle. At high clock cycles, this becomes a problem since your electrical signal can only travel so fast, if your instruction cannot reach the end before the next clock cycle ticks, then your CPU becomes unstable. For our example, lets say the maximum designed clock speed at room temperature of our all-at-once architecture is 200MHz, however, due to \"silicon lottery\", it is sold at 150MHz, with some chips able to OC to 200MHz.\n\nA method to help mitigate this is known as pipelining. Since the signal has to go through a few distinct parts of the CPU, instead of trying to execute the instruction all at once, we instead do the instruction one at a time, i.e, get the register values in one cycle, add the values in the second cycle, save the value in `R1` in the third cycle. This provides a few advantages, since our electrical signal effectively only has to travel a third of the distance, we can run our clock speeds at three times the speeds as well! Furthermore, we can also just queue the instructions right after the other such that for example instruction #2 can fetch the values it needs from the register while instruction #1 is adding those values (in reality a pipelined architecture will also come with a few additional challenges to solve, however, for our simple example, we need not worry about them).
