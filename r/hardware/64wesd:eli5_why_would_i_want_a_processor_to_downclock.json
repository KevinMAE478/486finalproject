Technical explanation: switching is not instantaneous, so there's some \"overlap\" current. Current flowing through a non-zero resistance dissipates heat (power loss). Also, parasitic capacitance in the transistors causes power loss when they switch. Charging and discharging a capacitor loses some amount of energy both ways.

Second, because lower clock speeds don't require as high of voltage to maintain stability, voltage can be lowered, which further reduces power consumption. There isn't a whole lot of exact information on the power savings, but a quick browse through the [Wikipedia article on underclocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underclocking) says power savings for modest underclocking can be from 50-66% (at least on older CPUs).

With higher power-draw cpus, I can only imagine the difference is even larger.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for how much, my testing says atleast 60%, expecting more from other systems, with direct savings being based on your cost per W/h. As for heat causing degredation over time, I expect there are articles around? The only case study I can imagine is the bitcoin-mining GPUs that were used at full whack for hours on end, and I&amp;#39;m not aware of how they were affected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hardware", "name": "t1_dg5mcar", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492012423.0, "created_utc": 1491983623.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh18", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wesd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh18", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wesd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60g7u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "prodikl", "parent_id": "t1_dg5knje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hardware", "controversiality": 0, "body": "assuming 15 cents per killowatt hour and saving 60 watts of power\n\nyou'd save 15 cents every 16 hours the computer was on\n\nassuming you keep the computer on 32 hours a week\n\nyou'd save $15 per year", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;assuming 15 cents per killowatt hour and saving 60 watts of power&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;d save 15 cents every 16 hours the computer was on&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;assuming you keep the computer on 32 hours a week&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;d save $15 per year&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hardware", "name": "t1_dg60g7u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039388.0, "created_utc": 1492010588.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5knje", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pvt_8Ball", "parent_id": "t3_64wesd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hardware", "controversiality": 0, "body": "probably about 30-60 watts of difference between low clock idle and full clock idle.
