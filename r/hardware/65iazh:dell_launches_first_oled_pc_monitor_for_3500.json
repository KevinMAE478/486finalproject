That means, the gradient can be smoother. The next question has to be, then why does HDR demos have been showing brighter pictures?\n\nWell, the reason is contents have most of their brightest and darkest parts removed (simply made the same color as their not-as-bright and not-as-dark colors) in order to fit the narrow non-HDR bit depth. The 'artificial HDR' feature in some TVs simply stretches the narrow non-HDR colors to the HDR colors, and filling up the gap (gradient) in between. The filling up process is similar to the 'soap opera' feature on TVs.\n\nAnyway, HDR has nothing to do with color gamut, as /u/Sluisifer mentioned.
