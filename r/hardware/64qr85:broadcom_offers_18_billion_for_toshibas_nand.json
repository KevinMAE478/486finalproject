Part of business is about stealing customers away from your competition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;that still does not prevent IP lawsuits between all the major western players&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how IP disputes get resolved and enforced here.  The important thing is IP disputes get resolved here one way or another.  Over there.... not so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;shaddy shit is going on all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shady, not brazen.  That&amp;#39;s an important difference where law is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you honestly think that western market is somehow more fair? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Western market is more regulated.  The Chinese market is more rough-and-tumble.  Things move so fast there, it&amp;#39;s hard even for the law to keep up.  So if a deal goes bad there, chances are you will have no legal recourse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chinese are doing what everyone else is doing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If they are able to produce products of equal quality based on stolen IP, then thats actually impressive (that they managed to match the quality of products in such a short time)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impressive, but one can&amp;#39;t help but think they got there by wholesale industrial espionage.  It&amp;#39;s kind of frowned upon here so we keep it on the down-low while they pride themselves on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Totally different mindset.  And it&amp;#39;s something to keep in mind if you want to do business in China.
