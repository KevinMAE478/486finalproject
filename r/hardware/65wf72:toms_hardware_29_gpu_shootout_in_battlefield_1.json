And it might happen to some of you if you&amp;#39;re running Games at very high fps, So you may find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially My super high fps was causing quest items not to appear for me. My solution demonstrated that the Game loops weren&amp;#39;t designed for super high Rendering rates... Aka FPS. It&amp;#39;s not a unique problem but can be generally solved by capping your Frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was that a critical Main Quest item would not drop for me to grab. So like everyone else....I googled it and saw that a lot of other players were Having the same problem. There were many suggested solutions bit they were  more akin to superstition then anything. But now I knew that I most likely wasn&amp;#39;t just having an ID10T problem. So time to experiment...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a very lucky hunch (due to a tech article fresh on my mind) I turned on Vsync and viola... fixed first try, I was able to repeat the &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; at will simply by uncapping my FPS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If You want to know more just Google &amp;quot;game loop vs frame rate&amp;quot; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.
