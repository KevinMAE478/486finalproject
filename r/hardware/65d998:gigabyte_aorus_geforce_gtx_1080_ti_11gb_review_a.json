You have to understand that with eSports titles like CSGO and overwatch, it&amp;#39;s all about high ass frame rates and getting as comfortable as you can with your settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hardware", "name": "t1_dgakouz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492286543.0, "created_utc": 1492257743.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgak7jz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kikimaru024", "parent_id": "t1_dga2vn9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hardware", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can understand playing on 4:3 CRT monitors, but playing with black bars just sounds retarded.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can understand playing on 4:3 CRT monitors, but playing with black bars just sounds retarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hardware", "name": "t1_dgak7jz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492285297.0, "created_utc": 1492256497.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2vn9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jaymeegeephuket123", "parent_id": "t1_dg9eeg1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hardware", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What I meant to say was 1440p at 144hz on AAA titles haha, when playing eSports titles it's basically a given to play on low settings, especially in CSGO with some pros even playing on 800x600 black bars.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I meant to say was 1440p at 144hz on AAA titles haha, when playing eSports titles it&amp;#39;s basically a given to play on low settings, especially in CSGO with some pros even playing on 800x600 black bars.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hardware", "name": "t1_dga2vn9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492248341.0, "created_utc": 1492219541.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9eeg1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Poop-Back-and-Forth", "parent_id": "t1_dg9bow5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hardware", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; 1440p at 144hz on a single card\n\nThe 1080ti can do that now.
