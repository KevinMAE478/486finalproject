I have severe depression and anxiety, as well as schizophrenia. My depression manifested at a very early age (9). The schizophrenia hit really hard when I was around 19. I'm 36 now and only first started trying to get treatment a few years ago. It's tough going because of so many years of running rampant. Leaving it untreated for so long has completely ruined my life. I can't keep a job because of my mental state. I can't take classes because I can't be around people. I'm homeless and living in a tent in the woods. I have no money or job. I'm overweight. I'm unclean because I only get to shower once a week, and have to wear the same clothes for around a week at a time.\n\nDue to the depression affecting me for so long, feeling completely worthless is completely normal for me. But when I date someone, I begin to feel alright. My fucked up brain starts to feel like something isn't right because I don't feel like my skewed version of normal. I start to tell myself that I don't deserve to be happy, and begin to destroy what is causing the happiness. I fall apart and have emotional outbursts and freak out and shit. I sabotage the relationship to punish myself. No matter how hard I try, I revert to this behavior.\n\nTo add to that, I feel others are more important than I am. I've dehumanized myself to the point that I feel my mere presence is a burden on anyone around me, and the guilt over that tears me apart. So I avoid other people as much as possible.\n\nOn the positive side of things, I've been on medication that actually finally helps me since January. Unfortunately, my insurance doesn't cover it, so I have to pay for it with part of my small monthly disability allotment. I'm also in councilling and we're working hard to untangle two and a half decades worth of craziness. I'm losing weight, and that's helping me more than I expected.\n\nSorry if this is a little incoherent or strange.

I have severe depression and anxiety, as well as schizophrenia. My depression manifested at a very early age (9). The schizophrenia hit really hard when I was around 19. I&amp;#39;m 36 now and only first started trying to get treatment a few years ago. It&amp;#39;s tough going because of so many years of running rampant. Leaving it untreated for so long has completely ruined my life. I can&amp;#39;t keep a job because of my mental state. I can&amp;#39;t take classes because I can&amp;#39;t be around people. I&amp;#39;m homeless and living in a tent in the woods. I have no money or job. I&amp;#39;m overweight. I&amp;#39;m unclean because I only get to shower once a week, and have to wear the same clothes for around a week at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the depression affecting me for so long, feeling completely worthless is completely normal for me. But when I date someone, I begin to feel alright. My fucked up brain starts to feel like something isn&amp;#39;t right because I don&amp;#39;t feel like my skewed version of normal. I start to tell myself that I don&amp;#39;t deserve to be happy, and begin to destroy what is causing the happiness. I fall apart and have emotional outbursts and freak out and shit. I sabotage the relationship to punish myself. No matter how hard I try, I revert to this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To add to that, I feel others are more important than I am. I&amp;#39;ve dehumanized myself to the point that I feel my mere presence is a burden on anyone around me, and the guilt over that tears me apart. So I avoid other people as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the positive side of things, I&amp;#39;ve been on medication that actually finally helps me since January. Unfortunately, my insurance doesn&amp;#39;t cover it, so I have to pay for it with part of my small monthly disability allotment. I&amp;#39;m also in councilling and we&amp;#39;re working hard to untangle two and a half decades worth of craziness.
