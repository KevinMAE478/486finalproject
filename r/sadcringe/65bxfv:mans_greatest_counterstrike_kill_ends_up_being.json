There hits a point where if you ignore regular maintenance too long it will be easier to just bulldoze and start over.\n\nVideo games aren't the condition they're a symptom.\n\nMy husband was addicted to work and nobody would sit around and say \"His lazy ass deserves to get dumped\" or any other nonsense. He was an addict. He couldn't go days without thinking about it. Vacations weren't vacations because he'd need to 'just check in quick' on some things in the fire.\n\nMy husband didn't wake up one day and say, \"Well golly gee! You know what would be swell? Being the type of person who works every day out of the year so even when I'm on vacation people call me with questions! What would be really grand is if after sex with my wife I had three missed calls from the office! That's the future I dream of!\"\n\nNo, the problem was financial insecurity caused by me not working at the time. We had dual six figure incomes and after children swapped to single six figure income. Before I left my job if his boss asked him to check in on the weekend for a project he'd have said, \"You do it. That's why you make the big bucks boss.\" Because he had my \"Fuck you money\" as a safety net. After I left my job basically he had no choice and slowly they rope him into more and more and he can't say no because we'd be homeless if he didn't work.\n\nSo, when it came down to it I was the cause of my own dissatisfaction. MY selfishness in wanting to be a stay at home mom while also maintaining our general lifestyle put all of the financial burden on him and he sucked it up and smiled even though it was fucking killing him because that's what he was taught he should to do.\n\nIn the end we moved to the Midwest and are a million times happier. We went from paying around 70,000 dollars a year in rent to about 15,000 dollars a year in mortgage for a nicer place. Schools are better. Crime is lower.

", "edited": 1492261062.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships are a lot like houses. There hits a point where if you ignore regular maintenance too long it will be easier to just bulldoze and start over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video games aren&amp;#39;t the condition they&amp;#39;re a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband was addicted to work and nobody would sit around and say &amp;quot;His lazy ass deserves to get dumped&amp;quot; or any other nonsense. He was an addict. He couldn&amp;#39;t go days without thinking about it. Vacations weren&amp;#39;t vacations because he&amp;#39;d need to &amp;#39;just check in quick&amp;#39; on some things in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband didn&amp;#39;t wake up one day and say, &amp;quot;Well golly gee! You know what would be swell? Being the type of person who works every day out of the year so even when I&amp;#39;m on vacation people call me with questions! What would be really grand is if after sex with my wife I had three missed calls from the office! That&amp;#39;s the future I dream of!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, the problem was financial insecurity caused by me not working at the time. We had dual six figure incomes and after children swapped to single six figure income. Before I left my job if his boss asked him to check in on the weekend for a project he&amp;#39;d have said, &amp;quot;You do it. That&amp;#39;s why you make the big bucks boss.&amp;quot; Because he had my &amp;quot;Fuck you money&amp;quot; as a safety net. After I left my job basically he had no choice and slowly they rope him into more and more and he can&amp;#39;t say no because we&amp;#39;d be homeless if he didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when it came down to it I was the cause of my own dissatisfaction. MY selfishness in wanting to be a stay at home mom while also maintaining our general lifestyle put all of the financial burden on him and he sucked it up and smiled even though it was fucking killing him because that&amp;#39;s what he was taught he should to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end we moved to the Midwest and are a million times happier.
