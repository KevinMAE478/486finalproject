I have one really good friend, we&amp;#39;re like brothers. We drink quite a bit, at least 1L of Ron Rio a day, plus bar stops and sometimes beer. So yesterday my friend let&amp;#39;s call him Frank hit me up around Noon telling me to scoop him up for a trip to the flying saucer. We agreed to lay off the liquor for a day or two, so I had one hard cider ($2 they have the best beer specials) and a burger. We leave and on the way back this super cute girl hit Frank up to swing by her place and kick it at her pool. At first we weren&amp;#39;t too into it, I had to swing by my new employer and pick up some information for my first day today. No issues there made it got the information walked back to my truck and Frank says, &amp;quot;She says there&amp;#39;s a bunch of single sorority girls going,&amp;quot; of course I agree to go. The only thing was we had to bring booze. I told Frank alright I&amp;#39;ll buy the Ron Rio you get the mixer. Keep in mind I&amp;#39;ve been in vacation mode for about 3 weeks and have about $20 cash to my name. We get out there go straight to her pool and start pre gaming. Well we forgot to pull the paper bag off and within about half an hour I had drank almost half the litre. Our contact shows up and I look over to Frank and tell him I think we&amp;#39;ll need some more liquor. He just cracks up and says to me, &amp;quot;well I&amp;#39;m not going anywhere.&amp;quot; I chill out, lay down on one of the reclining chairs to get some tan to my pasty skin. Then the Girls start showing up and I realize real quick that this group of characters weren&amp;#39;t the biggest fans of me. Apparently I had made a scene about a year prior while on xanax at a house part; I had no memory of it. I played it cool, being about 40lbs lighter they could tell I was different and I could see it in their eyes. I jump in the pool, immediately slicing my foot open on some glass. No biggie, walk it off. Then I start hearing, &amp;quot;where&amp;#39;s all the drinks?&amp;quot; I look over and see that the two of us had damn near killed the litre within an hour. No big deal I volunteer to buy more and one of them takes me to the store. I buy another litre and she buys 2 750s of some cheap vodka. We get back to the pool and to my suprise Frank made some new friends while I was gone and was helping himself to two handles of svedka. I go straight to the back and resume drinking off the bottle. I&amp;#39;m about half way done with the second litre and I&amp;#39;m having a great conversation with a couple of nice young ladies. Look at my phone and see that I have to be at work for my first day in 12 hours. No big deal i&amp;#39;ll just slow down and grab a bite. When I&amp;#39;m getting up to walk back to our contact&amp;#39;s appartment to sober up for a biy, Frank stops me and puts the handle of svedka to my mouth, 6 seconds and 1 video later, I get caught up drinking again. This time I&amp;#39;m pretty drunk, drunk enough to send most people to the hospital, but I&amp;#39;m completely functional coherent and speaking fine. We leave the pool around 10pm and go back to our contact&amp;#39;s place where the party continued. Our new friends and the sorority girls all came back with, to my amazement, more liquor. I sit down, not trying to talk to anyone because I&amp;#39;m way too drunk to consent to anything [wink]. I baby sit that second bottle until midnight when Frank asks me how I&amp;#39;m feeling. I replied, &amp;quot;why do you ask?&amp;quot; Frank, &amp;quot;you almost killed that bottle too. How are you still standing?&amp;quot; I look down at the bottle and to my amazement it was completely empty sans 1 or 2 shots. Our contact&amp;#39;s neighor comes in smoking a blunt, i take 1 or 2 hits and pass out on the couch. I wake up at 2a.m. with a burger in my face. And a nice young lady trying to wake me up and spraying listerine in my mouth. At this point I realize I&amp;#39;m fucked. Somehow while asleep my feeling of intoxication had magnified itself. I brush her away and pass her off to some frat guy who she ends up leaving with. Now it&amp;#39;s 4 a.m. and I have to be at work in 6 hours. I get home pass out immediately. Wake up this morning at 9 am and realize I hadn&amp;#39;t done any of my pre employment paperwork. Still drunk I fill everything out get showered and clean myself up a bit. Now I have no time to sober up and go straight to work. I arrive (to work), sit down, and immediately realize I hadn&amp;#39;t done my i-9 online. No worries I just won&amp;#39;t say anything unless they ask. We do our orientation and the manager is going through everyone&amp;#39;s paperwork handing out time cards. She asks me &amp;quot;your id and social security card please.&amp;quot; Now this was the moment I realized I really fucked up. No wallet no SS card, I try to talk them into letting me bring it by right after we&amp;#39;re done. Nope. No go. So now I won&amp;#39;t get paid for orientation and can&amp;#39;t start for another week when the next orientation class starts.\nTl ; DR Now i have to make my last $12 last at least 3 weeks.
