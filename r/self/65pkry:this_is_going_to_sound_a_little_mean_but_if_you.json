I can see why there would be a perception of a lot of rape in the military, but you have to remember that it&amp;#39;s an organization with an interest in managing its appearance. So it has statistics on rape and sexual assault and all that that the public has access to, whereby someplace like Google wouldn&amp;#39;t be as forthcoming. So the information is visible, and that might make it seem rampant, but I would guess a lot of that is just because there&amp;#39;s such a robust system for illuminating it. In my 4.5 years in I was never aware of any actually happening around my social circle, and it&amp;#39;s not like it was even a large topic outside of official briefings. Not saying that it&amp;#39;s not a problem or even MORE of a problem in the military than in other spheres. But it&amp;#39;s also not really representative to have it be the centerpiece of the negative side of military culture. It&amp;#39;s a loud but pretty peripheral issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "self", "name": "t1_dgcmhe3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492407844.0, "created_utc": 1492379044.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh96", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pkry", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh96", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pkry", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0e1z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "silverblaze92", "parent_id": "t1_dgcvvou", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/self", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's an expression we use meaning soldier on soldier and sailor on sailor.

And for that we should always be thankful.\n\nWe don't have to agree with the politics, but these men and women are often times in extreme conditions, away from their family, away from their friends, in scary places and just because their job makes them do things we don't agree with, does not mean we should turn our backs to them.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a very valid question, and one that if we don&amp;#39;t start to answer with intellectual debate over blind trust, the trust and respect we do have will start to erode leaving many people, in particular the service men and women in dire a situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly I think something that needs to be addressed is that many people take jobs in the armed forces, not for a sense of civil duty or patriotic pride, but because there are increasingly less opportunity for other meaningful employment. In that sense, many of the people that go to combat, are in a way innocent themselves and on return deserve our help, our pity, and our time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people also take jobs in the armed forces for idealistic reasons, maybe it&amp;#39;s a family tradition, or they have a feeling they really can make a difference. Those people deserve our respect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The minority of people join the armed services for selfish reasons, a desire of revenge, a hatred of those that are different etc. While there is that element, it is only a very very miniscule portion of the service people population.
