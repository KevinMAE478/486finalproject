He was controlling, manipulative, very quick to cause fights, and I wanted so badly to make him happy. It quickly became where I had no self worth beyond a desire to make him happy. I was his girl and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He once broke up with me on a roof top. We were two hours from my campus, in a major city. I had no money. None. Not even enough to pay for a cab, much less a bus ticket back to my university. He forbid me from going back to the event downstairs. My cellphone was dead, and the event was due to go on until three in the morning--and it was barely midnight. I was running on no sleep whatsoever because I had pulled an all nighter trying desperately not to fail a class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to beg him to give me another chance, because if he had left me on that roof top, I would not have been there come three in the morning. I would have found a short cut to the pavement below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My counselor told me that was an act of supreme violence. It was. She told me she herself would have jumped in my situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, he forbade me from telling anyone what was going on, and to smile like everything was okay. I think that was the night I became truly numb, and I only recently fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was early December.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much of me was lost because of him. I was always with him on weekends, so I never did social events. Never made friends. The friends I did make, I never saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then....Winter break came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I went home. Twelve hours away.

So we met in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I saw him, he was a person. There was no anger. There was no fear. I was more terrified when I got to his area of the city because of the memories! I was shaking when I walked into the building, but actually seeing him was...nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ruined me, or at least, I thought he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not a monster.
