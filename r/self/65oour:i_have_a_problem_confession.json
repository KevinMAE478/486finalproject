I don\u2019t want to go into detail about my upbringing but I will say that my parents are not bad people, but good people don\u2019t always make good parents. I\u2019ve never felt like it was appropriate for me to talk about how I felt, and suddenly being expected to open up on such an intimate level was essentially impossible. I haven\u2019t had a real conversation with them about my sexuality in the 4 years since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of all of this, I arrived at university feeling extremely unsure of myself, and feeling like, as a gay man, I had both something to hide, and something to prove. I made a tightly knit group of friends who I was \u201copen\u201d with, but not really. I had a brief relationship which involved no expectation to be emotionally available, and ultimately convinced myself that I\u2019d done something right. I enjoyed my course, and was looking forward to it being more intensive in my second year. I\u2019d smoked weed for the first time, drank a lot and basically had a \u201cnormal\u201d student experience which I felt like I felt comfortable sharing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time it became apparent that I had a problem with alcohol was the day I got back home. I started drinking with my family, very fast, and didn\u2019t stop until I was sick (if my memory serves, at 8pm). Over summer, I drank alone on a few occasions, and if alcohol was available, I would drink it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back to university, I started to hate my course, and to drift away from my friends. I was smoking weed more often not realising that I was addicted to the tobacco I mixed it with. My relationship ended, I became completely disillusioned with my education and essentially became depressed and anxious. I took antidepressants for about 2 months but eventually stopped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a way to cope with this, I smoked weed daily, and drank heavily a couple of times a week. I felt guilty for drifting away from my home friends, humiliated about how I\u2019d handled being outed at school (basically by playing along and doing exactly what I felt was expected of me) and responsible for my strained relationship with my parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an excuse, or as a way to \u201creset,\u201d I decided to leave uni for the rest of the year and change course. I started waiting tables in a restaurant where there was a lot of pressure to behave a certain way. It was a chain restaurant and they were pretty focused on pushing their brand in everyone\u2019s face. I was eventually sacked because, due in part to anxiety, I wasn\u2019t good at being warm or approachable. I was kind of indifferent to being sacked, although it was a blow. Either way, when I was out of university I didn\u2019t actually face the real reasons why I\u2019d left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back to uni in September of last year, I really enjoyed my new course, and convinced myself that that meant I was doing alright. I also did something I\u2019ve never done and made a group of gay friends. They club and drink a lot, and for a long time so did I, until I decided that I didn\u2019t like the clubbing part as much as the alcohol part. I started inviting people out to the pub on a near-nightly basis, and more often than when people didn\u2019t want to go out, I drank alone. I\u2019m still in uni, but I am now in a position where I have not gone a full 24 hours without getting at least tipsy in about 5 months.
