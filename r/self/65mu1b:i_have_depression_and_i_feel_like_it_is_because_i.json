I&amp;#39;m sorry&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day is a struggle for me. I wake up and get ready for school like the same thing everyone else does. Shower, shave, shoes, show up. And every day I get to school, I see a couple in the parking lot making out or laughing. Or there&amp;#39;s a group of people sitting in the back of a pickup truck eating fresh bacon from IHOP or something. I have very few friends and the friends I do have either don&amp;#39;t go to school with me, older than me, or I rarely see them in school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have anxiety when it comes to talking to girls. Let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m talking to a buddy and there&amp;#39;s a cute girl standing by herself in the hall or walking...she&amp;#39;s alone basically. The conversation that follows with....tom...let&amp;#39;s call him tom....goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Hey that girl is really cute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tom: go talk to her then&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: but what if she seems grossed out by me or uninterested?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tom: then walk away&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: so what&amp;#39;s the point of even going over there&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tom: to have a shot with her&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: but she&amp;#39;s gonna say no&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s just an endless loop of that. I don&amp;#39;t know how some guys do it but I can&amp;#39;t. I physically can&amp;#39;t. I can&amp;#39;t approach girls and say hi. I seem awkward and I probably seem like a creep and a pig who is just looking to get laid or whatever. Even if on some miraculous reason I make it, I don&amp;#39;t know what to say. I don&amp;#39;t know how to act, and everything my parents taught me about chivalry goes out the window. It has been like this for years and I get pissed off at anyone who says &amp;quot;just go talk to her&amp;quot; like it&amp;#39;s the easiest task in the world. I don&amp;#39;t know how to overcome it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys have feelings too. But we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to show them. Why? Who knows. I walk down the halls with anxiety wanting to scream and yell and cry my eyes out over nothing but depression. People tell me to get over it because I&amp;#39;m just sad. Well guess what buddy I&amp;#39;m sad for I fucking reason. I&amp;#39;m sad when I should be happy. I feel like my eyes are glued wide open at 3 am and I can&amp;#39;t shut them because I can&amp;#39;t find the reason to want to. I would love to talk to people about this stuff. But I can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even remember the last time I got a compliment from someone not named mom. And it sucks too because I love compliments. Even petty ones like &amp;quot;i like your eyes&amp;quot; or something...something that I may even be feeling self conscious about. Like my hair...or the fact that my beard doesn&amp;#39;t connect with my mustache or something I don&amp;#39;t know. It sucks that girls receive all these compliments every day from guys that don&amp;#39;t even know them and that&amp;#39;s considered normal but I&amp;#39;m sitting in a corner wondering if anyone even thinks I exist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would never in a million years commit suicide. I&amp;#39;m not stupid enough to put family members and the few friends I have in the position that I am currently in right now because I know there&amp;#39;s a way out of this. But I am not about to lie and say I&amp;#39;ve never thought about it or even never have done self harm. Because I have. I tried starving myself. Or taking an extra dose of Benadryl because I want to sleep longer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know what I&amp;#39;m doing when it comes to my actions. I stay awake at night wondering if the belt in my closet could support my weight if I hung myself. Or maybe even if I downed the entire bottle of NyQuil. But I chose not to because I actually do want to be alive&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going into the military. That&amp;#39;s all I have going for me. I trust myself to be happier by the time i ship out and hope to find new brothers and sisters trust and call my own. But I don&amp;#39;t ship out until august and I know I will most likely be single and probably not even receive a compliment other that &amp;quot;congratulations&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;im so proud of you&amp;quot;. Both of which probably coming from my mother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I have to rant about today.
