Western music has 3/4 major phases: Baroque, classical, romantic, and sometimes modern stuff is it's own thing depending on who you ask. Baroque is Bach, Vivaldi, etc. They like lots of competing sounds at once (called polyphony or many-voices). They were famous for fugues and really mathematically based structures for their music. Baroque became a little bit academic and so things took a U turn and became more fun. So classical music became much simpler and much more homophonic (many instruments playing the same thing). Beethoven's 5th is about as classical as it gets. Most elevator music is classical, not baroque, not romantic. Classical was fun and all, but then people wanted something a little more book-based. So the romantic era ventured back into polyphony and was programmatic, meaning it was meant to tell a story. This is probably where soundtracks became a really big deal. Peter and the Wolf is a pretty digestible and exemplary romantic piece. Modern stuff (ie 20th century) is really edgy and by all accounts a little to weird to enjoy. Most modern stuff asks questions like what is music and how fast can we play something before it's no longer music?

Music was as fun and digestible as it was gonna get, so then it just got more complicated. When people like Hans Zimmer write soundtracks, they're usually mostly classically inspired and only draw minor elements from other eras. Thus, most people have learned to associate classical with anything orchestral and it's become the blanket term. I think the most correct term for all of these different genres combined is orchestral, but most people would rather just say classical and be done with it. It's like calling a bison a buffalo, and in both cases, we've been doing it wrong for so long it's right.\n\nTL;DR: Musicians call it different things for different time periods, but unless you want to wind up on r/iamverysmart, just call it classical, which isn't half bad when you're talking about soundtracks.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a non-musician with a little background in the field, here&amp;#39;s what I know.
