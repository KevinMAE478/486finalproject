It can be shown that there are genes which affect expression of those values, and those values shape the kind of society that will emerge. One way this can be seen is what kind of family system a people prefer.  Individualistic people prefer the nuclear family whereas collectivistic people prefer a community style family. \n\nSo if you want to segregate based on personality, you'll soon find a great deal of overlap as though you were segregating based on race. \n\n&gt; Finally, where your argument truly falls apart is the fact that diversity is necessary\n\nI don't even understand the point you're trying to make here.

So I draw the line on race. Is there some arbitrariness there? Ambiguity? Sure. Not even all white people are the same.

Culture is at least partly a product of race. The example I like to give is individualism vs collectivism. It can be shown that there are genes which affect expression of those values, and those values shape the kind of society that will emerge. One way this can be seen is what kind of family system a people prefer.  Individualistic people prefer the nuclear family whereas collectivistic people prefer a community style family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to segregate based on personality, you&amp;#39;ll soon find a great deal of overlap as though you were segregating based on race. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, where your argument truly falls apart is the fact that diversity is necessary&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even understand the point you&amp;#39;re trying to make here.
