On paper, Hillary Clinton seems pretty electable. She&amp;#39;s such a household name, has a ridiculous amount of experience, she&amp;#39;s a woman, she&amp;#39;s mostly moderate. She seems like a home run on any election. But as it turns out, the woman thing probably worked against her, her experience was interpreted as corruption, Trump was even more of a household name, and there are a lot of people that are so sick of the establishment that they couldn&amp;#39;t bring themselves to vote for either of them. But it&amp;#39;s impossible to have known that for sure at the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "iamverysmart", "name": "t1_dge5kq6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493330.0, "created_utc": 1492464530.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge0fbu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "puppetstrings", "parent_id": "t1_dgdk45b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/iamverysmart", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But if people weren't fucking retarded and voted for Bernie in the primaries, we wouldn't be teetering on WWIII as trump goes missile happy in the middle east.
