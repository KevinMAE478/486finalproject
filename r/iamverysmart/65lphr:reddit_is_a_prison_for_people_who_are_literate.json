I don't think most people who have experience in academia or in the working world think of reddit as intellectual.  A lot of the posts on this sub, the ones with people trying to sound intelligent, read as if they were written by a teenage boy or someone with emotional difficulties.  I know that when I was 15 I was incredibly ignorant and obnoxious and it was a really rude awakening to realize what an actually intelligent adult does with him or herself and ways these adults spend their time.\n\nAn example of this is the top post on this sub right now is someone talking about the Big Bang theory only appealing to intelligent people.  The Big Bang theory is one of the highest grossing shows on television right now.  It's on prime time tv on a major network.  The people who make the show want the show to appeal to as many people as possible.  There are probably more \"stupid\" people than smart people who watch it.  I would say with basically any sitcom or drama on network television, which includes things like the Big Bang theory, and even \"Sherlock\" which so many people whose comments appear on this sub seem to think makes them smart--these shows are all written for someone with a ninth grade education.  That's actually the standard.  That is an industry standard because you basically can't assume adult audiences finished high school or pursued education after high school, and the shows are written intentionally to appeal to as many people as possible.  More people means more advertising revenue.\n\nYou can't assume just because you belong to one community of people or another that that community is smarter.  Chances are, if you are going to it, it's the stupid community, because these things are set up to appeal to as many people as possible and there is no screening process.  I don't honestly mean that you are dumb.  I was trying to joke.  I'm saying that information needs to be read critically, and if the information is meant to appeal to as many people as possible, it isn't written for the most intelligent people.  That information is usually hidden behind a screening process.  The New York Times doesn't print just anyone's articles.  I'm not saying everything the times prints is garunteed right, but the audience is wealthier people usually assumed to have college degrees.  Now, then you compare what is in the times about foreign affairs to what is in some academic journal, and the academic journal might discuss the same event but it doesn't even sound like it's the same event because the article is so loaded with complicated information basically no one but government workers and people who study that shit for a living knows. \n\nIt's like, I'm seeing all these posts from idiots on this sub talking about the drake (?) equation.  I'm trying to think where I've heard of this before.  I have almost earned my second college degree and I took some math classes and science classes and I've never heard about the Drake equation in school.  Ever.  So where are people getting this shit?  Netflix.  On netflix there's all these garbage documentaries about the possibilities of life on other planets or something.  There's nothing wrong with these documentaries, but they follow the same industry standards as network television.  These documentaries are made for adults with a ninth grade education because netflix wants as many people to watch the documentary as possible.  People don't like to watch stuff that makes them feel stupid.  So you frame this information in an exciting way and you reduce the technical aspects of it until a ninth grader can understand it.\n\nI'm not saying these a bad documentaries.  I'm just saying the information is empty of academic value.  What these documentaries are teaching is the history of the idea, not the math.\n\nI'm sorry I'm rambling.  I'm not saying information is good if it only appeals to a small group of people.  I'm just saying that if it appeals to a huge number of people, the purpose of the information isn't really about being academic or intellectual.  There are some really great books that aren't intellectual or academic, it doesn't mean they're bad.  It just means people shouldn't run around acting like a dick because they know it.\n\nI'm sorry if this is really long, and I hope this doesn't come off as me being an ass.
