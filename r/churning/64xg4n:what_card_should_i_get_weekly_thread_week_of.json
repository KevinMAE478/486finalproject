If you get two new cards that each give $500 back on the first $5k, you&amp;#39;re up $1000. So I&amp;#39;d say her decision should be largely independent of what you already have, other than to the extent that having the same kind of points is better than having little pools that can&amp;#39;t be combined (for instance, I&amp;#39;d rather have 80k Hyatt points than 40k Hyatt and 40k IHG points).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given all that, getting her a CSR, CSP, or Ink Pref is probably going to be the most lucrative initial option.
