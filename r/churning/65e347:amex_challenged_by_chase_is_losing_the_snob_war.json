I really don&amp;#39;t like pulling out the platinum at some places (especially if I&amp;#39;m a regular), because it feels like the equivalent of flashing a roll of cash.  The CSR is so common, that a lot of people seem to think it&amp;#39;s the latest gimmick like custom card designs were a decade ago.  I&amp;#39;m not sure what the answer to this is though, as I&amp;#39;m positive many people care about the image of pulling the platinum card out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That all said, the real benefits for me of the platinum are the hilton/marriot/spg status, and the centurion and delta lounges.  Amex offers has been kind to me, and the concierge got me hamilton tickets.  I&amp;#39;m not thrilled about uber (prefer lyft or via), but won&amp;#39;t walk away from a free credit.. so I&amp;#39;ll get the full $200 from the travel credit and $200 from uber credit.  I&amp;#39;ll easily get $150 use out of the rest of the benefits (especially lounge), so it&amp;#39;s worth it to me to renew..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "churning", "name": "t1_dg9u307", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236566.0, "created_utc": 1492207766.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vrf0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e347", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga9512", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "q3bing", "parent_id": "t3_65e347", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/churning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "IMO the reason why Amex is more stingy about category bonus points is their different profit structure than that of Chase, Citi, etc.\n\nAmex's revenue mostly relies on discount fees,i.e. the 2%~3% processing fee they get for each transaction, while other credit card company makes significantly more money on accrued interests. \n\nSo increasing an everyday spend category bonus would mean a very large revenue drop for Amex, and  so they would rather use some other incentive, like the Uber credit, to increase overall spending.\n\nAll above being said, their \"unique, luxurious\" marketing culture still seems outdated for current potential spenders, and Amex seems kind of lost on future directions.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMO the reason why Amex is more stingy about category bonus points is their different profit structure than that of Chase, Citi, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amex&amp;#39;s revenue mostly relies on discount fees,i.e. the 2%~3% processing fee they get for each transaction, while other credit card company makes significantly more money on accrued interests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So increasing an everyday spend category bonus would mean a very large revenue drop for Amex, and  so they would rather use some other incentive, like the Uber credit, to increase overall spending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All above being said, their &amp;quot;unique, luxurious&amp;quot; marketing culture still seems outdated for current potential spenders, and Amex seems kind of lost on future directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "churning", "name": "t1_dga9512", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257603.0, "created_utc": 1492228803.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vrf0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e347", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hsdt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kaztooch", "parent_id": "t3_65e347", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/churning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Let the war continue!
