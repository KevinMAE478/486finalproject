The best thing about LGA is visiting Amex Centurion lounge. I noticed there is a Priority Pass lounge (The Club) at MCO, which I will try to check it out. Anyone who have been there can comment on The Club lounge? \n\nFor our hotel, we will be staying at Hyatt Place Orlando/Convention Center. We booked it using our points which cost 8k points per night and the pay rate is around $260 per night. It's a good redemption since most of the hotels near convention center were either sold out or overpriced when we were looking for which hotel to stay. \n \nWe are excited for this trip since it will be our first time going to a Star Wars Celebration and Magic Kingdom. I will appreciate for any tips or recommendations for those two events and food places to eat in Orlando.

The best thing about LGA is visiting Amex Centurion lounge. I noticed there is a Priority Pass lounge (The Club) at MCO, which I will try to check it out. Anyone who have been there can comment on The Club lounge? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For our hotel, we will be staying at Hyatt Place Orlando/Convention Center. We booked it using our points which cost 8k points per night and the pay rate is around $260 per night.
