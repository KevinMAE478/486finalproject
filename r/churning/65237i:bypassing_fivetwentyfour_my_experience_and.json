I am around 26/24 with 11 new cards in 2017 alone. I have a &amp;quot;business&amp;quot;. Revenue listed was &amp;lt;$10k and sole prop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 2 weeks ago I got a call from my CPC banker who knows I love CC bonuses. He says that he just got done talking to his branch\u2019s business relationship manager (BRM) and that she asked if he had any clients who wanted business cards but had been denied for too many cards. Fast forward 5 minutes and he calls me immediately and tells me about it, asks me to come into the branch. I ask if it&amp;#39;s possible to apply for more than 1 business card this way, he puts me on hold for a moment and then comes back and says &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t see why not!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once in branch I meet with him and the BRM (my team), both are young and there&amp;#39;s brief conversation about how 5/24 has inhibited me from getting some of the great available bonuses now, etc. With that, she hands me already filled out paper applications and says she just needs my signature. I noted immediately that the interest rates were fixed and so I asked if I was pre-approved for the cards (Ink Preferred and Ink Cash). They look it up on the computer and don\u2019t see any pre-approvals. The BRM goes on to say that she was having me fill out the paper applications because when she (BRM) submits the paper applications they go to a specialized business lending department who doesn\u2019t deny based on 5/24. I was very intrigued at this point as the prospect of getting 2 business cards at the BRM bonus rates (100k and 50k), but very skeptical that this would end in my favor but continued anyways as with my # of HP&amp;#39;s another one won&amp;#39;t change anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explains that because it&amp;#39;s a paper application the process can take longer than normal, but to be patient. After a few days of not hearing anything from my team I call and check the status line, it states I have no applications on file, hmm interesting. I call the BRM and see if everything went through ok and if she needed anything else. She states that she actually had just spoken with the lending team and that the applications were received and going to be looked at later that day or tomorrow. A few days later, after still hearing nothing from my team or Chase, I check the status line\u2026CIP approved for 10k and Ink Cash was 2-wk status. Are you kidding me? This is awesome! I was pumped. I then began checking the status line every few hours to track the progress of the Ink Cash. Unfortunately later the next day it changed to 7-10 days and subsequently got the denial letter. The only reason stated for the denial was that I had to much available credit available to me. At this point I decided that although it may be pushing my luck, it couldn&amp;#39;t hurt to try and get the Ink Cash approved too. I put on my game-face, loaded up some \u201cnumbers\u201d to reference, and called recon.
