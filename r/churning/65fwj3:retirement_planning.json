With churning, I can travel 10-12 times a year and some of it can be in biz/first and some of it can be last minute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a comment a little further down that I think bears repeating.  Most of the reason I churn is to travel.  I never traveled more than 100 miles from my house as a kid (didn&amp;#39;t get on a plane until I was 17) and as soon as I experienced traveling I was hooked.  That addiction (for lack of a better word) feeds the churning.  If not for traveling, I might do a little churning for savings/retirement/general spending.

So, for me at least, &lt;a href=\"/r/churning\"&gt;/r/churning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/financialindependence\"&gt;/r/financialindependence&lt;/a&gt; are very much linked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve talked about this around here before, but I actually see doing this as the best cpp value available. People get really excited about cashing in URs at 1.5cpp, for example, or transferring to airlines for ~2cpp, and there&amp;#39;s a general sentiment that 1cpp for cash redemptions is a horrible thing to do with UR/MR/TYP/etc. But 1cpp invested with an average annual return of 7% will be worth ~4cpp by the time I retire (assuming I retire early). Alternatively, if I retire at the normal age of 65, my points redeemed today at 1cpp will be worth ~&lt;strong&gt;19cpp&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy traveling, and there are a few places that I absolutely love visiting (see flair), so I do use points for flights and hotels occasionally. But doing that generally represents a &lt;em&gt;lower value redemption&lt;/em&gt; than investment funds, so I don&amp;#39;t do it as frequently (and usually only with points that are hard/impossible to convert into cash).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "churning", "name": "t1_dg9xr2r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241466.0, "created_utc": 1492212666.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vrf0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fwj3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga1vao", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "timtom178", "parent_id": "t3_65fwj3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/churning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My wife and I churn so we can still travel while maxing out both our 401k's, IRAs, pay down my student loans, and invest... we live and spend like we are school teachers, and save everything else..
