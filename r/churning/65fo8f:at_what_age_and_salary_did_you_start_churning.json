Started with Freedom, Freedom Unlimited, Blue Cash, Citi AA, CSP, and Delta AMEX. Currently a student in school too!... so I&amp;#39;m kinda hesitant on high AF cards for the upfront costs. However, all these bank bonuses and points are making the school year tolerable. I get to treat myself between semesters and have some extra fun money :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior, I just had a shitty Bank of America card that I despise. No rewards, but its my oldest card (9~ yrs, so I have to keep it) I guess it worked out okay, since if gave me a pretty good credit history to sign up for all these awesome cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "churning", "name": "t1_dgaazc8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492260776.0, "created_utc": 1492231976.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vrf0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fo8f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaazkf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Clip_Clippington", "parent_id": "t3_65fo8f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/churning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In theory, I got my first points earning card back in 2005 or so when Chase offered me an AF free United card.
