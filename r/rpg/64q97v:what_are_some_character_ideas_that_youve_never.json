A lover of flair and pizazz, he has next to no fighting capability, but damn does he look fine.  Also, he&amp;#39;s a skeleton.  Yeah (Thus the fragile part).  Every person he meets, he needs to do a bluff check to convince them that, of course he&amp;#39;s a normal human man with normal human skin and hair.  Just look at it!  It&amp;#39;s so gorgeous!  Just look at all this magic and listen to all this beautiful music!  A skeleton with no tongue that just sort of hisses menacingly can&amp;#39;t do that.  Nope.  It&amp;#39;s not like he uses Minor Illusion all the time to make it sound like he&amp;#39;s really singing.  That would be ridiculous.  You&amp;#39;re crazy!  From a play standpoint, half the humor comes from his ridiculous antics while the other half comes from the occasional person who actually is smart enough to recognize a skeleton when they see one and not be taken in by his magical trickery.  And yes, you can bet your bottom dollar that he parades around like it&amp;#39;s El Dia de Los Muertos 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg8ut5k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492180002.0, "created_utc": 1492151202.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q97v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4h0vb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DearGodPleaseWork", "parent_id": "t3_64q97v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Technically a Professional:\nA cavalier that was sent to serve a local adventurer guildmaster/mistress from his lord as repayment for [INSERT EMBARRASSING QUEST HERE.] Completely against his will, but damn it, he's a professional, and will do his fucking job.

He anticipates all dungeons to be trap-riddled death mazes, and all magic items to be illusions hiding spheres of annihilation. The newer editions' focus on narrative and fun escapes his notice.\n\nTo combat the lethal dangers he expects around every corner he employs his trusty Dungeon Delving Procedures Manual: Surviving Gygax - a bulky, dog-eared book outlining the proper procedure for any situation. Encounter a door? Consult the door breaching table on page 221. A dimly lit hallway? Consult chapter 7, article 12: Navigating unlit passages. Discover a treasure hoard? The appendix might shed some light on the best approach, accounting for seniority.\n\nHis background is military, and so his adherence to procedure is borne out of a sense of duty rather than apprehensiveness. Left to his own devices he is likely to navigate any dungeon successfully, though he might take a month to do so. In a party he's often driven slightly crazy as his allies barge on ahead, heedless of the potential dangers outlined in his book.
