I GM a D&amp;amp;D 5e game. One of my players has become a bit of a kleptomaniac, picking up anything that remotely looks like an &amp;#39;ingredient&amp;#39;, and asking me if they find anything during the party&amp;#39;s travels. In the interest of creating something more interesting than &amp;#39;you find 10gp worth of herbs&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;ve prototyped a little crafting heuristic that works well with my improv-driven, but low-prep style of GMing, and I thought I&amp;#39;d share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here are the basic rules.

Tags in ingredients start as Inactive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tags can be manipulated by a Process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tags can be identified by testing. Testing may destroy the ingredient but reveals a number of tags. Check varies with ingredient type. Use herbalism tools, for example, for plants. DC 10 to prevent destroying it. Learn one tag at DC 5, and one additional tag for every 5 higher.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A process can combine two ingredients, creating a single new ingredient.

Duplicate tags increase intensity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When rendering ingredients into outcome, only strongest non-Inactive tags matter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you would strengthen a Strong tag, instead the ingredient is no longer alchemically reactive.

When drunk it allows you to speak to a dead family member so long as you know their name. Lasts for an hour.\n* Sleepy Pills - Helps you get a good night sleep. 10 doses. Each pill is a tiny nightcap.\n* Grenade of Mending - It mends stuff in a big area.\n* Panacea - Cures all disease, poisons, rashes, bruises, etc. Injection deals 1 damage.\n* Pocket Sand - Throw like pocket sand, bury the area in two feet of sand.\n* Enchanter's Elixir - An item becomes +3 for the duration of one encounter. Side effect: Item turns to stone afterwards.\n* Dose Doubler - With a single drop, becomes a copy of an existing potion.\n* Death's Delay - Prevents you from aging for one year.\n* Dwarven Gilding - If poured onto an item, the item will be permanently transmuted into mythril.\n* Elf's Remorse - It's egg-white paste in a jar.

Outsiders and undead have disadvantage on the saving throw.\n* Reader's Digest - A vial filled with what appears to be liquid paper pulp, when consumed it allows you to read at 100 times normal human ability. Lasts for one hour.\n* Can of Clothes - A small tin can with a twist top. Think of an outfit, pop the lid, and clothes shoot out.\n* Essence of Hadar - A clay vase with a relief carving of a tentacle wrapped around it.
