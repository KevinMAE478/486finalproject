In this course, you learn how to give and receive feedback, how to defuse charges situations, how to negotiate and define metagame rules to ensure the game stays comfortable and satisfying for everyone involved. We will mention topics such as dice fudging, railroading and bait-and-switch, as controversial techniques that have their uses but can easily break groups if the communication is lacking.\n\n* **Genres, tropes, archetypes and expectations**\n\nEach game makes use of some narrative conventions - taking them from a known genre or defining them itself. In this course you learn how to use genre tropes and archetypes to manage player expectations and build a common understanding of the shared fiction. WARNING: We take no responsibility for time wasted by students browsing TvTropes.\n\n* **System matters**\n\nOne needs an appropriate tool for their job. During this course, we focus on some of the games you tried in *Just play it* course. We take their systems apart piece by piece and analyze how they affect the play experience. After finishing this course you should know how to choose a system that fits the style of play you and your players want, how to customize systems for different settings and how to hack/house rule around small problems in games you otherwise like.\n\n* **Tools of the trade**\n\nA roleplaying game is a conversation.
