Most of my time on Roll20 has been as a GM.\n\nMy first point of advice? If at all possible, if schedule allows, and if you are willing to put in the sometimes hours of effort:\n\nBuild. A. Group. Not a game.\n\nNot a few wankers to play a single game with. A group. Some people that ideally you will be playing with in 3 years. Ideally this will include at least one other person with an interest in GMing at some point. It's possible you can't do this - some of this advice should still apply but your focus is on making a friends list of great players you can pinch from but, for the time being, my advice primarily focuses on this type of GM who is willing to bust his ass and deal with a lot of disappointments to form a group of guys and gals to sit and game with regularly who won't just be strangers on the internet, but eventually good friends. People in my group earlier this year went to a convention together.\n\nTo do this, you as the GM need to be willing to be flexible, be honest and upfront with your players. \"Hey guys, I fucked up! So the way I'm going to handle this is from now on is - \" or \"So I made a ruling last session that killed x character. Turns out, that was a real shit ruling. I'm sorry. But the story has advanced and I can't figure out how to bring the character back without rewinding everything, so I'm sorry, what do you guys thing is a fair way for me to apologize to Tom without unbalancing the game? I'm thinking may we can toss him a unique utilitarian magic item, something with some cool flavor?\". You also have to be willing to pull people aside, have a talk with them and, yes, kick them from the group if they don't fit. Make sure they KNOW what they are doing wrong before you kick them - give them a chance to fix it. Don't just assume they know.\n\n**The Recruitment Post**\n\nWhen you recruit for a game, remember you are recruiting for your group, not just the current game. Make it clear what style of GM you are - this may take some time to figure out if you are new. If you are new, be honest. \"I'm a new GM. I'm going to screw up - please be patient. Also please understand that I may simply disagree with you for better or worse.\" For a new GM? Explaining that rules lawyers probably won't enjoy themselves is not just fair, but responsible. If you are a crunchy GM who thinks the game is enhanced by a measure of risk - and that means characters may die, that's something the player should know. Tell people that you are looking to form a long-term group and that you are more interested in them than their character - bold that if you have to - and in my case I would even request people not give me a character sheet. You don't know the world, or the house rules, much less the party - how can you make a character? In fact, if I saw someone say \"I'd like to play a ranger\" or \"I don't play fighters\" or - and this is key \"I don't play clerics/deckers/supportive characters\" - be a bit skeptical. \n\nSo, your prospective players have seen a detailed post about your world including the type of focus of the game - an expedition to the \"new world\" in which they are forming a colony from the ground up and have to explore the dangers of the jungles, delve into zigguarauts and steal aztec gold while finding plants the colony can use and making alliances and deals with the natives - something that tells them what type of gameplay they can expect. You've got a clear list of what you want them to reply with - this is as much to see if they are reading your intro post as much as to give you information. This sorts out the people just shotgunning the same application into as many games as they can find. And make it clear that you'll be interviewing players. I personally inform people that I prefer to play with people around my age - I don't play with people under 18 (had a bad issue with a mother bitching me out in the middle of a game.) - I make sure they are aware that I have house rules and what they are geared towards achieving (but save the actual discussion of specifics for the interview).\n\n**Stalki um...Research**\n\nNow you do your research. For each player look through their profile. Check their discussion posts on the forums - are they an asshole? Are they dismissive of other views? Are they generally helpful? Or, most likely, do they have nothing? No big deal. At the top of their profile you'll see how long they've been a member and other details. How many hours have they played? This can be unreliable if they just forget to close their browser. Look at their forums post count. This includes posts to apply for games. If a player has no forum activity (check recent posts - if it's empy then all their posts have been in applying for games), lots of posts, but little time played? That usually means they have applied and joined in a lot of games, but haven't worked out for other GMs. That doesn't mean they should be dropped, but it's a mark against them. Look at the badges. The ones you are looking for are the following: I've God An Idea (means they've run a game on Roll20, tried to, or at least played with the interface.), Patron of the Arts (they've purchased a pack on Roll20. That means they've invested money into a game - and it means they have the ability to obtain a credit card.) Others that are good to look for are Scribe, Won't You Be My Neighbor / One of Us (means they either jump games a lot, or leave their tab open), Never Ending Story (they've run or been in a long-running campaign, or they just never delete their games), Better to Give, Script Runner and the \"Played with x people\" achievements. If they've only played 50 hours of games, but have played with over 100 people, that means they have been in a lot of games that only lasted a few hours. \n\n**Interview**\n\nSo now you've researched your players a bit, you've payed attention to what they said on their post, you've looked into badges and profile details, you've found some that really make you leery. Reply to ALL posts. Don't just ignore them. Tell them that you are sorry but you are going to pass (don't give a reason, that invites them to argue), and wish them the best of luck finding a group that fits their game style. The ones you are hopeful about? Send them a PM with skype info, ask them to add you, and try to figure out when you can chat with them on skype or whatever voice system you can. \n\nThe interview serves two purposes. Scaring away players who won't like your game, and getting to know who might be a good fit. Ask them open-ended questions, and don't guide their answers. My favorite questions?\n\n* Can you tell me about your favorite character? - Encourage them to gush. Most tabletop gamers have a favorite, doesn't matter about system. They'll tell you a story about the character and this should give you a good idea of what they enjoy. Players who talk about the time their character stood up to a dragon and wrestled it down are looking for bad ass moments, players who talk about outsmarting the enemy are looking for that. Players who talk about getting cool loot and playing at high level, or talk about their super cool build? This tells you what gets them exited. \n* Give me your favorite \"No shit, there I was in a dungeon / run / mission\" moment. - A lot like the above one. More details, confirm your suspicions. \n* What really pisses you off in a GM? - Let's be honest, this might be you. You might be the guy who pisses them off. If that's the case - TELL THEM. Don't waste their time. \n* Are there any lines you aren't comfortable being crossed in a game? - Some players can't stand romance or relationships in their games. Some don't want sexual stuff at all (so that super cool succubus story arc? Not for them). Some are bothered by grimdark and grey morality. Others can't stand torture. Listen. If you think you'll cross some of those, talk with them and see if you can't find middle ground. Might be impossible. I expect people to be able to handle mature humor and potty humor. I expect them to not burp or chew their food into their mics.\n* Do you have any interest in GMing? - If you are going to run a group for multiple years, you'll need to pass the torch. GM burnout is a real thing, and when it starts hitting the game goes downhill and fast. Explain this to them. Hell, explain that you'd like this group to be more than just a run through of your favorite pathfinder module. Likewise, be open to new games and systems.\n\nThen give the warnings. Know your own GM style as much as you can and tell them about what they can expect. This is the point where I tell them my concerns about them as a player - being honest, but polite - and tell them \"Hey, I don't think it's going to work out.\" or \"I'm going to interview other people. I want to make sure I grab the best people for the game. I'll have a yea or nay for you by Friday.\" Youu got them to add you on roll20 and set up an interview - you owe them an interview at very least. \n\n**Iteration**\n\nYou've got your group of 5 players, you think they are all super-mature, good people you'll play with. You're wrong. Someone is going to flake, or offend another person (welcome to deciding who is in the wrong!), or show up late constantly, or have non-specific life circumstances come up that prevent them from playing (Read: They don't like you, the group, or the game, but are nice enough to tell you, but not willing to hurt your feelings. Response: Ask them what you can improve on, then wish them the best of luck.), or who just stop showing up or being invested. \n\nReplace those players. Those people who applied that you were iffy about? Send messages to them, ask if they would still be interested in an interview. Clear your Looking for Players post of people's responses, and then open it up for new players. Try again. And again. And again. Keep trying until you have a group that you look forward to playing with. \n\n**Best of luck, and god help your poor, stupid soul.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a GM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this one is going to be long. Most of my time on Roll20 has been as a GM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first point of advice? If at all possible, if schedule allows, and if you are willing to put in the sometimes hours of effort:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Build. A. Group. Not a game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a few wankers to play a single game with. A group. Some people that ideally you will be playing with in 3 years. Ideally this will include at least one other person with an interest in GMing at some point. It&amp;#39;s possible you can&amp;#39;t do this - some of this advice should still apply but your focus is on making a friends list of great players you can pinch from but, for the time being, my advice primarily focuses on this type of GM who is willing to bust his ass and deal with a lot of disappointments to form a group of guys and gals to sit and game with regularly who won&amp;#39;t just be strangers on the internet, but eventually good friends. People in my group earlier this year went to a convention together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do this, you as the GM need to be willing to be flexible, be honest and upfront with your players. &amp;quot;Hey guys, I fucked up! So the way I&amp;#39;m going to handle this is from now on is - &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;So I made a ruling last session that killed x character. Turns out, that was a real shit ruling. I&amp;#39;m sorry. But the story has advanced and I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to bring the character back without rewinding everything, so I&amp;#39;m sorry, what do you guys thing is a fair way for me to apologize to Tom without unbalancing the game? I&amp;#39;m thinking may we can toss him a unique utilitarian magic item, something with some cool flavor?&amp;quot;. You also have to be willing to pull people aside, have a talk with them and, yes, kick them from the group if they don&amp;#39;t fit. Make sure they KNOW what they are doing wrong before you kick them - give them a chance to fix it. Don&amp;#39;t just assume they know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Recruitment Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you recruit for a game, remember you are recruiting for your group, not just the current game. Make it clear what style of GM you are - this may take some time to figure out if you are new. If you are new, be honest. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a new GM. I&amp;#39;m going to screw up - please be patient. Also please understand that I may simply disagree with you for better or worse.&amp;quot; For a new GM? Explaining that rules lawyers probably won&amp;#39;t enjoy themselves is not just fair, but responsible. If you are a crunchy GM who thinks the game is enhanced by a measure of risk - and that means characters may die, that&amp;#39;s something the player should know. Tell people that you are looking to form a long-term group and that you are more interested in them than their character - bold that if you have to - and in my case I would even request people not give me a character sheet. You don&amp;#39;t know the world, or the house rules, much less the party - how can you make a character? In fact, if I saw someone say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like to play a ranger&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t play fighters&amp;quot; or - and this is key &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t play clerics/deckers/supportive characters&amp;quot; - be a bit skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, your prospective players have seen a detailed post about your world including the type of focus of the game - an expedition to the &amp;quot;new world&amp;quot; in which they are forming a colony from the ground up and have to explore the dangers of the jungles, delve into zigguarauts and steal aztec gold while finding plants the colony can use and making alliances and deals with the natives - something that tells them what type of gameplay they can expect.

If the game that your joining doesn't have a GM who can do that, it probably won't last. Oh, games where you have to chat with the GM at very least, or preferably the group, before making a character are a good sign. It means the GM has a specific idea of a world he wants, and is interested in encouraging party cohesion - and he's willing to lose some people to impatience in pursuit of that. Lastly, don't quit a group because another player is a problem - talk to the GM. No point in being worried about it until nothing gets done over time.
