Says \"excuse me my throat is dry\" and passes.\n* While telling the story, other players may make objections or suggest corrections to the story \"But I thought Attila the Hun died long before you were born?\" but they must offer the person a coin (a bit like a Fate compel) Either the storyteller must accept the coin and consent to the change, or the storyteller must pay the challenger a coin of their own (also like denying a Fate compel). However, if the person tries to deny it, I believe you can offer *another* coin and continue to raise the stakes until one of you caves and gets all of the coins in the pile.\n* Once the story is finished the storyteller then asks the next person to tell a story about a topic of their choosing. \"Dear sir, didn't you once swim across the indian ocean in nothing but your skivvies?\" \n* Play continues around until everyone has told a story. \n* At the end each player selects the player they believed to have the most extraordinary story (but not their own, that would be impolite), and they give that player their whole purse of coins. (Obviously, you only give *your* coins to the person you are voting for. You can not give the coins of the person that voted for *you* to the person you are voting for. Those would not be your coins to give.)  Once this is done, the player with the most coins is the winner.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n* If someone insults your good name, you may challenge them to a duel. To resolve the duel, play rock paper scissors and the loser is out of the game and gives their full purse to the winner.\n\nThe meta-game: \n\n* Having coins is good because it gives you narrative authority and the ability to defend your story.\n* Having coins is bad because each coin in your purse at the end of the game is a point that you have to give to help another player win. \n* Having coins is good because it allows you to potentially pick the winner.\n* Having coins is bad because that winner is not you.\n\nThis is the \"core\" game, but there are several really cool variations offered up in the book I linked. For instance there is a Cthulu themed one where everyone is telling parts of their story and trying not to finish it because to finish it would mean their death. There is a cool arabian-nights themed one where all of the stories are interwoven together. There is a variation for kids. There are a number of other interesting variations as well, and the writing is very thematic and a real pleasure to read.\n\nIf this interests you, I would recommend it, but if it doesn't, then don't spend the $30. It's probably a bit more expensive than it should be, but people who are going to like it will probably find it worth their money.
