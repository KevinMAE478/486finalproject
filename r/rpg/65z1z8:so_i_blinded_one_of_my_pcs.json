One of my PC&amp;#39;s, a viking-type Skald who goes by Grim, decided that he needed to go threaten the region&amp;#39;s new lord (for reasons that would take a whole &amp;#39;nother post to explain).

The other option was that Courage calls out the demon in the spear and destroys it, thus freeing Shen&amp;#39;s soul up for Revival, but Courage would require additional power to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, he would require one of the PC&amp;#39;s to join in his power, which require the PC also give up their eyesight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grim immediately volunteered, feeling somewhat guilty about the situation, and wouldn&amp;#39;t listen to any argument otherwise.
