Last D&amp;amp;D campaign I was in was completely scene-based and PC-driven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/4gb0d8/the_sandbox_vs_the_railroad_a_really_great_video/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/4gb0d8/the_sandbox_vs_the_railroad_a_really_great_video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?248683-What-s-Wrong-with-the-Railroad\"&gt;http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?248683-What-s-Wrong-with-the-Railroad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://adventureaweek.com/confessions-of-an-evil-gm-sandbox-vs-railroading/\"&gt;http://adventureaweek.com/confessions-of-an-evil-gm-sandbox-vs-railroading/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.critical-hits.com/blog/2010/01/20/railroading-in-a-good-way/\"&gt;http://www.critical-hits.com/blog/2010/01/20/railroading-in-a-good-way/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?493910-Railroading-the-good-and-the-bad-of-it\"&gt;https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?493910-Railroading-the-good-and-the-bad-of-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgbz7fl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492374539.0, "created_utc": 1492345739.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcsca3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cra2reddit", "parent_id": "t1_dgclmjb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'll say it again - start your group on Prime Time Adventures.\nThe \"favorite shows &amp; movies\" idea will resonate with non-gamers who will be able to instantly relate.\nAnd they'll pop right over that \"helplessness towards making goals\" bubble and never look back.\n\nBesides the fact that the game will MAKE you think about Scene Framing and Pacing (a couple of the least learned skills a DM could benefit from).\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll say it again - start your group on Prime Time Adventures.\nThe &amp;quot;favorite shows &amp;amp; movies&amp;quot; idea will resonate with non-gamers who will be able to instantly relate.\nAnd they&amp;#39;ll pop right over that &amp;quot;helplessness towards making goals&amp;quot; bubble and never look back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides the fact that the game will MAKE you think about Scene Framing and Pacing (a couple of the least learned skills a DM could benefit from).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgcsca3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415787.0, "created_utc": 1492386987.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcorji", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "scrollbreak", "parent_id": "t1_dgcnty0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can I suggest not leaving breadcrumbs?

It was difficult to prod them into action; they just didn&amp;#39;t know what to do because of inexperience. On the other hand, I didn&amp;#39;t know the proper way to improvise a good path for them, again due to inexperience; I left the story very open so they could do what they want, but without them exercising their agency I didn&amp;#39;t have anything to work off of and the session was very flat and uninteresting.

What if they would&amp;#39;ve/could&amp;#39;ve made other choices and NOT been captured?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok... do you really think that if the (almighty) DM wants the party to be captured, it can&amp;#39;t be arranged?  ha ha hahhh   muah hahha hahha hah haaaaaa...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, seriously, sometimes the story warrants some in media res start where you begin the campaign (or adventure)(or chapter) with, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re on a ship when the storms crank up and you have to jump ship...  what one thing or person do you grab?!&amp;quot;  That&amp;#39;s the same thing - the DM having narrative control and making choices that push the story along to the next important scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I would offer that I do this (often) in a group with shared narrative control.  So, in other words, the players do this back to me, just as much.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will ask, &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the next scene?&amp;quot; and the players will respond with a setup; location, NPCs, time, purpose of the scene, etc. and I&amp;#39;ll just nod and say awesome, then take over &amp;quot;setting the scene&amp;quot; into motion.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if I have a big combat going on, I&amp;#39;ll ask the thief what he&amp;#39;s doing and he&amp;#39;ll narrate how he&amp;#39;s found some ally of the enemy trying to sneak into the fray and he&amp;#39;s stalking him.  Mind you, this ally is of his own creation - I had no plans for an ally.  But if it gives the thief player some fun, if it adds to (doesn&amp;#39;t break) the narrative, and it involves a sufficient challenge, then hey, who am I to complain?  So I run with it and he gets to do his stealth/stabby rolls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is that we trust each other with our PCs (and roles at the table) such that when someone says &amp;quot;your PC does X&amp;quot; we know it&amp;#39;s always going to be fun and we never feel threatened.  And, being adults, if someone&amp;#39;s not comfortable with the proposed actions, they just speak up and we back off and change it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I generally agree with you.\nI just wanted to point out there are exceptions to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgcw33r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492420789.0, "created_utc": 1492391989.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9axs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "flat_pointer", "parent_id": "t1_dgc5vlk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, railroading would be if the GM tells them something happened during the 4 months, _and_ what the players do in response.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, railroading would be if the GM tells them something happened during the 4 months, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; what the players do in response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgc9axs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390536.0, "created_utc": 1492361736.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ofyp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgehwca", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Captain_Lambkin", "parent_id": "t1_dgecor3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My players quite often would like to play out every minute all the time, but sometimes the game requires that I spin them forward quickly a few months or even years without their sudden whimsical ideas about what they might be firing out of the rail gun or how they are going to redecorate the common areas or any of the other random ideas they have.
