Unless there is time-sensitive things going on, a player would want to yield automatic max because to the actual player (not character), it was just a few seconds of real time for what was 10 weeks....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Questions More - Crafting a rare magic item takes 50 weeks.  I realize that 5e is suppose to lower the frequency of magic items, making them more precious, but in the time you take 50 in-game weeks to forge a magic item, aren&amp;#39;t the odds of finding something of equal or better before that high?  And that is 50 weeks of down time....you&amp;#39;re not going to spend straight 50 weeks....so it&amp;#39;ll take much longer overall to complete....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg4ptpn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491965380.0, "created_utc": 1491936580.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvfj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4i7lj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KesselZero", "parent_id": "t1_dg4galo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well said!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well said!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg4i7lj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957057.0, "created_utc": 1491928257.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvfj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qvfj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4n64u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "birelarweh", "parent_id": "t1_dg4kxjg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did your sword drop off?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did your sword drop off?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg4n64u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962476.0, "created_utc": 1491933676.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kxjg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pbradley179", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jecc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And my axe", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my axe&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg4kxjg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960034.0, "created_utc": 1491931234.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4jecc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Totema1", "parent_id": "t1_dg4galo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; ...the 'orgies' article in a 1977 Dragon magazine.\n\nYou have my attention.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;...the &amp;#39;orgies&amp;#39; article in a 1977 Dragon magazine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have my attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg4jecc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958353.0, "created_utc": 1491929553.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4galo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DungeonofSigns", "parent_id": "t1_dg4en9m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think that's the point of it being 'downtime activities' roleplaying out carousing or a week of prayer is unlikely to be fulfilling - especially for the players not involved in the downtime activity.  \n\nThe 5E version above is very similar to what's used in some more contemporary gamified systems (Torchbearer has one I think?) and follows a long tradition dating back to the 'orgies' article in a 1977 Dragon magazine.\n\nCarousing Tables have long been a popular thing in OSR games, traditionally a way to spend loot and squeeze a bit more XP out of it at the risk of a complication.
