A focus on which all other subsystems rely.\n\nIn OSR D&amp;D, you play an adventurer, typically trying to become more powerful. To become more powerful, you need xp. The primary xp resource is gold that you loot from adventuring. All other sub systems deal with how to conduct said adventuring in the context of the games setting.\n\nSo we have a clear gameplay loop: find adventure site, loot the shit, level up, find better adventure site.

At their heart, OSR games are resource optimisation puzzles. You know that you want the max amount of gold at the min amount of cost (in terms of dead characters). You know that to minimise cost, you need to minimise danger. Danger comes from monsters, which can either be negotiated with (see reaction subsystem), fought with (combat system) or otherwise dealt with (utility magic spells for example), or from environment (the game of dungeon / wilderness / city crawling and puzzle negotiation). One of the dangers inherent in the environment is of course the amount of random encounter checks as you spend more time (turns) in a specific environment.

In the past 30 years board games have evolved heavily, spawning new genres, new mechanics, new ways to play, while RPGs remain firmly rooted in the past.\n\nLets use **D&amp;D 4E** for an example.  We'll take combat, it's developed system.  And how does that work as a strategic game?  In all honesty, it's crap.  You pick an attack, roll a D20 (one layer of randomness), if you hit you roll damage (another layer of randomness).  There are very few ways to mitigate either of these random events, and this ruins long term planning.  Lets use an example.\n\n\"I'd like to attack the Orc!  Because I'm an axe user I can get bonus damage if he's prone!\"\n\n\"Great, I've got an attack that prones on hit!  We've got a plan!\"\n\n*misses*\n\nNow compare it to a game like **Malifaux** or **Imperial Assault**.  In Malifaux it's a tactical combat game, but you have huge opportunities to use chance and skill.  With a hand of cards, you can cheat in better results or necessary symbols (it uses deck-based resolution) and a primary mechanic of the game gives you extra flips if you're skilled at what you're doing.  So while you can fail, most certainly, you can make plans and pit them against your opponent's plans.\n\nIn **Imperial Assault**, the resolution is dice based, but instead of low-high, there's a variety of symbols that trigger critical effects, healing, etc.  You can use skills and abilities to bring in bonus dice for your resolution, and with knowledge of the game you can easily know that you'll get \"something good\" if you go to blast a Stormtrooper, while trying to shoot down an AT-ST is risky and you might easily do no damage. This lets you take informed risks while still making hero maneuvers.  In this context:\n\n&gt;**There are some games that emphasize gameplay over narrative or realism. How do you tend to feel about those games? Do you prefer that rules to stay out of the way of your stories? Is there a limit to how much verisimilitude you're willing to sacrifice for a game that is fun but not necessarily realistic?**\n\nIt really depends on what style of game.  If it's combat heavy, I would prefer an abstraction that allows you to make tactical maneuvers and planning, with a minimum of chance.  For that I'll sacrifice quite a lot, since outside of maybe Phoenix Command no one bothers to make a very accurate model of combat anyway.  \n\nGenerally I'm of the opinion that a good rules set enhances the story.  A bad rules set doesn't.  The biggest waffle I have is the Apocalypse World systems, which are definitely game systems, but which sometimes just feel weird and arbitrary (although this is implementation dependent).\n\n&gt;**What are the gamiest RPGs you're aware of? D&amp;D 4e seems to be the go-to answer for this, but are there any others? Are there any games whose rules you really enjoy outside of the context of the story? Any with really fun rules that you think enhance the story? Any gamist rpgs that you feel give just as much (or more) emphasis outside of combat as they do to the combat mini-game?**\n\nI'd say honestly the most satisfying gamey-RPG hybrids are all board games.  Imperial Assault, Descent, Mansions of Madness, board games just do it right.\n\n**Final Note:** Quantity of rules and quality of rules are very different.  Many excellent games with deep strategy have a lighter rules framework.  RPGs have entirely failed to capture this, as I feel most rules-light RPGs also have very shallow mechanics, often deliberately.
