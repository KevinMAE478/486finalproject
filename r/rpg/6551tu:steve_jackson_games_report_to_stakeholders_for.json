However, I believe that using the GURPS mechanics one can create a game around a given setting, and that GURPS is capable of far more than just simulation.  It's just a lot more work than most people (myself included) would like to do in order to get a game for their preferred setting.  It defaults to a simulation of reality because that's a reasonable baseline to start with - in pretty much any setting in fiction, we tend to expect anything not explicitly different from reality to conform to what we've come to expect.  Reality is merely a place to start; something to which genre conventions may be added with little difficulty within the rules; either by removing rules that don't fit or by adding rules that do.\n\nWhile Panache (to use your example) isn't a first class stat by default, the question is what would you want it to do if it was?  What skills would you want keyed off of it?  What secondary attributes would you want to key off of it?  If neither of these things, then why would having it as a stat be better than renaming the Charisma Advantage?  If you want it to be a combination of Dexterity and Will, then why not simply rename Dexterity and key Will off of it instead of Intelligence?\n\nRegarding your point regarding one hero vs 10 mooks, the Cinematic Combat Rules section on page 417 of the basic set include rules for:\n\n* Cannon Fodder: if you do a single point of damage to the NPC through their armour, they die.  That's it.  \n* Flesh Wounds: spend a single character point to reduce all damage taken from an attack to a single point.  \n* Melee Etiquette: only one mook per combat round gets to attack the PC; all the rest stand around uselessly - kinda like Power Rangers.  Combined with the above, there's your one lone fighter vs ten mooks.  Probably not a whole army, but it depends how many character points your PCs are built with.  \n* Cinematic Explosions: explosions cause knockback and a single point of damage per yard of knockback caused - and nothing else.  I personally wouldn't use this because I like my grenades lethal, but it would certainly suit something akin to the A-Team.  \n* TV Action Violence: You take FP damage from any kind of attack that would normally deal lethal damage - basically, gun fights involve being forced onto the defensive and eventually tiring of fighting instead of actually getting shot.  See above regarding the A-Team.  \n* Cinematic Knockback: Real guns don't send you flying; this rule disregards that entirely.  \n* Infinite Ammunition: You never run out of ammunition, because tracking that kind of thing is incredibly boring in a cinematic game.  \n\nGURPS has no inherent flavour, that I'll certainly grant you.  That is because the GM is expected to provide that flavour themselves, both in terms of how they present the setting and in terms of the rules they choose to include.\n\nLet us take GURPS Monster Hunters as an example - this is basically a how to guide on running Buffy the Vampire Slayer with the serial numbers filed off using only the rules provided in the three main books (the two that make up the Basic Set, and Powers).  Each template for a starting PC is 400 points - for comparison, a realistic special forces operative would have around 100 points, and your typical run of the mill human being would have 25 or so.  Each PC begins play with a 15 point \"lens\"; a package of advantages and disadvantages related to why they're fighting the supernatural menace paid for out of those 400 points.\n\nWhile the skill list is rather long, when a given set of skills is core to a character's concept it is replaced with a wildcard skill: The Sage (basically Giles), for example, begins the game with Lore! at 17 - when it comes to knowing stuff about the occult in just about any way, shape or form, The Sage will almost always succeed at this.  The Warrior, meanwhile, gets Blade! at 16: not only are they skilled in the use of literally any edged weapon, but they also know pretty much everything there is to know about those weapons.  Other wildcard skills are also included where appropriate.\n\nFlesh Wounds, as listed above, is included by default.  It can also be paid for with bonus points provided by appropriate wild card skills - The Warrior, for example, can use this four times per session when fighting with a bladed weapon without needing to spend any character points on it.  Given that they start with 20 hit points anyway (average being 10) and they deal an average of 18 points of damage on an unarmoured foe, they are highly unlikely to be seriously hurt in a fight unless it's against the big bad - pit them against human mooks with swords, and they'd probably go 10-v-1 and win - with some injuries, of course, but still.\n\nNow is this game better at being Buffy the Vampire Slayer than than the licensed Buffy the Vampire Slayer RPG?  Depends what you're after, to be honest, but for most people probably not.  The licensed game is actually quite good, and while the system wasn't designed with the setting in mind, it's still a decent fit.  However, if you wanted the cinematic feel of something like Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a little added detail in areas that the licensed RPG ignores, it still works.  The thing is, the point of Monster Hunters isn't to replace games like Buffy the Vampire Slayer; it's simply an example of what can be accomplished with just the three main books.  The choice of rules provides a certain amount of flavour; the rest is up to the GM in play.  This is also deliberate - Buffy and Supernatural are very different in flavour, but both of them could be run using these rules.\n\nSo, TL;DR (fake edit: Christ, you know you typed for far too long when the TL;DR is two paragraphs by itself)?  GURPS isn't just about simulating reality; that's just the baseline that it presents for genre conventions to be built on top of.  It is admittedly not as good for a given setting as a game specifically built around that setting might be, but it can come close, and it can handle a variety of genres, from old school D&amp;D style fantasy or hard sci-fi to superheroes or wuxia.  It can be as pulpy as Savage Worlds or as realistic as H\u00e2rnmaster or anywhere in between.  However, it relies greatly on the GM knowing enough about the genre they intend to run to both choose the appropriate rules to use and to impart the required flavour in play.\n\nRunning GURPS well is far more up front work than any other game, simply because your job is to not only come up with the usual prep that you would want for starting a campaign, but also build a system out of the RPG equivalent of a Lego box.  For pretty much any setting with a decent RPG already made, it is almost certainly not worth the amount of work compared with picking up a copy of the existing game (provided you have the budget).  That said, regardless of the kind of role playing experience you want, if you're willing to put the work in GURPS can almost certainly provide it at the table.

It has a key elegance and verisimilitude that is lacking in most other games, and for a long time their books were so good people would recommend them for genre material even if you weren't playing GURPS.  (For example, GURPS Space and GURPS Time Travel are both beyond excellent for those genres regardless of system).  GURPS has a reputation for crunchiness that isn't accurate (you can have stupid levels of crunch...but that's all optional - I don't do much more than 3D6 rolls and 1 sec combat turns).\n\nMy complaint is not that they are sidelining GURPS work in favor of Munchkin, but that they are mis-attributing the blame.  Discworld didn't sell well?  You took years more than expected to put it out,  during which you've given GURPS no promotion.  While there have been a number of very focused PDFs, in terms of physical books they shipped:\n\n* 2016: GURPS Discworld and GURPS Mars Attacks (have some fans, but we've known forever that licensed materials are niche audiences)\n* 2015: No physical GURPS books\n* 2014: No physical GURPS books\n* 2013: No physical GURPS books\n* 2012: GURPS Horror?   (can't tell if that was 2012 or 2011\n* 2011: No physical GURPS books\n* 2010: GURPS Low Tech\n\n.. and so forth\n\nThroughout the reports, they repeatedly mention how GURPS lacks POD (until this year, for a handful of products), GURPS lacks releases, that the books they do releases are \"long-awaited\", and that sales are lackluster.  The tone in recent years, however, has stopped being about how to find a good path for GURPS and just a \"GURPS sucks, yo\".  \n\nMunchkin being a bigger money-maker is just a fact, and I'm glad SJGames didn't just drop GURPS.\n\nGURPS losing popularity as it has, however, is something that is completely their fault.  I have on my shelves over 130 different GURPS books.  10 of them are 4th edition books.  The 120ish 3rd edition books are all unique, and represent a minority of the 3rd edition books available (and these are overall great books that sold well at the time and got fantastic reviews).  The 10 4th edition books I have represent an almost complete 4th edition physical collection (I'm missing 3 or 4, I believe).  4th edition was released in 2004 - 13 years ago!   That same year Shadowrun 4th came out (to be followed by 20th anniversary edition and 5th edition, plus all their assorted books) as well as Requiem (to be followed by the Stryx Chronicles, then Requiem 2nd edition).  D&amp;D 4th came out a year or two LATER, and we've had 5th edition for over a year now (two?).  I'm not saying GURPS needs a 5th edition (though I really think they need some pre-done settings as intro-to-GURPS so that they don't just offer tooloxes), but look at all the books those other companies put out!  Heck, during their AMA the Onyx Path people were arguing that White Wolf used to have 50 people while they have 5, and yet Onyx Path is not having problems putting out a healthy number of books for their games compared to SJGames.  \n\nBeing profitable in the RPG business is tough - but other companies manage it.  It is not impossible.  If you decide that there is just a better source of money in churning out new games for the Munchkin fans, so be it, but please stop pretended like GURPS shifting from one of the top RPGs to an \"oh, does that still exist\" is something that happened TO YOU instead of BECAUSE OF YOU.  (I mean, sure, things happen beyond your control, but if you aren't doing anything with the things that ARE in your control, you're involved in the neglect and diminishing)\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492107905.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found this crushing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It totally makes sense that if they make make more money for every $ spent on Munchkin, then that&amp;#39;s what they should spend money.

The tone in recent years, however, has stopped being about how to find a good path for GURPS and just a &amp;quot;GURPS sucks, yo&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Munchkin being a bigger money-maker is just a fact, and I&amp;#39;m glad SJGames didn&amp;#39;t just drop GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GURPS losing popularity as it has, however, is something that is completely their fault.  I have on my shelves over 130 different GURPS books.  10 of them are 4th edition books.  The 120ish 3rd edition books are all unique, and represent a minority of the 3rd edition books available (and these are overall great books that sold well at the time and got fantastic reviews).  The 10 4th edition books I have represent an almost complete 4th edition physical collection (I&amp;#39;m missing 3 or 4, I believe).  4th edition was released in 2004 - 13 years ago!   That same year Shadowrun 4th came out (to be followed by 20th anniversary edition and 5th edition, plus all their assorted books) as well as Requiem (to be followed by the Stryx Chronicles, then Requiem 2nd edition).  D&amp;amp;D 4th came out a year or two LATER, and we&amp;#39;ve had 5th edition for over a year now (two?).  I&amp;#39;m not saying GURPS needs a 5th edition (though I really think they need some pre-done settings as intro-to-GURPS so that they don&amp;#39;t just offer tooloxes), but look at all the books those other companies put out!  Heck, during their AMA the Onyx Path people were arguing that White Wolf used to have 50 people while they have 5, and yet Onyx Path is not having problems putting out a healthy number of books for their games compared to SJGames.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being profitable in the RPG business is tough - but other companies manage it.  It is not impossible.  If you decide that there is just a better source of money in churning out new games for the Munchkin fans, so be it, but please stop pretended like GURPS shifting from one of the top RPGs to an &amp;quot;oh, does that still exist&amp;quot; is something that happened TO YOU instead of BECAUSE OF YOU.  (I mean, sure, things happen beyond your control, but if you aren&amp;#39;t doing anything with the things that ARE in your control, you&amp;#39;re involved in the neglect and diminishing)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg7rphl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128556.0, "created_utc": 1492099756.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6551tu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6551tu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6551tu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7n5y0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GrokEinSpiel", "parent_id": "t1_dg7n1c8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Every time I run a GURPS scenario at a convention there's at least one person who walks by, sees the books and says, \"Wow!

This is old news. A brief look at the stakeholder reports through the years shows it happened almost a decade ago. The TL;DR summary is: Munchkin was 30% of sales in 2003. By 2007 it was 70% of sales and while they stopped listing the percent of sales a few years ago, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that it is still 70% of sales.\n\nHighlights from the Stakeholders reports:\n\n**2003**\n\n\u201cWe are, as I assume the reader knows, a publisher of games. At the moment, all these games are physical products; none of them are videogames or online games, nor are any (yet) PDF files.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur 2003 sales were approximately $2.5 million\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most important products at the moment are the GURPS roleplaying system, with more than 100 items in print, and the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 30% of our sales in 2003.\u201d\n\n**2004**\n\n\u201cWe are, as I assume the reader knows, a publisher of games. In a big change from last year, not all these games are physical products. A number of them are digital downloads . . . PDFs and a few other types of file sold through our e23 site.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur 2004 gross was approximately $2.8 million, up about 4% from last year\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most important products, as last year, are the GURPS roleplaying books, with more than 100 items in print, and the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for nearly 40% of our sales in 2004.\u201d\n\n**2005**\n\n\u201cAn online game, UltraCorps, went through a successful alpha-test last year; it's almost ready for a short beta and we hope it will launch soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur 2005 gross was approximately $2.4 million, down 13% from 2004.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most important products continue to be the GURPS roleplaying books, with more than 100 titles in print, and the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 40% of our sales in 2005, and appeared in more translations; by the end of the year, it should be available in nine languages.\u201d\n\n**2006**\n\n\u201cAn online game, UltraCorps, has been \"almost ready\" for more than a year, but I expect that, no kidding, it will launch very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur 2006 gross was a bit less than $2.4 million, about the same as 2005.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most important product is now clearly the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 55% of our sales in 2006, and is now available in nine languages. The GURPS roleplaying system, with more than 100 titles in print, is the other main component of our sales.\u201d\n\n**2007**\n\n\u201cOur 2007 gross was close to $2.88 million, about a 14.8% increase over 2006.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most important product, even more than last year, is the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 70% of our sales in 2007! It is now available in 12 languages. The GURPS roleplaying system, with more than 100 titles in print, is still the other main component of our sales, and the mainstay of the e23 PDF library.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur UltraCorps online game project has gone on for another year, and now feels very much like Zeno's arrow paradox: we keep getting closer, but will we ever get to the point of launch? Not giving up, though. It's a great game.\u201d\n\n**2008**\n\n\u201cOur 2008 gross was a bit over $2.9 million, only a small increase over 2007.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continued to keep Munchkin in print almost 100% of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe focused more on board and card games, and less on RPGs. The profit margin on RPGs is lower, especially at low print runs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most important product, even more than last year, is the Munchkin card game. The Munchkin line, including the new Munchkin Quest boardgame, accounted for almost exactly 75% of our sales in 2008! Munchkin is now available in 13 languages. The GURPS roleplaying system is still the other main component of our sales, and the mainstay of the e23 PDF library. At the end of 2008, though, we took a number of GURPS 3rd Edition titles out of our hardcopy catalog; they are now in print only in PDF.\u201d\n\n**2009**\n\n\u201cOur 2009 gross fell a bit short of $3 million, a small increase over 2008.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Munchkin line, including the Munchkin Quest boardgame, accounted for nearly 80% of our revenue in 2009! It is now available in 15 languages, with one more licensed. The GURPS roleplaying system is the other main component of our sales, and the mainstay of the e23 PDF library. Most of our new GURPS releases are now PDF. 2009 saw only one new hardcover release for the system: the long-awaited Vorkosigan sourcebook.\u201d\n\n**2010**\n\n\u201cOur 2010 gross was just over $3.5 million, a significant increase over 2009, and we made a profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you compare this report with last year's, you'll see a lot of similarities. This is not, I hope, because the author is lazy, but because this year was a lot like last year for us. The big differences were: we sold even more Munchkin, both through book chains and hobby retailers, and we also sold a lot of dice games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Munchkin line, including the Munchkin Quest boardgame, accounted for more than 75% of our sales! Munchkin is now available in 15 languages, with one more licensed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur two new dice games, Zombie Dice and Cthulhu Dice, accounted for 8.4% of our sales, despite being midyear releases!\u201d", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People seem surprised at the decline of GURPs.

With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for nearly 40% of our sales in 2004.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAn online game, UltraCorps, went through a successful alpha-test last year; it&amp;#39;s almost ready for a short beta and we hope it will launch soon.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 2005 gross was approximately $2.4 million, down 13% from 2004.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur most important products continue to be the GURPS roleplaying books, with more than 100 titles in print, and the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 40% of our sales in 2005, and appeared in more translations; by the end of the year, it should be available in nine languages.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAn online game, UltraCorps, has been &amp;quot;almost ready&amp;quot; for more than a year, but I expect that, no kidding, it will launch very soon.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 2006 gross was a bit less than $2.4 million, about the same as 2005.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur most important product is now clearly the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 55% of our sales in 2006, and is now available in nine languages. The GURPS roleplaying system, with more than 100 titles in print, is the other main component of our sales.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2007&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 2007 gross was close to $2.88 million, about a 14.8% increase over 2006.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur most important product, even more than last year, is the Munchkin card game. With its sequels and supplements, Munchkin accounted for over 70% of our sales in 2007! It is now available in 12 languages. The GURPS roleplaying system, with more than 100 titles in print, is still the other main component of our sales, and the mainstay of the e23 PDF library.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur UltraCorps online game project has gone on for another year, and now feels very much like Zeno&amp;#39;s arrow paradox: we keep getting closer, but will we ever get to the point of launch? Not giving up, though. It&amp;#39;s a great game.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 2008 gross was a bit over $2.9 million, only a small increase over 2007.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe continued to keep Munchkin in print almost 100% of the time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe focused more on board and card games, and less on RPGs. The profit margin on RPGs is lower, especially at low print runs.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur most important product, even more than last year, is the Munchkin card game. The Munchkin line, including the new Munchkin Quest boardgame, accounted for almost exactly 75% of our sales in 2008! Munchkin is now available in 13 languages. The GURPS roleplaying system is still the other main component of our sales, and the mainstay of the e23 PDF library. At the end of 2008, though, we took a number of GURPS 3rd Edition titles out of our hardcopy catalog; they are now in print only in PDF.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 2009 gross fell a bit short of $3 million, a small increase over 2008.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Munchkin line, including the Munchkin Quest boardgame, accounted for nearly 80% of our revenue in 2009! It is now available in 15 languages, with one more licensed. The GURPS roleplaying system is the other main component of our sales, and the mainstay of the e23 PDF library. Most of our new GURPS releases are now PDF. 2009 saw only one new hardcover release for the system: the long-awaited Vorkosigan sourcebook.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 2010 gross was just over $3.5 million, a significant increase over 2009, and we made a profit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf you compare this report with last year&amp;#39;s, you&amp;#39;ll see a lot of similarities. This is not, I hope, because the author is lazy, but because this year was a lot like last year for us. The big differences were: we sold even more Munchkin, both through book chains and hobby retailers, and we also sold a lot of dice games.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Munchkin line, including the Munchkin Quest boardgame, accounted for more than 75% of our sales! Munchkin is now available in 15 languages, with one more licensed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur two new dice games, Zombie Dice and Cthulhu Dice, accounted for 8.4% of our sales, despite being midyear releases!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg7yhrl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492135766.0, "created_utc": 1492106966.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6551tu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7psf1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drhayes9", "parent_id": "t3_6551tu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for this!

Why did I only find out about the Axe Cop Munchkin because I stopped at a random gaming stores booth and talked  to a guy who I only found out was a SJG employee after he handed me a business card? No SJG signage or promo materials. Just their SJ products mixed in with the rest of the stores inventory and a guy standing around. Great guy but how many ppl who would have loved to talk to him walked right by? At Comic Con...\n\n GURPS benefits so much from an experienced hand to guide new players. I experienced this recently when I played in a veteran GURPS grognards game. Night and day compared to my efforts as a green GURPS ST with new players. SJGs, get some STs out there at cons, maybe get that 'game finder' tool front and center on the website. Those top posts are a week or more old! How about some links to roll20, RPol, and some gaming subs or forums to find STs, other players, and ask questions? GURPs is intimidating so help new people find folks who can help get past that to the, to paraphrase a friend, \"caveman riding pterodactyls with laser eyes battling undead jetpack wizards in the post apocalyptic wasteland of a cyberpunk Mars,\" toolkit of near infinite awesomeness that GURPs can be!\n\nTL:DR: SJG, i love your stuff but you're damn right your marketing could use some work and would it be too much to ask for you to help connect up some newbies with the grognards who can shepherd them through GURPs?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some other folks have said GURPS is initimidating at first glance both in crunch and size of product line.
