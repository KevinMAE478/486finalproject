He turns toward the window behind him.  What do you do?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIn this case, you don&amp;#39;t give them time to do all that excessive planning.

Which is good! That makes it much more fixable!\n\n(I didn't remember the specific *Urban Shadows* moves when I started writing this, so I'm just going to use generic/*Apocalypse World* names. It should still be pretty clear.)\n\nWhen you get really passive play in a PbtA game, it's because you're not using the GM moves aggressively enough. Remember that you use GM moves when they fail rolls, but *also* when they present you with a golden opportunity or when they look to you to see what happens.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that those are not *opportunities* to use GM moves, they're times when you are *required* to make a GM move. Every single time they look to you to see what happens next, look at the GM moves and make one. That's your job.\n\nIf the PC goes to prison and decides to keep to himself and stay out of trouble, think about all the movies you've seen: how does that usually go? If you try to stay away from trouble, great, but trouble has no such compunctions about staying away from you.\n\n&gt; If there is a check they fail that doesn't result in immediate disaster, they'll try to find a way to re-do that check, by putting more at risk or trying to get the same result in a slightly different way.\n\nThat is 100% in line with PbtA. That's what you *want* the players to do: respond to failure with escalation. But remember, every failure does, in a sense, lead to immediate disaster. Maybe it's not a particularly serious disaster (at least not yet), but you're still making a GM move. If they fail to pick a lock, that doesn't just mean the lock isn't picked, it means you make a GM move - maybe they spring a trap (do damage), maybe an alarm goes off (put them in a spot), maybe they can force the door open just enough that only the two smaller characters can get through (split them up). But *something* (one of the GM moves) happens.\n\nPbtA games don't need rules about how you can't retry failed checks without the circumstances changing because failed checks directly cause the circumstances to change.\n\n&gt;  Here we have a case where the player FAILED at the grab. At this point, I as GM think the most interesting thing to do would be to have the guy escape - possibly followed by PCs, possibly just being someone they can research.\n\nThat isn't how you GM PbtA. You don't just think of the most interesting thing to do, you pick a GM move (which one you pick and what the specifics are is, of course, dependent on the most interesting thing to do).\n\nGlancing at the MC moves for *Urban Shadows*, I can't see how having the guy getting away falls under any of them. This is crucial to understanding PbtA: that means you are not allowed to react to a miss with the guy getting away. GMing PbtA is *not* freeform, anything-goes GMing. You're like a blackjack dealer: the game tells you what moves to make and when (and you have to make the moves - just like the blackjack dealer they aren't optional). You get to pick the move and the specifics and describe the color of it, but otherwise your hands are tied. In practice, this still gives you an enormous amount of freedom, but it is incredibly important. This is what makes the game function. Without it, you end up with problems like the one you're describing.\n\n&gt; If he gets out the window, sprouts wings, and flies away, they will try any number of things to catch him as long as I allow it.\n\nAs well they should. And you should allow it so long as it makes sense. The PCs are pursuing a goal. Blowing a roll to do something doesn't mean that they're not supposed to be able to accomplish their goal, it means that continuing to pursue it comes at a greater cost, or a greater risk, or there's some complication they'll have to overcome.\n\n&gt; As soon as I deny it, they frown at me for 'protecting the NPC'.\n\nAs well they should, unless you're protecting the NPC by making an MC move. But if you look, you'll notice that things like having NPCs escape tends to be hard to do within the MC moves. In most situations, there's no clear way to spin an MC move to allow you to do that. This isn't an accident.\n\nHere's maybe another way to think of it: When the PCs try to do something, one question is \"will they succeed?\". That's one of the things the dice tell you. The other thing, the larger, more general thing, is \"how hard will it be to succeed and what will it cost them?\".\n\nAnd another way: You don't have the authority to say \"he gets away\" in response to a failed roll to capture him. All you can do is put more shit in the way of further attempts to capture him. He gets away if the players either can't think of a way through the new shit that's between them and their goal, or they decide it's not worth it. *That's* when they go do research to figure out where he went or whatever. You don't decide that, they do.\n\n&gt;  They'd establish where the doors and windows are, who is in place to do what, what equipment they have on them and what is in hand.\n\nCool. Nothing wrong with that. Even if they know every single detail about the place, nothing stops you from making a GM move. Knowing the floorplan and guard patrols doesn't prevent a van of guards showing up, or the police inconveniently showing up to investigate an unrelated crime in the building at just the wrong time. GM moves are your license (your *requirement* even) to introduce things like that. A missed roll means that the situation just got more complicated - and not necessarily as a direct result of the character's failure. If a character fails on a roll while picking a lock, maybe that triggers an alarm. But it's just as acceptable for it to mean that the character is in the middle of picking the lock when the janitor (who came in early because his wife kicked him out) comes around the corner and sees them. Unless the characters are literally omniscient, they can't defend against coincidences.\n\n&gt; Someone might try a distraction move that I think is desperate and ridiculous\n\nIf it's \"desperate and ridiculous\" in the sense that it literally doesn't make sense, then they can't do it. You can't \"trade harm\" with someone using a plastic spoon just because you say that's what you want to do. Some things just aren't possible.\n\nIf it's just desperate and ridiculous, then great! If they succeed, it's fun (remember your Principles: you're a fan of the characters). If it's desperate and it fails, hit them with a seriously *hard* MC move.\n\nYou have two other tools here:\n\n1. You should require Keep Your Cool to do anything that involves avoiding danger to accomplish a goal. If a character is running between cover to act as a distraction, first they roll Keep Your Cool to see if there are any problems making it between cover. *Then* they roll Mislead, Distract, or Trick (or maybe Lend a Hand or Get in the Way if that makes more sense in aiding the character they're creating the distraction for). You shouldn't make people roll Keep Your Cool every time, but it's your swiss army knife for creating two possibilities for things to go wrong rather than just one.\n\n2. The third time you are required to make an MC move: when a player hands you a golden opportunity. If two dozen guys have assault rifles trained on someone and that person says they want to run forward creating a distraction, they roll Mislead, Distract, or Trick, but they don't avoid damage just because they rolled high. They succeed at creating a distraction, but by knowingly running into a wall of bullets, they've presented you with a golden opportunity. Use that golden opportunity to choose the \"inflict harm\" MC move. There's no way they're pulling that off without taking a few hits.\n\nOverall, reread the MC chapter and play it to the letter. There are three circumstances in which you can *and must* make an MC move. That's your role in the game: making MC moves. Keep the list of MC moves in front of you at all times until it's second nature.\n\nIf they play passively, respond actively. If they peek in the window and ask you what's there, guess what: \"there\u2019s a lull in the action\". Make an MC move. The thing they see on the other side is two rival gangs arguing (surface a conflict, ancient or modern) or one of their allies bloody and tied to a chair (put someone in danger), or any number of other things.\n\nMake moves. Make moves and color them in. That is your only job. When they ask what's on the other side of the window, you don't just tell them what's on the other side of the window, you make a move (even if it looks to *them* like you're just telling them what's on the other side of the window).\n\nThis relies in part on another crucial element of most PbtA games: you cannot plan ahead. The book tells you how to prep Threats and that's not the minimal amount of prep, it's also the maximal amount of prep. You can't plan out the building and \"encounter\" before the PCs get there because that would mean that when they decide to look in the window, you can't make an MC move because you already know what's there. When the PCs investigate things, it should feel to them like they're uncovering things you've planned, but in actuality their investigation is prompting you to create the details, which is what gives you the room you need to make MC moves in response to their investigation.\n\nDon't plan.

For example, many PbtA games have some kind of \"Fight\" Move that assumes you are having some kind of scuffle. If you just stab somebody in their sleep you don't roll that - you just kill them.\n\nIf the players have set it up so that there's no reasonable way this guy can escape then that's that - he can't escape. But if they haven't planned in advance and start rolling dice then whatever opportunities are available (like that unguarded window) are yours to exploit freely as the GM.\n\nSecond, make it clear what's going to happen when they fail a Move. Players who play to win appreciate having more information (\"oh, if I miss he's going to get away? Let me distract him instead while George goes around to the window...\"), and it's also best-practice whenever you're using that generic \"roll+stat because danger\" Move that most PbtA games have. If you're making them roll tell them why - what will happen if they succeed (usually baked into the Move) and what will happen if they fail so they can make an informed decision.\n\nThird, it's fine if people try to jump in the way of a failed roll. The most important principle in these games, in my opinion, is \"do what the truth demands\" (or whatever variant there is in whatever PbtA game you're playing). If another PC would reasonably have been ready for this guy to run and would have beaten him to the window? Fine. But there's still a GM Move floating around and now that guy gets a knife to the ribs. Or when this goon's escape is cut off he bites down on his cyanide to escape interrogation. Or something. It doesn't really matter what, as long as it makes sense.\n\n\"But this guy has a Move that says 'escape out the window' - he's really great it!\" That's fine. But if you have a Move that says 'knock somebody out' and you're tied to a chair and also asleep that doesn't mean you can just do it - it has to make sense.

Adding an initiative system would be a *gigantic* deviation from the style of the game and really hurts the designed interplay between the PC and GM rules.\n\n&gt; shouldn't fail an encounter\n\nMost PbtA games don't really have the more discretized \"encounters\" in the sense of something like D&amp;D, but even when they come closer to that, the person escaping in your example is probably not a possible outcome if the GM is playing according to the rules. The rules in PbtA games literally have a list of the things a GM is allowed to do in response to a failed roll (either the move itself says what happens on a failed roll, or, more likely, you make a GM Move, which is a list of things like \"put them in a spot\", \"do damage to them\", \"use up their resources\", etc.). The GM moves are designed such that \"you failed a roll to catch the bad guy, so the bad guy gets away, and there's nothing you can do to follow up in any meaningful way\" generally just isn't one of the outcomes you're allowed. The GM rules basically give you a license to make things happen, but they avoid the pitfalls that creates in other games by making it a restricted license that only allows for certain kinds of things that generally move things forward rather than just stymieing the players' efforts.\n\n&gt; I'm going to start trying to \"powergame\" situations because I know if I fail a roll my agency is challenged.\n\nThis is how you're intended to play PbtA games. The possibilities for \"powergaming\" are pretty limited, and you're definitely expected to take advantage of them as much as you possibly can. And the downside to failing rolls is almost always some loss of agency. If you fail to capture a guy, you *fail to capture him* - it never just means \"you failed so nothing happens\". Every roll moves things forward. Every roll means something happens.

Adding an initiative system would be a &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; deviation from the style of the game and really hurts the designed interplay between the PC and GM rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t fail an encounter&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most PbtA games don&amp;#39;t really have the more discretized &amp;quot;encounters&amp;quot; in the sense of something like D&amp;amp;D, but even when they come closer to that, the person escaping in your example is probably not a possible outcome if the GM is playing according to the rules. The rules in PbtA games literally have a list of the things a GM is allowed to do in response to a failed roll (either the move itself says what happens on a failed roll, or, more likely, you make a GM Move, which is a list of things like &amp;quot;put them in a spot&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;do damage to them&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;use up their resources&amp;quot;, etc.). The GM moves are designed such that &amp;quot;you failed a roll to catch the bad guy, so the bad guy gets away, and there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do to follow up in any meaningful way&amp;quot; generally just isn&amp;#39;t one of the outcomes you&amp;#39;re allowed. The GM rules basically give you a license to make things happen, but they avoid the pitfalls that creates in other games by making it a restricted license that only allows for certain kinds of things that generally move things forward rather than just stymieing the players&amp;#39; efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to start trying to &amp;quot;powergame&amp;quot; situations because I know if I fail a roll my agency is challenged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how you&amp;#39;re intended to play PbtA games. The possibilities for &amp;quot;powergaming&amp;quot; are pretty limited, and you&amp;#39;re definitely expected to take advantage of them as much as you possibly can. And the downside to failing rolls is almost always some loss of agency. If you fail to capture a guy, you &lt;em&gt;fail to capture him&lt;/em&gt; - it never just means &amp;quot;you failed so nothing happens&amp;quot;. Every roll moves things forward. Every roll means something happens. If you fail a roll to pick a lock, something happens (maybe an alarm sounds, or maybe the door unlocks from the other side and swings open leaving the party face to face with the guards) - it isn&amp;#39;t just that the lock is unpicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flipside is that there&amp;#39;s one other situation where you lose agency: when you do nothing.

The time dilation problem comes from mixing a more familiar time abstraction with the very different one that PbtA uses.\n\n&gt;  Setting = System. And if #SpiderMan wants to swing from the rooftops while in the middle of the ocean, it ain't gonna happen no matter how hard he tries. In fact, in PtbA, he wouldn't be able to trigger that move at all. #ProblemSolved.\n\nMan, there's a lot here.  First, Setting != System.  Spiderman and Star Lord are clearly playing the same system, but not the same setting, while Spiderman and Rorschach are playing the same setting, but not the same system.  There's also at least one missing layer here, which is Genre.  It is true that some systems make mechanics that fit the genre which fits their setting, but not all of them work like that.\n\n\\#bonusedit:  the more I think about it, the more telling the omission of genre becomes.  PbtA's essential innovation was abandoning a mechanical description of the world in favor of a mechanical description of the genre.\n\nSecond, Spiderman wouldn't have a Web-Slinging move in PbtA, because that's not what moves are.  Moves are narrative mandates.  In Masks, for example, web slinging as normal probably isn't a move at all, while trying to websling somewhere very quickly probably falls under:\n\n&gt; UNLEASH YOUR POWERS\n&gt; When you unleash your powers to overcome an obstacle, reshape your environment, or extend your senses, roll + Freak. On a hit, you do it.

The time dilation problem comes from mixing a more familiar time abstraction with the very different one that PbtA uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Setting = System. And if #SpiderMan wants to swing from the rooftops while in the middle of the ocean, it ain&amp;#39;t gonna happen no matter how hard he tries. In fact, in PtbA, he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to trigger that move at all. #ProblemSolved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man, there&amp;#39;s a lot here.  First, Setting != System.  Spiderman and Star Lord are clearly playing the same system, but not the same setting, while Spiderman and Rorschach are playing the same setting, but not the same system.  There&amp;#39;s also at least one missing layer here, which is Genre.  It is true that some systems make mechanics that fit the genre which fits their setting, but not all of them work like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#bonusedit:  the more I think about it, the more telling the omission of genre becomes.  PbtA&amp;#39;s essential innovation was abandoning a mechanical description of the world in favor of a mechanical description of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, Spiderman wouldn&amp;#39;t have a Web-Slinging move in PbtA, because that&amp;#39;s not what moves are.  Moves are narrative mandates.  In Masks, for example, web slinging as normal probably isn&amp;#39;t a move at all, while trying to websling somewhere very quickly probably falls under:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;UNLEASH YOUR POWERS\nWhen you unleash your powers to overcome an obstacle, reshape your environment, or extend your senses, roll + Freak. On a hit, you do it.
