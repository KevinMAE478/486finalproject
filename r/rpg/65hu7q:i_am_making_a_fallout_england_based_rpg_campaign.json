Seeing the small scale nuclear exchange in the middle east as well as rumors on the US&amp;#39;s Project safe house and the rise of Vault Tec, the Parliament agrees to invest time into their own project for survival of the nuclear holocaust. They hire outside assistance including a soviet scientist Dr. Bruno Flyorov, descendant of (Real Life) Nuclear Physicist Georgy Flyorov. He leads a group of scientists and engineers to create a design for fallout shelters, the Blitz Bunker. They are not as technologically advance as their Vault Tec counterparts across the sea, but they are designed to last for 2 generations before the survivors would emerge to work together on rebuilding the United Wasteland.

Because of a ban in the early 2030&amp;#39;s, all of the European Commonwealth has banned outside corporations to establish factories and companies in their territory to encourage growth within. The mostly Conservative Parliament wants to wait for more money to flow in, they want to drain England for most of it&amp;#39;s wealth to help the nation survive the inevitable nuclear war.\nThe current royal leader, King Rupert, agrees to the terms of the project as well, but doesn&amp;#39;t want to finish off the barely breath English economy.
