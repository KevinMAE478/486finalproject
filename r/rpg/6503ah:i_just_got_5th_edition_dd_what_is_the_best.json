Take some time to flesh out two or three hooks for each location (lost treasure, missing NPC, strange lights at night, survivors of an event that wander into town, etc...). Draw a crude map of the area and a couple of crude maps for the adventure sites. Come up with two or three helpful NPCs in town (barkeep, smithy, shop owner, town drunk, etc...). Insert your PCs in town and let them decide where to go and what to explore. Craft the story together with them. If they irritate a local, make that local a recurring foil.

Story hooks, NPCs, persistent effects... not to mention the Tolkienesque narrative plots, can be a lot to track and manage for a first time DM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead go old school: start with a town and two or three rough ideas for adventure locations nearby (old woods, ruined castle, abandoned mine, mountain pass, etc...). Take some time to flesh out two or three hooks for each location (lost treasure, missing NPC, strange lights at night, survivors of an event that wander into town, etc...). Draw a crude map of the area and a couple of crude maps for the adventure sites. Come up with two or three helpful NPCs in town (barkeep, smithy, shop owner, town drunk, etc...). Insert your PCs in town and let them decide where to go and what to explore. Craft the story together with them. If they irritate a local, make that local a recurring foil. If they decide to head into the woods to investigate the rumors of treasure give the treasure some level appropriate guardians (or more challenging than appropriate and teach your players the value of running away from a fight...). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Play the game a bit and learn with your friends without investing in more than the three core books, a notepad, some graph paper and dice. It will make running the fancy commercially crafted adventures easier in the long run and you may decide you never want to spend the $50 on a commercial campaign anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, Maze of the Blue Medusa is awesome but I think waaay too complex for a new DM. Buy it anyway. The layout and imagination will help you when you create your own games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just realized this was not a &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m new to DnD&amp;quot; post for the OP. My bad. Still, gonna leave this up for that truly rookie DM that stumbles on it. OP, if you&amp;#39;re a veteran DM just switching to 5e, I recommend Curse of Strahd. Even if you ditch the &amp;quot;spookytown&amp;quot; theme and the gimmicky stuff, it&amp;#39;s a phenomenal sandbox. Out of the Abyss was good too, but drives the characters more than the characters drive it (especially with the chase mechanic they installed...). Oh, and Maze of the Blue Medusa is freakin&amp;#39; awesome even just as inspirational reading. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg6wojz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075119.0, "created_utc": 1492046319.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6503ah", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg78i8y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ludifex", "parent_id": "t3_6503ah", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Death Frost Doom.
