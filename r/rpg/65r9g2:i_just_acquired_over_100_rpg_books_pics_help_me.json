It's something of a niche setting afaik. That particular supplement is WOTC D&amp;D 3.0 IIRC.\n\nFrom the \"Path of the Sword\" to the \"Seafarer's Handbook\" look like 3rd party d20 licensed material. I'm guessing that they're rule supplements.\n\nThe \"Kingdoms of Kalamar\" is 3rd party material. I've never seen it before.\n\nThe next book is \"Oriental Adventures\", a supplement focusing on bringing Japanese flavoured characters to the table. D&amp;D 3.0 IIRC.\n\n\"The way of the Ninja\" book is afaics belongs to a different rule system, \"Legend of the Five Rings\". I'm guessing a supplement.\n\n\"Faith and Avatars\" is a D&amp;D 2end book judging by the logo. It's a Forgotten Realms supplement book. Interesting for people who stick with 2nd edition D&amp;D, or interesting for people curious about the lore surrounding the Gods in FR 2nd ed.\n\nThe \"Forgotten Realms: Campaign setting\" is for the 3rd edition D&amp;D rules. A very established campaign setting. To compare to likes of LOTR, 2nd &amp; 3rd end is whack-a-mole with Gandalf power level characters. It's a \"high magic\" setting, so we're talking arch-wizards shearing off the tops of mountains, levitating them and building cites on top.\n\n\"Faiths and Pantheons\" is a supplement book discussing Gods and their structure in the FR setting.\n\nMagic of Faerun is another FR book focusing on magic in the FR setting.\n\nSilver Marches is a book focusing  on a specific geographical region in FR.\n\nIf you have any interest in playing D&amp;D 3.X in the FR setting, I'd suggest hanging on to those 4 books. (The Campaign setting is the biggie though. Depending on where your personal RPG adventures take you, if I were you, I'd sell it after the others.)\n\nThe complete Bard's Handbook is D&amp;D 2ed material, a supplement.\n\nThe next book I can't read anything of, but looks a book from Mongoose Publishing, 3rd party D&amp;D 3.0 material.\n\nThe next two are D&amp;D 3.0 supplements focusing around building a stronghold and bardish centeric upgrades.\n\n\"The Quintessential X\" series are from Mongoose Publishing, a 3rd party publisher of d20 materials.\n\nThe next 5 are various supplements for D&amp;D 3.0. The Hero's Builder's Guide I haven't heard of, but the next 4 books would be relatively well known in the D&amp;D 3.0 community. \"Masters of the wild\" is for druid and ranger characters, \"Sword and Fist\" is for the more dedicated martial characters, Defenders of the Faith is for paladins and clerics.\n\nThe next 5 (Mongoose Publishing) books I don't know anything about.\n\nThe DM's guide and Player's Handbook for D&amp;D 4.0 I think. If I were you, I'd consider hanging on them for your own use. They're not valuable, but you did get them for nearly nothing.\n\nThe next 3 players handbooks from what I understand are, the 3.5 handbook, the 3.0 handbook and the 2ed handbook. A quick look at amazon shows that a used copy of the 2ed handbook is worth more than you paid for the entire pile of books (24$).\n\nIf you have any interest in playing D&amp;D 3.0, 3.5 or 4.0, I'd strongly suggest holding onto the player's handbook &amp; DM guide.\n\nThe Psionic's Handbook is D&amp;D 3.0 material, which is a bit poor IMHO. One sentence summary is \"Hpw to kill you enemy with mindbullets\". The expanded psionics handbook has better rules IMHO.\n\nEpic level handbook is a supplement for characters over level 20 in D&amp;D 3.0. At that point, you consider taking on minor deities as a boss encounter.\n\nUnearthed Arcana is when you let the developers of a game system come up with some alternate rules for your RPG system. Worth hanging onto if you keep the D&amp;D player's handbook, but don't expect your DM to accept it for a while. (Rules get funky).\n\nSavage species. Much more tame than Unearthed Arcana, it's how to provide the basics of playing the likes a mummy, vampire, goblin or orc, in a structured statwise way with other players. D&amp;D 3.0 material.\n\nManual of the Planes is D&amp;D 3.0 material, useful if you want to design or understand how multiple realties are laid out.\n\nDeities and Demigods covers designing Gods, Pantheons with illustrative examples such as the Norse Pantheon IIRC.\n\nMonster manual for 3rd edition. This book along with the player's manual and DM guide are the basis for most D&amp;D games.\n\nDM's guide 3rd edition and 3.5 edition. If you're at all interested in playing D&amp;D hold onto the player's handbook, monster manual and DM guide for the relevant revision. I'd really suggest hanging onto both the 3.0 and 3.5 releases.\n\nOther pics:\n\nThe Book Of Vile Darkness is your sanitised A.O. book for describing bad characters.\n\nTwo Ravenloft books there. Ravenloft can be described as classic Victorian era horror crossed with D&amp;D ideas. Worth hanging onto if you're playing D&amp;D. Or if not, the setting can transferred to another system.\n\nYou also have the Eberron Campaign setting book. In some ways, the \"default\" campaign setting for D&amp;D is comparable to LOTR. The FR setting is bigger in terms of population and impact of magic. Eberron's setting is far less traditional D&amp;D RPG fare.\n\nTake an Industrial Age society, cheap+low magic available everywhere, medieval style guilds based mostly on extend family lines, a sentient magitek species created for war, paint it across the history of a united kingdom that fell into civil war of the succession leading to five nations--a war comparable to WWI in terms of effects and \"what happens next\". It's post war magitek steampunk done comic style. Worth hanging onto if you're playing D&amp;D 3.X.\n\nBook Of Erotic Fantasy. Uhm, obviously an AO book, do what you may. D&amp;D 3.0 material I believe.\n\nShadowrun third edition: Neuromancer with elves, both working-class and sitting on throne types. Throw in Orcs, Trolls as your lower classes, add mother-fucking fire-breathing sitting-on-their-piles-of-gold Dragons. Except the fucking dragons sit on bank accounts, CxO positions and lecture the UN. Cyberpunk crossed with fantasy. 3rd ed? Sell it I think and buy the newer version if you can find a group imho. (Unless they are playing 3rd ed.).\n\n\"The World Of Darkness\". It's a rules light system compared to the likes of D&amp;D. Judging by the spine, it's the \"nWoD\" setting. It's a setting that emphasises personal horror. The (new) World of Darkness setting is based around our world but a bit darker. \"One more murderer gets away, one more cop is corrupt and looks the other way.\" It's very much a book worth hanging onto, as it's sort of needed for the other nWoD games. On it's own, you can run \"Mortals\" games, average Joe doing shit. The nice part about nWoD games is that they are designed to be compatible.\n\nVampire: The Requiem. You're a vampire and you maybe thought dying would make shit easier. Hell no. A book worth hanging on to, but only if you keep the nWoD book.\n\nOf the D&amp;D books, I'd suggest keeping the \"core books\", the player's handbook, the monster manual and the DM's guide if you're interested in D&amp;D, no matter the revision, you can always sell them later. Hold on to the campaign setting books if you keep the core books. The supplements can be sold easily.\n\nI cannot offer a serious opinion about the rest of the books.\n\nEdit: Some grammar fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492456347.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwing my 2 cents in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pic 1:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From top to bottom:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve got a setting manual, Dragonlance, based off a series of fantasy novels (which in turn IIRC are based off an actual D&amp;amp;D game the writers played).
