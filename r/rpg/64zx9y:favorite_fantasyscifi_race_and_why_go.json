They role played as the [Blorg, a kind of sentient fungus that looks like a moldy pile of foodscraps](http://www.stellariswiki.com/Preset_empires#/media/File:Fungoid_massive_12.png).\n\nThe Blorg are **repugnant** (other empires get a big opinion malus because they are, well, repugnant; other species that have to share a planet with your are unhappy, scaling higher the more Blorg on the planet) and **solitary** (-5% Happiness because they are a race of introverts that hate living close to other people) but can live to be hundreds of years old (**Venerable**).\n\nBack when they were only a race of distusting loners that had bearly mastered technologys like TV and Computers, they started receiving signals from a far away star: \"Sol\", or as we know it, \"The Sun\". Somehow, a terrestrial TV signal transporting a few episodes of the TV show \"Friends\" made its way to them. Fascinated by this concept of \"friendship\", Blorg society started to shift. They started to tune into the radio emissions of Sol III and absorbed \"The sounds of friends, movies, culture and music - things the Blorg had done without for eons\". They even started attaching names to themselves, a practice unheard of amongst the Blorg, and they picked up the names they heard on these transmission. Even though they were socially extremely inept and unlikable even to each other, they united their planet behind the common wish to learn friendship. Their leaders were not chosen through democratic means, but instead the Blorg with the most friends would get the highest office by default, with every other office distributed the same way. The President even had as many as 5 friends! But soon they realized that not even Blorg could be friends with most Blorgs and they set out trying to invent Faster than Light travel to find friends amongst the stars in the hopes that there were other that *could* love a blorg and befriend them.\n\nUnfortuantely, they soon discovered that Sol III (Earth) had perished in a thermonuclear war and the creators of the great \"Friends\" had perished decades ago. They also had to discover that space is not a nice place and that all of their neighbors were of the unlikable kind (All of the surrounding AI empires were either slavers, imperialists or fanatic purifiers trying to cleanse the galaxy of all other sentient life). But clever as they were, the Blorg did not despair: If noone wanted to be friends, a bit of ~~violence and warfare~~ forceful persuation might make them reconsider. Because to the Blorg, friendship is everything, friendship is total, friendship is absolute, friendship must be sought by **any** means. What are a few decades of revolting Xeno to a~~n Elve~~ Blorg, after a generation has come to pass and a lot of ~~indoctrination~~ friendly discourse sprinkled with ~~forceful resettlement on the Blorg homeworld~~ mandatory party invitations, surely the Xeno would embrace their new Blorg overlords?\n\nI say semi official because most AI's are randomised through the same interface the player uses to build an empire, but the Blorg are one of the presets that can be set to sometimes spawn as AI's in your procedually generated galaxy.

Fascinated by this concept of &amp;quot;friendship&amp;quot;, Blorg society started to shift. They started to tune into the radio emissions of Sol III and absorbed &amp;quot;The sounds of friends, movies, culture and music - things the Blorg had done without for eons&amp;quot;. They even started attaching names to themselves, a practice unheard of amongst the Blorg, and they picked up the names they heard on these transmission. Even though they were socially extremely inept and unlikable even to each other, they united their planet behind the common wish to learn friendship. Their leaders were not chosen through democratic means, but instead the Blorg with the most friends would get the highest office by default, with every other office distributed the same way. The President even had as many as 5 friends! But soon they realized that not even Blorg could be friends with most Blorgs and they set out trying to invent Faster than Light travel to find friends amongst the stars in the hopes that there were other that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; love a blorg and befriend them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortuantely, they soon discovered that Sol III (Earth) had perished in a thermonuclear war and the creators of the great &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; had perished decades ago. They also had to discover that space is not a nice place and that all of their neighbors were of the unlikable kind (All of the surrounding AI empires were either slavers, imperialists or fanatic purifiers trying to cleanse the galaxy of all other sentient life). But clever as they were, the Blorg did not despair: If noone wanted to be friends, a bit of &lt;del&gt;violence and warfare&lt;/del&gt; forceful persuation might make them reconsider. Because to the Blorg, friendship is everything, friendship is total, friendship is absolute, friendship must be sought by &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; means. What are a few decades of revolting Xeno to a&lt;del&gt;n Elve&lt;/del&gt; Blorg, after a generation has come to pass and a lot of &lt;del&gt;indoctrination&lt;/del&gt; friendly discourse sprinkled with &lt;del&gt;forceful resettlement on the Blorg homeworld&lt;/del&gt; mandatory party invitations, surely the Xeno would embrace their new Blorg overlords?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say semi official because most AI&amp;#39;s are randomised through the same interface the player uses to build an empire, but the Blorg are one of the presets that can be set to sometimes spawn as AI&amp;#39;s in your procedually generated galaxy. There is even a unique AI personality just for them that tries to play just like the original Blorg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg71gbh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492081120.0, "created_utc": 1492052320.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zx9y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zx9y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6auoe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Engineseer01", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ajhn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They are the most SANE of the evil races.

Also evil Elves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this answer is a copout. I definitely always love to see Lizardmen in various RPG incarnations, be it Lizardfolk, Dragonborn, or whatever. Warhammer Fantasy is my favorite version as it makes them &amp;quot;alien&amp;quot; but gives them a sophisticated, high-functioning civilization. In my setting I&amp;#39;ve combined the Dragonborn and Lizardfolk in a sorcerous, Aztec-like empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also really liked it when I decided that Beholders in my homebrew setting can work with each other in a limited way and are not so relentlessly, destructively evil all the time, meaning that they managed to create a city-state empire in my setting. They hoard knowledge and enslave other races in their lands, but they have stable relations with some other nations. It&amp;#39;s a much more interesting dynamic to me than having a single Beholder scheming deep in a lair, hidden from the world. Can you imagine a diplomatic visit from the Beholder Empire? Absolutely terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg7liih", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121704.0, "created_utc": 1492092904.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zx9y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zx9y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85c3h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Engineseer01", "parent_id": "t1_dg6mdb6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lord of the Rings dwarves are best dwarves.
