I actually have only just recently heard of the 13th Age from some friends while working on a combat system for a different project, and became doubly worried on the name.\n\nThe project started a few years ago with my work on the biggest system and setting, Solare, which will be another couple years before work begins in earnest on it-- but long story short, the 9th Era is just the number of the era, and I certainly recognize as I'm in a Numenera game now (my first one that started a month or so ago) that it was the Ninth World. It's a point of contention because I think I really like it, but also you are absolutely right that it sits in an odd spot name wise with two other prominent (and forever larger and more well known) games.\n\nI can say with complete confidence that the game is nothing like Numenera now having played in both, but I'm not familiar with the 13th Age, so I can't speak to that. Numenera exists in a super future with ancient and unknown technology that makes it super fun. The 9th Era lives in a confluence of many worlds and cultures, future and past, and brings magic, technology, fusions of both, and other weird systems all into a clusterfuck of fun. Things can be new, but they won't be unknown or ancient, and the sheer diversity of cultures present I think is one of the biggest differences in worldbuilding.\n\nI love the key point of numenera and oddities, but decided not to pursue something similar as I didnt think it fit as well, since this is not as much a game of exploration of old and unfathomable ruins/tech as so much as it is a cultural exploration game. It can work in any way you want it to, I suppose, like any TTRPG, but I feel that it has very distinct differences.\n\ntl;dr\nworking on fixing the mobile for both our site and our sister site, and considering new names for the game-- using The 9th Era until such a time as a new name is selected and a proper logo made.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slight improvement over our sister website, which doesn&amp;#39;t work on mobile at all! But honestly, mobile friendliness is something I want to work towards, but I do everything myself and haven&amp;#39;t figured out just yet how to fix some of the problems. Will work on it though-- thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the Numenera similarity, that is something I saw as I began work, and so became a bit worried. I actually have only just recently heard of the 13th Age from some friends while working on a combat system for a different project, and became doubly worried on the name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The project started a few years ago with my work on the biggest system and setting, Solare, which will be another couple years before work begins in earnest on it-- but long story short, the 9th Era is just the number of the era, and I certainly recognize as I&amp;#39;m in a Numenera game now (my first one that started a month or so ago) that it was the Ninth World. It&amp;#39;s a point of contention because I think I really like it, but also you are absolutely right that it sits in an odd spot name wise with two other prominent (and forever larger and more well known) games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can say with complete confidence that the game is nothing like Numenera now having played in both, but I&amp;#39;m not familiar with the 13th Age, so I can&amp;#39;t speak to that. Numenera exists in a super future with ancient and unknown technology that makes it super fun. The 9th Era lives in a confluence of many worlds and cultures, future and past, and brings magic, technology, fusions of both, and other weird systems all into a clusterfuck of fun. Things can be new, but they won&amp;#39;t be unknown or ancient, and the sheer diversity of cultures present I think is one of the biggest differences in worldbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love the key point of numenera and oddities, but decided not to pursue something similar as I didnt think it fit as well, since this is not as much a game of exploration of old and unfathomable ruins/tech as so much as it is a cultural exploration game. It can work in any way you want it to, I suppose, like any TTRPG, but I feel that it has very distinct differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr\nworking on fixing the mobile for both our site and our sister site, and considering new names for the game-- using The 9th Era until such a time as a new name is selected and a proper logo made.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgboz6e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346559.0, "created_utc": 1492317759.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbodpc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "enjeyarr", "parent_id": "t3_65mj24", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A few marketing notes: \n\n\n- Your website isn't working great on my mobile (android for reference) but the links work at least\n\n- Just a suggestion but I think your system name could be stronger.
