If you have played 3.0, 3.5, or Pathfinder, you'll feel right at home here. If your experience is primarily through pathfinder, do expect to have a few quibbles with some mechanics and details, but they are easily patched up if you are familiar with the 3.x style game. Levels, classes, HP - very combat focused but a much greater focus on skills than you'll find in standard 3.x and derivatives. The big advantage? Accessibility. Many people know these systems and it's liking slipping on a familiar pair of pants. Maybe has a hole in the knee, but it's familiar.  It also does a great job of capturing the feeling of the farmboy becoming a hero, or the scoundrel becoming a well-known name across the galaxy. It does bring along the issue of wizards quickly outstripping the mundanes, or in this case Jedi bypassing your lowly bounty hunters and smugglers. How much will you enjoy it? How much do you enjoy D&amp;D 3.x or Pathfinder?\n\n**FFG Version**\n\nFantasy Flight Games really did some weird stuff with this version. Most of it, in my opinion, works out very well. One of the things is that they have their own fancy dice. These dice are pretty much required for play - a set can be picked up for a few dollars - and instead of providing a pass / fail, they provide things like \"Success, but with complications\". This really helps to create interesting stories based on how the dice come up if you, as the GM, are willing to run with the dice. If you are trying to tell a specific story that follows the rails pretty closely, you'll likely find the dice system to be an annoyance. If you are willing to embrace the party scoundrel getting picked up because while he opened the lock, he managed to set off a silent alarm accidentally or separated himself from the group (even if you never planned for anything like that in your GM notes) and see how that story plays out? It's great! The quibble a lot of people have is that the system is divided into 3 books. One for scoundrels and bounty hunter types, one for rebel scu- ahem - rebel soldiers attempting to fight the tyranny of the empire, and one for force users of various sorts. While the three books are highly compatible, even in power levels, you may end up having to have 3 books bouncing around depending on party makeup. Of course, this is easily avoided by keeping the game focused on the style of play that your particular book is geared for - which is the base intent of the system.\n\n**The WEG system**\n\n I am not very familiar with it besides a few sessions that probably weren't very representative of the system. The advantage here seems to be speed. The rules are simple, intuitive and fairly quick, especially compared to the other two big names which are FAR more crunchy. I've also been told (not confirmed) that the system actually does a fairly poor job of Jedi fighting it out with Sith or functioning well at \"high levels\".
