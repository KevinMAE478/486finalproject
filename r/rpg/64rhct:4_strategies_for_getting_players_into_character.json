It takes some of the load off the GM, and it makes RP about keeping the whole group&amp;#39;s interest, not just doing what the GM wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Also, especially with newer players or longer campaigns, I think it helps to keep the mechanical rewards to things that only last for the session (or next session if they come late), rather than permanent rewards like experience points in most systems.  It keeps the dramatist of the group from taking a huge lead in character development over time, and it keeps shyer players from potentially feeling &amp;quot;punished&amp;quot; in the long run.  If the game uses a point system, like Fate, you can just use those; otherwise, you can implement a point system that gives players rerolls, small heals, or other useful benefits for spending the RP points they get.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg5xkeg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036116.0, "created_utc": 1492007316.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4jqne", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deltadave", "parent_id": "t3_64rhct", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Remain in character as GM.
