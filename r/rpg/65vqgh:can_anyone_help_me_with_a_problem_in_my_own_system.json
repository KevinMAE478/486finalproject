The stats are:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strength (Each point give you 1hp)&lt;br/&gt;\nAgility  (This is the one that affect the AC system), like, if i have 6 agility i will have 16 dodge&lt;br/&gt;\nDexterity (This is for throwing weapons, bows, spells and stealth)&lt;br/&gt;\nVitality (Each point gives you 10hp, you can have 66 max hp in lvl 1)&lt;br/&gt;\nIntelligence (Each point gives you 10mp, you can have 66 max mp in lvl 1)&lt;br/&gt;\nWisdom (Each point gives you 1mp)&lt;br/&gt;\nCharisma (For some tests)&lt;br/&gt;\nLuck (Re-rolls, critic, rng loot)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Hitting: &lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To hit someone you will roll a d20 (+) your weapon stat (stat/2; round up), for example a warrior with a sword (that use STR as stat) and 5 STR, you roll a 10, so you have a 10+3 (5/2; round up). In low level, on high level you can use more dices, like even a d100.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Damage:  &lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you hit someone you deal the weapon damage (+) your weapon stat.

To hit someone you need tie or surpass the lowest value of one of the AC, but if you tie or surpass the highest value you will deal a extra damage. There are four types of armour, and you always have 10 armour/dodge base(AM), the types are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naked: You get no armour (10 AM), but you can use full agility, and take +3 damage;&lt;br/&gt;\nLight: You have 4 armour (14 AM), and can use full agility, and take +2 damage;&lt;br/&gt;\nMedium: You have 5 armour (15 AM), and lose 1 agility, and take +1 damage;&lt;br/&gt;\nHeavy: You have 5 armour (15 AM) , and dont use agility, don&amp;#39;t take extra damage;&lt;br/&gt;\nShield: Give 1 armour or more, can or not lose agility (Depends on the size).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there is a special condition that if your dodge and armour is the same value, you don&amp;#39;t take extra damage if there is a tie, only if you surpass.

The extra damage is low.&lt;br/&gt;\n3- This is a bonus one, How can i base the movement of the players based on their agility?

I like it.  \n\nSo, looking at the numbers: On average, an attacker will have a +2 to hit, but a target will have an average +3.5 to defense (assuming Agility bonus is usually lower than available armor at +4 for light).  The average die roll on a d20 is 10.5, so you're looking at a +1 difference in favor of the defender; attacks will miss slightly more often than they hit.  If you get up to rolling a d100 to hit, though, you're going to make attack and defense stats meaningless; they'll almost always hit.  It's really a huge swing.  If you want to use more dice to increase their chances, I'd recommend instead going with a roll X, keep Y mechanic; they get to roll additional d20s and keep the highest one.\n\nIt looks like damage will average around 5.5 per hit (assuming swords are most common and use 1d6 for damage, as you said), and PCs will average 38.5 HP to start.  That's 7 hits, or over 14 attacks on average, to drop a target.  That seems a little \"padded sumo\", but if your goal is swarms of weak enemies, or long adventuring days with limited opportunities for resupply, that might work well for an attrition game.  The bonus damage also shrinks those numbers a bit.\n\nMy thoughts:\n1. Follow the suggestion from /u/kingpin000 to use damage dice in addition to, or instead of, bonus damage points, and let the numbers grow with number or skill.  You might use d4s or d6s for Medium armor, and step up the die size once for each category lower.  This also helps chew through HP more quickly.\n\n2. If you make the bonus damage matter more, then heavy armor's removal of the bonus damage may do enough to make it more worthwhile.  However, you're still getting hit on a result of 10, so maybe you need some damage reduction to balance it out.  Maybe just -level to damage, or ignore damage dice that roll 1 or 2, or halve the result of damage dice.\n\n3. That could be awful for anyone with 1 or 2 agility.  How much distance does a square represent, and how fast do you want the PCs to be?  Assume an average 3.5 starting agility.
