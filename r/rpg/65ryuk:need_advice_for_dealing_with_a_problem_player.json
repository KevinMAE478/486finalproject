I have not idea how to get that through to him, you know him better. But in the end he&amp;#39;ll have to accept that if the PCs can do just whatever they want it stops being a challenging game and is just a self-insertion Mary Sue fan fiction that you live read to other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another technique: Let him mope and ignore it. Super helpful thing to learn if you plan to marry at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much for the social aspect, here come the in-game solutions...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MOOK RULES! Basically, what you do is add low-hp enemies from time to time that CAN be slashed in half in one hit. Yay! In fact, if you play a system like 13th Age or Feng Shui, you can even slash MULTIPLE enemies in half with one hit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the other secret of being a good DM: Yes you need to challenge your players, but sometimes you need to indulge them too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;#39;d just give the guy a vorpal sword. Then it&amp;#39;s not your fault he didn&amp;#39;t cut the enemy in half, it&amp;#39;s the stupid die that didn&amp;#39;t roll a crit!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgcurt5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419083.0, "created_utc": 1492390283.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ryuk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd41vh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "apostatecrusader", "parent_id": "t3_65ryuk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I chimed in on your post on r/rpghorrorstories, but I have more to add with the new information here, so here's my thoughts.\n\nYou can't solve an out-of-game player issue with in-game actions.
