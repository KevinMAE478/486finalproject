Is this true in the world you are portraying?  Even here, for example, the way men and women are socialized in, say, Denmark, is very different from how they are socialized in the Southern area of the United States.  \n\nAssuming you're talking about modern, generic US behaviors:\n\nThe differences in socialized behavior ARE subtle once you take overt sexism out of the equation, but they do exist.  In particular:\n\n* Women are taught that their own appearances and behavior (impressions) matter a lot, while the appearances and behaviors of others matter less.  Men are taught the opposite.  This is why, for example, a women will more often worry about her appearance before meeting someone new (or even being somewhere new with an existing friend), or make sure to bring a gift when visiting someone for dinner or a party, but a man is more likely to overtly look down on someone else that is wearing something unusual, while being more likely to do so themselves without regard to what the etiquette is.\n* Men are told to be \"bold\" and \"firm\", while women are taught to be \"accomodating\" and \"unifiying\".  A woman doing the behavior men are taught are often thought of as \"shrill\" or \"bossy\".  A woman is less likely to talk over someone or interrupt, and their language is more likely to be couched as suggestions or thoughts to consider rather than a declaration of fact.\n* Men are taught to solve problems - a man feeling overwhelmed is weak.  Women are taught to endure their own problems but empathize and notice the problems of others.  (The whole Mars/Venus thing)\n* The way men and women are taught to establish hierarchies within their social groups are completely different.  I don't understand it enough to say HOW (I suck at both), but this is why women get the reputation for backstabbing, and men get the reputation for avoiding personal intimacy.\n\nSo for your specific question, if you're trying to RP a modern American female and want to acknowledge these socialized differences without portraying a sexist caricature, I'd just focus on the language you use.  You're still picking a stereotype to portray, it's just a stereotype that is true more often than the stupid sexist stereotypes.  My particular thoughts would be:\n\n* Don't interrupt PCs while they are talking (feel free to get quietly annoyed if they don't include the NPC though!)\n* Do have subtle social flags to when the NPC is disappointed/angry\n* Don't have blatant social flags to the NPC mood for routine things\n* When speaking about anything that the PCs might disagree with, avoid word choices that are absolute.  Instead, have phrases like \"it seems that...\", \"one would think...\", \"have you considered...\" etc.  You still state your thoughts, but it's the least \"pushy\" way to do so.\n\nUltimately, your players shouldn't CONSCIOUSLY notice the RP is different - if they do, they are either looking for it or you're laying it on too thick.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking your question as you intended it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men and women in our world are socialized differently.
