A few languages use a neuter gender for generic referents (like singular \"they\" in English, or some uses of \"one\") or speaking about people you don't know the gender of, and almost every language has a few weird irregularities (like how the word for \"girl\" in German is neuter) but other than that, the languages with more complex grammatical gender still use only two for words involving gendered humans.

It's called \"gender\" in the historical sense meaning \"kind\" (this predates the specifically male-or-female sense of \"gender\" by about a hundred years). And the genders in most languages are called \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" because even though a toaster isn't \"conceptually male\" in French in any significant way, words that actually denote human males in French overwhelmingly use the same forms as the word for toaster. But in other languages \"grammatical gender\" doesn't have anything whatsoever to do with natural gender - like languages that have grammatical genders for animate and inanimate instead of male and female. \"Gender\" is a misleading word for this: you're really talking about classes of nouns.\n\nWhen you hear about languages with more than two genders, you're really hearing about languages with more than two noun classes.

I totally sympathise with the counterarguments that the  language looks more than a little unnatural (very few people use these terms in normal language), but I think I can put forward some non-political arguments for their use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomly switching between &amp;#39;she&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;he&amp;#39; in accordance with a class still genders the class in a way which is weird.  Paladins aren&amp;#39;t all female, druids aren&amp;#39;t all male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &amp;#39;he&amp;#39; as a base pronoun is a little like saying &amp;#39;cat&amp;#39; when you mean &amp;#39;any household pet&amp;#39;.  We know that when you say &amp;#39;cat&amp;#39; you sometimes mean &amp;#39;parrot&amp;#39;, but this is also a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; all the time means that when writing examples with a thief fighting goblins, &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; can refer to (a) the goblins, (b) the thief, or (c) both.  When a pronoun covers everything, it covers nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can get around this by just not using pronouns outside sentences with one subject and no object, that&amp;#39;s pretty weird writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPGs cover weird things, like sexless gods, sentient spells, animate golems (which can&amp;#39;t seriously have a gender, but aren&amp;#39;t exactly &amp;#39;it&amp;#39; either).  We have no proper pronouns for such creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you accept just the little bit of oddness then you can gain a lot of accuracy in your language and return to the natural fluidity of saying &amp;#39;sie, the thief&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;they, the goblins&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying everyone should do this, but I hope people see the reasons why some authors think of it as an easy and concise option.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg97dfo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209388.0, "created_utc": 1492180588.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654njl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9p8hn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anon_adderlan", "parent_id": "t3_654njl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Politics, and the misplaced notion that this will attract more female roleplayers.\n\nWhat I wouldn't give for a truly gender neutral singular pronoun.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics, and the misplaced notion that this will attract more female roleplayers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I wouldn&amp;#39;t give for a truly gender neutral singular pronoun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg9p8hn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230463.0, "created_utc": 1492201663.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654njl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654njl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654njl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ybbe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TAHayduke", "parent_id": "t1_dg7wajj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I feel like you are defending a point no one was attacking.
