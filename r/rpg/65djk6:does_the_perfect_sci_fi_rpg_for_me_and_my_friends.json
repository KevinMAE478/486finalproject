It does not pretend to be hard sci-fi-- it is unabashed about making anything past Tech Level 4 seem magical. And with psionics, there's a great deal which is more or less magical. Nonetheless, it is still sci-fi rather than space-fantasy because of the relatively grounded aesthetics (Tech Level 3 is what we have now, Tech Level 4 is futuristic speculative stuff, Tech Level 5 is magical space wizardry). It was built to handle the space version of a hexcrawl in which a ragtag group of space ragamuffins bop from system to system discovering aliens, exploiting them, mating with them, and getting murdered by them. If political intrigue and large-scale stuff is your ilk, it has that as well (the Faction System is one I have ported over to at least two games so far).\n\n* Stars Without Number fails your second point in that it is not overly complex. It is based on AD&amp;D 2e. For skill checks you roll 2d6 + Attribute mod. + Skill bonus + Misc. against a target number (between 6- 10). For combat you roll 1d20 + Attribute mod. + Skill bonus + Target AC, hoping to roll 20+. SWN is, however, highly moddable by design (Kevin Crawford, the designed, said that he wants people to make the system fit their game and not vice versa). So if it lacks the crunch you desire, maybe you can mod it in.\n\n* Stars Without Number also fails in this regard-- all guns shoot the same, all Psionic powers require more or less the same rule interaction of psypoints, system strain etc. It does, however, satisfy your apparent desire for lethality. Unless you are specced for combat, SWN will put you through a meatgrinder if you aren't smart. So play smart.\n\nIn short, go take a look at Stars Without Number.
