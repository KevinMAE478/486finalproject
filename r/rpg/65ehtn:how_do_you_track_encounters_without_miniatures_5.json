Normally everyone gets a move, so as a player is wrapping up his or her turn, that is a perfect time -- explain the current situation (e.g. \"you're 20' out from the nearest of the three ogres still standing\"), then ask if they want to move closer or farther from any particular enemies or allies.  Almost everyone has taken many turns in board games, so the existence of the miniature is a natural prompt to move.  With theater of the mind play, compensating with words can provide that prompt and give the DM a chance every turn to confirm that the player is on the same page regarding tactical options.\n\nAfter distance and position, it is important to know about dispersal (i.e. who is bunched together and who is standing apart.)  After all, parties should be able to spread out if room is available when they anticipate an area effect danger . . . and likewise with intelligent monsters.  Yet users of such abilities need to keep aware of all this too, since it influences the choice whether or not to use an area effect ability.  Some inferences will be obvious, like the fighter standing next to the guy he just used his shield to protect last turn, while others will require communication, like whether two PCs charging at targets 10' apart want to fight back-to-back between them or some other arrangement.  Communication skills are everyone's responsibility, but DMs should be clear whenever possible and charitable when uncertainty is genuine.\n\nThen there is the scene.  Miniatures have the most to offer when you want to do elaborate setups with many variations in cover and/or a diverse array of traps and hazards.  Theater of the mind players will struggle with scenarios like a pattern of trapped floor tiles or high powered battle in an audience chamber with balconies.  At the onset of combat, always alert the party about available cover, the general size of the space, etc.  In the end, you'll find things like line of sight become less about fussing over geometry and more dramatic devices.  In some cases, you might even substitute totally random dice rolls for the \"did a character step on the kablam tile?\" if you don't have a mechanic to let them notice where it is (and if you do have that and it works, then tell them that they see it and don't have them step on it by accident, of course.)\n\nAnyway, long story short, the big tool here is communication.  Talk about movement so nobody loses track of distance(s) to key group(s) as well as how clumped or dispersed groups are.  Since melee brings foes together, this is often much simpler than it sounds.  Yet also make compromises, since each approach (LARPing vs. miniatures vs. theater of the mind) has its own strong suits and weak suits.  Theater of the mind is great for efficiency and non-combat activities, but it is less great at epic scale battles and sophisticated tactical challenges.  Consider all that when planning and running sessions this way.\n\nP.S.  Here are some rules of thumb (mostly from the original DMG) that I continue to favor.  5' corridors mandate single file.  10' corridors allow no more than two abreast.

You've got 3 each on the left and right, along the walls a few yards from you in either direction.  They are carrying crude fire-hardened short spears with some sort of black residue over the points.  \n\nGimli, Frodo, you two are still in the hall outside the entrance, - you can rush forward but Ned blocks you from getting far without risking crowding him.  You can hear the goblins chattering, but aside from knowing they're to both sides of Ned, you aren't positive about their positions.\n\nJon, what do you do?\"\n\nIn my notes,  I might say:\n\nG (for Goblin, mainly used if I have different types of enemies)\n\nG\n\nG\n\nG\n\nG\n\n(etc)\n\nI leave a little room to the left, and a lot to the right on each line.  For fights where different enemies have different health/hp totals, I note that with a vertical line to separate it from damage:\n\nO 47 |  ~~5~~ 12    (this is an ogre with 47 hp that took 5 damage, and then 7 more)\n\nThen I'd draw a line between groups - 5 on Jon, 1 doing something, 6 on Ned.   If I think it will take more than a minute to get to back to their actions, I might make a one word note of what they are doing, ditto if they have some strange position - high ground, invis, at the altar, blocking a door, etc.\n - quick actions on the right, longer ones on the left.  Any damage dealt is added together on right.  Conditions, spell effects, etc also follow this left/right system, so temporary conditions go next to \"current damage\", and get crossed out as a I continue, but lasting ones are the left, and likely get crossed out less.  If someone goes down, their letter is crossed out.  If distribution changes I either cross the dividing line and make a new one, or circle groups with arrows.  After a few rounds I might have this:\n\n ^~~p~~ ~~G~~ ~~4~~ 10   (the crossed \"p\" shows that his poison has been used up - this group all has poisoned spears\n\nG 3 ~~st~~    (had gotten stunned, but it's over.  Next damage will cross out the 3 and goto the right of the \"st\")\n\nfl G ~~3~~ 7  (Jon and Ned have moved to flank this guy or otherwise get positional advantage)\n\nguard G     (the two \"guard\" notes say they are trying to protect the guy with the wand)\n\nguard ~~G~~ 12\n\n---- J^\n\nwand G \n\n----  (note here to prevent reddit from making this a divider)\n\n(etc)\n\nHope that helps - the big deal for me is that almost none of this changes when I DO use a map - I might not have to note positional info, but then I have to note which line is whom, so it works out almost identically.
