Obviously the technology level of the setting affects the degree to which cultural preferences  can be accomodated - if your humans don't have any kind of artifical gravity, the need to work around that will overtake everything else - but so long as you have centrifugal gravity or better, you can show things that the current culture has inherited from pre-dispora designs.\n\nFor an example of what I mean, think about housing. Some cultures tend to favour smaller cohabiting groups than others. In Britain, for example, we spend huge sums of money on buying or renting tiny new-build box homes rather in preference to living with our parents or with housemates. The same trend would probably continue on space stations: lots of very small, self-catering cabins, with only one or two occupants. Other cultures favour multigeneration cohabiting groups, with parents, grandparents and children all living in the same home. This would probably carry over to space with larger communal areas shared between a few cabins, probably with shared dining facilities.\n\nA second question is how Earth-centric cultures and religions have adapted to space. Assuming Islam is still practised in your setting, for example, how have they adapted the Qibla (the praying facing Mecca*) tradition? Do they pray facing in the direction of Earth? If so, how? On a ship or station with centrifugal gravity, the direction of Earth isn't going to be constant, it's going to move quite rapidly relative to somebody standing in the spin section. This would be solvable by putting the mosque on the central axis of the ship, so that the prayer room is in zero gravity, and worshippers can pray facing Earth. Of course, this raises the question of of how they manage to perform Salah without gravity... Regardless, this would give you some very distinctive buildings that give the ship a less conventionally american character.\n\nI suppose my advice basically boils down this: Work out what cultures survived whatever event lead to the disapora, and work out how they have to adapt to the practicalities of living in space. A lot of the \"big\" stuff like food is going to be strongly tied to the technology and resources your people have, rather than their culture, but the more personal things like religion and family will make a big difference to the character of each location\n\n*Actually they face the Kaaba, which is a big cube-thing in Mecca. Given that Earth is off-limits, that would raise the question of whether Muslims are still obligated to perform the Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca). It's quite possible that the dispora version of Islam doesn't require it, on the grounds that it's not possible, but it's also possible that they've somehow agreed on a \"new Mecca\".
