They clone whomever is most readily available with varying degrees of &amp;quot;success&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the players continue to investigate the town, they&amp;#39;ll learn that the clones have a highly organized hierarchical society. They all have tattoos which aren&amp;#39;t immediately noticable but which easily identify themselves to the other clones as to who they are, what their job is, and their rank in the organization. The organization part of the mark gets added onto it until it forms something similar to &lt;a href=\"http://www.davincicodeonline.com/images/vitruvian_man.jpg\"&gt;DaVinci&amp;#39;s Man&lt;/a&gt;, with the leader having a crown, and full armaments added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would also be fun to spin it into something where they&amp;#39;ve developed a cult of some kind, and in doing so have given birth to a demi-god in a sacrificial ritual in which most of the original villagers initially died. The god demands the sacrifice of non-clones in ritualistic manner periodically, and absorbs the power of the people. If the demi-god can manage to absorb 1000 people, it&amp;#39;ll transcend and become corporeal at which point it will attempt to spread it&amp;#39;s evil religion. For fun it can look like a hideous version of the clone originator. Maybe with multiple heads, or a single head with a face on it&amp;#39;s chest, mouths on it&amp;#39;s hands, etc. If it can transcend it&amp;#39;ll start harvesting nearby villagers to gain even more power and attempt to build itself a demonic court filled with disfigured versions of the clones each with it&amp;#39;s own set of powers it uses as specialized henchmen. Fun times in evil clone land.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg4r1ne", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966659.0, "created_utc": 1491937859.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64onwv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5nf71", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "megazver", "parent_id": "t3_64onwv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Horatio.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjIeBTaykPE)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjIeBTaykPE\"&gt;Horatio.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg5nf71", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492015731.0, "created_utc": 1491986931.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64onwv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg66qm9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SwiftOneSpeaks", "parent_id": "t3_64onwv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1) Don't forget the effect on women!
