I highly recommend that, at the start of each combat round, you give a quick recap of where everybody is standing in the room.\n\n&gt; There are a LOT of NPCs in this campaign (which is awesome), but I am worried about getting mixed up/losing track of who is related to who/their stats/their motivations, etc, etc. How would y'all handle this? I was thinking about having each one assigned to a notecard with their relevant info...is this a thing DM's do?\n\nMaybe remove a few of the NPCs to simplify things. What you're describing with notecards sounds just fine.\n\n&gt; Because I am new to DnD, and VERY new to DMing, I will not know ahead of time which encounters will TPK the group, if they enter in below level/without the proper prep. Is this OK? I certainly don't want the group to die and start over in the first campaign ever, but I am also not sure how to avoid this/guide them as I am not aware of enemy/PC power spikes.\n\nThrow a test encounter in at the start of the dungeon to make sure you're not overwhelming them. In encounters with intelligent monsters, the PCs might be captured as slaves instead.\n\nYou should also tell the players you're worried they'll die horribly ahead of time. Maybe also telegraph it with the corpses of other dead PCs.\n\n&gt; Gear: Other than my Monster Manual, DM Guide Book and 5E Core Rules, and the Phandelver set...what else should I buy/make before starting?

I'll reference their PP I have jotted down, and tell the relevant players what they noticed. It doesn't take more work than making sure your numbers are up to date at the beginning of a session, and it interrupts the story less). Keep your stuff in that behind your screen with your dice. I use an iPad because I make my own stories and write them up in googledocs, I also keep my bestiary in googlesheets, so that was handy for me. \n\n2) I like having a mini when I play because it makes me feel more attached to my character, and I find people I play with like to have one too. However, buying hundreds of monster minis is EXPENSIVE, and I don't recommend it (cool as some are). Get yourself a DnD Monster Vault, not too expensive, comes with a bunch of cool tokens and some nice grid maps. \n\n3) Refer to 1, totally cool to use whatever works for your sorting system! Hell, its behind the screen, your players don't need to know you have all the NPCs written down on your arm if that's what works for you. \n\n4) Use the challenge rating in the monster manual. There's a section in there that should describe really well how to use it. Also, don't be afraid to be a little fluid with your monsters. Once I had a boss that my players were making EASY work of, almost dead in one round; I had nerfed a big monster a bit too much in an effort for my players to meet a fun monster early in the game. So, I changed it up, had it hit a threshold and get stronger, beefing it up a bit and making the encounter more fun. Obviously don't get carried away with this, but if you see an encounter isn't going well because of something you did to mess it up, don't be afraid to edit it on the fly a bit. \n\n5) Roll20 is powerful, but I don't like it. I write my own stories, draw the maps on a grid marker board, use pen and paper for encounters, and that's how I like to play. Maybe you'll really like Roll20, but it's not for me.\n\nHope that helps! I'd be glad to help with any other questions you ever have through PM if you need it.

It doesn&amp;#39;t take more work than making sure your numbers are up to date at the beginning of a session, and it interrupts the story less). Keep your stuff in that behind your screen with your dice. I use an iPad because I make my own stories and write them up in googledocs, I also keep my bestiary in googlesheets, so that was handy for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I like having a mini when I play because it makes me feel more attached to my character, and I find people I play with like to have one too. However, buying hundreds of monster minis is EXPENSIVE, and I don&amp;#39;t recommend it (cool as some are). Get yourself a DnD Monster Vault, not too expensive, comes with a bunch of cool tokens and some nice grid maps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Refer to 1, totally cool to use whatever works for your sorting system! Hell, its behind the screen, your players don&amp;#39;t need to know you have all the NPCs written down on your arm if that&amp;#39;s what works for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Use the challenge rating in the monster manual. There&amp;#39;s a section in there that should describe really well how to use it. Also, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to be a little fluid with your monsters. Once I had a boss that my players were making EASY work of, almost dead in one round; I had nerfed a big monster a bit too much in an effort for my players to meet a fun monster early in the game. So, I changed it up, had it hit a threshold and get stronger, beefing it up a bit and making the encounter more fun. Obviously don&amp;#39;t get carried away with this, but if you see an encounter isn&amp;#39;t going well because of something you did to mess it up, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to edit it on the fly a bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Roll20 is powerful, but I don&amp;#39;t like it. I write my own stories, draw the maps on a grid marker board, use pen and paper for encounters, and that&amp;#39;s how I like to play. Maybe you&amp;#39;ll really like Roll20, but it&amp;#39;s not for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps! I&amp;#39;d be glad to help with any other questions you ever have through PM if you need it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dgeh9z8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492508186.0, "created_utc": 1492479386.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65xpry", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeo823", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jigawatts42", "parent_id": "t3_65xpry", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dont worry about Roll20, you are more than fine without it.\n\nYou absolutely dont need to worry about minis if you dont want to.
