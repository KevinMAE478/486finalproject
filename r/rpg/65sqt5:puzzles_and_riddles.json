Gollum riddles about life in the dark in the mountains, Bilbo riddles about life in the shire. The context, the situation and location make the answers easier for both parties; Bilbo is in the mountains and can see how Gollum lives and Gollum was once a hobbit living in conditions similar to the shire. Without that situational context those riddles are either nonsensical or can have different answers.\n\nTake the egg riddle, for example. To Bilbo and Gollum the answer is obvious as eggs are, or were, a significant part of their life. But what about a dwarf? To a dwarf the answer would be more literal and obviously be a mine, or perhaps a gold seam. How about an elf? The answer could just as easily be the sky or the heavens, a great box with a golden treasure (the sun), or more philosophically, life itself.\n\nLet's look at another staple of riddles; what gets shorter the more you use it? Most people would answer a candle or pencil, mostly depending on the answer given last time they were asked. But what about context?

The original riddle, at least the one most of us are familiar with, is also very much contextual in use. The riddle reflects Oedipus' journey through life, starting out as a child, growing as a man then ending as a cripple.\n\nThe important factor for a riddle to work is that everyone be on the same contextual page, otherwise someone can give an answer that is obviously correct but it is still wrong for the person asking the riddle.\n\nSo, if you are going to use riddles then keep the riddle within the context of where and how it is being asked.
