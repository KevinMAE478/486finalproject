Getting female input on games in a diverse setting by collaborating with male developers, as well as creating games with entirely female teams with just a few hires and put out both the kind of games made by a team of women, and the kind of games made by a team of mixed gender creators.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rpg", "name": "t1_dg67400", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046431.0, "created_utc": 1492017631.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60jvi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "akkoud", "parent_id": "t1_dg573k4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pretty weird that you chose TW3 and DaS to represent the idea that we need identity diversity in individual offices, considering those games were made by very homogenous teams in some of the world's most homogenous countries.

The hobby will expand if the product quality increases regardless of the sex of who makes the product.\n\n1. Actually they will. People overwhelmingly tend to create things they themselves would be interested in. Different groups of people make different games. More diversity of creators always leads to more diverse creations and originality and unique things have increased value, not to mention making something unique is a more reliable process than improving upon current trends. We already have good games, people want things that are either different or much better, we are already an industry full of people trying to make better things, making different things as well is a very good and almost guaranteed return on investment.\n\n Remember when World Of Warcraft was the killer MMO? What happened to the MMO's that came afterwards trying to make a better WoW? Games like Warhammer Online and other WoW killers flopped immensely. Whereas some creators tried to make MMO's that were different to WoW. Things like EVE Online or other niche titles. They cornered their own market of people who never played WoW and never wanted to, and found great success doing so.\n\nI'd like to point to two hugely successful video games here. One is Dark Souls, one is the Witcher 3. What do these two games have in common? Apart from being held up as some of the pinnacle of the last decades gaming offerings? I'd argue that obviously \"Quality\" is a factor, as nebulous as that term can be, but plenty of \"Quality\" RPG's are made and not all of them do this well. \"Fresh\" is a word I would use to describe why these titles have been so incredibly successful. Both games feel familiar but different, they shake up the tired worlds of \"Western style RPG\" in a lot of subtle and unsubtle ways. I would argue that bigger than any individual nut and bolt in the machine is the fact that these are \"American style\" \"Westernish RPGS\" made by a Japanese and a Polish studio respectively. I argue that their ***uniqueness*** is completely inseperable from their ***foreign-ness.*** I don't believe that these games would have so many new ideas and such a subtly different but incredibly powerfully tone shifting atmosphere if they weren't made in a different part of the world by groups of people that generally don't make these kinds of games. Diversity WORKS.\n\n&gt; 2)If a person isn't defined by their sex, race, religion or sexual orientation. Different viewpoints come from different people not from people of different race or sex or etc... If we consider 4 people (2 men, 2 women) there is the same likelihood of the two men (or women) of having different life experiences or opinions as there is between one of the men and one of the women.\n\nThey are. It's not the only thing of course, there are tons of things that inform the person you become. But ultimately a combination of our nature and nurture defines us. What are you even trying to say here? That there is no such thing as culture or commonality in the human psyche between like individuals? I don't think you can possibly believe that. Sure an individual Christian can and often is quite similar to an individual Hindu, or an individual Woman to an individual Man, but that's junk data, pull the lens back and look at a stastistically significant amount of data and the truth is clear as day. Different people, with different backgrounds and different life experiences are on the whole, different. Not a shocker. Hell that's not even going into the fact that we're not talking about Religion or Culture here, we're talking about Gender, which has the added dynamic that Womens and Mens bodies and brains are full of different chemical balances which literally make them think and feel in different ways to one another in a way that can be proven by hard science ***on top of the altered societal norms and life experiences that cause people to grow up differently.***. \n\n&gt; 3)I don't see why we need to increase minority partecipation in the hobby. If women do not like role playing games that's ok, it's not a bad thing. And if women do become interested then it's still ok. I don't see why we need to force certain demographics to take part in a hobby they're not interested in.\n\nMoney. Fucking big huge piles of dollar dollar bills yo. You manage to be the first to bring out a big game that Women like and you get ALL the fucking money. That's why. It's not just a touchy feely \"In an ideal world\" musing or a social justice thing sure people ARE thinking \"Wouldn't it be great if Women were into RPG's too?\" but many many more are also thinking \"Wouldn't I be rich if I released an RPG that Women were into too?\". Sales of Toy Bows for Kids increased a little when the Avengers came out and Hawkeye was the hot new thing, that's great. Really great, lots of little boys were into the whole archer thing for a while, but ultimately so many little boys were buying bows before then anyway it was a drop in the water. Guess what though? They jumped up a whole lot fucking higher when the Hunger Games came out with branded merchandise alongside and lots of little girls started asking for toy bows for Christmas. Sure it was \"OK\" that girls weren't interested in toy bows before, but as soon as something got little girls interested in toy bows a lot of people made a lot of money. (Of course some companies didn't get it and tried selling Pink Bows with Ponies on them because they're out of touch idiots and they didn't do so well)\n\nWhy do you think Twilight made so much money? Sure it was trashy and lowest common denominator as fuck, but lots of things are, there are tons of poorly written romance novels and they don't all make more money than god. Because almost nobody was writing fantasy for teen girls, with vampires and magic and werewolves and shit and those teen girls who didn't even know they wanted that shit jumped on it like a pack of rabid Jacobs making a lot of people incredibly rich in the process, and people paid attention. There has been a lot more female authored fantasy aimed at young women released since then, that inarguably some of wouldn't have seen the light of day without the doors being blown wide open and investors who previously would not have given opportunities to this kind of thing due to no proven track record of big financial success (basically the only thing most investors care about) now have a proven track record of big financial success to convince them to pony up the moolah for fantasy from female writers aimed at young women, it's gone from niche to big business in record time. Lots of Young Women used Twilight as a jumping off point for other Fantasy and sure they look back on it and cringe a little embarassed at the schlock they were reading when they were 13-14 but they also appreciate it for opening their eyes to the wonderful world of fantasy novels hey now inhabit. \n\nIf you make something for a crowd that's already buying very similar stuff you have a TON of competition and it's very hard to outsell everyone else.

They always seem ridiculous!  Of COURSE the really bad stuff is bad and only a few terrible people do those.

I read about \"booth babes\", I see read the comments posted to women that dare to speak up.  I read the behavior that Susan Fowler describes at Uber (just one of many such), and the many other employees that have confirmed her claims.  I read the REACTION to those claims.  I notice that vitriol isn't coming from one, or two people.  Or 5.  Or 10.  I see the population of subreddits that focus on describing how terrible these women are, and how unfair things are for them, and I judge these numerous complainers by their words and actions.\n\nAll of which leads me to the conclusion that there is a real problem.

BUT...we&amp;#39;re not dealing with a one-in-a-million issue.  We&amp;#39;re not dealing with a one-in-100k issue.  Look at the size of the crowds saying horrible things.  I&amp;#39;ll even grant you that they&amp;#39;re a minority - but they are a large, vocal one, and an actual majority of the original crowd seems to deny there is any problem worth worrying about.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the many anti-sexual harassment trainings I&amp;#39;ve had for jobs.

Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m worried about being accused of something in which I have no real defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I look at my industry (computing).  I read about &amp;quot;booth babes&amp;quot;, I see read the comments posted to women that dare to speak up.  I read the behavior that Susan Fowler describes at Uber (just one of many such), and the many other employees that have confirmed her claims.  I read the REACTION to those claims.  I notice that vitriol isn&amp;#39;t coming from one, or two people.  Or 5.  Or 10.  I see the population of subreddits that focus on describing how terrible these women are, and how unfair things are for them, and I judge these numerous complainers by their words and actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of which leads me to the conclusion that there is a real problem.
