As a unashamed Mythras fanboy that would be expected of me.   \n\nThe stats are very similar to D&amp;D because the whole thing started as a \"better\" (or more politely, alternative) D&amp;D in the 70s. D&amp;D did get some things right, so they went with those things. The two outliers Pow and Siz made sense there and then, and havent been \"streamlined\" out because they simply work. Siz, in particular, has been a hot potato for some fans and would-be reinventors. Personally I have no problems with it, but I'm not going to hold Siz against you - because it boils down to opinion.   \n\nThe derived attributes and deeper system suffer a bit in the Imperative - it is a quite severely edited quickstart. Cha adds to your experience because it is assumed that socially agreeable characters will not only have an easier time getting people to teach them, but also have an easier time learning from them (on account of being socially adept). And yes, a high Int/Dex-combo will make you quicker in a fight. Gamedesign-wise, that's as straight edge as it gets.  \nSiz and movement speed - good question. This is an average human range of Siz's we're talking about. The differences in actual size is less than what it looks like on the character sheet. Think this is an oversight and want to fix it? Add Siz to the equation in Athletics for running and to Initiative for reach. The game lets you do this without breaking anything.  \n\nAs for skills; do you really consider Boating, Bureacracy, and Customs to be completely unnecessary skills in what is, by all accounts, a *skill-based* system? Really? And allow me to disagree that things like Gambling and Native Language are innate instead of acquired. Regarding Brawn (and the other resistance-skills), I do however agree. Being an oldschool BRP-curmudgeon, the good old Resistance Table was both less fiddly and made at least as much sense.  \nThe skill-list does suffer somewhat from the aforementioned editing, but I have to concede a few points. After the great liscencing-shuffle of 2016 they re-edited the game, and in doing so, included some things from their expanded universe - thus the inclusion of a Computer-skill and blaster rifles in what seems very much like a fantasy game. While it is excusable in the quickstart, it is less so in the core book - those things stand out like sore thumbs.  \nThe same goes for the backgrounds - they make perfect sense in a fantasy game (they really do, but again; severely edited). Careers are in there for a reason. They help define a character and they help avoid chargen devolve into an unholy clusterfuck like what you see in Eclipse Phase.  \n\nPassions are awesome. Period. Of course, you could force players to roll to see how their characters feel if you were dead set on making the game as miserable an experience as possible. Or you could use them as *passions*, as defined character traits, use them to drive the story, add hooks, let them boost skills and heroic exploits, or let them play their part in tragedy.  \n\nI don't recall the wording on opposed rolls in the Imperative, but assuming it is the same text as in the core I don't see where it is incomprehensible.  \n\nThe combat is not a clusterfuck. It may seem like a clusterfuck when you read it for the first time, and it may feel like a clusterfuck when you play it for the first time without knowing what you're doing. The only drawback of combat is that it requires some level of system mastery - the turn structure and special effects has the potential to be grating until it sinks in. Once it sinks in, it *shines*, and I dare say that it sinks quickly.  \nApart from the game-mechanical aspects of how combat works; yes, getting stabbed in the lung is different from getting stabbed in the spleen. Mythras doesn't differentiate these two organs though. Getting stabbed just hurts. A lot. Your main priority if you're in a fight is to not get stabbed, because your organs don't grow back in a hurry.  \n\n&gt;Well, Mythras is a bad game, and I'm saying so  \n\nThe fact that you're wrong is inconsequential. It is still my favourite game.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m going to disagree with you here. As a unashamed Mythras fanboy that would be expected of me.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stats are very similar to D&amp;amp;D because the whole thing started as a &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; (or more politely, alternative) D&amp;amp;D in the 70s. D&amp;amp;D did get some things right, so they went with those things. The two outliers Pow and Siz made sense there and then, and havent been &amp;quot;streamlined&amp;quot; out because they simply work. Siz, in particular, has been a hot potato for some fans and would-be reinventors. Personally I have no problems with it, but I&amp;#39;m not going to hold Siz against you - because it boils down to opinion.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The derived attributes and deeper system suffer a bit in the Imperative - it is a quite severely edited quickstart. Cha adds to your experience because it is assumed that socially agreeable characters will not only have an easier time getting people to teach them, but also have an easier time learning from them (on account of being socially adept). And yes, a high Int/Dex-combo will make you quicker in a fight. Gamedesign-wise, that&amp;#39;s as straight edge as it gets.&lt;br/&gt;\nSiz and movement speed - good question. This is an average human range of Siz&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re talking about. The differences in actual size is less than what it looks like on the character sheet. Think this is an oversight and want to fix it? Add Siz to the equation in Athletics for running and to Initiative for reach. The game lets you do this without breaking anything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for skills; do you really consider Boating, Bureacracy, and Customs to be completely unnecessary skills in what is, by all accounts, a &lt;em&gt;skill-based&lt;/em&gt; system? Really? And allow me to disagree that things like Gambling and Native Language are innate instead of acquired. Regarding Brawn (and the other resistance-skills), I do however agree. Being an oldschool BRP-curmudgeon, the good old Resistance Table was both less fiddly and made at least as much sense.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe skill-list does suffer somewhat from the aforementioned editing, but I have to concede a few points. After the great liscencing-shuffle of 2016 they re-edited the game, and in doing so, included some things from their expanded universe - thus the inclusion of a Computer-skill and blaster rifles in what seems very much like a fantasy game. While it is excusable in the quickstart, it is less so in the core book - those things stand out like sore thumbs.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe same goes for the backgrounds - they make perfect sense in a fantasy game (they really do, but again; severely edited). Careers are in there for a reason. They help define a character and they help avoid chargen devolve into an unholy clusterfuck like what you see in Eclipse Phase.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passions are awesome. Period. Of course, you could force players to roll to see how their characters feel if you were dead set on making the game as miserable an experience as possible. Or you could use them as &lt;em&gt;passions&lt;/em&gt;, as defined character traits, use them to drive the story, add hooks, let them boost skills and heroic exploits, or let them play their part in tragedy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t recall the wording on opposed rolls in the Imperative, but assuming it is the same text as in the core I don&amp;#39;t see where it is incomprehensible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The combat is not a clusterfuck.

Both of those games are deeply flawed but have something special to offer (a staggering array of splatbooks and a wildly imaginative setting, respectively).\n\nBut Mythras just seems like an absolute mess of rules to the extent that I can't believe anyone would actually play this.\n\nWhere to start? First off, the base stats are just standard D&amp;D, except that they ditched Wisdom for Power.

And Size doesn't seem like it's important enough to need a seventh stat--most systems just have a perk/feat for \"Large\" and a flaw/weakness for \"Small\" and assume everyone else is normal size.\n\nThe list of derived stats that you liked is insane as well.

There is no logic behind this skill list, I cannot believe that someone rationally decided that yes, Boating is going to be a core gameplay feature.\n\nThis might be better in the real rulebook, but the four options in Cultures are literally \"Civilized\" and then three other options that are all variations on \"not Civilized\" (Barbarian, Primitive, and Nomadic) which seems absurd for a game that has Computers as an available skill. Careers don't make any sense either, they're just an arbitrary restriction on where you can put your skill points.\n\nThe Passions mechanic infuriates me more than anything else in the game. I like the idea of making players write down their character motivations, a lot of games do something like that. But the fact that they are rated like skills, and you are expected to literally **roll to see how your character feels** shows to me that the Mythras designers fundamentally don't understand what roleplaying is.\n\nThe wording on how opposed rolls are supposed to work is so badly written that I don't think I would have understood it if I hadn't played a d100 system before.\n\nCombat is a clusterfuck. The fact that you have to spend Action Points to attack **or** defend means that the winner of combat is always going to be the person with more Action Points, always. You have hit points by location, and yet you're supposed to just roll a d20 to see where it hits? And why are \"Chest\" and \"Abdomen\" considered to be different locations? Is it really that different if I kill someone by stabbing them in the lung, versus stabbing them in their spleen?\n\nHealing rates are also bullshit. If an average-health character takes a gut wound for ten damage, it will take them **two weeks** to even be able to fight again, and another six days after that to get back to full health. Oh, and that assumes that I'm lying in bed doing nothing, taking any action slows that down.
