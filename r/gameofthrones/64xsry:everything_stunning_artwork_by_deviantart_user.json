When Ned called his banners to join Robert, Howland Reed was with him. It's not impossible, of course, that Meera would have been conceived within the aforementioned window (Robb is proof it could happen - he was conceived just before Ned went off to war, and was born near the end of the war, also in 283), but it seems too coincidental (in my eyes) given that Howland Reed was with Ned at the Tower of Joy, that the two shared a great secret, that there is still a third Targaryen unaccounted for, and that Meera has played such a seemingly significant role in Bran's storyline. Add to that Howland's history with the Starks, as well as his friendship with Lyanna Stark, I'm inclined to believe that had there been another child, Howland would have shouldered that burden out of honor, just as Ned did. Several times in the series, Howland Reed is alluded to as a man of great worth and honor, and his fealty to the Starks unprecedented. GRRM has said we will eventually see him, and I'm sure his inevitable presence will be with great fanfare. If the prophecy that Dany saw in the House of the Undying is to be believed, there are three heads to the dragon - one is her, the other is Jon, leaving the third 'dragon' (Targaryen) a mystery. We know of no other contenders for this role as of yet since Aemon Targaryen passed, and this theory that Jon could have a twin, be it Meera or someone else, could be a strong one. Bran has stated that he cannot control his visions yet, and they are seldom linear, so it's possible if this revelation came to be, he simply hasn't seen it yet.
