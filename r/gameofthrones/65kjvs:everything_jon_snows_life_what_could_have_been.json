Ned was disgusted and wanted The Mountain and others responsible punished and that&amp;#39;s why he went home rather than stay. He was only in the war to rescue his sister and when he found Jon he had a new responsibility. I definitely think Lyanna &amp;amp; Rhaegar were in love, married in secret, and Jon is the legit heir.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope they have some Bran-led flash-backs to Lyanna &amp;amp; Rhaegar. I imagine him finding her as the mystery knight, appreciates &amp;amp; respects her skill, bravery, and honor as much as her beauty. Rewards her with the winter roses. I also think Little Finger helped them run off together, maybe even helping Lyanna get to the meeting place with Rhaegar, then LF runs off starting the rumor of Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "name": "t1_dgcbcgu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393220.0, "created_utc": 1492364420.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrj9n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pspetrini", "parent_id": "t1_dgbnnl2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gameofthrones", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think that meshes well at all.
