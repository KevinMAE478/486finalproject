Meera tells one about a crannogman who leaves his home to go off on an adventure. He visits the isle of faces and spends the winter there before leaving.\n\nSo far, I don't think it's supposed to be that interesting, but next Meera describes a scene that should be much more familiar to the reader. She says the crannogman reaches the greatest castle in all the world, and there's to be a great tourney. The king is present with the dragon prince. The White Swords are there to welcome a new brother. The storm lord and the rose lord were there, but the lion of the rock stayed away due to a quarrel with the king.\n\nFrom things in the book so far, the reader should realize Meera's talking about the tourney at Harrenhal. First, Harrenhal is a *huge* castle (Bran even assumes it's Harrenhal when Meera describes it). The White Swords are the kingsguard, and their new brother is Jaime Lannister. The lion of the rock is Tywin, of course, who didn't attend the tourney because the king took away his heir by appointing him to the kingsguard (this was a deliberate insult by the king). You learn all this in ASOS (and possibly ACOK too), so it's exciting to realize this isn't just a story about some crannogman, it takes place in the current world with the current characters.\n\nAll that is just to establish the setting, now for the story: The crannogman is minding his own business when he gets bullied and beaten up by three squires who are all bigger than him. Bran asks if they are Freys, because he already dislike Freys, and Meera says they offered no names. The crannogman is rescued by a she-wolf who shouts, \"That's my father's man you're attacking!\" and chases them off with a tourney sword. The reader can deduce that this is probably Lyanna Stark. She takes him back to her \"lair\" to patch him up, and there we meet a wild wolf that leads their \"pack\" (Brandon Stark), a quiet wolf (Eddard Stark), and a pup who was the youngest of the four (Benjen Stark).\n\nAfter that, the crannogman hangs out with the wolves. At the feast, the dragon prince sings a beautiful song that makes the wolf maid cry. The pup makes fun of her for that, so she pours a glass of wine over his head. The storm lord drinks. A lot. (Just like Robert, eh?) The crannogman spots the three squires who beat him up, one of them wears the two towers of the Freys. (Bran was right!) The wolf maid sees them too, and points them out to her brothers. The pup offers to get a horse and armor for the crannogman to use, to get his revenge in the tourney. But the crannogman feels conflicted. He's proud, but he knows he isn't a warrior, and would probably only make a fool of himself in a joust. He spends the night in the tent of the quiet wolf, but before that he prays to the old gods.\n\nTo sum up the rest of the story, a mystery knight shows up, short in stature and wearing ill-fitting armor. Bran assumes it's the crannogman On his shield is a white weirwood with a laughing red face (see my flair). He challenges three knights to joust, all three are the knights that the three bullies squired under. He beats them, and all he asks for in his victory is for the knights to chastise their cruel squires, which they do. Later, everyone wants to know who the mystery knight was, but he disappeared. The king is angry and sends the dragon prince to look for him, but all he finds is the shield with the tree painted on it.\n\nBran likes the story, but has his own critiques which are hilarious to read. He asserts again that the mystery knight must be the crannogman. Throughout this story, Jojen keeps asking bran, \"Are you *sure* your father never told you this story?\" This further implies that the story was about Ned Stark and his siblings, and hints that Meera and Jojen probably learned the story from their own father, Howland Reed, who is almost certainly the crannogman in the story.\n\nThat's the story as the book presents it. The question is, who was the mystery knight? That leads to several fan theories, but the most popular one posits that Lyanna was the mystery knight, and when Rhaegar goes to look for the knight, that's when they meet and fall in love. Rhaegar lies about finding her, to protect her from his psycho dad, and they run off together after that.\n\nEdit: One thing I love about this that I forgot to add is that Eddard and Howland are old friends, and this is clearly the start of their long friendship.\n\nEdit 2: Tagging /u/Saboteure and /u/TCesqGO who asked for a recap below.", "edited": 1491977186.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of hard to describe the fun of reading the story, but I&amp;#39;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While traveling together, Meera, Jojen, and Bran pass the time by taking turns telling stories to each other.

The king is angry and sends the dragon prince to look for him, but all he finds is the shield with the tree painted on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bran likes the story, but has his own critiques which are hilarious to read. He asserts again that the mystery knight must be the crannogman. Throughout this story, Jojen keeps asking bran, &amp;quot;Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; your father never told you this story?&amp;quot; This further implies that the story was about Ned Stark and his siblings, and hints that Meera and Jojen probably learned the story from their own father, Howland Reed, who is almost certainly the crannogman in the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the story as the book presents it. The question is, who was the mystery knight? That leads to several fan theories, but the most popular one posits that Lyanna was the mystery knight, and when Rhaegar goes to look for the knight, that&amp;#39;s when they meet and fall in love. Rhaegar lies about finding her, to protect her from his psycho dad, and they run off together after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: One thing I love about this that I forgot to add is that Eddard and Howland are old friends, and this is clearly the start of their long friendship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Tagging &lt;a href=\"/u/Saboteure\"&gt;/u/Saboteure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/TCesqGO\"&gt;/u/TCesqGO&lt;/a&gt; who asked for a recap below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "name": "t1_dg5gwan", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492000091.0, "created_utc": 1491971291.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rjz2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ra8x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5e46p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoobertDowneyJr", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ddvq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gameofthrones", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They didn't say anything in the show.
