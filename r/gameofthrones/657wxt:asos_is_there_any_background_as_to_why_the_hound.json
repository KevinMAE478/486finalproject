He hates knighthood, but being a \"true knight\" is something different he can strive for, something his boyhood self could have looked up to.\n\n* Sansa becomes the arbiter of what is and isn't a true knight, in Sandor's mind, so this is when he begins to protect her, to try to be a true knight to her. He's the only kingsguard who refuses to hit Sansa when Joffrey commands it.

Unfortunately, he is shaken from the battle and even drunker than usual. Sansa is startled by his appearence (and the battle, and all) and Sandor mistakes her hesitation for rejection. So he leaves without her.\n\n* Later he feels very guilty about leaving Sansa with the Lannisters. He failed to protect her. So when he stumbles on Arya, he sees a chance at a sort of redemption. He couldn't save Sansa, but at least he could save her sister. That's' why he begins his journey with Arya, out of loyalty to Sansa.\n\nLike I said, I may have gotten some things wrong.
