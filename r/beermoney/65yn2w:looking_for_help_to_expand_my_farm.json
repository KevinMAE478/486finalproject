I am looking to expand my current farm. I came across &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BeermoneyHomeNetwork/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; subreddit, but thought I would post here as well to see what help you guys might be able to give.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, my current internet setup looks like this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ISP: &lt;a href=\"http://nextlinkinternet.com/about/how-it-works/\"&gt;NextLink&lt;/a&gt; (Fixed wireless through a dish on my roof, link explains further)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bandwidth: Unlimited&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current Speed: 15 mbps down, 3 mbps up (can increase up to 50 mbps down, 10 mbps up if needed)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IPs: can get additional IPs for $10/month if this would be useful in any way&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And my current farm setup looks like this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Router: Netgear AC1750 (R6400) - (my main router that my internet connects directly to since I don&amp;#39;t have cable internet/modem)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AP: old Linksys WRT54G router&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phones connected: 21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have 4 other devices connected wirelessly throughout the house for other purposes (1 laptop, 1 DirecTV, 1 cell phone, 1 printer).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 25 total devices I have connected is the max I seem to be able to do with my current setup. Using the Linksys as an AP hasn&amp;#39;t helped much because I think my Netgear is maxed out. I also do have several more phones I could add to my farm, but as soon as I go above what is currently connected I start getting frequent connection problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have read a number of posts on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BeermoneyHomeNetwork/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; subreddit and other farming posts on other subreddits to get more of feel for things and what might be possible, but have a few questions I hope you guys can also help to answer. Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) How limited am I by my current and max internet speeds my ISP provides and how many devices could I max out on based on those speeds? I have seen no reduction in speeds with my current internet speeds and farm setup, but not sure how far I can go before I start to see a decline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Which router should I get, especially given my internet is fixed wireless and not cable? I&amp;#39;ve seen people say the Edgerouter X, others say the Lite. I&amp;#39;m looking to connect as many devices as possible (preferably 100+) and want one that will allow to expand as far as I want to go. A link to the exact model would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Which APs should I get? Again, same idea as the router in terms of expandability and performance. I&amp;#39;ve seen the Ubiquiti Lite and Pro mentioned. A link to the exact model would be helpful as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I am looking to expand as far as possible. I understand my internet isn&amp;#39;t the best, but it&amp;#39;s all I really have available in my area. Just looking for what equipment works the best and won&amp;#39;t be difficult to manage.
