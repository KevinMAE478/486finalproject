I suppose in the future that might be useful, I can&amp;#39;t think of a specific example though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "beermoney", "name": "t1_dg5dvvf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995305.0, "created_utc": 1491966505.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5dddk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "T0X1K01", "parent_id": "t1_dg5cx97", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/beermoney", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I agree, but I am not big into farming as I was before, so I don't mind helping some people out.
