Unfortunately the API only exists since Marshmallow. Will investigate an alternative for Lollipop;\n2 - New option that let&amp;#39;s you set up a daily alert reminding you to start a cycle, for example, when you get to work in the morning.

Being under Doze rules was preventing the app from sometimes not alerting the user properly and not updating the Android Wear watch app on a minute basis because Doze doesn&amp;#39;t allow apps from pushing Alarms in shorter than 9 minute intervals. This won&amp;#39;t hit your battery life in any way since this is a VERY quick partial wake-up, it&amp;#39;s just a couple milliseconds for a MUCH better experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also fixed a bug that was preventing the app from recording the number of daily work cycles. Now you can poke your friends about how productive you really are by rubbing on their &amp;quot;faces&amp;quot; the productive day you just had.
