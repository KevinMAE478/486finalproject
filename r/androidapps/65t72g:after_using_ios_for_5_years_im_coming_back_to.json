Spotify certainly isn&amp;#39;t bug-free either; the thing is Spotify only has Spotify to maintain (allowing for a lot of updates and constant development), while Google does have a lot of other services (of course it&amp;#39;s a bigger company, I realise that). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Good argument, but if you have music that&amp;#39;s not on Spotify you can still upload it. Example, Taylor Swift isn&amp;#39;t on Spotify but here I have her song Blank Space as well as the rest of the album: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ViI88VS.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/ViI88VS.png&lt;/a&gt; The process is fairly straightforward, have Spotify watch a folder for music, add that music to a playlist, sync playlist to phone.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I aware of this feature as I decribed it in my own post, but the way you have to make a watchfolder is not very userfriendly, especially if you want to do this on more than one computer. Same scenario on GPM: Upload the music to your account (ONCE), available everywhere, even for download. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;That thing that sucked the most was getting all the music I collected out of GPM, but that was a one time thing and they have scripts for that.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see a reason for doing that :) - But if it&amp;#39;s your own music there is even a download manager which makes is very easy. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "androidapps", "name": "t1_dgdhy79", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492465872.0, "created_utc": 1492437072.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2reen", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t72g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2reen", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t72g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdlkvm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JokerzBane", "parent_id": "t1_dgdkqqg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/androidapps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The fact YouTube Red isn't in my country is the thing that's stopping me from getting GPM.
