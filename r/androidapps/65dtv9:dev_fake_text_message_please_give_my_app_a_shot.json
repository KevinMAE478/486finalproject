Other than  that insignificant detail, I love it and will be using it a lot in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "androidapps", "name": "t1_dga03mt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492244580.0, "created_utc": 1492215780.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2reen", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dtv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2reen", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dtv9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga1n7x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MJHApps", "parent_id": "t1_dga0z83", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/androidapps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I should have put in a disclaimer for not holding me responsible for the fallout.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should have put in a disclaimer for not holding me responsible for the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "androidapps", "name": "t1_dga1n7x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246644.0, "created_utc": 1492217844.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0z83", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ya_like_dags", "parent_id": "t3_65dtv9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/androidapps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This app is going to be weaponized drama.
