I.E. Canadian taxpayers pay for 60% of every movie shot there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, greedy execs who have no concern for good content or satisfaction and quality of life of the artists creating it are eager to ship every job they can up there to get their 60% check - so a LOT of movies shoot there. Mostly on sound stages in warehouses where they could shoot literally anywhere in the world (or maybe - like - where most of the actors/directors/artists making them live?). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How Vancouver residents haven&amp;#39;t gotten wise to it (the drain the film industry is bringing to their public services) is beyond me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying Vancouver is a bad place, and I&amp;#39;m not saying that over the 5-10 years the incentives have been in place, people haven&amp;#39;t started becoming more skilled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But try leaving your home town, moving to LA which has been the home of film and television for 100 years, working your ass off for years and years of your life trying to perfect your skills and be good enough, building a career, a life and a family there, only to have executives start telling you to move some place new every time that place offers a bigger rebate check. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the place that literally tens of thousands of us in LA have found ourselves in over the last 5-10 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg6vcjl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492073477.0, "created_utc": 1492044677.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6kz1q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Feeling_Arkansaucey", "parent_id": "t1_dg6kkw9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A lot of movies and shows are filmed there for tax breaks.
