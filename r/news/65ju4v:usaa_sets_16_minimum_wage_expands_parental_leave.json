Well, it's moot anyway because I don't have anything that proves my parents owned them...\n\nStill not a problem.  They cut a check immediately based on my best estimate of what the bikes were worth and said they'd deliver the rest after I faxed in some documentation of their value.

The guy told me that he'd do the rest of the financial advising with me later because I needed to talk to insurance about making a claim immediately.  But, I told him, I don't have insurance for this - it happened while I was walking home from the bar.  Still actually covered, apparently.  They paid for a new phone, wallet, and iPod - and even a new pea coat because mine was covered in blood.  \n\nA more recent event was when I sold a car and forgot to take it off of my insurance - get that, my car insurance is so cheap that I *forgot* that I was insuring a vehicle I'd sold.  Full coverage, including collision!

Some of these events might have transpired a little differently than I recounted them here, but the general vibe is spot on.  I'll close with this:  I can't remember the last time I gave even the slightest thought to insurance.  I keep money in a savings account and add a little more in from time to time, my premiums get debited from that account.  I don't know how much they are, although I could find out in less than a minute with their app.  Just yesterday I was trying to buy something and my card didn't have enough on it so I made a transfer.  Before the next person in line was done paying the money was in my account and ready to use.\n\nI'll never use another bank or insurer if I can help it.  This news only elevates my opinion of them and that's amazing in and of itself because I already thought of them as like, the one good company I know of.\n\nI recommend them to anyone and everyone.

The guy told me that he&amp;#39;d do the rest of the financial advising with me later because I needed to talk to insurance about making a claim immediately.  But, I told him, I don&amp;#39;t have insurance for this - it happened while I was walking home from the bar.  Still actually covered, apparently.  They paid for a new phone, wallet, and iPod - and even a new pea coat because mine was covered in blood.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A more recent event was when I sold a car and forgot to take it off of my insurance - get that, my car insurance is so cheap that I &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt; that I was insuring a vehicle I&amp;#39;d sold.  Full coverage, including collision!  The refunded me all of the premiums I had paid since the sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I should say that my head&amp;#39;s been knocked around a couple of times, so my memory is not the best in the world.  Some of these events might have transpired a little differently than I recounted them here, but the general vibe is spot on.  I&amp;#39;ll close with this:  I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time I gave even the slightest thought to insurance.  I keep money in a savings account and add a little more in from time to time, my premiums get debited from that account.  I don&amp;#39;t know how much they are, although I could find out in less than a minute with their app.  Just yesterday I was trying to buy something and my card didn&amp;#39;t have enough on it so I made a transfer.  Before the next person in line was done paying the money was in my account and ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll never use another bank or insurer if I can help it.  This news only elevates my opinion of them and that&amp;#39;s amazing in and of itself because I already thought of them as like, the one good company I know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend them to anyone and everyone.  Using USAA &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; improve your life somehow, I feel confident about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dgby3fb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492371584.0, "created_utc": 1492342784.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ju4v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ju4v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ju4v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbafql", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "J-Blackwood", "parent_id": "t1_dgb8dmc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Businesses will increase costs to cover the costs of operations, however the increase to cover will minimally impact minimum wage earners. \n\nUtilities, rent, car repairs and so on (essentials) aren't tied to a minimum wage.
