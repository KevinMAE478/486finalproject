It was about 6 months of work. They were supposed to get progress payments but the company always gave some excuse. Dad naively thought that such a large company couldn&amp;#39;t possibly want to rip off small time folks like us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t afford to continue to rent the place we were in and I remember we all had to cram into another relative&amp;#39;s apartment while my parents got their life back together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was still expected to get straight A&amp;#39;s though.\nAnyway the point of this story is I hope the paint store gets the money.
