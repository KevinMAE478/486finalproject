Simply saying, &amp;quot;We should just deport them all.&amp;quot; shows an extreme lack of knowledge or understanding of the complexity of the problems that would create. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like the people who argue about illegal immigration in black and white terms usually have no actual interaction with illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Lots of good discussion being had below. It is a shame this sort of dialog will never be something you see at the top of a comment thread, at least not in this political climate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immigration issues won&amp;#39;t be fixed by building a wall and deporting everyone here illegally. They also won&amp;#39;t be fixed by opening the boarders and granting carte blanche immunity to everyone here illegally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things we need to change, but that has become difficult when both sides think that change comes from only their ideas. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg7rgsu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128296.0, "created_utc": 1492099496.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 255}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7m876", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 344, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HistoricalNazi", "parent_id": "t3_6553ii", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "ITT: Black and white and nary a shade of grey.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ITT: Black and white and nary a shade of grey.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg7m876", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492122543.0, "created_utc": 1492093743.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 344}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553ii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553ii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553ii", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7v84x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Friscogonewild", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qfth", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There was an article?
