Paper logs were, and still are very inexpensive. The savings has to be justified by fewer errors and or fewer fines which in the end make paper logs a more expensive proposition. With self driving and or electric, the initial costs are going to be huge. Insanely huge with little to no upside within an industry that likes to get every penny they can. It's going to be a HUGE uphill battle. The only companies I see as first adopters are non-public companies that have an affinity for new technology and or want to give it a go... just because. That or huge incentives by say a company like Tesla, and or government level incentives. \n\n&gt;3\n\nSee above, lol... I completely agree. Well most of it. They will adopt it when they are forced to either by the government, or by economics. Eventually it will be cost effective and the transition will begin and a decade or so after that near full adoption will be here. \n\n&gt;3a\n\nI don't see a fully driverless tractor for 4 to 5 decades out. That's just not really feasible. The infrastructure in which trucks have to operate is just not there. As a truck driver you sort of have to break the law just about every day in some way or another to get where you are going in a safe and timely manner. The only way I see that happening is with actual AI that is more advanced at all processes involved than a human. Until then a driver will always be in or close by to that seat. \n\nWhat I can see happening is the long hauls... where the tractor drives on the highways, and in some areas it's approved to navigate in, and then alert the driver to take over at a designated spot. I can see a driver taking a nap in the sleeper berth and if the driver doesn't get in the seat in time, the tractor pulls over in the nearest safest space. Driver assistance like that could be here a lot quicker easily within a decade if it can be done cost effectively, not fully adopted but at least 60% with most large companies. Mainly in the area of Owner Operators. \n\nI don't see them as being, or will be \"transport engineers\". That would be way to convoluted for the current method of doing business. They will oversee everything and if anything goes wrong they will report it. \n\n&gt;3b\n\nI think it would be similar HoS, but not exact. It will have to change for those specific drivers. At least 8 consecutive hours in the sleeper berth, and only say a max of 10 hours behind the wheel in a day. So for example 16 hours total onduty time, 10 hours of that could be driving. The \"breaks\" don't really matter at that point if it's a long highway drive that the tractor can do easily. Hell you could be in back sleeping, or watching a movie, or playing a game until the next takeover point. \n\nNow as for the 24/7 bit. A single human can depending on a number of factors. If a lot of the driving is on the highway and or what the tractor can do unaided or not supervised then the driver can do whatever they want until they are needed. The truck will be able to move for longer periods of time, maybe not 24/7, but easily 20/7 depending on a number of factors. \n\n&gt;4\n\nIf only you take it from the perspective of a driver needs to have their hands on or near the wheel at every moment, then it would be an issue. There are ways to mitigate the trip time. A typical long distance day for OTR you can do maybe 600 miles or so. A 2,000 mile trip will take 4 to 5 days to do solo, if you hussle. \n\nJust a small thought experiment. You can usually fuel in less than 15 minutes including paying for it, taking a piss getting whatever and off you go. A typical tractor can hold anywhere from 200 to 300 gallons. So let's say 250, at around 5MPG if you are lucky that's 1,250 miles. So during that 2k trip you would have to at least fill up once. If you can get 1k to 1.25K miles out of a full charge on a truck, then let's say that charge takes a fast charger to do in 24 hours (I think with reasonable future tech we could get to 8 hours). If the truck handles all of the highway miles, you could probably get 1000 miles easily in a day depending on road conditions, traffic, etc. So instead of 4 to 5 days realistically speaking, you could do it in 2 to 3. Add 24 hours for recharging, and that goes up to 3 to 4. An easy savings of at least a day. Now if self driving vehicles get the go ahead to \"speed\" when conditions are good for them, like little to no traffic then you could get quite a few more miles during a trip. \n\n&gt;I would LOVE to see automated EVERYTHING on the roads.\n\nI can see that happening at some point but not for a very very long time. Hell today you can see Model A's on the road from time to time, so \"EVERYTHING\" is unlikely to happen during any of our lifetimes. Most? Possibly, but not all. Personally I would own fully autonomous vehicle, but I would also own one that I could also get behind the wheel. I don't like being driven around... I actually like and prefer driving. The one complaint people have about manual transmissions is driving in traffic. I don't. Hell even in a tractor I don't mind it. Especially bobtail and skipping gears :D\n\n&gt;While that day may be near for the average American driver (I'd bet about 15 years), we are probably 40 years from autonomous semis being commonplace.\n\nI don't subscribe to your time frame. Fully autonomous cars where in any trip a human could do an autonomous car can do 100% on it's own... that is way out. easily 2+ decades. With tractor trailers, that will require huge infrastructure spending like we have never seen before, and even then it will not be 80%+ viable, or 80%+ adoption. Look at any city and some roads are very narrow, and just the general layout. Cities for the most part were not designed with tractor trailers in mind, and you can't completely do away with them due to construction and other large items that only a tractor trailer could do. \n\nOne thing I can see going away fairly quickly say within 15 years or so are yard jockeys on very flat terrain and very good weather conditions. Uneven terrain, and or bad weather will take a bit longer. Full automation of the drop and hook process will require specific robotics on the tractor, as well as the trailers need modifications to work without human intervention. All of those are huge sunk costs that will take many decades to flush out.  \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a looooooong way out before we see semis that are self-driving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely agree, easily 3+ decades out. But this is about electric vehicles not self driving. Even that before near complete adoption could easily take 2+ decades with all of the sunk costs in the trucking industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need legislation to develop the technology, to get it passed, and or get an idea where to finalize the tech yeah. DOT is a bitch and it will be tough to get going. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again I agree, but you also have to factor in costs. With the electronic logs it was a cost that had to make sense to the bean counters. Paper logs were, and still are very inexpensive. The savings has to be justified by fewer errors and or fewer fines which in the end make paper logs a more expensive proposition. With self driving and or electric, the initial costs are going to be huge. Insanely huge with little to no upside within an industry that likes to get every penny they can.

I completely agree. Well most of it. They will adopt it when they are forced to either by the government, or by economics. Eventually it will be cost effective and the transition will begin and a decade or so after that near full adoption will be here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3a&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see a fully driverless tractor for 4 to 5 decades out.
