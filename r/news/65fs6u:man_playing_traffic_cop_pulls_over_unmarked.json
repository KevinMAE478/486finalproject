Their latest way of getting around this is painting their cars glossy black with ever so slightly visible police markings in like speckle gold. Then they can claim it&amp;#39;s a marked car and everything is all legal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s shady as fuck and I love seeing cops get called on their bullshit and sit there stammering &amp;quot;uh...well..uh...&amp;quot; and obviously you can&amp;#39;t do anything real about it but seeing them squirm when someone knows the actual law is about the best you can get. I&amp;#39;d love to see someone call them on their shady gold paint bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this guy...this guy sounds like he&amp;#39;s got some mental problem and may be dangerous to everyone, not just someone who wants to make sure the cops follow the law just like we all have to. Some people go out and will look for cops doing blatantly illegal things and confront them on video about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guy though, I don&amp;#39;t think those were his intentions. I don&amp;#39;t think he was trying to do anything noble, he&amp;#39;s either got a problem or was out to find someone to harm. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dgag7wv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492272922.0, "created_utc": 1492244122.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fs6u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavp6c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nuuvem_token", "parent_id": "t3_65fs6u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "OP loves farming for easy karma with some old pics.
