Also, it was $11,000 American dollars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also it was for THREE seats, not just 1, and included things like lunch and taxi vouchers.  Thus it was about $3,650 per seat.  I believe that was $1,350 for the first time, and $2,300/ea for when they just cancelled their reservation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So rather than compare United&amp;#39;s US$800 to A$14,600, a more accurate comparison is $800 to $1,350.
