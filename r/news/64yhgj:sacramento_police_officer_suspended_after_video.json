It&amp;#39;s a necessary part of the job, therefore an officer is far more likely to face accusations of violence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Americans are well past taking cops word for it regarding how these instances go.  Video is the only objective set of eyes on the scene, which is why all police encounters must be recorded.  Absent video, we all know this cop would have testa lied his way out of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we have a clear recording of obvious police misconduct.....a crime, yet there is no charge.  Right now, this cop should not be sitting on his couch at home, he should have been put in a position where he has to post bail, just like any of us regular citizens would.  Then let him fight his way through the system like any other US citizen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So to accommodate this and prevent a chilling effect of officers performing their duties, there should be a more lenient investigative phase for police suspected of a crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The investigative phase is over as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, based  on the video evidence.  The PD has already condemned the officer&amp;#39;s actions publicly, suggesting they do not reflect policy....yet there that officer sits, at home, getting paid, not charged, and watching daytime television.  I am far more concerned with the rights of citizens then I am about cops second guessing the use of force.  In fact, I would welcome cops second guessing the use of force....especially when they are talking to someone who they think was guilty of nothing more than jaywalking. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg6hp2p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057256.0, "created_utc": 1492028456.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yhgj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg71hz5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bureaucromancer", "parent_id": "t1_dg6hbco", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Frankly I might even accept this as justifying something along the lines of the current system if they could justify being in any way trustworthy.
