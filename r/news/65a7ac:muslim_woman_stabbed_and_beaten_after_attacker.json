Conversely, Disbelievers say that someone *could* stab themselves, but why would someone who was genuinely stabbed in an assault wait to go to the hospital?\n\nAccording to the article, her arm was cut; she wasn't \"stabbed\" as most people would think of it.  There was some blood, but it didn't appear to be as much as one would expect from a very deep cut, so it's plausible she thought she could deal with it on her own.  This _also_ makes it plausible that the wound was self-inflicted, since it was presumably not severe.
