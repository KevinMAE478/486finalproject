Why had they never awarded it to a woman before? Why never an Indian? Surely many women and Indians have contributed greatly to mathematics. Is it a coincidence that both received the award in 2014, when political correctness increasingly demands equality in things like this? Everyone who has ever won the award of course deserves it, but lots of people make amazing contributions to math, only a maximum of four every year can win the award, so of course it gets political.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also consider: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mbarany.com/FieldsNotices.pdf\"&gt;http://mbarany.com/FieldsNotices.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Put bluntly, with few exceptions the Fields Medal (along with the Wolf and Abel prizes) has been an award for white European and American men. Their educations and careers, with few exceptions, traverse a small collec- tion of elite institutions disproportionately located in the United States and France&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mathpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/08/politics-and-fields-medal.html?m=1\"&gt;http://mathpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/08/politics-and-fields-medal.html?m=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;the prize committee is dominated by mathematicians in fields X,Y, and Z, and that fields X,Y, and Z receive most of the prizes. If these fields are the most important and the most active, then it is natural and appropriate that they dominate both committee and prize, but who decides that this is the case? Various committees have to make these decisions, and we should not be surprised to learn that there is lobbying for various fields of mathematics to be given greater consideration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg4293c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491931921.0, "created_utc": 1491903121.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg41h9h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "larrymoencurly", "parent_id": "t1_dg3xkgf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Again, [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal)?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal\"&gt;Fields Medal&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg41h9h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491929485.0, "created_utc": 1491900685.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3xkgf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CountVonVague", "parent_id": "t1_dg3s696", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hint: the more prestigious the award the less genuine it really is. this applies to every mainstream award", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hint: the more prestigious the award the less genuine it really is. this applies to every mainstream award&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg3xkgf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491918954.0, "created_utc": 1491890154.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3s696", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 109, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zorbiburst", "parent_id": "t1_dg3r4qi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Nobels fake awards\n\nAs if the Peace Prize wasn't already?\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nobels fake awards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if the Peace Prize wasn&amp;#39;t already?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg3s696", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491909692.0, "created_utc": 1491880892.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 109}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nica", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nica", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nica", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4odi6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rafaeliki", "parent_id": "t1_dg4caf0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And even though there have been controversial picks, that doesn't mean they're all bad.

Clinton was basically a republican, and before that it was even more severe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a relief when a change of pace came, and maybe some peace came with it, at least in terms of a body count from war/over-policing/increased science and education funding.  But again, this was all part of the joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real reason was his stance on nukes which culminated in the SMART II treaty.
