Telling someone to suck it up and accept their fate is fine, but does nothing to help the hundreds of thousands of people who will probably (read: definitely) make the same choices they did.

Yelling at people &amp;quot;accept your poor decision-making and move on&amp;quot; does nothing for them, yourself or society. Should a pregnant woman accept responsibility for her baby? Yes, absolutely. But she fucking did that when she got pregnant and had the kid. Do you know what would save taxpayers money? Ensuring she stays healthy so she doesn&amp;#39;t rack up millions in medical bills. Instead, society just looks at her and goes &amp;quot;well, sucks go be you&amp;quot; and wonders why their taxes aren&amp;#39;t alleviating as much debt as they want. We as a culture have become excellent at improving our hindsight and have completely lost all ability to problem-solving or think critically about the world. This isn&amp;#39;t even and issue about empathy, I don&amp;#39;t actually care how that teenager is doing. But if she&amp;#39;s healthy, society has less of a burden to care for, ergo, your precious taxes are saved.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To.put in simpler terms - many of society&amp;#39;s problems can be mitigated with very simple solutions (teaching financial literacy in high school, access to birth control for the poor/rural, etc.) By no means am I saying people shouldn&amp;#39;t take responsibility for their actions. But what were individual problems have largely become societal problems, and these problems can potentially have very easy, cheaper solutions. Telling someone to suck it up and accept their fate is fine, but does nothing to help the hundreds of thousands of people who will probably (read: definitely) make the same choices they did. In order to break the cycle, society has to be proactive in its solutions, and if you care so much about how your taxes will be spent, your interest should lie in breaking this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg5276y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491979651.0, "created_utc": 1491950851.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1319}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tknr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tknr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg55evj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 177, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iScreme", "parent_id": "t1_dg51a46", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nah, that's because her brother is the founder of XE/Blackwater/Academi (They like to change names a lot... wonder why), and those people have done a lot of dirt around the globe, lots of people would love to hurt either of them.
