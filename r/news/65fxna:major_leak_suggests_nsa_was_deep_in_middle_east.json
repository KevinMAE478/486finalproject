They haven't done anything yet with their tools or information.  \n\n\"Other stuff\"? The articles I sent you clearly told us that the NSA and the USA have a long, still *ongoing* history of interfering with foreign elections, foreign governments, foreign economies, etc etc. And during that history both entities clearly made use of both their tools and their information. Anyways. The moment you made your comment about Russia your claims went beyond this \"case\", as you called it. If you can bring up other \"cases\" to make a claim about how the NSA and the USA are allegedly so different from Russia, then why should I not be allowed to point out what the NSA itself actually, contrary to your claims, did and does?\n\n&gt; They haven't done anything yet with their tools or information.\nWe know they collect information constantly but how much they act on is entirely unknown. They could've been looking for a million different things or even analyzing market trends. Who the fuck knows?\n\nThere are examples of them acting on information collected within the last years, and the way they use their tools to hack into stuff belonging to other governments and to corporations of all kinds clearly qualifies as \"doing something with their tools\". Also, you yourself claim not to know what they do, yet you maintain that the NSA has not done anything yet with their tools or information. That is a clear contradiction.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency#Global_surveillance_disclosures\n\n&gt;A dedicated unit of the NSA locates targets for the CIA for extrajudicial assassination in the Middle East.\n\n&gt;The NSA also spies on influential Muslims to obtain information that could be used to discredit them, such as their use of pornography. The targets, both domestic and abroad, are not suspected of any crime but hold religious or political views deemed \"radical\" by the NSA.\n\nDoes not sound like \"having done anything yet with their tools and information\". Meanwhile you keep implying that the NSA, which amasses unprecedent amounts of data on foreign diplomats, foreign leaders, foreign business people, and even random citizens all over the world, while sparing neither expenses nor efforts, that this very NSA does not make ruthless use of the fruits of its labor. Even though it was you who said that organizations like the NSA are \"souless and moral-less beings\". Ridiculous. \n\nAlso, I hope I do not need to tell you about the various ways the data in question here can be used to further the goals of American global hegemony and imperialism.  \n\n&gt;  They could've been looking for a million different things or even analyzing market trends.\n\nYou are talking as if everything is equally as likely. The NSA does not exist since yesterday, and there is no reason to stupidly decontextualize its actions and to ignore its whole history.
