question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question), but it could be an [argument from incredulity](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity)). To \"believe that moral truth exists because without moral truth we can't say that any one thing is good or bad in a consistent manner\" assumes that there is a reason to think we should be able to \"say that any one thing is good or bad in a consistent manner\". I see no reason to do so, logically speaking. Basically, you're using your preferred conclusion to justify your claim. \n\nYou continue with a couple of points that either naively or cynically suggest that moral relativists have strictly binary good/bad moral categories and no capacity for understanding moral degree. Again, you have offered, and I have, no logical reason to accept these claims. Rather, I can tell you without qualification that, as a moral relativist myself, I have no trouble accepting a moral continuum or spectrum.\n\nAt the end of your post, you conflate morals (personal), ethics (social), and justice (law). This is too much to untie, but if there are any laws which offend your moral sensibilities, you can see that your incarceration is only loosely linked to my personal moral framework.

Morality is not a legal consideration.\n\nI think nearly everyone is wrong about nearly everything. Thus, I must consider the possibility that I, too, am wrong about nearly everything. Moral relativism comes easy for me because, from my perspective, there is no way to remove my own relative perspective from my \"objective\" assessments of morality. \n\nFor me, moral absolutism suggests that everyone who ever lived was evil, not because of their specific actions, but merely because they were ignorant of truths later discovered and moral revelations that had not at the time been considered. What we consider morally upright now is likely to be similarly revealed over time to be flawed and incomplete too. Was any early twentieth century German *not* evil? Was any American who lived while slavery was legal not evil? An absolutist should struggle mightily with the dearth of \"good\" people of the past, and, by extension, how they themselves will be considered in the future.\n\nIf you accept that, then moral absolutism, absent some externally imposed (ethical) framework, leads to the conclusion that we are unwittingly evil because we are not omniscient. *That* is a nihilistic way of seeing the world.\n\nMay I ask, are you religious?
