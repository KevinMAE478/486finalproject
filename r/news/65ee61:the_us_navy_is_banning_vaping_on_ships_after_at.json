Mainly because no protection means they can put whatever dumb coil they want on it, and it'll work.\n\nHerein lies the problem. 18650 batteries, the standard sized used in vaping(Also used in most laptops, used in a lot of electric cars etc) are not the problem.\n\nA standard 18650 can handle a constant draw of 20 amps, 40 pulse amps(Brief draw) and some better ones can do upwards of 30/60.\n\nOhms laws shows that V = IR, and I = V/R, and R = V/I. I is current, or amperage.\n\nSo if you have a 1 ohm resistor, which in this case the resistor is the coil itself, at 4 volts what the battery allows, 4/1 = 4 amps. \n\nEasy enough. Power or wattage = V * I so 4*4 = 16 watts.\n\nAnyway for protection regulated mods will not let you use coils that have to low of a ohm rating, or resistance rating for a good reason.\n\nA 0.1 ohm coil, you fire that at 4 volts, you are drawing 4/0.1 = 40 amps.

A mechanical mod is just a button that connects the battery to the coil, no regulation, no protection.\n\nBatteries don't like being forced to draw more then they are rated for.\n\nHowever building a 0.05 or even lower coil is quite easy, and if you don't know what you're doing(Which most people don't) and you don't test your coil with an ohm reader(Which most people don't) they could be putting on coils with lower ratings then 0.1 on a single 18650, drawing a lot more amperage then the thing is rated for. \n\nThen explosions happen. \n\nWorse yet is some of these mechanical mods are completely sealed, so when the batteries begin to off gas, they pressurize the container and become a pressure bomb. \n\nWorse yet in series voltage rises, so two 18650s in series will be 8 volts. 8 / 0.1 = 80 amps. Even worse. \n\nHaving two 18650s in parallel is good however, because voltage stays constant, but now the amperage draw is across two batteries, so while 4 volts 0.1 ohms the draw is 40 amps, it's 20 amps per battery. \n\nIn the end to use a mechanical mod, you need to:\n1.

Test coil daily to see if things change.
