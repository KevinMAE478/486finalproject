Maybe all the busy work is supposed to expose slow learners to more properly written language through books, but when I was a kid one of my limited entertainment options was reading books and as a consequence I was always well above my grade-level in reading. Having to do the busy work to prove I was reading the assigned books completely killed any enjoyment of those books and did little to teach me anything. \n\nUnfortunately, English class appears to have been completely ineffective on a large portion of students. If people actually learned half of what they were supposed to in an semester then the next semester wouldn't have to start with doing the same things over again. Somehow native speakers can make it to college-level English classes with shocking language skills. \n\nMath class needs different treatment. I actually enjoyed math classes (except when I changed schools and the new school was two years behind where I was at the old school), and went to some schools that allowed me to (voluntarily, even) take higher level math classes covering concepts which I actually still use occasionally. However, with the Internet now, most people don't actually need to understand calculus or trigonometry and really only need maybe the most basic algebra, and most of what they would need it for is probably finance anyway so a finance class could cover it. \n\nSimilarly to English classes, math classes also fail a lot of students.
