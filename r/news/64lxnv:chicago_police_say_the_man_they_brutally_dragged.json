She was refused boarding for being in leggings, as per the United dress code (note that this only applies to passengers flying for free/reduced fares as air crew family members, it&amp;#39;s a pretty well-known dress code).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some lady on Twitter in the airport saw this but didn&amp;#39;t know any context, and went on a rant live tweeting how United was removing a tween girl from a flight for being in leggings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;United Twitter, in their infinite wisdom, didn&amp;#39;t clarify the difference in dress codes between revenue and nonrev passengers for multiple hours, instead going back and forth with people online while making no official public statement. Went long enough that other airlines started taking swipes at them online before they clarified what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This led to a debacle of some people thinking United had literally barred a girl from boarding for wearing leggings, some people that knew what had happened and had no issue, and some people that knew what had happened but were concerned about the potentially discriminatory dress code for nonrevs. And of course some people bitching about kids these days not dressing up to fly, or leggings in public in general, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;United PR did an absolutely terrible job though, and we went through the &amp;quot;United is sexist&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;never flying United again&amp;quot;, and so on.
