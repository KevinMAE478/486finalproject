It&amp;#39;s the same reason every time an officer shoots someone. It&amp;#39;s five magic words: they feared for their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police are trained from day one to react to every encounter with fear. They watch videos of officers being killed in routine traffic stops and they have mantras like &amp;quot;At the of the day I go home to my family&amp;quot;. Despite the fact that being a police officer is actually relatively low risk as far as careers go, this is how they&amp;#39;re trained. So then we give them a gun and send them out with this training to react to every situation with fear first. Fear, which is probably the strongest emotion designed to skip rational thought and go straight to response. And we give them that and a gun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg5vjif", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033581.0, "created_utc": 1492004781.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 56}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5nv5h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1505, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RaikerCat", "parent_id": "t3_64wpjm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No one has asked why the police decided to shoot him.
