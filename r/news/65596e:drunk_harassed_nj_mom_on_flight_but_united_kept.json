So, I waited until they closed the door and then I moved back as the guy next to me was starting to get more and more physically ill. I again told the stewardess I was moving because the guy was out of control intoxicated. She then had the audacity to scold me again for trying to move and instead told the man to let her know if he needed anything.......&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then moved to one of the still empty 2 rows with my son. The lady then got on the PA system (!!!!) and used a passive aggressive line like &amp;quot;I would like to thank the passengers for remaining in their seats during take off preparations. Again, please remain in your seats.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then came back to me and asked if there were going to be any issues during this flight and I swear I almost had a Greg Focker/Meet the Parents moment where I was going to get thrown off the plane. I legit called her a lazy pile and a terrible excuse for a human (my anger definitely got the better of me) among some other choice phrases. She gave me some snark replies and then left me alone the rest of the flight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so appalled that I emailed, mailed, and tried calling United customer support. You know what they did? Nothing. They apologized for the experience and said they hoped I would be back............&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all makes sense to me. It&amp;#39;s the status quo. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg7ranw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128110.0, "created_utc": 1492099310.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 162}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65596e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65596e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65596e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8i67y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kippythecaterpillar", "parent_id": "t1_dg8crty", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol yep, theres always that one guy just completely plastered for the 8+hour plane ride\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lol yep, theres always that one guy just completely plastered for the 8+hour plane ride&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg8i67y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492159487.0, "created_utc": 1492130687.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8crty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "the_falconator", "parent_id": "t1_dg84y6l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I thought that too until I got on a flight after a 16 hour overnight lay over on my way back from Europe", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought that too until I got on a flight after a 16 hour overnight lay over on my way back from Europe&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg8crty", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492152191.0, "created_utc": 1492123391.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg84y6l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JAVA_Goons", "parent_id": "t3_65596e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;the man was already intoxicated when he boarded the flight from Newark to Phoenix and needed help from two flight attendants just to make it to his seat next to her\n\nI thought airlines typically denied obviously drunk people from boarding.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the man was already intoxicated when he boarded the flight from Newark to Phoenix and needed help from two flight attendants just to make it to his seat next to her&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought airlines typically denied obviously drunk people from boarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg84y6l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142742.0, "created_utc": 1492113942.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65596e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65596e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8470r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "United_Airlines", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ypte", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh look, the self-loading baggage can *speak* now.
