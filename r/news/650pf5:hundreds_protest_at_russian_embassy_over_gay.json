happened in the US about 50 years ago. Back in the 50's and 60's, you were arrested and sent to either jail or mental hospitals for being \"out\" as a gay person. From the source:\n\n&gt; Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals, their favored establishments, and friends; the U.S. Post Office kept track of addresses where material pertaining to homosexuality was mailed.[14] State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to homosexuals were shut down, and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.[15] **Thousands of gay men and women were publicly humiliated, physically harassed, fired, jailed, or institutionalized in mental hospitals.** Many lived double lives, keeping their private lives secret from their professional ones.\n\ncont.\n\n&gt; Through the 1950s and 1960s, **castration, emetics, hypnosis, electroshock therapy, and lobotomies** were used by psychiatrists to try to \"cure\" homosexuals.\n\n^ These extreme methods obviously didn't work. All of which eventually led to people being fed up and literally fighting for their rights just so they can live like normal human beings. They gathered and marched, fully knowing that they will be thrown into jail.\n\n**Wait, that's not all.**\n-\nIn some countries even to this day, gay people face not just discrimination, but also death.[ This source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory) shows you a map of exactly all the countries where gays aren't even allowed to live, **facing death penalty**. They wouldn't even be able to fight for their lives, because that would mean death for them.\n\nLook, I know these aren't major concerns for you and I'm not asking you to understand them nor how they feel. However, please do understand that they are human, just like you.

Back in the 50&amp;#39;s and 60&amp;#39;s, you were arrested and sent to either jail or mental hospitals for being &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; as a gay person. From the source:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals, their favored establishments, and friends; the U.S. Post Office kept track of addresses where material pertaining to homosexuality was mailed.[14] State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to homosexuals were shut down, and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed &amp;quot;sweeps&amp;quot; to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.[15] &lt;strong&gt;Thousands of gay men and women were publicly humiliated, physically harassed, fired, jailed, or institutionalized in mental hospitals.&lt;/strong&gt; Many lived double lives, keeping their private lives secret from their professional ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;cont.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through the 1950s and 1960s, &lt;strong&gt;castration, emetics, hypnosis, electroshock therapy, and lobotomies&lt;/strong&gt; were used by psychiatrists to try to &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;^ These extreme methods obviously didn&amp;#39;t work. All of which eventually led to people being fed up and literally fighting for their rights just so they can live like normal human beings. They gathered and marched, fully knowing that they will be thrown into jail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, that&amp;#39;s not all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some countries even to this day, gay people face not just discrimination, but also death.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory\"&gt; This source&lt;/a&gt; shows you a map of exactly all the countries where gays aren&amp;#39;t even allowed to live, &lt;strong&gt;facing death penalty&lt;/strong&gt;. They wouldn&amp;#39;t even be able to fight for their lives, because that would mean death for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I know these aren&amp;#39;t major concerns for you and I&amp;#39;m not asking you to understand them nor how they feel.
