I know the story about if the United employees didn&amp;#39;t make the flight, they would&amp;#39;ve had to cancel another flight in Louisville (I think), and would&amp;#39;ve had to deal with a whole flight of angry customers instead of 4 from the Chicago flight.  But that was because of a policy instituted by United, and because of that, they needed to make amends to correct it.  And the proper way to do that was to keep raising the amount for someone to give up their seat (and maybe throw in extra perks too) until someone did.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg5r1lv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492026084.0, "created_utc": 1491997284.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vlt8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vlt8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vlt8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vlt8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vlt8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vlt8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6btf5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Goodkat203", "parent_id": "t1_dg68llt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Just because something is legal doesn't mean it ought to be legal.\n\nTHANK YOU!

This myth that passengers don't have rights needs to go away, ASAP. You are dead wrong when saying that United legally kicked him off the plane.\nFirst of all, it's airline spin to call this an overbooking. The statutory provision granting them the ability to deny boarding is about \"OVERSALES\", specifically defines as booking more reserved confirmed seats than there are available. This is not what happened. They did not overbook the flight; they had a fully booked flight, and not only did everyone already have a reserved confirmed seat, they were all sitting in them. The law allowing them to denying boarding in the event of an oversale does not apply.\nEven if it did apply, the law is unambiguously clear that airlines have to give preference to everyone with reserved confirmed seats when choosing to involuntarily deny boarding. They have to always choose the solution that will affect the least amount of reserved confirmed seats. This rule is straightforward, and United makes very clear in their own contract of carriage that employees of their own or of other carriers may be denied boarding without compensation because they do not have reserved confirmed seats.

Their contract of carriage highlights there is a complete difference in rights after you've boarded and sat on the plane, and Rule 21 goes over the specific scenarios where you could get kicked off.
