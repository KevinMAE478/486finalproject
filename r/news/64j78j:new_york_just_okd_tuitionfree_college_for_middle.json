Take, for instance, [this graph](http://imgur.com/p4zAhR2) [(source)](http://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_snapshots_20051012/) showing \n\n&gt; . . . great disparities in college completion based on socioeconomic status.  The worst scoring students from high SES families complete college as frequently as the best students from low SES families.  Only 29% of high-achieving kids belonging to the lowest SES quartile obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree, compared to 74% of high-achieving kids in the top SES quartile. This success rate for high-aptitude poor students (29%) is less than the success rate for students with the lowest aptitude from the top SES families.  Of these well-off but less academically meritorious students, 30% completed a bachelor\u2019s degree even though they had scored in the bottom quartile in 8th grade math. \n\nIt is clear, then, that for nearly all low-income students, finishing college is merely a pipe dream, something that they will never be able to do by virtue of their families low income.  In many parts of the United States this is a huge problem, because average household income has actually decreased against inflation rates in the last 10 years [(source)](https://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nabes/).  Further, many low-income students perform worse at the middle and high-school level in standardized testing because they attend schools whose lack of funding mirrors that of their students.  This makes it difficult for them to attain merit-based scholarship (this is important to this case, because New York's program is a \"last dollar\" program, where the state only pays for tuition costs not covered by federal money such as Pell Grants).  Therefore, this program becomes even more helpful for low-income students, who have a hard time as it is graduating from college for a number of reasons.  \n\nAs an aside, I absolutely do not agree with your final argument, that \"This plan just creates perverse incentives for people to lower their salary or get divorced to save money\".  I sincerely believe that the majority of people don't view their marriage in such stark economic terms only, and that if two people in a family making more than $125,000 were to divorce over $4,000 per year for the education of their children, then they probably had deeper problems to begin with.  \n\nFinally, I would argue that there is a problem with the way people look at issues like this.  It isn't meant to be a plan to help everyone pay for college regardless of income.  In fact, by limiting the program to state and community colleges only it specifically blocks out the majority of high and high-middle income families, who by and large send their children to private schools.  What this program does, though, is make it significantly easier for those who are not able to pay for college at all to attend.  Many students in low-income families recognize very early on that college isn't an option to them, and this affects their participation in math and science classes as early as the 6th grade, so this program opens the door to people for whom there wouldn't have been even a cracked open window before.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I do feel that this system isn&amp;#39;t perfect, I want to make that clear, but there are a few things that are important to keep in mind.

Further, many low-income students perform worse at the middle and high-school level in standardized testing because they attend schools whose lack of funding mirrors that of their students.  This makes it difficult for them to attain merit-based scholarship (this is important to this case, because New York&amp;#39;s program is a &amp;quot;last dollar&amp;quot; program, where the state only pays for tuition costs not covered by federal money such as Pell Grants).  Therefore, this program becomes even more helpful for low-income students, who have a hard time as it is graduating from college for a number of reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I absolutely do not agree with your final argument, that &amp;quot;This plan just creates perverse incentives for people to lower their salary or get divorced to save money&amp;quot;.  I sincerely believe that the majority of people don&amp;#39;t view their marriage in such stark economic terms only, and that if two people in a family making more than $125,000 were to divorce over $4,000 per year for the education of their children, then they probably had deeper problems to begin with.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would argue that there is a problem with the way people look at issues like this.  It isn&amp;#39;t meant to be a plan to help everyone pay for college regardless of income.  In fact, by limiting the program to state and community colleges only it specifically blocks out the majority of high and high-middle income families, who by and large send their children to private schools.  What this program does, though, is make it significantly easier for those who are not able to pay for college at all to attend.  Many students in low-income families recognize very early on that college isn&amp;#39;t an option to them, and this affects their participation in math and science classes as early as the 6th grade, so this program opens the door to people for whom there wouldn&amp;#39;t have been even a cracked open window before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg2ydpc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491874949.0, "created_utc": 1491846149.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64j78j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3wx6n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SWIMsfriend", "parent_id": "t1_dg2vdm1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; $125,000 in NYC is $90,000 after taxes. \n\nno one told you to live there. you should have realized back in november that the governments give way more of a shit about people that don't live in cities compared to ones that do.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$125,000 in NYC is $90,000 after taxes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;no one told you to live there. you should have realized back in november that the governments give way more of a shit about people that don&amp;#39;t live in cities compared to ones that do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dg3wx6n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491917587.0, "created_utc": 1491888787.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2vdm1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TexasLonghornz", "parent_id": "t1_dg2ul8z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "$125,000 in NYC is $90,000 after taxes.
