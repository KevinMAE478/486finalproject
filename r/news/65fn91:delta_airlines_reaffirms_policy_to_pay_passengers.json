I was part of Delta&amp;#39;s debacle last week where they cancelled 4000 flights, by 6 pm everything around Atlanta was gone. They had my plane sitting at the gate from noon until 8pm but didn&amp;#39;t have enough attendants to fly, by the time they cancelled it at 8 I had no options, even if I waited in line until midnight at that point no hotel would have magically sprang up, slept in the airport and got a bus out the next morning because they had no flight for me for three more days. I&amp;#39;m still waiting for them to refund me the flight they cancelled.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these major airlines are trash&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dgakydw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492287197.0, "created_utc": 1492258397.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fn91", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fn91", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fn91", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb3r0p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "promonk", "parent_id": "t1_dgapolu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Or an RPG fan.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or an RPG fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dgb3r0p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315637.0, "created_utc": 1492286837.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgapolu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dgaal3j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "name": "t1_dgapolu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296191.0, "created_utc": 1492267391.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaal3j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SalesyMcSellerson", "parent_id": "t1_dga9akh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I'm glad I did what I did because by the time I had gotten a voucher, I wouldn't have had time to get a hotel.

I can see how denied boarding is exactly like slavery. /s\n\n&gt;&gt;At this point the passenger is in the process of committing multiple felonies. \n&gt;\n&gt;You link is to a post talking about the Jurisdictional Venue for Violating Aircraft Regulation,  for the most part though I believe you are implying a person would be in violation of [49 U.S. Code \u00a7 46504 - Interference with flight crew members and attendants](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46504) which says (in part)\n&gt;&gt;An individual on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States who, **by assaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant** of the aircraft, interferes with the performance of the duties of the member or attendant or lessens the ability of the member or attendant to perform those duties, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.\n&gt;\n&gt;I am not aware of any judge that would say sitting quietly in your seat talking to your lawyer is \"assaulting or intimidating\" as required under the law\n\nI can admit when wrong. The individual could be assess a civil fine not to be greater than $25,000.\n\nDoesn't mean that passenger was going to Louisville on that flight though. It would have been just as easy to have the passengers to deplane for whatever reason then restart the \"boarding\" process.\n\n&gt;Stick to flying because the law you know nothing about sir.\n\nI know what I am allowed to do without getting fired.\n\n&gt;Again we must consult the law, because \"Overbooking\" under the law, and FAA regulations has a specific meaning,  my understanding of that meaning is that requires there to be more tickets sold and seats,  Employee travel like that is not, legally, considered overbooking.  United has even stated publicly this **was not** an overbooking situation,  while that is what the gate agents told the passengers on the plane, that does not match reality.  To a Captain,  Flight Attendants, and Gate Agents, it may be \"over booking\" because there are more people that need to be on the plane that seats, however to the **LAW** it is not.  We are discussing the **LAW** so how the law and regulations see it is all that matters. \n\nThe waters are muddy on this.

This man was a doctor with patients. Instead of trying to force him off or your technique of shaming him off --- and shame on you --- they should have at least gone to the maximum amount they are legally required to offer to anyone who would take it. Not try to force or shame a medical doctor who was on his way to treat patients. \n\n3. That maximum is just the federally required maximum. Doesn't mean the airline can't choose to go higher.

We have offered them $1000 and a first class booking on the next flight (he was offered this). Unfortunately the individual is still refusing to de plane.

Instead of trying to force him off or your technique of shaming him off --- and shame on you --- they should have at least gone to the maximum amount they are legally required to offer to anyone who would take it. Not try to force or shame a medical doctor who was on his way to treat patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That maximum is just the federally required maximum.
