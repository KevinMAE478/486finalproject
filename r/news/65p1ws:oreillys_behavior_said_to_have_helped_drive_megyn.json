She left the network to join NBC. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\nLast fall, in the weeks after 21st Century Fox struck settlements with two women who said that Bill O\u2019Reilly had sexually harassed them, the Fox News host went on morning television and offered a harsh assessment of women who had come forward with complaints about the network.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s open season,\u201d he said, visibly irritated, when asked about a recently published book by Megyn Kelly, his colleague at the time. In the book, Ms. Kelly provided an account of being sexually harassed by Roger Ailes, the network\u2019s former chairman. Later Mr. O\u2019Reilly added, \u201cLet\u2019s whack the Fox News Channel. I\u2019ve had enough of it. It\u2019s a good place to work. All right?\u201d\n\nThe comments set off a media firestorm and frustrated Ms. Kelly, who sent an email to Fox News executives complaining about his behavior and the chilling effect it could have on women at the company and beyond, according to four people with knowledge of the email who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nDespite Ms. Kelly\u2019s complaint, and a plea from a producer that Mr. O\u2019Reilly not be allowed to make similar remarks on his prime-time show, Mr. O\u2019Reilly delivered a second public scolding on the program that night.\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave,\u201d he said.\n\nThat experience, along with a deep skepticism about whether the network was truly committed to changing its culture after Mr. Ailes was forced out, was a factor in Ms. Kelly\u2019s decision to leave Fox News for a new role at NBC News, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nHer departure was a major blow to Fox News. Ms. Kelly was viewed as the network\u2019s star of the future, and the Murdoch family, which controls 21st Century Fox, Fox News\u2019s parent company, was prepared to pay her more than $20 million a year.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox News and Ms. Kelly declined to comment. Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Ailes have both denied the allegations against them.\n\nMarc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. O\u2019Reilly, said in a statement: \u201cMr. O\u2019Reilly cannot comment on what Megyn Kelly thought, or did or did not do, except to say she never raised any such issue with him, nor did anyone else. At this time, it is apparent to any objective observer that Mr. O\u2019Reilly is being subjected to a malicious campaign intent on harming his reputation and family through speculation and innuendo.\u201d\n\nThe revelations about Ms. Kelly\u2019s complaints regarding Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior come in the wake of a New York Times investigation that found that five women had reached settlements totaling about $13 million after making allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior against Mr. O\u2019Reilly.\n\nSince The Times published its report, more than 50 advertisers have pulled their spots from his show, and women\u2019s and civil rights groups have called for Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s dismissal.\n\nMr. O\u2019Reilly is on vacation while the Murdoch family considers his future at the network. In making their decision, the Murdochs are awaiting the results of an investigation into Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.\n\nThat inquiry began with an examination into complaints made by Wendy Walsh, a former guest on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d and was expected to expand if other issues arose.\n\nOn Thursday, a former Fox News employee contacted Paul Weiss to report having witnessed an episode in 2002 when Mr. O\u2019Reilly stormed into the newsroom and berated a producer, which led to one of the five settlements reported by The Times. The former employee spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution within the television industry.\n\nMr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show has continued to earn strong ratings and he has support among some people at the company, but some employees at Fox News and 21st Century Fox have expressed frustration that the Murdochs have continued to stand by him. Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s contract with Fox News was extended even as the company was aware of several settlements that had been reached with women who had complained about his behavior.\n\nEboni K. Williams, a Fox News contributor who appears weekly on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, said in an interview that she had not been harassed by Mr. O\u2019Reilly or anyone else at Fox News but that women at the network were under a \u201creal cloud of suspicion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe narratives at this point are either: A, you are suffering in silence, or B, your otherwise silent stance on the issues is some type of tacit compliance to wrongdoing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, neither of those are true.\u201d\n\nMs. Williams said that she had met with the top human resources executive at Fox News last week with suggestions about how to make it easier for women to report problems.\n\n\u201cWe just want to do our jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Kelly\u2019s frustrations with Fox News intensified on the morning of Nov. 15, when Mr. O\u2019Reilly appeared on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to promote \u201cGive Please a Chance,\u201d his new children\u2019s book about manners. Norah O\u2019Donnell, one of the show\u2019s hosts, asked Mr. O\u2019Reilly about Ms. Kelly\u2019s book, which had been published that day and included sexual harassment accusations against Mr. Ailes. Mr. O\u2019Reilly said he wasn\u2019t \u201cinterested.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not interested in sexual harassment?\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell asked.\n\n\u201cI am not interested in basically litigating something that is finished that makes my network look bad,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly responded.\n\nShortly after hearing those comments, Ms. Kelly sent her email to Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine, who had recently been named the co-presidents of Fox News. In the email, Ms. Kelly said that Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s comments on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d were in bad form, according to the people with knowledge of the email who described its contents to The Times.\n\nMs. Kelly said that a man with Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s history had no business publicly lecturing women inside or outside the company about sexual harassment, the people said. (In a highly publicized 2004 dispute, Mr. O\u2019Reilly had settled sexual harassment allegations made by a young producer for about $9 million.)\n\nMs. Kelly added in the email that the push for blind loyalty was the reason the network had gotten into the mess with Mr. Ailes. Several people at the network became aware of the email.\n\nLater that day, a producer on Ms. Kelly\u2019s show learned that Mr. O\u2019Reilly planned to revisit the issue during his show\u2019s \u201cTip of the Day\u201d segment, according to some of the people familiar with the episode. The producer called Mr. Shine, urging him to pull the segment, the people said.\n\nThat did not happen.\n\nOn his show that evening, Mr. O\u2019Reilly played a clip of his appearance on CBS, stating he \u201cwas not amused\u201d when \u201cthe conversation shifted to some problems the Fox News Channel had earlier this year.\u201d He then delivered his rebuke again.\n\nOn her own show, broadcast live in the next hour that night, Ms. Kelly did not mention Mr. O\u2019Reilly or the comments he had made. She did talk about her book, which included a chapter on sexual harassment and the issues at Fox News, and which had the approval of her bosses.\n\n\u201cLike me,\u201d she said, \u201cthey believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant \n\n\n\n*****I think I got the whole thing copied********\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megyn Kelly in 2016 while she was still at Fox News.
