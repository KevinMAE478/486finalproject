The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Munoz to memorialize the terms of his employment as President and CEO of the Company. As described above, the compensation, benefits, terms and conditions of the employment agreement were approved by the Compensation Committee after consideration of Mr. Munoz's compensation at his prior employer, including forfeited compensation and prospective incentive opportunities; the benchmarking analysis of the peer group; general succession planning processes within the Company; and guidance and input from Exequity. In consideration of his commencement of employment, and in part to compensate him for incentive and equity compensation forfeited at his prior employer, the agreement provided him a sign-on cash payment of $5.2 million and an initial equity award (granted in 2016) with a grant date value of $6.8 million, vesting over a three year period. Mr. Munoz's sign-on cash payment is subject to repayment if he is terminated for cause or resigns without good reason within the first year of his employment. The agreement also provides an annual base salary of $1,250,000 and, beginning in 2016, Mr. Munoz is eligible to participate in the Company's annual cash bonus program, with a target annual bonus not less than 200% of his annual base salary. Also beginning in 2016, the Company will provide Mr. Munoz an annual long-term incentive award with a grant date value of at least $10.5 million. However, Mr. Munoz is not eligible to receive a long-term incentive award for calendar year 2016 until he has been in continuous active service as President and Chief Executive Officer for a period of six months.

On April 19, 2016, Mr. Munoz, the Company and United Airlines entered into an amendment to the employment agreement. The amendment, which was initiated by Mr. Munoz, provides, among other things, that it is the Company's expectation that Mr. Munoz will be appointed Chairman of the Board at the Company's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, and the amendment modifies the definition of \"Good Reason\" such that the appointment of Robert A.

Upon separation, Mr. Munoz retains lifetime flight benefits and a related tax indemnification, which\nbenefits he retains from his service as a non-employee director of the Company.
