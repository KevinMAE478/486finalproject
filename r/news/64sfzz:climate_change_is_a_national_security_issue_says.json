Do you think they would wipe out existing infrastructure and significantly impact the world population of 7 billion? That would be an impressive killing spree. So, they are not that big a threat to human civilization. Humans would still exist and so would civilization.\n\nPC culture, last I checked, is also not responsible for any mega genocides or nuking of large cities worldwide. So again, not much of a threat to human civilization.\n\nOn the other hand, if climate change continues on it's current path, there are likely to be water shortages worldwide. Hence the idea of future \"water wars.\" \n\nCrops, livestock and people are pretty reliant on water. \n\nAlso, have you seen any pictures of [Miami at high tide](http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20160405-flooding-accelerated-sealevel-rise-in-miami-over-last-decade) on a sunny day lately? It ain't pretty. [Big cities all up and down the coast](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/04/science/global-warming-increases-nuisance-flooding.html) are starting to have problems at high tide and it's only going to get worse. For coastal cities all over the globe. I imagine people will hustle to save those cities, but that flooding is a bigger threat to infrastructure worldwide than Radical Islamic Terror ever will be.\n\nLike Zika? West Nile? Lyme Disease? They're all getting a nice boost from climate change. The bugs that carry them didn't used to be able to survive the weather in areas they've moved into. More of that to come, as well. Humans and incurable diseases don't play well together.\n\nAnd I hope you don't like seafood.
