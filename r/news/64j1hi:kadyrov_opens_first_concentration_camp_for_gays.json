L.

If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .\n\n&gt;And that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .\n\n&gt;So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Hunter S.

San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \u201chistory\u201d it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time\u2014and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder&amp;#39;s jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2015 Hunter S.

The rest of my post is pretty much irrelevant at this point, but I will leave it up as some may find it informative.* \n\nI was raised in Chechnya, and although I love the culture overall, there are some parts of it that are really messed up.\n\n\nThere are no \"gay Chechens\" because no gay person will ever come out of the closet IN Chechnya, and even if they do come out in a different country, they will still hide it from their families. \n\nIn Chechnya, a nail that sticks out will get hammered back in. What makes it especially difficult to stick out in Chechnya is that it's not just your immediate family you need to worry about. Anything you do is a reflection of your immediate family, which in turn is a reflection of your extended family, which in turn is a reflection of your clan, which is also a reflection of your city/village, and a reflection of the nation as a whole. It's trickle down economics of shame, where the more serious the deviation from the norm, the bigger the sphere of people who have a claim over you because you are shaming them. For example, there was some guy on a reality TV show in Russia claiming that he had slept with a Chechen girl on a vacation in Cabo or something. It took less than a month for a YouTube video to pop-up with the bloodied guy retracting his statement, saying that he had lied and had never touched a Chechen woman. Why? Because what he had said was deemed to have shamed the nation- \"no Chechen woman would sleep around like that!\"\n\nNow, going back to being gay. A publicly gay Chechen is a unicorn. In a society where your elders' words trump any law and dictates your life, being gay is a violation of traditions. \"Neither my grandfather nor my seventh forefather was X, and neither will be you\" is a typical approach to everything. Families will take care of their problems privately, and no one will ever so much as dare to snitch.\n\nBack to why this article is bullshit. Killing a gay Chechen is still killing someone's family member and will trigger a blood feud that will last until the debt in blood is repaid. You had people getting shot in the street in retaliation for what was done a century ago and such, and it is still \"normal.\" Anyone involved in such murders will get his entire family marked for retaliation, and even dying from old age will not resolve it until someone from the murderer's family is killed, eventually. \n\nNonconformity with traditions gets resolved on the family level. If you are gay, your family will likely marry you off immediately, have you have kids, and forget about you being gay because that is what had always been done. If you decide to be rebellious and want to live a publicly gay life, your family will bury you. Similarly, if you are a drug addict, they will give you an opportunity to clean up. If you fail to conform, they will bury you. Not even being the President's brother will save you- Kadyrov's junkie brother was buried by his own family, it's a bit of an open secret in Chechnya. \n\nEdit: Look, I am not defending this practice as what I have described is a lot harsher, in my opinion, than the article about the alleged concentration camp. If Ramzan Kadyrov wants you gone, you better believe he would not need a concentration camp to achieve this purpose.
