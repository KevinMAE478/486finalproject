We know that hobbits grow potatoes, carrots, and cabbages. Hobbits are more or less based on the England of Tolkien&amp;#39;s youth, or the period before that. How about pork tenderloin (don&amp;#39;t overcook!) with mushroom sauce, accompanied by boiled or mashed potatoes and carrots? We ate that a lot when I was a kid (Dutch, not English, but the potato-meat-vegetable combo is quite common of course in large parts of Europe). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Conspiracy chapter it is mentioned that hobbits really love mushrooms.
