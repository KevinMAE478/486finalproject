'speak!\nTell us where you have hidden our friends! What have you done with them?\nSpeak, or I will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard\nto deal with!'\n\n&gt; The old man was too quick for him.

He\nlifted up his staff, and Gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on\nthe ground. The sword of Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a\nsudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air:\nit vanished in a flash of flame.\n\n&gt; 'Mithrandir!' he cried. 'Mithrandir!'\n\n 'Well met, I say to you again. Legolas!' said the old man.\n They all gazed at him. His hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and\ngleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright,\npiercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy,\nand fear they stood and found no words to say.\n\nHe immediately responds to the name Mithrandir. But then:\n\n&gt; At last Aragorn stirred. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'Beyond all hope you return\nto us in our need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf!' Gimli said nothing,\nhut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.\n\n 'Gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long\ndisused word. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.'\n\n He stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it\nabout him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in cloud\nagain. 'Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,' he said, and the voice was the\nvoice of their old friend and guide. 'Get up, my good Gimli! No blame to you,\nand no harm done to me. Indeed my friends, none of you have any weapon that\ncould hurt me. Be merry! We meet again. At the turn of the tide. The great\nstorm is coming, but the tide has turned.'\n\nOk, his reaction to 'Gandalf' is strange. But the Elves in Lothl\u00f3rien would have called him Mithrandir instead of Gandalf. Ok...\n\n&gt; He laid his hand on Gimli's head, and the Dwarf looked up and laughed\nsuddenly. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'But you are all in white!'\n\n 'Yes, I am white now,' said Gandalf. 'Indeed I _am_ Saruman, one might\nalmost say, Saruman as he should have been. But come now, tell me of\nyourselves! I have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. I have\nforgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had\nforgotten. I can see many things far off, but many things that are close at\nhand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!'\n\nSo he has forgotten much, and seen things far off. Hm. There are a few instances where Gandalf the White seems to see things in a supernatural way, 'with the sight that was given to him' he saw all that happened at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields for example, the things that happened when he was dealing with Denethor in Rath D\u00ednen. \n\nNow why would Gandalf seem so confused that he doesn't know his name? Well, there are several things that happened. He had a 10 day fight with the Balrog, then he died and his soul left Creation altogether: \n\n&gt;  I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high place and\nbroke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin. Then darkness took me;\nand I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will\nnot tell.\n\nOut of thought and time. And then he was sent back by Eru (God).  But there is also something else that happens: \n\n&gt;  The Ring now has passed beyond my\nhelp, or the help of any of the Company that set out from Rivendell. Very\nnearly it was revealed to the Enemy, but it escaped. I had some part in that:\nfor I sat in a high place, and I strove with the Dark Tower; and the Shadow\npassed. Then I was weary, very weary; and I walked long in dark thought.'\n\nWhen Frodo was on Amon Hen, wearing the Ring, and nearly discovered by Sauron, Gandalf apparently struggled with Sauron (he was the Voice that Frodo heard when he felt the Eye at Amon Hen). We know that for example Aragorn and Denethor are strongly affected when they meet Sauron through a palant\u00edr.\n\nGandalf also talks about meeting Treebeard:\n\n&gt;  I saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and I\nthink he saw me, for he paused; but I did not speak, for I was heavy with\nthought, and weary after my struggle with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not\nspeak either, nor call my name.\n\nSo Gandalf may have forgotten some stuff about his life as an incarnation of an old man rather than the primeval Maia spirit that he is. Because 'Gandalf' wasn't his original identitity and body anyway. And of course he went through an enormous ordeal: Balrog, death, yanked out of Creation altogether, sent back to his broken body on the mountain top, lying there for days while hearing the sorrows of the world, getting healed in Lothl\u00f3rien, and going after the Fellowship at good speed, and struggling with Sauron from a distance. \n\nMost (all?) of the quotes here are from the chapter The White Rider, one of the most interesting chapters of LotR in my opinion.

We know that for example Aragorn and Denethor are strongly affected when they meet Sauron through a palant\u00edr.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gandalf also talks about meeting Treebeard:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and I\nthink he saw me, for he paused; but I did not speak, for I was heavy with\nthought, and weary after my struggle with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not\nspeak either, nor call my name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Gandalf may have forgotten some stuff about his life as an incarnation of an old man rather than the primeval Maia spirit that he is. Because &amp;#39;Gandalf&amp;#39; wasn&amp;#39;t his original identitity and body anyway. And of course he went through an enormous ordeal: Balrog, death, yanked out of Creation altogether, sent back to his broken body on the mountain top, lying there for days while hearing the sorrows of the world, getting healed in Lothl\u00f3rien, and going after the Fellowship at good speed, and struggling with Sauron from a distance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most (all?) of the quotes here are from the chapter The White Rider, one of the most interesting chapters of LotR in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lotr", "name": "t1_dg6edw2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492053860.0, "created_utc": 1492025060.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t4mr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t4mr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t4mr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t4mr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6yomv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheBratPrince1760", "parent_id": "t1_dg6xoq1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lotr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm hoping to eventually read more of Tolkin's work when I get the money to get more books ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping to eventually read more of Tolkin&amp;#39;s work when I get the money to get more books &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lotr", "name": "t1_dg6yomv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077606.0, "created_utc": 1492048806.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6xoq1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bigwillyb123", "parent_id": "t1_dg6q17c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lotr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you wanna expand your mind more, you can read a tiny bit about the two Blue Wizards as well, along with Radaghast the Brown (whose mission *may* have been different)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wanna expand your mind more, you can read a tiny bit about the two Blue Wizards as well, along with Radaghast the Brown (whose mission &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have been different)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "lotr", "name": "t1_dg6xoq1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492076366.0, "created_utc": 1492047566.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6q17c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheBratPrince1760", "parent_id": "t1_dg6pksx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lotr", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I appreciate your simple answer just as much ad the detailed ones I'm just really bad about responding on here.
