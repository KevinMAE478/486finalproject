I believe he was under the impression that, if the item was described as a gift, no import duty would be charged. I knew that wouldn't work and I told him so, but he didn't believe me; he insisted that it be shipped with that description. I also believe it wasn't really a gift; he had been conned into selling the item to someone in Britain, and he thought he was helping to scam the British government out of its import duty, but in fact he was being scammed himself.

The student came back to the window and complained that he shouldn't have to pay it. I showed him the form he had signed where he promised to pay the duty, if any was applicable.
