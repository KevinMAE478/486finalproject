It&amp;#39;s likely the US would just bomb to dust the ruling gov&amp;#39;t, any significant military infrastructure (they do have some) and anyone loyal to the Kim regime from Navy ships and drones, and China &amp;amp; South Korea would move in and/or start accepting refugees, and the N Koreans would see what the outside world is like and the brainwashing of the Kim regime would begin to recede. All it would take is to remove the evil dictatorship currently in place and help the people to see what is happening to them, and how much better their lives would be if they were allowed to choose their own government.
