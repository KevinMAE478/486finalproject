Current scientific evidence finds very little to no credible link between salt and blood pressure. We have trained ourselves *not* to use literally the most powerful taste enhancing substance. \n\nWhile we're talking about salt, let's talk about other spices and seasonings. Most home cooks will use bottles of dried things for spices, if they use anything at all. Fresh is (usually, with exceptions) better and very few people use enough of any given herb to keep it on hand all the time.\n\nRestaurants are not afraid to use a bunch of fat. You are evolved to want it, and we also trained ourselves out of using a lot of it. I choose to restrict carbs. So, I skip bread/pasta/etc for most meals and choose to have more fat instead. This makes my food (and restuarant food) taste better. To a point, obviously. Oily food is gross.\n\nOther spices. Can you name a few powdered spices that work well with a hamburger? On a salad? With something tomato based? Most cooks can't. You may throw in some parsley, some basil, some pepper and call it a day. What about a hint of cumin, fenugreek, clove, or cardamom? Restaurants not only often have fresher spices, but more *of* them. The wider variety of tastes makes things taste novel and therefore often better.\n\nThe actual foods you are eating will often be fresher as well. Restaurants rarely stock more than a day or two of various things (again, lots of exceptions) at a time. You may be keeping some things in your pantry and fridge for a week or two, or even more. Fresher = often more taste = tastes better.\n\nAlso, just plain old regular skill and practice. Spend months making the same damn thing a thousand times, tinkering with it all the time, and you'll find a lot of ways to make it better. Or, with big chain restaurants, some person spent months making a recipe \"perfect\" (for the restaurants specifications) and replicatable. You're tasting experience. \n\nLastly, sometimes the ingredients they use may be novel/different than what you're using at home.

Places like Jimmy Johns will typically buy from a few distributors that can deliver consistency. Giant chains want something to be the same everywhere, whereas your random pack-o-grocery-store-ham cares a lot less about making every single pack identical.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As others have pointed out: fat, sugar and salt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Home cooks have been trained (wrongly) that salt is bad for you. Current scientific evidence finds very little to no credible link between salt and blood pressure. We have trained ourselves &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use literally the most powerful taste enhancing substance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#39;re talking about salt, let&amp;#39;s talk about other spices and seasonings. Most home cooks will use bottles of dried things for spices, if they use anything at all. Fresh is (usually, with exceptions) better and very few people use enough of any given herb to keep it on hand all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Restaurants are not afraid to use a bunch of fat. You are evolved to want it, and we also trained ourselves out of using a lot of it. I choose to restrict carbs. So, I skip bread/pasta/etc for most meals and choose to have more fat instead. This makes my food (and restuarant food) taste better. To a point, obviously. Oily food is gross.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other spices. Can you name a few powdered spices that work well with a hamburger? On a salad? With something tomato based? Most cooks can&amp;#39;t. You may throw in some parsley, some basil, some pepper and call it a day. What about a hint of cumin, fenugreek, clove, or cardamom? Restaurants not only often have fresher spices, but more &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; them. The wider variety of tastes makes things taste novel and therefore often better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual foods you are eating will often be fresher as well. Restaurants rarely stock more than a day or two of various things (again, lots of exceptions) at a time. You may be keeping some things in your pantry and fridge for a week or two, or even more. Fresher = often more taste = tastes better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, just plain old regular skill and practice. Spend months making the same damn thing a thousand times, tinkering with it all the time, and you&amp;#39;ll find a lot of ways to make it better. Or, with big chain restaurants, some person spent months making a recipe &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; (for the restaurants specifications) and replicatable. You&amp;#39;re tasting experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, sometimes the ingredients they use may be novel/different than what you&amp;#39;re using at home.
