And I had a lot of friends whose parents didn&amp;#39;t seem to care either. We had no shortage of booze. We had to scrape up the ends ourselves but we had, parents, aunts, uncles, and some friends or cousins over 21 to buy for us. I had a 23 year old gf at age of 16. And when no one was willing to buy or around, we had neighborhood bootleggers. 36 bucks for a 12 pack of Bud. Ouch! But it&amp;#39;s how we did it. I am in no way trying to brag about anything here. I&amp;#39;m 39 now and that was a long time ago. I&amp;#39;m a parent now and wouldn&amp;#39;t ever let my kids do 1/4 of the shit I did as a kid. Just saying kids drank and did it often in my day. And this is how we did it. Our keg parties were just drink tests. We didn&amp;#39;t do keg stands or anything wild. Just beer, liquor, and usually some Metallica or Slayer or Pantera. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgot to add.

Keg parties were fairly common for kids from 16 year old through their early 20's. The number of kegs really depends on the number of people and the money available. In the US the Keg sizes are probably a bit different. Check out this site: https://learn.kegerator.com/keg-sizes/\n\nParty planning was always a pain. If it was to be a drunken boys night, a gallon of beer plus distilled spirits for shots was not uncommon in my peer group. Planning for parties financially was even trickier. We usually ended up spending about $5-10/gallon as I recall.\n\nThe parties were often mildly similar to some of what a few movies represent. Idiots standing around holding plastic cups of rapidly warming beer. A few idiots working hard to get plastered by chugging beer. Fewer really attractive people. More stale beer smell as the evening progresses.\n\nSo for me at least, keg parties happened frequently. Kegs were a cheap way to get lots of people drunk.
