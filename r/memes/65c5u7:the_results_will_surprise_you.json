If there was ever a time when Germany could have won, it was then, when they had their best comparative advantage vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Capturing a country's capital is incredibly demoralizing for the defenders and often acts as a sort of political and economic decapitation. Doing it in half a year would have been even more meaningful. Furthermore, if the Nazis did capture Moscow, would that have convinced the Japanese to invade the Soviet Union in the East? That would have prevented them from sending a lot of reinforcements to fight the Nazis. Again, I don't know whether capturing Moscow would have been enough for Germany to destroy the Soviet Union, but it certainly would have done the most damage of their available options.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying that Germany would have won the war even if they had defeated the Soviet Union.
