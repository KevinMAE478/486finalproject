P, your boyfriend, just turned 21.  He just started working as a general laborer on some fishing boats.  Both of you had a couple misdemeanor charges as well.  Nothing to write home about though.  Both of you were trying to stay clean, and in our county, that&amp;#39;s hard to do.  Both of you were still living in a cheap, 300 square foot shitty studio apartment in a bad part of town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 20 and 21, both working part time at best and young, I get it. Both of you had criminal records.  That&amp;#39;s why you and P hid the pregnancy.  Young and scared.  But still...that was no excuse for what you both did.  Both of you had so many chances.  In court, your parents and siblings all stated had they known about the pregnancy, they would have moved heaven and earth to help you guys.  But no...no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An expert said in our county, 325 people are awaiting to adopt.  A kid.  Any kid.  290 of them specifically asked for a baby.  I knew this.  My husband and I adopted 2 local kids from foster care.  Same expert said in our county alone, there are roughly 400 approved foster homes.  We also have a safe heaven law.  Meaning a young, scared mother can drop her baby off at a police station, fire station, hospital or any other approved place and walk away, no questions asked.  But no...that&amp;#39;s not the route both of you took.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead...instead...B and P hid the pregnancy from their friends, family and coworkers.  Not even went to the doctor, once.  Then when B went into labor, you drove 10 miles outside of town, rented a cheap motel room and gave birth.  In secret.  Even in that moment, there were still choices...so many choices.  But no....B told P to take care of the baby.  A girl.  And P did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to court records, the medical examiner who still suffers from nightmares today and what P admitted to in court, while B went for a walk on the beach, P took the baby into a nearby wooded area and killed the baby girl, barely 10 hours old at this point...and killed her.  Depending on who you ask, it was either a hammer or a wrench.  Then wrapped her body up in a blanket and hid her body in the woods, right off the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was that evening when V was out for a walk.  It was a warm spring evening and she just wanted to walk her dog.  Her and the dog found the baby.  4 years later, she still has nightmares.  And PTSD from what she found.  She had to move out of the area, because she couldn&amp;#39;t bear to walk or drive past the wooded area anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B and P, you destroyed your families.  Not to mention the shock from your coworkers.  The local fire dept was left baffled.  The motel B gave birth at was across the street.  P had to drive past them to \u201ctake care of your daughter,\u201d as B so put it.
