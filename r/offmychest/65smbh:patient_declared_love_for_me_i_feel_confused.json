I just need to vent because I feel so alone and like a monster for admitting this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a RMN in an mixed sex acute psychiatric ward. I have worked there for the past 4 years since I qualified (I am 26 F btw). We recently had a new admission, a 35 year old man with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Prior to admission I was assigned as his duty nurse. We clicked fairly quickly and I saw that he is quite a sensitive and thoughtful man who was often misunderstood by other patients and staff. As the time went on, we developed a good rapport and he began to rely on me solely for all aspects of his care and would hesitate if another nurse got involved in his care. If he saw that I was on a smoke break, he would come and join me and he would spend time talking with me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has been on my ward for almost 2 months and his progress has been amazing. He should be cleared for discharge soon. However last week, he declared his love for me. He said he has never felt this way about anyone. Of course I had to explain to him that this was inappropriate and that there will never be a romantic involvement. He understood but he said he would still pine after me (and not act on anything). At the time I was shocked , but I have found I am starting to feel attracted towards him also. He is everything I want in a man; funny, smart and good looking but this is so fucked up that I am feeling this way. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t confide in anyone, even my best friends or close colleagues in case they think I am a sick minded person. I want to cry because I obviously care about this patient and his recovery. I am so aware of the repercussions of this and I am quite certain that I will never act on it. I used to love my job...now I can&amp;#39;t face waking up to go to work because I feel so rotten, guilt ridden and conflicted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you letting me vent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everyone.
