But the lifestyle is anything but. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited to add:&lt;/strong&gt; OP, &lt;a href=\"/u/-Mamihlapinatapei-\"&gt;/u/-Mamihlapinatapei-&lt;/a&gt; please feel free to private message me anytime. Whether you just need a pair of listening ears to vent, or would like some advice or comforting words, I&amp;#39;m here for you, and I will never judge you for anything you tell me. I know I&amp;#39;m just a stranger on the internet, but I know the feeling your post describes all too well - I&amp;#39;ve been there so many times. My husband and I have been on maintenance (subutex) for a long time now, so some people don&amp;#39;t consider that clean, however I do because it changed our lives and helped us turn everything around. Please try to remember me if you&amp;#39;re struggling with cravings on a bad day, or whatever the situation is. I have a little kitty to look after as well (there&amp;#39;s a photo of her in my post history), and for what it&amp;#39;s worth, I feel like her stares are much less judgmental these days hahaha :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here if you ever need a friend. Sending you love and light. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dg4ov2c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491964343.0, "created_utc": 1491935543.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qp8l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qp8l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49l9d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Mamihlapinatapei-", "parent_id": "t1_dg49aju", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you.
