For those that don&amp;#39;t know, that means that I worked at a huge hospital that got life-and-death cases most of the time. Hospitals like this are in big cities. As a trauma nurse, I see hundreds of people a day and normally don&amp;#39;t have time to interact intimately with my patients. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I have a child patient, I try to slow down a little. Three months ago, there was a mother and child waiting in the emergency room. (If you&amp;#39;re not one of the &amp;quot;life or death&amp;quot; cases, you&amp;#39;re in for a 6+ hour wait in the waiting area.) I asked them how long they had been waiting, and the mother calmly told me they had been there for about six hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl was about three and was vomiting. I told my supervisor that I would take the two. I brought the little girl and her mother back, did a workup, and couldn&amp;#39;t find anything initially wrong with the little girl. The mother was so concerned--but in a way that immediately sent me on alert. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain this to you all, but... it was just a gut feeling. The way the mother acted was almost &lt;em&gt;fake&lt;/em&gt;. The way she stroked her daughter&amp;#39;s hair, the way she wouldn&amp;#39;t ask questions, only say, &amp;quot;I know it&amp;#39;s bad.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran tests on the girl and her bloodwork came back abnormal. I asked the girl if she had eaten anything she doesn&amp;#39;t normally eat, and the mother answered that she had had nothing to eat except cereal. She then said that this happens a lot. They had been to the hospital five times in four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled up the girl&amp;#39;s chart and it read like a chronically ill patient. She had been in and out of hospitals for her entire life for various illnesses and injuries. I excused myself from the room and found my supervisor and showed her the chart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said that the mother could have MSBP (Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy), which means a mother/father/guardian will make up or create illnesses for a child to get attention. My supervisor was appalled--at me. She said that the chart was no indication of that, and immediately dismissed me and took over the case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was to not have any contact with the patient any longer and had to leave immediately. The next day, I was given a formal termination letter along with a call from my supervisor telling me that I was too hasty in my decision and I should never assume something so severe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told one of my coworkers about this after I was terminated. This morning, my coworker text me and told me that the same little girl that I had treated had died. She had apparently &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; ingested some form of insecticide and had hemorrhaged.

I could have fought harder, but I was so angry at being terminated that I forgot all about the little girl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For clarification, the little girl had been brought in routinely for years with stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a few sprained wrists and fractured ribs. Am I the only one that read too much into this? Were they all just accidents?
