I&amp;#39;ve always loved other dogs and I wanted to have one to share in all the good times and bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always loved hounds ever since I read &amp;quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&amp;quot; as a child. Finally, I found one online and drove 100 miles to pick him up. I had been staying at my mom&amp;#39;s for the summer while I looked for a job so I waited until she was out on business and boy did I have to promise her the world when she got back so that she would let me keep him. She finally relented, because my high school sweetheart got engaged that same weekend and she knew how much I loved her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I named him Asher. It means &amp;quot;blessing.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s a beautiful blue tick with big floppy ears and a tail that can whip you silly when he gets excited. We became fast friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning I was in over my head. I had trouble training him and going to work but we made it through the summer despite both of us somehow getting ringworm and poison ivy. There were a lot of trips to the vet those first couple months haha. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a job a state over and packed up. We hit the road with not much to our names and happy hearts, best buddies all the time. We lived in a beach town and we would spend hours at this huge dog park at a little lagoon. Those were some good days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asher isn&amp;#39;t perfect. I never could get him to quit jumping on people or stealing food. Wow he could bay like nobody&amp;#39;s business. He would bay and bay at random things. He loved little kids, especially and would hug them any chance he could. I had to hold him back quite a few times until the child could adjust to his strength. He ended up playing with a kid for two hours one day, never leaving his side. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I would get him back haha. He was a lot to handle but so was I. I loved him beyond comprehension. He is just like me in so many ways, or at least I hope. Hard to handle, loud, but always ready to bring a smile to your face. I probably gave him some bad habits but he gave me his good ones. I love harder because of him now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He helped me cry, a lot. He listened to me with interest while I practiced presentations for work. We ran miles and miles together and some days we did absolutely nothing and loved every second of it. Once, on Halloween I dressed up like a fox. We were Copper and Todd from Fox and the Hound. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I got fired from my job. That was the hardest experience of my life and Asher quite literally kept me tethered to the world. I had this life that needed me, that I needed as well. He saved me during that time, grounded me, loved me through it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made the decision to move back home and apply to law school. I got in. As school approached and my schedule was set, I realized I would be gone for so long every day. On top of that, I pay my way through school and needed a night job. I made the hardest decision of my life. I posted him up for adoption on line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t take long for people to respond and I know why, he&amp;#39;s gorgeous and wonderful. I spent more time describing him than I have on my own resume. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman texted me, she has three children. She sent me a picture of them and they had this cute three year old. They lived really close to me which made me excited, thinking I might could see him some throughout his life. I told them I would meet them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sobbed on the way there, Asher in the back seat trying to lay his head on my shoulder. I met them and they fell in love with Asher. Immediately I knew he found a home. The children instantly took to him and I swear he was on the best behavior he had ever been on. It&amp;#39;s like he knew. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days later, he was there&amp;#39;s. The day I gave him to them was hard, extremely hard. I felt guilty and embarrassed and so broken. Guilty and embarrassed because I felt like I let him down and I felt like I wasn&amp;#39;t adequate enough. My friends would tell me I did the right thing, that I gave him a better life and I cling to that but sometimes I still don&amp;#39;t know. His new mom sends me pictures sometimes, they call him Dasher at the behest of the three year old. The little girl dresses him up sometimes and will play with him for hours while he just lays there licking her and snoozing. He&amp;#39;s nice and healthy and seems content. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see him the other day, for the first time in 6 months and I was terrified. I kept panicking, thinking he wouldn&amp;#39;t remember me. I knew it would break my heart if that happened. I got to their house and sat in my car for 5 minutes gathering myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out and the door opened and out came this 3 year old and she ran up and hugged me. I had only met her once. Then I see Asher, he&amp;#39;s in the doorway but he&amp;#39;s turned around and can&amp;#39;t see me. I drum up the courage and call his name. He turns and bounds to me and I let him take me down. He does everything he can to climb on me, wiggling with excitement and baying at the top of his lungs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent a few hours together. They fed me and showed me his new trick, not jumping for the food on the table. I was impressed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mother told me how happy he makes the children, how joyful he is to go to their big farm and run through the fields chasing birds for hours. I smile so big and feel my heart warm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got in my car after saying a long goodbye and cried happy/sad tears all at once. I miss him like hell but I truly wanted him to be the happiest damn dog in the world and I think now he has a shot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fox and the Hound is our favorite movie to watch together. He would always bark with the dogs in the movie. I love this one exchange between Copper and Todd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Copper you&amp;#39;re my best friend.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re mine too, Todd.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;And we&amp;#39;ll always be friends forever, right?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Yeah, forever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for saving my life Asher. I love you buddy. Forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: guys what?! This outpouring of support is both overwhelming and so appreciated.
