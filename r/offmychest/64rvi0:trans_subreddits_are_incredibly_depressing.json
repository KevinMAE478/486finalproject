At all. Here&amp;#39;s the deal. There&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there who are skeptical of the trans* (or other gender - NB, agender, etc.) identity. And maybe they&amp;#39;re sitting on the fence. And they&amp;#39;ve heard a lot about special snowflakes and Tumblrinas and all that other garbage, but maybe they&amp;#39;re willing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they mess up. They hear criticism, perhaps not in the nicest tone - which I understand! A lot of people of non-cis gender identities will have dealt with a lot of hate and etc., and it gets tiresome after a while. But here&amp;#39;s the problem - if someone&amp;#39;s already sitting on the fence, acting as if they meant to mess up, as if they&amp;#39;re being rude or whatever even though they &lt;em&gt;just didn&amp;#39;t know&lt;/em&gt; (and it&amp;#39;s easy to confuse being uneducated for being ignorant) - will definitely not put them on your side. In fact, they&amp;#39;ll go away feeling bothered or down, then they might decide, &amp;quot;Yeah, y&amp;#39;know what? This person was just an asshole and attacked me with no reason!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you have someone who is no longer willing to support you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain it very well for some reason, but I&amp;#39;ve been trying to change the way I educate people (I&amp;#39;m cisgender, but I know and want to stand up for a lot of trans/etc. people). I&amp;#39;ve had a hell of a time explaining this to people because they have this idea about special snowflakes and they&amp;#39;re all pissed |that people get pissy if you misgender them or whatever&amp;quot; (kind of paraphrasing what I&amp;#39;ve heard more than a few times).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that a lot of it is miscommunication, and a bit of an &amp;quot;us vs them&amp;quot; attitude, from both sides. So I&amp;#39;m trying to foster more collaboration and understanding and, most of all, compassion. It requires an attitude shift in cis people, that they be willing to be open-minded, for sure. But you&amp;#39;re not going to get there by telling someone they&amp;#39;re bad for accidentally being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dg5lr9c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492010745.0, "created_utc": 1491981945.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rvi0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rvi0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6rp7m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "evilheartemote", "parent_id": "t1_dg5kdce", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's... kind of what I meant by my post, too?
