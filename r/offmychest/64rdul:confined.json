So basically I was born a Muslim, as my parents are Muslims. I was forced to go to religion classes back when I was like 7 years old, but I was never religious. It&amp;#39;s not that I hate the religion. I love the religion, it&amp;#39;s such a beautiful religion but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s just for me. I&amp;#39;m only 17 so I don&amp;#39;t really have much say because honestly, if I were to express to my parents that I want to apostate, I would probably get kicked out of the house - My mum has clearly expressed this with a firm stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On another note, my dad is a Muslim convert.
