You're going to both try to absorb all kinds of hurt and pain and blame from one another and the circumstances around you.\n\nTherapy, therapy, therapy. For you both as individuals and together so you can start to move forward and have support during the fallout of this awful, awful revelation.\n\nAnd it's OK to still love someone that has done horrible things. It's OK to not understand it and to feel disgusted and wounded and also want to run to that person for comfort, the way you have been doing for years and imagined you would be doing for the rest of your life. It is not all going to heal in an instant, the love and disgust will coexist and smash up against each other. \n\nIt is like floating outside your own body when your trust gets betrayed like that. My situation wasn't the same, but my ex spouse had a life in secret that I never knew about, and he was more dangerous and vile and reckless and frightening than I ever thought possible. I couldn't reconcile it with the man I (thought) I knew. \n\nAt times I'd think *Who will hold me? Who will hold me?* when everything blew up and he was in jail. It felt pathetic to think that way, but I still let myself feel it because it was real. \n\n\nIt will take time and therapy and more time to snap you back into yourself. It's OK to float in anguish for awhile. That's the only thing for it. \n\nYou will learn to hold yourself. \n\n\n\nThe only thing you did was trust the person that you loved- and that isn't a mistake. That's what you're supposed to do. You are a healthy, normal and good person. \n\nYou are showing your sister just how much you love her by charging at this situation with your full force. Even with your broken heart and your confusion and your feelings of unworthiness, you are going to battle for her.

", "edited": 1492252011.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is his shame and his guilt and his rot that you are wearing, love. It is not yours. It is not your sister&amp;#39;s. You&amp;#39;re both going to take it on because you&amp;#39;re good, loving people and I can tell that just from this post. You&amp;#39;re going to both try to absorb all kinds of hurt and pain and blame from one another and the circumstances around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therapy, therapy, therapy. For you both as individuals and together so you can start to move forward and have support during the fallout of this awful, awful revelation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s OK to still love someone that has done horrible things. It&amp;#39;s OK to not understand it and to feel disgusted and wounded and also want to run to that person for comfort, the way you have been doing for years and imagined you would be doing for the rest of your life. It is not all going to heal in an instant, the love and disgust will coexist and smash up against each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is like floating outside your own body when your trust gets betrayed like that. My situation wasn&amp;#39;t the same, but my ex spouse had a life in secret that I never knew about, and he was more dangerous and vile and reckless and frightening than I ever thought possible. I couldn&amp;#39;t reconcile it with the man I (thought) I knew. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At times I&amp;#39;d think &lt;em&gt;Who will hold me? Who will hold me?&lt;/em&gt; when everything blew up and he was in jail. It felt pathetic to think that way, but I still let myself feel it because it was real. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will take time and therapy and more time to snap you back into yourself. It&amp;#39;s OK to float in anguish for awhile. That&amp;#39;s the only thing for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will learn to hold yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing you did was trust the person that you loved- and that isn&amp;#39;t a mistake. That&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re supposed to do. You are a healthy, normal and good person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are showing your sister just how much you love her by charging at this situation with your full force. Even with your broken heart and your confusion and your feelings of unworthiness, you are going to battle for her. That is exactly who she needs you to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;\nEdit: Oh my gosh, thank you for the gold! This is unexpected and really validating. Cool.

Her last day in their apartment they had with a roommate and her boyfriend was about to leave to go out with some friends and she was about to head to work, and he was waiting for her to finish cooking. Their roommate was at work during this time and they were in need of a grocery trip, so the only thing they had left in the house was a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese that she was making. Her and her boyfriend ended up getting into a fight and he got so mad at her her took the pot of noodles (it has cooled down to be under boiling) and threw the water at her and threw the noodles in the trash. Her purse and stuff was in the car, so he took the car with all her money in it and left, and she had to walk 4 miles to work in a city at 11 in the afternoon in 100 degree weather. \n\nWhen she got home a few hours later (roommate still at work) her boyfriend was leaving to go out and party with friends, and still mad at her he grabbed her and started shaking her violently and threw her on the bed. After calling me and her mom and us three arranging a ride (she was three hours away) her roommate got home and saw her crying and asked why, so she explained the situation to him and said she's leaving. \n\nShe didn't know if her boyfriend would come back that night so she asked her roommate to wait up with her. He asked her if she was going to press charges and she replied she can't because there wasn't anyone who saw or heard anything and she didn't have any marks. Well, what he said to her always stuck with her and me and I think it would really help in this situation. \n\nHe said, \"Just because you can prove to THEM a crime happened, doesn't mean it didn't happened. If a crime happened, you should report it because if you don't you run the risk of the crime happening again to your or to someone else, and you or them may not be so lucky. And you may regret not reporting it.\"\n\nShe ended up reporting the crime and, even though they couldn't DO anything, they told her that if he does anything like that to her or anyone else they have a record of the report that could help if they have to deal with him again. It also helped her move on. It may help you guys move on, and it may help the police and anyone else who may be or has been a victim. \n\nAnd I am not religious in any way, but just know that you are in my thoughts and that I really hope you guys get through this.

Her last day in their apartment they had with a roommate and her boyfriend was about to leave to go out with some friends and she was about to head to work, and he was waiting for her to finish cooking. Their roommate was at work during this time and they were in need of a grocery trip, so the only thing they had left in the house was a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese that she was making. Her and her boyfriend ended up getting into a fight and he got so mad at her her took the pot of noodles (it has cooled down to be under boiling) and threw the water at her and threw the noodles in the trash. Her purse and stuff was in the car, so he took the car with all her money in it and left, and she had to walk 4 miles to work in a city at 11 in the afternoon in 100 degree weather. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she got home a few hours later (roommate still at work) her boyfriend was leaving to go out and party with friends, and still mad at her he grabbed her and started shaking her violently and threw her on the bed. After calling me and her mom and us three arranging a ride (she was three hours away) her roommate got home and saw her crying and asked why, so she explained the situation to him and said she&amp;#39;s leaving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t know if her boyfriend would come back that night so she asked her roommate to wait up with her. He asked her if she was going to press charges and she replied she can&amp;#39;t because there wasn&amp;#39;t anyone who saw or heard anything and she didn&amp;#39;t have any marks. Well, what he said to her always stuck with her and me and I think it would really help in this situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;Just because you can prove to THEM a crime happened, doesn&amp;#39;t mean it didn&amp;#39;t happened. If a crime happened, you should report it because if you don&amp;#39;t you run the risk of the crime happening again to your or to someone else, and you or them may not be so lucky. And you may regret not reporting it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She ended up reporting the crime and, even though they couldn&amp;#39;t DO anything, they told her that if he does anything like that to her or anyone else they have a record of the report that could help if they have to deal with him again. It also helped her move on. It may help you guys move on, and it may help the police and anyone else who may be or has been a victim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I am not religious in any way, but just know that you are in my thoughts and that I really hope you guys get through this. I love you and your courage and strength, and I hope that if there is a God that you, your sister, and your son are under his protection. And I hope you find peace after this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dgdl3ps", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470136.0, "created_utc": 1492441336.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76tze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 265, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ReservateThatRoom", "parent_id": "t1_dg76s8e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow morning &amp; plan to request an emergency appointment with my therapist.\n\nRight now we're discussing whether or not to press charges against him.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow morning &amp;amp; plan to request an emergency appointment with my therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now we&amp;#39;re discussing whether or not to press charges against him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dg76tze", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089378.0, "created_utc": 1492060578.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 265}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76s8e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 333, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DenMother8", "parent_id": "t3_653jsl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Therapy may help.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapy may help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dg76s8e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089287.0, "created_utc": 1492060487.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 333}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jsl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jsl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7b9bo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ReservateThatRoom", "parent_id": "t1_dg79xa7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for saying that.

I was with my ex for 17 years and for me to truly move forward I had to turn what I learned in all of that into helping someone else.  But that was after a year of healing first, I personally had very little luck finding a good therapist for being in this kind of situation so I turned to friends and faith but depending on the support you have working through it with therapy might be a good way to try.  I think maybe it helps to know that you aren&amp;#39;t alone too, so just wanted to make sure to let you know that you&amp;#39;re not alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dg7i51j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492117166.0, "created_utc": 1492088366.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653jsl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7khsj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "djfinbar", "parent_id": "t3_653jsl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is not your fault.
