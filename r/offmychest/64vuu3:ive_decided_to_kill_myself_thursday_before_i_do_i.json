I&amp;#39;m not looking for attention or rescue, I&amp;#39;m writing this to finally get everything out, and with no one to talk to, having never fit in anywhere at all, I want to finally say things I&amp;#39;ve never been able. So this WILL be long, as it&amp;#39;s the last bit of communication I intend on having.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, I will kill myself. I&amp;#39;ve several dozen Pristiq tabs saved up (antidepressant, go figure) and will take them all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 25 and I have no job, no money, am nearly homeless and entirely alone. I&amp;#39;ve tried so many times throughout the years to hold pieces of my life together and yet have never had any success. My father left when I was 4, I remember the day vividly, it&amp;#39;s my first memory. He was strangling my mother in the kitchen, having just punched through the wall, and I knocked over the gate separating the living room from the kitchen and yelled at him to, in my mother&amp;#39;s recollection, &amp;quot;leave my mom alone.&amp;quot; He turned around and punched me in the face, rearranging my upper pallet for life. He fled, she called the cops, and it was over. Then my mother met my future stepfather about 2 years later, and so she began to manipulate me and force me to visit my father on the weekends so that she could go on dates with my stepfather. Cue years of further physical, sexual and emotional/psychological abuse, during which I had terrible behavioural troubles in school my mother claimed not to know the causation of, painting herself to faculty and therapists as the victim of my behaviour during meetings to discuss my troubled state.\nDuring the summer, I would be left with my grandfather, who would make me kneel in the pantry facing the wall until my mother came back from work, so roughly 7 or 8 hours a day. Or I would be left with my uncle, who would make me walk up and down the driveway all day with a backpack filled with bricks and stones. Then on the weekends, I would be sent back to my dad&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then everything elevated severity when I was 9 and my father, a diagnosed, unmedicated schizophrenic with severe addiction issues, tried to kill me after being convinced that I was going to kill HIM. He held me down on the bed, held a pillow over my face and I believed my life was over. I woke up some time later and spent hours vomiting. That&amp;#39;s as far as I want to touch that memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months later, believing I was bad and deserved to die, I made my first suicide attempt, at the age of 9. I smashed open a picture of him and slashed at myself with the glass, then strangled myself with a belt on the kitchen floor. My mother looked on, hysterical, and called mobile crisis. For years after, the cycle continued--my mother played victim and gained the sympathy of professionals and teachers at my expense, refusing to listen to me when I tried to talk to her about what was happening at my father&amp;#39;s--she would lay on the couch from the time she came home from work until bed, and would stare at the television, telling me, when I tried to talk to her, that she was &amp;quot;too busy&amp;quot; and that we could talk later, but later never came, and the more I pressed, she would become angry and aggressive towards me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All those years, she never looked me in the eyes, hugged me or told me she loved me. In fact, my therapist once asked her to say something nice about me and she stared blankly at the wall. My therapist asked her to tell me she loved me and she refused. But that&amp;#39;s another tangent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This continued into my teens, and my behavioural problems worsened, until my mother requested juvenile court to become involved due to me running away so often. I was put on house arrest and eventually put in juvenile detention for a total of 9 months due to violating the probation I was put on, as requested by my mother, for my string of runaways that resulted from the situation she continued to force me into by guilting me into seeing my father every weekend (&amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s the only dad you&amp;#39;ll ever have, what if something happens to him, you&amp;#39;ll regret not seeing him&amp;quot;) that she refused to let me talk about in therapy, at home or at school. Effectively, she turned everyone against me, not only forcing me into abuse but actively portraiying herself as the victim of the anger and resentment I had DUE to the abuse I was being forced into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until I was finally kicked out, and forced to live with my father. I won&amp;#39;t get into what it was like living with him for 7 months, but at the end, I saw the same look in his eyes from when he tried to kill me when I was 9 and I called and asked DCF to take me into custody. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to my then probation officer, I was an unsalvageable little shit trying to work the system, and he hoped I would rot one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the next 3 years in DCF, bounced from place to place, even shortly living with Charles Wilson who murdered 3 store clerks 2 years later in failed robberies. I met a woman who was finally like a parent to me, who worked at the group home I was living in, and just as we were waiting on paperwork for adoption, at 17 years old, I was uncerimoniously discharged back to my mother and stepfather\u200b, where no matter how well I did, nothing was ever good enough.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was alone, with no friends and no support after finally finding someone who treated me with love and caring. I was no longer allowed to contact her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I barely made it through highschool, but I did, though it was at cost of developing an extremely abnormal eating disorder that caused me to go 3 years without being able to eat a solid food. Which was manageable Because I went immediately into freelance writing. I could escape everything while writing. But the loneliness, anxiety and depression caught up to me eventually, by the age of 21. I couldn&amp;#39;t eat food, my weight was fluctuating dangerously, I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep or focus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I begged my mother to talk to me and she refused, time and again, while staring at the television and telling me she was &amp;quot;too busy.&amp;quot; I knew there was always something wrong with me but it was building more and more and I was thinking about killing myself constantly. I needed help, I was scaring myself, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t listen. Her and my sister and stepfather would mock me for my eating disorder, constantly tell me how much they wanted me gone, but I couldn&amp;#39;t go due to not making enough due to the things I was asking for help with that no one would help me with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in September of 2013, I hospitalised myself. I met someone who seemed to understand me and sometimes listened. Treatment went well. I was starting to feel hopeful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, in December 2013, my father died of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was given the call at 940am, and expected to relay the information to my family. I was home alone. I called my mother, who just didn&amp;#39;t seem to know what to do, my sister who hung up on me, and then I spent the next two hours hysterically panicking and sobbing in the shower. My girlfriend, when she finally returned my call, rushed to be with me in the middle of a snow storm. My mother, when she was home, watched me sob in the kitchen with her arms folded and, after 10 minutes, asked, &amp;quot;are you done?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I moved out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next 3 years, I barely survived as every bit of trauma resurfaced. 10 more family members died. I ruined the relationship with my girlfriend, it ended just last fall, I tried twice to kill myself, spent two years unable to stop drinking or crying. My stepmother forced me to buy the few belongings of my father&amp;#39;s that I wanted, then turned around and sued me claiming I had stolen them. My sister openly blamed me for my father&amp;#39;s death. I rarely showered, rarely ate, barely slept, for 3 years. My eating disorder resurfaced and I couldn&amp;#39;t eat solid foods again for almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the last few years, I don&amp;#39;t even want to revisit beyond saying that. I don&amp;#39;t want to revisit any of it anymore. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve made my choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live in a place where I&amp;#39;ve never fit in, have no means of supporting myself or of moving OR of bettering my situation. I can&amp;#39;t date because after my upbringing, each and every relationship leaves such a deep, gaping wound after it ends that I can&amp;#39;t seem to heal enough to walk forward anymore, and I&amp;#39;m so conditioned to sympathise with abusers that I manipulate myself into dating women who have extremely aggressive, toxic and abusive traits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what makes it all so pointless and so hopeless is that it all comes down to luck. I was born in the wrong place, to the wrong family. I found somewhere I fit in this year, for the first time in my life, but I can never go there again, I&amp;#39;ll never have the means or the capability, and that&amp;#39;s what kills me. I didn&amp;#39;t do anything particular to receive the shitty fucking cards I&amp;#39;ve gotten, it all comes down to getting a bad hand, and I&amp;#39;ve tried to make it, I&amp;#39;ve tried work, school, but I always\u200b end up back in the hospital, and that makes it more and more impossible to get anywhere in life. I&amp;#39;m tired of the circular nature of suffering, and I&amp;#39;m tired of putting everything I am into people and into life and getting nothing positive in return, of ending up alone and incapable while others seem to just be able. I&amp;#39;m tired of having spent my whole life trying to overcome all of my trauma but still being no closer to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of dating women who are mentally and emotionally abusive, I&amp;#39;m tired of seeing other people have things I know I&amp;#39;ll never taste or touch, of watching my family succeed and ignore every ounce of suffering I&amp;#39;ve been dealt. I&amp;#39;m tired of no one acknowledging all the things that went on, everything that happened, and being unable to look me in the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a SINGLE family member looks me in the eyes, and hasn&amp;#39;t in years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired of the pain and I&amp;#39;m tired of it never being any better, no matter how I&amp;#39;ve approached it. I don&amp;#39;t want to be here anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is overly long but I&amp;#39;ve got nothing to lose by letting this out. I needed to get it all off my chest by Thursday, and seeing as I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone, getting it out here seemed best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I know no one will read something this long, so that&amp;#39;s all I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Where to begin?

After a lifetime of treatment--and the right treatment at that--I&amp;#39;ve become much less hopeful that &amp;quot;gets better&amp;quot; is something everyone experience. After all, if I didn&amp;#39;t learn from the patterns of my life, I probably would have stopped years ago. It&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ve tried to make things better--learning what happened and why it happened, how to change it and stop it. But even with all the effort I&amp;#39;ve still been in the same\u200b places, facing the same things, and I just don&amp;#39;t have the energy anymore. Thank you for replying though. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dg5tal6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492030284.0, "created_utc": 1492001484.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5grwi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 75, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ljcbff", "parent_id": "t3_64vuu3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I want you to know that I read your whole post.

I was watching Louis CK's netflix special the other night, while be anxious about school and exams, and he said something that made most of my anxiety go away. And it was that, you don't have to do anything in life that you don't want it, because you can always kill yourself at any moment and quit. I recommend watching the special, he honestly heals my soul.\n\nYou said you've tried everything to deal with your problems, I'm wondering if you've tried philosophy? Lots of philosophy talks about suffering. I'm currently on a mission to master my attitude toward suffering by detaching myself from the external world through meditation. There's a level of awareness and detachment from the external world you can achieve where you're capable of watching your first born child die in your arms and it have no effect on you. \n\nNietzche also has a really interesting outlook on suffering. He suffered a lot in his life as well, and he famously said:\n\"To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities\u2014I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not\u2014that one endures.\"\n\nI really recommend listening to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDNFH-ZNvyw&amp;t=1359s and the other videos on his channel, especially the Kierkegaard ones. \n\nWilliam James was discontent with life and suicidal. He said he would give himself one year to give it his all in order to change his life, or otherwise commit suicide. Would you consider a similar approach? Maybe change the thursday into a year? I think this would also reduce a lot of your anxieties about life - because the worst case scenario is that you're going to commit suicide. So, you only have to improve on that. \n\nI hope this catches you, thanks for sharing your story :) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I read that all.

The fact that you&amp;#39;ve gone through all that and survived thus far says a lot about your character. The fact that you haven&amp;#39;t retaliated and hurt other people says a lot about you.
