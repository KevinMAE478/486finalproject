Go and have fun, enjoy yourself, do what you actually enjoy doing, instead of trying to \"fix\" yourself. There's nothing wrong with just having a nice time when you're traveling.\n\nAlternatively you can use this realization to change things up and do better at your stated goals for the second half of the trip. You've realized that \"meeting people\" doesn't happen as easily as you thought it would, so take a few hours to google some resources for solo travelers and find out how *other* travelers manage to meet people (check /r/solotravel for starters), go on the free walking tours that every city has, sign up for the events that your hostel likely runs most nights, or whatever else you can find. There are plenty of resources online on this topic. Lots of people have written about how to meet people and how to open up to strangers when you're traveling alone. Now that you know it's not something that just happens automatically, you can put the required effort into making it happen.\n\nNeither option is wrong. You can absolutely just go \"screw this, I'm on vacation now.

Go and have fun, enjoy yourself, do what you actually enjoy doing, instead of trying to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; yourself. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with just having a nice time when you&amp;#39;re traveling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can use this realization to change things up and do better at your stated goals for the second half of the trip. You&amp;#39;ve realized that &amp;quot;meeting people&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t happen as easily as you thought it would, so take a few hours to google some resources for solo travelers and find out how &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; travelers manage to meet people (check &lt;a href=\"/r/solotravel\"&gt;/r/solotravel&lt;/a&gt; for starters), go on the free walking tours that every city has, sign up for the events that your hostel likely runs most nights, or whatever else you can find. There are plenty of resources online on this topic. Lots of people have written about how to meet people and how to open up to strangers when you&amp;#39;re traveling alone. Now that you know it&amp;#39;s not something that just happens automatically, you can put the required effort into making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither option is wrong. You can absolutely just go &amp;quot;screw this, I&amp;#39;m on vacation now. For the next two weeks, I&amp;#39;ll do what I want and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; what I want&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, enjoy the rest of your trip. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "offmychest", "name": "t1_dga2e31", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247663.0, "created_utc": 1492218863.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d7cf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaluk6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tyrant22", "parent_id": "t3_65d7cf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/offmychest", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Biggest thing I've learned about travelling, is that it is what you make it!
