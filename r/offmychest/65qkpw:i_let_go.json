When he left to go grocery shopping, I never thought that would be the last time I would see him alive. It\u2019s strange how things happen. One minute I\u2019m preparing to cook my sister a birthday dinner and the next I\u2019m preparing for a funeral. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband was my best friend. We dated off and on for eight years before we finally got married. Everyone hounded us and wanted to know why we weren\u2019t engaged by year two. Truth be told, we were both still trying to figure out how to be young and careless and didn\u2019t want that to affect the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met him when I was eighteen-years-old, my first week of undergrad. We were attending the same open house for our major. We had similar majors, so we saw a lot of each other. I thought he was the cutest; this was mainly because I knew he was into me. He would sweat when he was nervous, and after a conversation with me he would be drenched. I would tease him about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But college is not the best place to have a long-standing relationship. We dated off and on, broke up a few times, dated other people, fell in love with other people. In the end, though, he was the one that I always kept coming back to. We both went out-of-state for our graduate degrees. He went to one side of the country and I went to the other. When we finished, somehow we landed in the same city with similar jobs\u2014not far from the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took this whole thing as a sign and asked him out for drinks. We caught up after almost three years of not seeing each other, and it was just like we had never spent a day apart. I remember him telling me one night during a \u201clet\u2019s grab a beer\u201d chat that he wanted to marry me. We both knew we were in love with the other. So incredibly, stupidly in love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got married. Started a \u201cdomestic\u201d life. Neither of us wanted kids, so we made the most of it. We were married for six years. For six years, I was married to my best friend. Every single day with him I laughed harder than the day before. I would tease him about how he would still sweat when I flirted with him in front of our friends. I would tease him about how he would count on his fingers to do simple math\u2014despite having a PhD in mathematics. I would tease him about how much he loved me, and he would always reply to that one with, \u201cI can\u2019t help it, I just do.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After he died, I changed. I became this shell. My doctor prescribed me antidepressants, which made me feel \u201ccloudy\u201d and detached from everything. It was like every day I woke up, I was just trying to mask the pain because he wasn\u2019t there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was my \u201cepic\u201d love; he was the one that I was \u201cmeant to be\u201d with. We had fought hard to be together despite everything. Even though I make it sound like it happened so effortlessly, there was a lot of challenges that led up to us being together. Like his family not liking me from the very beginning, or my family not liking his. Or the fact that my own mental health\u2014which has always been rocky\u2014was telling me I didn\u2019t deserve him. But somehow, I did. I did deserve him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vowed to never love someone the way that I loved him. I said I would never date, sleep with, or be with another person so I could honor him. But last year\u2014two years after his death\u2014I met someone. Someone nice, caring, and funny. It just sort of happened by accident. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I have found myself caring for this man\u2014this stranger, this \u201creplacement\u201d\u2014and I hate myself every single moment. The first time I kissed him, I locked myself in my bedroom and cried until I threw up. I still have dreams where I see my husband standing in our kitchen, cooking dinner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the last few days have been clearer. This new man has been so patient, so kind. He has allowed me to grieve, and I realize that while I did have my \u201cepic\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d love, in order to really move forward and \u201cmove on,\u201d as everyone says I have to\u2014then I have to let go. I have to let go of my husband. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I packed away my husband\u2019s old clothes and prepared them for a donation drive tomorrow. I took down all of his posters and put them in our storage closet. I hung up some old paintings I used to make when I was into that sort of thing. I cried the whole time, messy tears, snotting, and with a lot of wine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I\u2019m having Easter dinner with this new guy and his family. He really likes me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m there yet, but I know I like him. I have no way to tell just how much he likes me; he doesn\u2019t sweat. He doesn\u2019t stammer when I kiss his cheek. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he does fold his hands across my body when I\u2019m standing close to him. He will rest his chin on my shoulder. When he\u2019s busy doing work, he\u2019ll reach out and find my hand\u2014almost as if he\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll float away if I\u2019m not near him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s different, and I like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will always love my husband, but I need to move forward.
