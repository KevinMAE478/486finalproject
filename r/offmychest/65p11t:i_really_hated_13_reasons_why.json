It is overly dramatic in the sense that Hannah&amp;#39;s character was extremely dramatic, as is made more and more clear as the show goes on. Everyone was sick of her drama, of her making everything about &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, to the point where she alienated everyone in her life just enough to allow the suicide to happen.
