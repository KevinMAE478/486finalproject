She is in intense full body pain and unless she is heavily medicated most food and liquids cause stomach pain and vomiting within 15 minutes. She had a botched gastro surgery that fucked up her stomachs nerves according to her new gastro doctor, and a surgery to correct it did not work, she struggles to hold food down most days and is dropping weight dangerously fast and her doctors have no clue what exactly is wrong or what course of action to take because her tests always come back good. She struggles to eat, struggles to walk, and sex isn&amp;#39;t a thing anymore due to her constant pain. They recently diagnosed her with fibromyalgia and are treating her with medication as such and it has helped but she still struggles to eat. On top of that she has been diagnosed with bpd since she was 18, and struggles daily with that, as well as was diagnosed with ocd at 21.
