I know we make a lot of jokes about \"starvation mode\", but there is a part of truth to it. If you eat 400 calories a day for a few days in a row, the lizard brain will fear starvation and decide to burn muscle and save a lot of the fat. This was tried in studies: people on a 800 kcal a day diet lose more or less the same fat as people in a 400 kcal a day diet. That's because with 800 a day and one refeed a week, controlling good macro input and doing strength training, you can tell your brain: \"I know it's not a lot of food, but I need the muscle\" -because of the strength training- \"see?\" -because of the once- a week refeed, and it will listen.\n\nIf you try to do that with 400 calories, the brain just doesn't listen. \n\nActually it's wonderfully efficient for it to do so. It will keep you alive in case of famine. Think about it, if you are bulky and starving, the muscle eats up your much needed calorie reserves. It makes complete sense to burn the muscle, because doing so will make you spend less energy.\n\nIt's wonderful for surviving in food-lacking environments.
