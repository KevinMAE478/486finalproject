Congestive behavioral therapy aims at changing your thoughts and behavior so you can improve how you feel. It's goal oriented too. A big part of it is mindfulness. The therapy is supposed to help you think about food in a different way. Not as something to turn to for support but for nutrients. Ideas like, how hungry are you really? What's bothering you that you feel you need to eat to feel better? Dig a little deeper to find the real source of the problem and work on it. Little by little. You can go to Barnes and Noble and in their psychology section there are a ton of books that might help. Even a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook that you fill out on your own. \n\nI also wanted to tell you that my mom is 63 and my dad is 60. They have both shead a ton of weight. My mom needs a knee replacement and so she decided to take a water aerobics class at the local gym. That's helped her a lot and it's easy on her knee so she doesn't have to use it as an excuse. My dad had a stroke last April so that really forced him into losing weight. \n\nFor your parents I rule say your mom sounds easiest to motivate. Try going to the gym with her and tell her about not dieting but maybe just changing to a clean eating. My parents did that too. It will take your mom longer to lose the weight but don't let that deter her. For your dad I would go for the step mom to help you get to him. If he just stops going to the fast foods places he'll already lose a ton. Same for if they drink soda. After about a week or two the cravings stop. Then if they eat the food again they are what it actually taste like and it's actually scary how easily you are it before. \n\nI was 230ibs in high school. Miserable. I got to college and gained a little more but not much freshman year. Around jr. Year I really got into health. I ate really well, exercised daily etc. I felt great and got my weight down to 154ibs and I was still going. Well my dad had a stroke and I lost my shit. Had a mental breakdown. Turned back to good after developing major depressive disorder, started cutting myself, I mean I lost it. I am currently at 185ibs and haven't really moved from there. I'm trying to get back into it. It's so hard even though I remember how happy it made me. I kinda just don't care. I'm starting therapy on Monday so I'm hoping that will help me care about my life again. As a suggesting to you personally, I planned on printing out old photos of myself when I was miserable and putting it on my go to foods. That way I can be mindful of eating it. Hopefully that way I remember that food isn't going to fix anything. Just like alcoholics drink to avoid problems, alcohol tend only to make things worse. over eating bad food does the same thing. \n\nI hope I've helped some, good luck with your parents. I know they'll come around. Good luck to you too. Being concerned about your parents I know you'll be able to get over the food mentality.

Congestive behavioral therapy aims at changing your thoughts and behavior so you can improve how you feel. It&amp;#39;s goal oriented too. A big part of it is mindfulness. The therapy is supposed to help you think about food in a different way. Not as something to turn to for support but for nutrients. Ideas like, how hungry are you really? What&amp;#39;s bothering you that you feel you need to eat to feel better? Dig a little deeper to find the real source of the problem and work on it. Little by little. You can go to Barnes and Noble and in their psychology section there are a ton of books that might help. Even a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook that you fill out on your own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to tell you that my mom is 63 and my dad is 60. They have both shead a ton of weight. My mom needs a knee replacement and so she decided to take a water aerobics class at the local gym. That&amp;#39;s helped her a lot and it&amp;#39;s easy on her knee so she doesn&amp;#39;t have to use it as an excuse. My dad had a stroke last April so that really forced him into losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For your parents I rule say your mom sounds easiest to motivate. Try going to the gym with her and tell her about not dieting but maybe just changing to a clean eating. My parents did that too. It will take your mom longer to lose the weight but don&amp;#39;t let that deter her. For your dad I would go for the step mom to help you get to him. If he just stops going to the fast foods places he&amp;#39;ll already lose a ton. Same for if they drink soda. After about a week or two the cravings stop. Then if they eat the food again they are what it actually taste like and it&amp;#39;s actually scary how easily you are it before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was 230ibs in high school. Miserable. I got to college and gained a little more but not much freshman year. Around jr. Year I really got into health. I ate really well, exercised daily etc. I felt great and got my weight down to 154ibs and I was still going. Well my dad had a stroke and I lost my shit. Had a mental breakdown. Turned back to good after developing major depressive disorder, started cutting myself, I mean I lost it. I am currently at 185ibs and haven&amp;#39;t really moved from there. I&amp;#39;m trying to get back into it. It&amp;#39;s so hard even though I remember how happy it made me. I kinda just don&amp;#39;t care. I&amp;#39;m starting therapy on Monday so I&amp;#39;m hoping that will help me care about my life again. As a suggesting to you personally, I planned on printing out old photos of myself when I was miserable and putting it on my go to foods. That way I can be mindful of eating it. Hopefully that way I remember that food isn&amp;#39;t going to fix anything. Just like alcoholics drink to avoid problems, alcohol tend only to make things worse. over eating bad food does the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;ve helped some, good luck with your parents. I know they&amp;#39;ll come around. Good luck to you too. Being concerned about your parents I know you&amp;#39;ll be able to get over the food mentality. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg8xgbi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492187358.0, "created_utc": 1492158558.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65825h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9odf1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oldercatlady", "parent_id": "t1_dg8ntgz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is a list of the nine \"thinking mistakes\" she talks about in the book.

I'll still lose weight.\"\n\nThinking Mistake #4: Emotional Reasoning\n\n\nYou think your ideas are true even though objective evidence says not.\n\n\n\"Since I feel like a failure for having strayed, I really must be a failure.\"\n\n\n\"I feel like I just have to have something sweet right now.\"\n\n\nThinking Mistake #5: Mind Reading\n\n\nYou're sure of what others are thinking, even in the absence of compelling data.\n\n\n\"People will think I am strange if I don't drink alcohol at the party.\"\n\n\n\"She'll think I'm rude if I don't try the brownies she baked.\"\n\n\nThinking Mistake #6: Self-Deluded Thinking\n\n\nYou rationalize by telling yourself things you don't really believe at other times.\n\n\n\"If no one sees me eating, it doesn't count.\"\n\n\n\"It won't matter if I give in to my cravings.\"\n\n\nMe this weekend: It won't matter if I overeat I hardly ever overeat.\n\nThinking Mistake #7: Unhelpful Rules\n\n\nYou mandate actions without taking circumstances into consideration.\n\n\n\"I can't waste food\" (Me with the leftovers this week.)\n\n\n\"I can't inconvenience my family by cooking healthier meals or getting the junk food out of the house.\"\n\nThinking Mistake #8: Justification\n\n\nYou link two unrelated concepts (to justify your eating).\n\n\n\"I deserve to eat this because I'm so stressed out.\"\n\n\n\"It's okay to this because it's free.\"\n\nThinking Mistake #9: Exaggerated Thinking\n\n\n\nYou make a situation seem greater or worse than it really is.\n\n\n\n\"I can't stand this craving.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have no willpower.\"\n\n\n\nMe: All I ever want to do is eat.\n\nIf you have any questions, ask. If you go to Amazon and look at the book (hot pink cover) if you click on it you can look inside and read some of it.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a list of the nine &amp;quot;thinking mistakes&amp;quot; she talks about in the book.
