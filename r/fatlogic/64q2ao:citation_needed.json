It&amp;#39;s the gaining it that&amp;#39;s tricky. Since moving to where I am now I stopped biking and eating regular portion sizes and was able to gain back over 50lbs in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with other women with PCOS, I know how tricky it can sometimes be. But I also hate when they use our illness as an excuse to just not even try, telling people it&amp;#39;s IMPOSSIBLE to lose weight when I know for a fact that it isn&amp;#39;t. My own weight loss, the weight loss of hundreds of other women in our support groups and all the women with PCOS who are slim and have always been slim say otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However PCOS has a few symptoms (depression for example) that can make it mentally difficult to lose weight. I try not to question an individual women&amp;#39;s journey with PCOS and weight gain/loss because in the end all our symptoms are different, and our levels of depression and anxiety are different. But just, stop spewing that PCOS = weight loss is impossible because it isn&amp;#39;t &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg4iarc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957155.0, "created_utc": 1491928355.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q2ao", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kza6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "somerandomgamer0", "parent_id": "t3_64q2ao", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "70% of women \"acquire\" PCOS?\n\nCongrats, lady, that's one of the most ridiculous pieces of fatlogic I've ever seen.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;70% of women &amp;quot;acquire&amp;quot; PCOS?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congrats, lady, that&amp;#39;s one of the most ridiculous pieces of fatlogic I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg4kza6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960086.0, "created_utc": 1491931286.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q2ao", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q2ao", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q2ao", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4sbrt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "youllknow", "parent_id": "t1_dg4n604", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah I saw that ad and comment threads.
