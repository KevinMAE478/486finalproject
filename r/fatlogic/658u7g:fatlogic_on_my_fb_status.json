Thus, mechanistic data from animal models can be highly useful because they permit greater experimental control. Results from animal studies in both the agricultural sector and the laboratory indicate that artificial sweeteners may not only *promote food intake and weight gain* but can also induce *metabolic alterations* in a wide range of animal species. As a result, *simple substitution* of artificial sweeteners for sugars in humans may not produce the *intended consequences*.\"\n\nSo there's lots of research that's exploring the topics and there are preliminary findings that suggest *certain* artificial sweeteners might not be the calorie free panacea of weight loss ... but it's likely the Facebook poster read an \"article\" somewhere saying \"Artificial sweeteners cause fat to congeal out of thin air!\" and ran with it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research. Other&amp;#39;s have mentioned it in their responses but it increasingly looks like that at least certain artificial sweeteners (a broad group of substances) have the potential to initiate a metabolic effect that could, when combined with other dietary and lifestyle factors, promote food intake/weight gain. Mechanisms of action need much further studies but the body of research is growing and is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;one recent example with a novel approach\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27387506\"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27387506&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the abstract (emphasis my own) &amp;quot;Obtaining mechanistic data on artificial sweetener use in humans in relation to metabolic dysfunction is difficult due to the long time frames over which dietary factors might exert their effects on health and the &lt;em&gt;large number of confounding variables&lt;/em&gt; that need to be considered. Thus, mechanistic data from animal models can be highly useful because they permit greater experimental control. Results from animal studies in both the agricultural sector and the laboratory indicate that artificial sweeteners may not only &lt;em&gt;promote food intake and weight gain&lt;/em&gt; but can also induce &lt;em&gt;metabolic alterations&lt;/em&gt; in a wide range of animal species. As a result, &lt;em&gt;simple substitution&lt;/em&gt; of artificial sweeteners for sugars in humans may not produce the &lt;em&gt;intended consequences&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s lots of research that&amp;#39;s exploring the topics and there are preliminary findings that suggest &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; artificial sweeteners might not be the calorie free panacea of weight loss ... but it&amp;#39;s likely the Facebook poster read an &amp;quot;article&amp;quot; somewhere saying &amp;quot;Artificial sweeteners cause fat to congeal out of thin air!&amp;quot; and ran with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg93lhu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203846.0, "created_utc": 1492175046.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8y5nc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lewwatt", "parent_id": "t1_dg8pbrj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's the kernel of truth then?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the kernel of truth then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg8y5nc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492189663.0, "created_utc": 1492160863.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8pbrj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yamiatworky", "parent_id": "t3_658u7g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Less \"fat logic\" and more \" I read some blog post somewhere and decided to pretend to be a scientist today!\" \n\nThere's a kernel of truth in there surrounded buy some delicious delicious pseudo scientific nonsense.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less &amp;quot;fat logic&amp;quot; and more &amp;quot; I read some blog post somewhere and decided to pretend to be a scientist today!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a kernel of truth in there surrounded buy some delicious delicious pseudo scientific nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg8pbrj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492169693.0, "created_utc": 1492140893.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658u7g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ck6m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "prettyradical", "parent_id": "t3_658u7g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mostly eat chicken breast or ground beef of lean pork or shrimp and non-starch veggies.
