Clearly fat logic won't go away until we get these people to realize that being fat is not who they are, it is what has happened to them.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this person sees themselves as &amp;quot;a fat&amp;quot;.  When they see being fat as who they are and not a description of a their situation, then they take offense to people treating it like a disease or an epidemic.  It being a core aspect of themselves makes it seem like something that can&amp;#39;t be changed and efforts to remove it is an effort to remove them rather than it being a periphery feature of the person that can be changed without changing the core person just like many other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is the same as the uneducated seeing themselves as &amp;quot;a stupid&amp;quot; or the poor seeing themselves as &amp;quot;a white trash&amp;quot;.  Others are trying to help you be a better person, but if you see those negative traits about yourself as a part of who you are, and not where you are or what you are doing, then any attempt to solve it will seem like a personal attack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest issue that I have seen with all of the fat logic, but I have never seen it expressed so clearly.  Usually they dance around the concept and imply it without stating it as though it is something obvious and they don&amp;#39;t get why others don&amp;#39;t see it the same way as them.  However, this person referring to themselves as &amp;quot;a fat&amp;quot; simply confirms what I have suspected.
