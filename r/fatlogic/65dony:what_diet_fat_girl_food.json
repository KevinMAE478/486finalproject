It makes me mad how many people think they can only lose weight if they cut out everything tasty, or only ever eat salad, or eat basically nothing at all.   \nAnd then they tell me \"you eat all of that crap, how do you stay skinny?!\".\n\nThere's two simple reasons:  \nFirstly, yes, sometimes I eat unhealthy crap, and a shit load of it. But what I do is that I do that *rarely*. Yeah, you saw me eat like eight large pieces of wonderfully unhealthy cake - but I only do that once a year! Of course I can eat thousands of calories in one sitting if I only do it once a year. If I finish off a bottle of wine at one party, do you assume I'm an alcoholic?   \nAnd secondly, it's all about balance. If you ate dinner with me every day, you'd think I'd have to be a lot heavier, because I almost always cook and I like to go for a generous amount of fat. But if you only ate lunch with me on all those days, you'd think I'd have to be skin and bones, because I usually have a very light lunch, and it's almost all vegetables or a small sandwich or something. If you saw me on only on the weekends, you'd think I'm always snacking, eating Joghurts and fruits and chocolate and cakes and what have you. But then during a week, I practically never do that and end up balancing it out again. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is, you can eat whatever you want! You just have to find the right balance, and you need to find a way to do that that works for you.   \nI've got a weakness for sweets, chocolate and particularly ice cream, so what I do is I have some self control in the supermarket and don't buy it. I still get to eat it, but only when someone else bought it, so it doesn't happen that often and I'm not tempted too often. In other areas, it's not hard for me to just stop when I'm full, so I have no problem cooking fatty foods because I know that I can exercise portion control.   \nFor someone else, it might work better in another way, maybe they can't control themselves around pizza and pasta, so they have to try and rarely buy or make these dishes. Instead, maybe they have no problem with sweets, so it's just about knowing to stop after a few pieces.   \nPeople just need to understand that it's not about specific items of food, they can try and find whatever works best for them. There's not one thing that they have to cut out, or have to eat, they just have to figure out a way to balance out their calories.

Of course I can eat thousands of calories in one sitting if I only do it once a year. If I finish off a bottle of wine at one party, do you assume I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic?&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd secondly, it&amp;#39;s all about balance. If you ate dinner with me every day, you&amp;#39;d think I&amp;#39;d have to be a lot heavier, because I almost always cook and I like to go for a generous amount of fat. But if you only ate lunch with me on all those days, you&amp;#39;d think I&amp;#39;d have to be skin and bones, because I usually have a very light lunch, and it&amp;#39;s almost all vegetables or a small sandwich or something. If you saw me on only on the weekends, you&amp;#39;d think I&amp;#39;m always snacking, eating Joghurts and fruits and chocolate and cakes and what have you. But then during a week, I practically never do that and end up balancing it out again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is, you can eat whatever you want! You just have to find the right balance, and you need to find a way to do that that works for you.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve got a weakness for sweets, chocolate and particularly ice cream, so what I do is I have some self control in the supermarket and don&amp;#39;t buy it. I still get to eat it, but only when someone else bought it, so it doesn&amp;#39;t happen that often and I&amp;#39;m not tempted too often. In other areas, it&amp;#39;s not hard for me to just stop when I&amp;#39;m full, so I have no problem cooking fatty foods because I know that I can exercise portion control.&lt;br/&gt;\nFor someone else, it might work better in another way, maybe they can&amp;#39;t control themselves around pizza and pasta, so they have to try and rarely buy or make these dishes. Instead, maybe they have no problem with sweets, so it&amp;#39;s just about knowing to stop after a few pieces.&lt;br/&gt;\nPeople just need to understand that it&amp;#39;s not about specific items of food, they can try and find whatever works best for them. There&amp;#39;s not one thing that they have to cut out, or have to eat, they just have to figure out a way to balance out their calories. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg9wps2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492240094.0, "created_utc": 1492211294.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dony", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9uv6a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "00Broobs00", "parent_id": "t1_dg9kjpf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know right.

So when i started, i studied 15 minutes per day. Then 20. Then 30 etc. Now i can casually study for 14 hours per day, and be perfectly happy doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dgadkd1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492266048.0, "created_utc": 1492237248.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgacmzg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "keepcalmandFREAKOUT", "parent_id": "t1_dg9u9ln", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "even here on reddit this shit gets attention and applause.
