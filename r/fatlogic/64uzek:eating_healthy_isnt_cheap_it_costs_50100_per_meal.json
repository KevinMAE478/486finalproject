I get it. I&amp;#39;ve been there. But you can still lose weight. Just eat less of those dollar menu items. Four nuggets instead of eight. One cheeseburger instead of two. Tap water instead of a Coke. No dipping sauce with the nuggets. It&amp;#39;ll be hard at first to break the addiction, but you&amp;#39;ll feel much better once you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I just want to edit to add that living in poverty conditions can lead to weight gain when the person is back in a position of being able to afford excess due to psychological conditioning to gorge on food when it is available out of fear of future scarcity. That&amp;#39;s different, it still depends on there being excess, but that&amp;#39;s a legit psychological condition that requires therapy. So I&amp;#39;m not saying that poverty can&amp;#39;t contribute to obesity, but being too poor to buy cabbage and chicken breasts doesn&amp;#39;t automatically mean you need to order the Big Mac meal versus the side salad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg5g6cr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491998852.0, "created_utc": 1491970052.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uzek", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg599dn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hairybreeks", "parent_id": "t3_64uzek", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Kind of true, but then again I'm pretty poor, juggling a few part-time and freelance gigs, and still do a reasonable job of meal prep.
