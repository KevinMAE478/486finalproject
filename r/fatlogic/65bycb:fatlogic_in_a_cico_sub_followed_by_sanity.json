His Strava is the sickest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, looking just now he is almost at 3000 miles for the year and the normal riding season is just starting for most people. 50,000 lifetime miles after joining mid 2012, so he is averaging over 10k miles a year.  Also, he&amp;#39;s not just tooling about, has 2 pages of KOM segments.  It&amp;#39;s not like his hobby is completely consuming his life either, still has time for a competitive financial analyst job, family and social life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of overweight people underestimate the disparity between their total average intake versus the total average intake of others, but it is certainly possible for people of all weights to underestimate the disparity of total activity level between themselves and others.  I may not be as much of an outlier as my friend listed above but I also bike commute daily and put lots of miles down (almost 1000 for the year).  People who commit to physical hobbies are going to be able to eat a noticeable amount more than people who commit to the AHA recommended 150 minutes of intense exercise a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg9qco9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231809.0, "created_utc": 1492203009.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93dgo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 328, "report_reasons": null, "author": "likemachines", "parent_id": "t3_65bycb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thin people with \"high metabolisms\" are always eating less than they think they are, while fat people with \"slow metabolisms\" are always eating more than they think they are.
