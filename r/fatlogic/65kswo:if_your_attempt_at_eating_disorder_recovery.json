It&amp;#39;s purely based on binge/purge cycles. I think AN gets the most attention simply because we&amp;#39;re totally fascinated by very thin young women as a culture (like Edie Sedgwick, who&amp;#39;s dead but still has a cult following.) Extreme cases are also very shocking to see and I think part of it is our obsession with very disturbing images. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;#39;re also kinda numb to what underweight looks like. I read that the weights at time of diagnosis with AN have actually gone down instead of going up (like, you&amp;#39;d think that since we know more about it now, it would be diagnosed earlier, but it&amp;#39;s actually diagnosed later). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also tend to ignore EDs that aren&amp;#39;t necessarily restrictive. I worry like hell about people who put on weight, especially when I know they are under a lot of stress--but asking about it is seen as catty or rude, whereas if they were dropping weight, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be. We tend not to see binges as unhealthy, like &amp;quot;oh everyone eats too much sometimes&amp;quot; but that&amp;#39;s not a binge at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advocacy and treatment have a ton of room for improvement. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dgbkx3c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492340051.0, "created_utc": 1492311251.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbhzvc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crunchingtime18", "parent_id": "t3_65kswo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I do think there needs to be some de-centering of thinness in eating disorder advocacy and recovery.
