I used to weigh over 300 lbs and struggle with binge eating disorder (down to 174 before my current pregnancy) \n\nI grew up with no boundaries about healthy eating and watched my mother equate food with happiness. She's been up to almost 400 lbs and now is on this crazy restricted diet where she has dropped 90 lbs in a couple years. Im proud of her but I see her continue to struggle with portions, especially evident as she nags me to eat \"enough\" during my pregnancy. And I'm sitting in a car next to my 350+ lb adult autistic brother right now. She blames his weight on the fact he doesn't walk as much anymore, not the fact that he can put away two pounds of cheese in one sitting and eats like he's in a competition when she puts an overflowing plate in front of him. \"But his blood sugar is just fine! He's healthy!\"\n\nShe loves me, truly, but she has always seen putting boundaries on food or just acknowledging  that someone's weight is unhealthy is in effect shaming that person. I remember begging to start slim fast at 13 and yelling at her  that we were all fat, and she was so offended she wouldn't speak with me for the rest of the day (she was around 230 lbs at that time). I had no education or guidance on how to manage my binging at that point, and spent another almost 2 decades obese and developed medical issues due to the fact I couldn't make myself stop hurting my body with overeating. \n\nAs I get ready to welcome my first child, a daughter into this world, I have spent a lot of time pondering how to provide healthy boundaries and education about food. Parents really do need to take responsibility. Turning a blind eye and modeling unhealthy eating are neglectful. Maybe not intentionally, but still can effect long lasting consequences.

My mom is actually in town today and made a comment while we were out to eat that I don&amp;#39;t clean my plate anymore. I used to weigh over 300 lbs and struggle with binge eating disorder (down to 174 before my current pregnancy) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up with no boundaries about healthy eating and watched my mother equate food with happiness. She&amp;#39;s been up to almost 400 lbs and now is on this crazy restricted diet where she has dropped 90 lbs in a couple years. Im proud of her but I see her continue to struggle with portions, especially evident as she nags me to eat &amp;quot;enough&amp;quot; during my pregnancy. And I&amp;#39;m sitting in a car next to my 350+ lb adult autistic brother right now. She blames his weight on the fact he doesn&amp;#39;t walk as much anymore, not the fact that he can put away two pounds of cheese in one sitting and eats like he&amp;#39;s in a competition when she puts an overflowing plate in front of him. &amp;quot;But his blood sugar is just fine!
