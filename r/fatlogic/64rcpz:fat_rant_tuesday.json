Our ~200 lb coworker, \"Nancy,\" asked how we afford to go on vacations all the time. We explained this place was about 2 hours drive from the office, an easy driving route and easy low grade trail. (You don't start someone out with a miserable arduous hike to get them interested in the outdoors.) Showed her some photos of the wildlife we'd seen, the river, lake, small waterfalls and walking along the mountain ridges. \n\nNancy seemed fascinated by this magical place, so we invited her family. Dan said we'd all go together. Lunch, kayaking, you name it. We'll provide our stuff and you're free to use it.\n\nNancy, her boyfriend and their kids piled into the car and off we went. It was about 55 degrees and sunny. On the way, Nancy and Co. exclaimed about the lack of restaurants. That was it. Not the scenery, just no restaurants. Whatever, I don't expect open-mouthed praise. I'd offered up a loaf of bread, peanut butter and jelly and black beans and tortillas. I'd brought more than enough for four adult sized people (Dan, myself, Nancy, her eldest child and her Boyfriend) and two kids.\n\nAfter our picnic next to the lake, we started teaching the kids how to safely kayak. Nancy didn't feel well. I'm hot, I'm cold, I feel sick. I felt bad for her, so gave her the key to my car to go back and rest. Her boyfriend went with her. In any other situation, this would be all kinds of red flags. Me and my coworker with their three kids we'd never met before and handing keys over. To be fair, I thought she was genuinely ill and her kids were busy being taught to kayak with Dan. We eventually shored the kayaks and headed up the trail.\n\nThe kids had a blast. Dan and I found a new appreciation for all the little things we take for granted through these kids who had never been to the forest before. (Never? There was a teenager and we live near a national forest?) Either way, they waded in the river, climbed up a small waterfall, climbed on everything and were grinning and getting along famously.\nTook tons of pictures of them to give to Nancy.\n\nOur hike took about 4 times longer than usual because the kids wanted to do everything, and that was fine by us. We crossed back over the river to the parking area about 5pm and...You saw this coming, didn't you. It was obvious what happened. Nancy and her boyfriend stole my car to drive half down the mountain to a burger place. When they got back around dusk, they blamed the restaurant taking too long with their sit-down order. They thought it would be inconsiderate to eat it in my \"borrowed\" car.\n\nThere were children present and I work with these people, so my line of questioning was, \"and you thought it was okay to lie to me about being sick, take a car that isn't yours, leave your kids and your hosts in the woods in the dark to go eat greasy food when there's plenty left in the cooler?\"\n\nNancy was taken aback that I accused her of lying. She was sick, she swore up and down. She ate too much for breakfast and lunch in anticipation of a four mile hike and vomited due to the exertion of helping load kayaks into the water. Now she's angry with me. \n\nBut wait, there's more! Oh. No there's not more. They came back, ate enough packed food for 7 people to have a moderate after-hike dinner, *then* they went to eat! All our food, including for their own children, was gone. Their solution was to go back to the burger place and Dan and I would foot the bill for ourselves and their three kids. Because the only tourist spot for junk food is expensive.\n\nDan and I bought their kids food and went without, ourselves. We didn't want the trip to be ruined for the kids. Our drive back was peppered with stories from the kids about the cool stuff they'd done on the hike, and Nancy and Boyfriend making disparaging noises.\n\nIt took two weeks for Nancy to speak to me, on social media, to ask about the pics of her kids. I sent them to her because I don't post people's kids, I posted my own photos without them.\nNancy uploaded them as her own (hey, they're her kids and I gave her the pictures) and went on and on about things that happened on her hike that didn't even happen because she wasn't there.\nHow they're avid hikers.\n\nLater on, I asked if her kids would like to come hiking with me again. She aid no, and her reasoning was that it was too much work for her (??), I had made her feel bad about it, and I had set unreasonable standards for her kids. All they ever talk about is hiking, and it makes her feel like a shit mother. So of course, rather than put in a little effort to walk, deny your children as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be long, and I&amp;#39;m filling my lunch break with this story because I&amp;#39;m too full of vitriol at the woman sitting near me to be hungry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My coworker &amp;quot;Dan&amp;quot; and I were comparing side trails of a popular hiking spot via phone pictures.

They thought it would be inconsiderate to eat it in my &amp;quot;borrowed&amp;quot; car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were children present and I work with these people, so my line of questioning was, &amp;quot;and you thought it was okay to lie to me about being sick, take a car that isn&amp;#39;t yours, leave your kids and your hosts in the woods in the dark to go eat greasy food when there&amp;#39;s plenty left in the cooler?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nancy was taken aback that I accused her of lying. She was sick, she swore up and down. She ate too much for breakfast and lunch in anticipation of a four mile hike and vomited due to the exertion of helping load kayaks into the water. Now she&amp;#39;s angry with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;#39;s more! Oh. No there&amp;#39;s not more. They came back, ate enough packed food for 7 people to have a moderate after-hike dinner, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; they went to eat! All our food, including for their own children, was gone. Their solution was to go back to the burger place and Dan and I would foot the bill for ourselves and their three kids. Because the only tourist spot for junk food is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan and I bought their kids food and went without, ourselves. We didn&amp;#39;t want the trip to be ruined for the kids. Our drive back was peppered with stories from the kids about the cool stuff they&amp;#39;d done on the hike, and Nancy and Boyfriend making disparaging noises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took two weeks for Nancy to speak to me, on social media, to ask about the pics of her kids. I sent them to her because I don&amp;#39;t post people&amp;#39;s kids, I posted my own photos without them.\nNancy uploaded them as her own (hey, they&amp;#39;re her kids and I gave her the pictures) and went on and on about things that happened on her hike that didn&amp;#39;t even happen because she wasn&amp;#39;t there.\nHow they&amp;#39;re avid hikers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on, I asked if her kids would like to come hiking with me again. She aid no, and her reasoning was that it was too much work for her (??), I had made her feel bad about it, and I had set unreasonable standards for her kids. All they ever talk about is hiking, and it makes her feel like a shit mother. So of course, rather than put in a little effort to walk, deny your children as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg4u531", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491970010.0, "created_utc": 1491941210.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 342}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rcpz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rcpz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rcpz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4g5es", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 55, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bc2zb", "parent_id": "t1_dg4e6md", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To put it simply as possible, T1 doesn't produce insulin, T2 doesn't respond to insulin.

He's about as tall as I am (5'7\"), though I suspect a lot of that height loss is due to him slouching because of his massive gut. He has T2 diabetes, a serious heart condition, and he smokes. He has done absolutely nothing to change what he's eating and has made no moves to exercise. My fianc\u00e9 has tried every single angle to tell him that his diabetes/heart condition/literally entire life would improve if he just watched what he ate and even just walked. Literally anything would be an improvement. But he just fires back with \"I'm too old for this\" and continues to slowly kill himself. It makes me so sad.\n\nMy future mother-in-law is an alcoholic and is short with a beer belly. She insists she \"hardly eats anything\" and still cannot lose weight. As my fianc\u00e9 and I have tried to inform her, beer doesn't help you lose weight, nor does it help you to be healthy. She also smokes a ton and stays home what is probably an unhealthy amount. More sadness. Though, she was asking my fianc\u00e9 and I what we were doing and eating this weekend, so maybe there's a small ray of hope there. But still. More sadness.\n\nThe only one I've got any sort of hope for is my future-sister-in-law. She's a little overweight, but has some severe mental illness that makes her life a good deal harder. She and I talked at length about eating healthy (she brought it up) and working out last time we saw her, and when we arrived at their house this time, there was tofu and other healthy-type foods in the refrigerator, all of it belonging to her. And, she went for a run with my fianc\u00e9 and me on Saturday, so I am hoping she'll continue on. But man, when you live in a house like that, it's just so hard.\n\n*sigh*\n\nGood news is that between my fianc\u00e9 and me, we've lost 50 pounds. I've lost 30 of that and am continuing on my way down. So....there's that, I suppose. Still, this shit just makes me so sad.

It&amp;#39;s not so much a fat rant but an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sad and have nowhere else to go with this that people will understand&amp;quot; rant with some very mild fatlogic sprinkled in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My future father-in-law is...well, if I were to guess, he&amp;#39;s probably pushing 350. He&amp;#39;s about as tall as I am (5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot;), though I suspect a lot of that height loss is due to him slouching because of his massive gut. He has T2 diabetes, a serious heart condition, and he smokes. He has done absolutely nothing to change what he&amp;#39;s eating and has made no moves to exercise. My fianc\u00e9 has tried every single angle to tell him that his diabetes/heart condition/literally entire life would improve if he just watched what he ate and even just walked. Literally anything would be an improvement. But he just fires back with &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too old for this&amp;quot; and continues to slowly kill himself. It makes me so sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My future mother-in-law is an alcoholic and is short with a beer belly. She insists she &amp;quot;hardly eats anything&amp;quot; and still cannot lose weight. As my fianc\u00e9 and I have tried to inform her, beer doesn&amp;#39;t help you lose weight, nor does it help you to be healthy. She also smokes a ton and stays home what is probably an unhealthy amount. More sadness. Though, she was asking my fianc\u00e9 and I what we were doing and eating this weekend, so maybe there&amp;#39;s a small ray of hope there. But still. More sadness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only one I&amp;#39;ve got any sort of hope for is my future-sister-in-law. She&amp;#39;s a little overweight, but has some severe mental illness that makes her life a good deal harder. She and I talked at length about eating healthy (she brought it up) and working out last time we saw her, and when we arrived at their house this time, there was tofu and other healthy-type foods in the refrigerator, all of it belonging to her. And, she went for a run with my fianc\u00e9 and me on Saturday, so I am hoping she&amp;#39;ll continue on. But man, when you live in a house like that, it&amp;#39;s just so hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good news is that between my fianc\u00e9 and me, we&amp;#39;ve lost 50 pounds. I&amp;#39;ve lost 30 of that and am continuing on my way down. So....there&amp;#39;s that, I suppose. Still, this shit just makes me so sad.

Relatedly, my dad says he&amp;#39;s lost 8 pounds in the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked my mom what she was doing for her Las Vegas diet and she said, &amp;quot;just cutting down,&amp;quot; which is a great start. My dad said he&amp;#39;d stopped eating carbs so I made a point of saying, &amp;quot;so you&amp;#39;re creating a calorie deficit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I offered to calculate my parents&amp;#39; TDEE so they&amp;#39;d know just how much to eat, but my dad is resistant. He said an online calculator couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be accurate. I plugged in their stats and my dad&amp;#39;s TDEE was 2300 and my mom&amp;#39;s was 1300. My dad was flabbergasted. &amp;quot;Your&amp;#39;s is 1000 less? But we eat the same amount!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set my mom up with a calorie counting app and she was discouraged by &amp;quot;how little&amp;quot; she eats before it reaches 1200 calories and I sympathized (as I am also petite.) I asked if she&amp;#39;s been feeling hungry since she started cutting down and she said yes, but that it&amp;#39;s okay to feel a little hungry sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all on Sunday, so she counted calories on Sunday and yesterday, but I&amp;#39;m encouraged to see her continue!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg4pkhv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491965111.0, "created_utc": 1491936311.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 46}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rcpz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg59eki", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FrankieLulu", "parent_id": "t3_64rcpz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I work in a medical clinic.
