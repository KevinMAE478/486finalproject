Sure! But is that what fat women or women of color have been experiencing for centuries? ABSOLUTELY.\n\nFat women and women of color have had a hard time finding ready-to-wear clothes that fit them at the mall for centuries, eh? Interesting, because prior to the Industrial Revolution, most people made their own clothes. Until well into the 20th century, clothing items were either purchased bespoke or made at home. \n\nThe entire idea of ready-made, easily available, inexpensive clothing that fits a majority of people is a recent invention and a first-world privilege. \n\nAnd the ability to acquire that clothing at such affordable prices capitalizes on terrible labor practices and working conditions that predominantly affect women of color in the developing world. (Though not *fat* women of color; somehow those third-worlders manage to stay slim despite the fact that they can't afford to eat healthy food or go to the gym or get It Works ... must be genetics.)\n\nI wonder if they also make sure to buy American when they shop? Because if we're talking about female oppression, women (and children) who work in the dangerous conditions of the garment industry overseas are of far more concern to me than some chubby, comparatively rich lady who's all pissy that she got sized out of Hot Topic. \n\nSee also:\nhttps://bellatory.com/fashion-industry/Ready-to-Wear-A-Short-History-of-the-Garment-Industry\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/books/review/overdressed-by-elizabeth-l-cline.html\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does it limit you in places you can shop? Sure! But is that what fat women or women of color have been experiencing for centuries? ABSOLUTELY.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fat women and women of color have had a hard time finding ready-to-wear clothes that fit them at the mall for centuries, eh? Interesting, because prior to the Industrial Revolution, most people made their own clothes. Until well into the 20th century, clothing items were either purchased bespoke or made at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire idea of ready-made, easily available, inexpensive clothing that fits a majority of people is a recent invention and a first-world privilege. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the ability to acquire that clothing at such affordable prices capitalizes on terrible labor practices and working conditions that predominantly affect women of color in the developing world. (Though not &lt;em&gt;fat&lt;/em&gt; women of color; somehow those third-worlders manage to stay slim despite the fact that they can&amp;#39;t afford to eat healthy food or go to the gym or get It Works ... must be genetics.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they also make sure to buy American when they shop?
