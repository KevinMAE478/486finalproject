But what it shows me is that you're looking for an excuse to not count calories.\n\nThe action of counting calories is what's most important. It's okay to estimate. If you've set a limit like 1200 calories per day, it's okay if maybe you did 1300 one day. Maybe you'll do 1100 the next. The most important thing is that you're taking action towards progress.\n\nIf you've set a goal to jog 5K per day, maybe one day you jog 5075 meters, maybe another day you jog 4850 meters. The important thing is taking action.\n\nOne of my jobs is teaching private guitar lessons. I love to hear the excuses of kids who haven't practiced their lessons for the week. With my young, beginning students, I might give them a piece of music that takes literally 30 seconds to play, *once they pick up their instrument.* The most important thing is that they develop the habit of picking up the guitar every day. I tell them this. Just pick it up and play every day and that's enough.  \nMany of them just aren't interested (their parents are making them take lessons) so I have conversations like this:\n\n\"Did you practice this week?\"  \n\"No, I had to go to a birthday party.\"  \n\"That's okay.
