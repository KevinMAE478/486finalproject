Because now my legs don&amp;#39;t hurt when I walk on stairs, I can walk a long distance for hours without feeling out of breath or overly tired, I can run, I can jog, I can actually feel confident to take off my shirt when swimming, my resting heart rate is now 60-70bpm, my stomach doesn&amp;#39;t always hurt, I can actually exercise (and &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; it), I actually have abs for the first time in my life (not just for others to see but for my own satisfaction of being able to see them), the list goes on. I was never happy when I was overweight/obese. I always felt tired, couldn&amp;#39;t exercise, felt embarrassed and self conscious (still do at times but not as severe), was more depressed, etc. The extra fat wasn&amp;#39;t only damaging to my self esteem but it was damaging to my body as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dgcirnt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492403001.0, "created_utc": 1492374201.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pak7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgb7z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GingerShamrock14", "parent_id": "t3_65pak7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "didn't she used to work for a diet company, and then it failed? now she spews this bs all day. kind of sad, really", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;didn&amp;#39;t she used to work for a diet company, and then it failed? now she spews this bs all day. kind of sad, really&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dgcgb7z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492399824.0, "created_utc": 1492371024.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pak7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pak7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdz2wo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EuphemiaPhoenix", "parent_id": "t1_dgd99dw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was confused by that part too.
