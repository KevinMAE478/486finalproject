Past the initial loss in water weight, a ketogenic diet will lead to the same weight reduction and loss of fat mass as a diet incorporating carbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sochob.cl/pdf/obesidad_adulto/Ketogenic%20diets%20for%20weight%20loss%20A%20review%20of%20their%20principles%20safety%20and%20efficacy.pdf\"&gt;&amp;quot;the most common finding was\ngreater weight loss at 3\u20146 months on the KLC diet,\nwith the difference no longer seen at 12 months&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I recognize that a ketogenic diet may be beneficial when it comes to intuitively eating less instead of calorie counting as people say they&amp;#39;re more filling and satiating (something which I don&amp;#39;t agree with, but that&amp;#39;s subjective.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But controlled for calories, both diets are the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Returning to my point about satiety too, it&amp;#39;s funny how people will consistently report these diets being more filling and satiating than other diets but I&amp;#39;ve read an increasing amount of studies showing the opposite, that carbs are more filling as a macro than fat. Maybe people who go on to keto diets also up their protein intake by a substantial amount and it&amp;#39;s actually the protein that contributes to the satiety and not the fat per se.
