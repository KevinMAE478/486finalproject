Why the hell is a size 0 not fitting?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So every time I see a post complaining about lack of cute clothes, and the placement of clothes shaming them, I just get angry. Because of their addiction, healthy weight people like me can no longner find clothes that fit because they&amp;#39;ve been vanity sized to fit the 70% of the population that doesn&amp;#39;t want to see the correct size that they are. It&amp;#39;s a good thing I didn&amp;#39;t get rid of any of my old fat clothes yet, because I wouldn&amp;#39;t have anything to wear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently I need to go to Europe to do any clothes shopping because I&amp;#39;m not womanly enough here to find anything in my size. You will now find me shopping in the kids section just to find a dress for Easter. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg5t12h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492029856.0, "created_utc": 1492001056.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 75}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xldp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xldp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xldp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xldp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6heye", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "electricpotatoes", "parent_id": "t1_dg6997o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "rawr", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;rawr&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg6heye", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056967.0, "created_utc": 1492028167.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6997o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shannibearstar", "parent_id": "t1_dg62pc5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I will scale you and fite you.
