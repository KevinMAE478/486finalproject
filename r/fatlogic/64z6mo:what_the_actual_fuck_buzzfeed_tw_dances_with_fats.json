Metabolic adaptation is the difference between an expected metabolism (based on a formula) and the observed metabolism (based on actual measurements). Their previous work looked at a group of people who had undergone gastric bypass surgery, the NYT study looked at people from the biggest loser. \n\nMetabolic adaptation is often twisted by FAs as \"damaging your metabolism\", but it is a misconception. Your degree of metabolic adaptation is simply your expected metabolism compared to your measured metabolism. Depending on how you arrived at your formula for expected metabolism will greatly effect the end result. The authors here came up with a formula based on the starting weights and metabolisms of the study participants (hence *de novo*), and using that curve, extrapolated the participants metabolism at the end of the study. This extrapolation led to statistically significant levels of metabolic adaption, which was reported in the NYT as, \"People from TBL have drastically slowed metabolism\", which just isn't true. The finding was their expected metabolisms (which was extrapolated from their metabolisms at a much higher weight) was different than their measured metabolisms. \n\nIn this sub, we know weight loss is simple CICO, and so we tend to scoff at studies like this. Personally, I have not been able to figure out why these sorts of studies exist, but I have not been able to put in the time to track down why people in the obesity research community on focused on metabolic adaptation. From my experience in statistical modeling of biochemical data, it's a no brainer to me that extrapolating outside a curve is going to present with a high deviation between the expected and measured value. But, my knowledge of statistical modeling is not exhaustive, so there may be nuance here that I am not grasping.

Metabolic adaptation is the difference between an expected metabolism (based on a formula) and the observed metabolism (based on actual measurements). Their previous work looked at a group of people who had undergone gastric bypass surgery, the NYT study looked at people from the biggest loser. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metabolic adaptation is often twisted by FAs as &amp;quot;damaging your metabolism&amp;quot;, but it is a misconception. Your degree of metabolic adaptation is simply your expected metabolism compared to your measured metabolism. Depending on how you arrived at your formula for expected metabolism will greatly effect the end result. The authors here came up with a formula based on the starting weights and metabolisms of the study participants (hence &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt;), and using that curve, extrapolated the participants metabolism at the end of the study. This extrapolation led to statistically significant levels of metabolic adaption, which was reported in the NYT as, &amp;quot;People from TBL have drastically slowed metabolism&amp;quot;, which just isn&amp;#39;t true. The finding was their expected metabolisms (which was extrapolated from their metabolisms at a much higher weight) was different than their measured metabolisms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this sub, we know weight loss is simple CICO, and so we tend to scoff at studies like this. Personally, I have not been able to figure out why these sorts of studies exist, but I have not been able to put in the time to track down why people in the obesity research community on focused on metabolic adaptation.
