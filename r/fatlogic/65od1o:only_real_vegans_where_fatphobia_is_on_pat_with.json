NU is an abbreviation for Negative Utilitarianism, which is a philosophical viewpoint that says we should try to maximize the well-being of individuals and that individuals tend to care more about avoiding negative experiences like suffering more than experiencing positive ones, so we should focus more on that. \n\nNegative utilitarianism is an ethical theory that almost all philosophers consider to be insane and unworkable. A straightforward implication of strong negative utilitarianism is that the extermination of all sentient life would be the best possible outcome. Only a minority of EAs endorse negative utilitarianism, but I would still say that they are vastly overconfident in their views if they take it so seriously.\n\n&gt; EA is an abbreviation for effective altruism, which is the idea that we should attempt to empirically evaluate the impacts of our charitable work and giving and focus efforts to where they can have the largest impact\n\nThat's a nice example of [motte and bailey](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey) rhetoric. Much of the EA movement has little or no grounding in empirical evidence. Effective altruists even [admit that](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/m5/why_effective_altruism_used_to_be_like/): \"I think effective altruism used to have a lot of similarities to evidence-based medicine but is increasingly moving in the opposite direction.\" What EAs actually promote falls into four camps: the poverty, animal welfare, and AI doomsday (singularitarianism). I have no issue with the poverty people.\n\nThe animal welfare people have been known to inaccurately represent survey data, and have many conflicts of interest.

A straightforward implication of strong negative utilitarianism is that the extermination of all sentient life would be the best possible outcome.
