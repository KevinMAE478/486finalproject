That's not necessary; nobody *needs* organic to be healthy. \n\n\n* they bought items that are expensive in the first place. Grapes, where I'm from, are cheap as fuck, but these have to be like almost ten dollars a bag to make that total. Pineapple is off season, I assume, and expensive in the first place. Fucking *berries* are *always* the most expensive product in the whole supermarket! Nuts are expensive as well - they're worth it in term of calories, though, which isn't good if you're trying to lose weight either.   \nWhy does it have to be pineapple and berries? If you want to eat healthy fruit, eat what's local and inexpensive. Where I am, I can buy kilos upon kilos of apples for practically nothing. I'm sure there are cheap fruits wherever they are in the US, too. \n\n\n* yes, fruits are healthy. In moderation, like most things. How long is that supposed to last, for one person? Those are several pounds of fruit.   \nFruit are a healthy snack - healthier than cake, for sure - but they still have lots of calories and sugar. Two one-pound bags of grapes - 600 calories? A pineapple. 500 maybe? And then on top of that nuts, let's say a cup. Probably 700 or 800 calories. \nYou don't need that many fruit. Buy a few vegetables instead. And no, not expensive imported avocado for 5 bucks a pop, but whatever is the cheapest per kilogram. \n\n\n* they conflate healthy eating with losing weight. Firstly, on a balanced diet:  \nYes, if you want to have a very healthy, balanced and diverse diet, you should get a fruits (although not pounds and pounds of the most expensive stuff you can find!), meat, and a lot lot of veg, and maybe some nuts and so on. \nHowever, you can hit your macros (sugar/fat/protein) without having the most interesting and variable diet. For example, while nuts are healthy, you don't need them for a generally balanced diet if you're on a budget. Meat is great, but if you're strapped for cash, you can do either cheap meats or just scrap meat altogether and go with beans and chicken and such for protein. \n\n\n* and secondly, on health and losing weight. If you're overweight or obese, losing weight will be healthy for you whether or not you make you diet a lot more healthy and balanced. Now we're really getting to the bottom of this, because we all know that their main point isn't that a very varied diet can get expensive. They're talking about weight. They're saying that you can't lose weight if you don't have enough money.   \nThat's not true! Eat less -&gt; lose weight.   \nLosing weight can save you money, because you just need to eat less or what you're already eating. Obviously that'll cost less. \n\n* to expand on that, even if they're eating cheap unhealthy shit right now, while they could lose and save money by eating less of the same shit, I think it's very likely that they can also lose weight and save money by eating less of some healthier shit.   \nFast food is not terribly inexpensive (although I'm sure it's cheaper in the US, here in Germany it's actually pretty expensive).   \nThere are healthy options that aren't the most expensive thing in the market! Potatoes. Beans. Lots of cheap veggies. Some apples or whatever local, cheap fruit you have. Simple sandwiches, just a slice of bread with cheese or deli meat. It all depends a bit on your location, but I guarantee you there are cheap, healthy options for everyone. It won't be the most varied, and it'll be a bit more work, yes. But it also has the additional effect that most cheap healthy options are a lot more filling than typical fast food. It'll make losing weight easier, because you feel full after 300 calories, which at McDonald's is like a one-bite-burger. \n\nSo, this got a bit long, but I hope this shows just how much is wrong with that post.   \nI'll add this: as with everything, there's a nugget of truth in there that I think is important to point out:\n\nIn many areas of life, the better, higher quality option is more affordable in the long run - but poorer people still can't afford it, because it has a high upfront cost. When you're living week to week, day to day, it can be impossible to get the more expensive option. Like expensive clothes or shoes, that end up lasting longer than cheap ones.   \nA healthy, varied diet can be similarly difficult for some people. Maybe someone lives in a shitty apartment where the stove doesn't work, and the landlord won't fix it. Maybe someone doesn't have a car, so they have to schlepp everything they buy home from the supermarket. You end up having to go several times per week, and pay more for smaller amounts. Maybe they don't have enough money to pay for lots of stuff that you might use in cooking or baking, that keeps forever, but is expensive upfront. Maybe they don't have enough space in their fridge and kitchen to store more than a few items. Maybe they have no space in their freezer, so if they cook too much they can't store it, so again - they end up buying smaller amounts of everything, which is more expensive.   \nI just wanted to point this out so that there's some perspective on this problem here as well. As I said above, that doesn't make weight loss impossible. And it doesn't make healthy eating impossible, either, although it might be a somewhat boring diet.
