I would never buy a burger, cake or just anything to go, not even when really hungry, because every bite would be stressful, I&amp;#39;d be worried about sauce dripping down my shirt and so on, and I would have to eat it walking which I hate anyway. It would be something to get over with, and I prefer to enjoy my meals in peace and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On family celebrations with strangers and people I didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable around I would do the same. Eat a small piece of cake to be polite, then 1-2 hours later get more cake to eat alone in my room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5CtQQBulwgWly/giphy.gif\"&gt;What&amp;#39;s best is when I do get some ice cream outside and then end up somehow with a person near me, observing me while I try to eat it before it melts and drips to the ground.&lt;/a&gt;\nIt puts the focus from enjoying that ice cream to now somehow eat it without looking like &lt;a href=\"http://1funny.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pig-cake.jpg\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg9pbd1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230556.0, "created_utc": 1492201756.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bm24", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgadeuj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sparklyassrainbows", "parent_id": "t3_65bm24", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I do this.
