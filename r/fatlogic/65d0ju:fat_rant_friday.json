I&amp;#39;ve ranted about Creepy Boss before and the base summary of it is as follows - small company, CB owns this company, maybe 15 employees total (I don&amp;#39;t count, there&amp;#39;s high turnover in the shop), I&amp;#39;m the only woman here besides his wife. No HR department, his wife sees no problems with his behavior and says he just has a creative sense of humor and I&amp;#39;ll get used to it. I&amp;#39;m actively job hunting. And yes, he is a bag of hot air and he makes me want to hurl. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dg9avat", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213662.0, "created_utc": 1492184862.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 65}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d0ju", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9awbc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PrimeMinisterOwl", "parent_id": "t1_dg99yvu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If I recall correctly, creepy boss is also the owner of the company.

It&amp;#39;s a family-friendly, touristy spot with a lot of US, Canadian and European tourists chilling on the sand enjoying some time in the sun. Of course, a very large majority is overweight. That fact in itself doesn&amp;#39;t really bother me, live and let live. The fat adults eating pizza, ice cream and pineapples filled with over-sweetened alcoholic beverages can do their own thing. You know what makes me sad though? Obese kids. Huge fat rolls on a six-year old are sad. Toddlers so fat they can barely walk make me want to cry. If your son is twelve and has bigger chesticles than me, maybe there is a problem. I watch these kids winded sitting on the ledge of the fountain while their thinner friends run around and play. I watch them avoid the playground and other kids and sit by themselves, pretending to be absorbed in a handheld video game. I watch their parents hand them juice boxes, bags of chips, three pieces of pizza, large ice cream sundaes, and smoothies the size of a 7/11 Big Gulp. This is crazy! Folks, I don&amp;#39;t care if you&amp;#39;re fat and happy, but please, think of your children. Oversized portions are just setting them up for failure. You&amp;#39;re killing the next generation, slowly, by overfeeding them into immobility.

You&amp;#39;re far more likely to be labeled healthy by BMI when you are not, than to be labeled unhealthy when you are actually healthy. I&amp;#39;m not saying there aren&amp;#39;t outliers of course, but the scale actually skews in the opposite direction from what they want. If there were a cheap, quick and easy way to measure body fat % nation wide, the obesity epidemic would look far worse than it already does. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really sucks that you&amp;#39;re not allowed to talk about your dissatisfaction openly, but I totally understand what you&amp;#39;re saying. Being healthy is the goal dammit, not just being &lt;em&gt;healthier&lt;/em&gt; than the next guy.
