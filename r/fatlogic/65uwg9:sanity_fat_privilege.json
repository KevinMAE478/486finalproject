Many minorities in the US have not had that luxury and a lot of them don&amp;#39;t even have consistent access to get the foods they need to feed their families. Now, when there is a will there is a way. People CAN find ways to eat healthy when living in impoverished areas, but expecting them to know how is like expecting two kids from Louisiana to know how to access proper birth control when all they&amp;#39;ve been taught is abstinence sex education. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying that the reason poor people are fat is because they are inherently defeatists grossly simplifies the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I missed the part with your siblings being obese. I understand your frustration. My father, a black man who&amp;#39;s entire family (his mom, dad, and sister) are obese and are in failing health, hates hearing the excuse of poverty when it comes to people being fat. My dad took the initiative to learn how to be healthy despite his circumstances. Even though I grew up upper-middle class, my siblings and mother are obese and I was almost considered class 1 obese. I took the initiative to learn how to be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we can&amp;#39;t expect every person to be an anamoly and go against the grain. We need to make an effort on how to educate people to be healthy. This is not only important to the general American population, but also  to people who are struggling to feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatlogic", "name": "t1_dgdnkuf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492473063.0, "created_utc": 1492444263.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdn1ic", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "osheetwaddup", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfws6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I ate subsidized school lunch, grew up poor and on food stamps but I'm not overweight.
