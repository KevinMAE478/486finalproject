Talking obnoxiously and annoying someone is not a valid reason to be hit (although that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you wont get hit).  Hitting someone first, regardless of how hard, is a valid reason to be hit back.  Theres no law that states you must match the the force that was applied to you (obviously within reason).  Once the aggressor crosses that line, you have more of the law on your side in regards to defense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "JusticeServed", "name": "t1_dg7vdn6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492132456.0, "created_utc": 1492103656.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vxxc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s13z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga1vc9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "D00GL", "parent_id": "t1_dg7u9tk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/JusticeServed", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Then unsub", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then unsub&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "JusticeServed", "name": "t1_dga1vc9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246941.0, "created_utc": 1492218141.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7u9tk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zeppelinfromled1", "parent_id": "t1_dg79jqc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/JusticeServed", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh please.
