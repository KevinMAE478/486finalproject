The guy pulled out a gun and started firing shots right in the crowd rather than just letting the mugger walk off with his stuff, (it was clear that the mugger wasn't going to be violent because he had already started to just pick up his stuff off the floor).  Thousands and thousands of people watch this guy, and if just one of them gets into a situation like that and pulls their gun out because they have this ridiculous sense of immunity as a result of this guy's videos, that would be a tragedy.
