Her flying out there is part of her job, she is getting paid to sit in that seat, because they need her to fly a different plane in a different place than would be optimal (her home base city). They are deadheading her there. With all the recent weather on the east coast, airlines are still recovering to get on a regular schedule. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes more than one person to fly a plane. Often, if there are delays/etc, an entire crew can clock out. There are so many regulations with the FAA, and the crew cannot wait indefinitely.  If they wait to long, they are not legally allowed to fly. This is one of the major causes in cancellations across the US, they can only delay so many times. This is why 4 crew members may be needed at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "JusticeServed", "name": "t1_dg4jljr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958571.0, "created_utc": 1491929771.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vxxc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qb09", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vxxc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qb09", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vxxc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qb09", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vxxc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qb09", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4lgny", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AppleCinnamonBread", "parent_id": "t1_dg4key1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/JusticeServed", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well someone will take them at a price.
