So I've thought about what your points on the nature of the character, and I've changed my mind on a few things, but not all. I think the Mad Max character in the movies totally undergoes change in a couple of the movies. And in the game I maintain there was a sign he would experience growth, so I was disappointed when it didn't follow through. Here's what I mean.\n\nMovie spoilers follow:\n\nMad Max: He loses his family and goes mad. He's likable because he's a hero who experiences tragedy becomes and antihero.\n\nRoad Warrior: Not much change here, like you said. He's an antihero looking out for himself. But also as you said, that's part of the charm, and I like the character. So it's debatable whether the character is \"likable\" I suppose.\n\nThunderdome: He didn't kill the gladiator who had the mind of a child and he helped the colony of lost children without expecting anything in return. Does that count as development? It sure seemed like a change from the previous movies, but then again this movie stood out in lack of quality and being \"hollywood-ized\". Besides being the protagonist, I guess this one didn't give me much reason to like him.\n\nFury Road: Max finds his voice. He becomes less feral. He aligns himself with Furiosa and her goals, which to me makes him likable, even if he does it for personal benefit.\n\nThe Game: Max treats everyone he encounters as if they are trash. He appeared to come to regard Griffa (not the pair of NPCs) as a friend, and so appears to experience character growth, but then throws it all away at the end.\n\nI wasn't talking about the pair of NPCs - I totally understood the reference to the first movie, and why he treated them the way he did. I was talking about Griffa.\n\n&gt;Griffa: I'm glad to see you, my friend.\n\n&gt;Max: Me too.\n\n&gt;Griffa: You understand; the time has come to leave these Plains of Silence.\n\n&gt;Max: That which is broken can be mended by love only.\n\n&gt;Griffa: It's a very dangerous thing to fathom. Your way does not end with the Plains of Silence. They're just another stop on the road...until your true purpose is revealed.

So I&amp;#39;ve thought about what your points on the nature of the character, and I&amp;#39;ve changed my mind on a few things, but not all. I think the Mad Max character in the movies totally undergoes change in a couple of the movies. And in the game I maintain there was a sign he would experience growth, so I was disappointed when it didn&amp;#39;t follow through. Here&amp;#39;s what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Movie spoilers follow:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mad Max: He loses his family and goes mad. He&amp;#39;s likable because he&amp;#39;s a hero who experiences tragedy becomes and antihero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Road Warrior: Not much change here, like you said. He&amp;#39;s an antihero looking out for himself. But also as you said, that&amp;#39;s part of the charm, and I like the character. So it&amp;#39;s debatable whether the character is &amp;quot;likable&amp;quot; I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thunderdome: He didn&amp;#39;t kill the gladiator who had the mind of a child and he helped the colony of lost children without expecting anything in return. Does that count as development? It sure seemed like a change from the previous movies, but then again this movie stood out in lack of quality and being &amp;quot;hollywood-ized&amp;quot;. Besides being the protagonist, I guess this one didn&amp;#39;t give me much reason to like him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fury Road: Max finds his voice. He becomes less feral. He aligns himself with Furiosa and her goals, which to me makes him likable, even if he does it for personal benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Game: Max treats everyone he encounters as if they are trash. He appeared to come to regard Griffa (not the pair of NPCs) as a friend, and so appears to experience character growth, but then throws it all away at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t talking about the pair of NPCs - I totally understood the reference to the first movie, and why he treated them the way he did. I was talking about Griffa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Griffa: I&amp;#39;m glad to see you, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max: Me too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Griffa: You understand; the time has come to leave these Plains of Silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max: That which is broken can be mended by love only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Griffa: It&amp;#39;s a very dangerous thing to fathom.
