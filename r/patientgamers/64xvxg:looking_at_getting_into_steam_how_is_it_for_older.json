The catalogue goes pretty far back, though for considerably older titles GOG is generally better at providing games that will work on modern PCs, plus they're DRM free, so you can archive installers and don't need to have anything running to launch them. By those I mean games like Planescape Torment, the old school Fallout games and so.\n2. It's dead simple, really.

You buy the game, it shows up on your library, you click on it to install and that's it.\n3. I can't answer that off the top of my head, but I'm sure you can find some gems in there.  \n  \nApart from that, Steam tends to offer pretty good regional pricing excluding outliers from some publishers who think it's ok for their game to cost double the currently accepted regional price (I'm looking at you, Bethesda and Square). The client feels a bit clunky and awkward at times, but it's simple enough to navigate and use. There's cloud saving for many games, though some still don't support it.  \nThat's about it, I guess.
