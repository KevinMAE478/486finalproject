I had be eagerly awaiting the game, the trailers got me hyped for it and it ticked a few boxes for me; its got a cool setting (underwater), its got cool baddies (splicers and big daddies), its got a cool story, and i just loved everything about the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought it originally for the XBOX 360 but later on i got it for the PC version. For this review ill be discussing the PC release. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in the day i installed Bioshock on my old windows vista machine, but to my dismay the PC version had a fair few bugs (this is the non-Steam version). The DRM system the game used was rubbish and required connection to a 2K website (which no longer exists btw, in case any of you thought about buying the CD disk version of the game for some reason) and once you got past the DRM you might boot up the game to find there is no sound and it runs crappy. They patched the game up and it ran better, but there was still a sound issue. It turns out this sound issue had something to do with the audio mix on windows and bizarrely enough was fixed by pluging something into the headphone jack on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Issues out of the way it was time to enjoy the game! And boy oh boy what a game it was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singleplayer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You play as Jack, a survivor of a plane crash that lands in the Atlantic ocean. Not far from where the crash occurs is a lighthouse, Jack investigates and descovered a submarine that automatically takes him down to city built on the ocean floor called Rapture. A full sized city, a sweeping metropolis complete with skyscrapers, meuseums, theatres, docks, apartments, and more. Once down in the city Jack becomes embroiled in a plot to assist a mysterious stranger, save little girls, and escape the madness of Rapture. Jack&amp;#39;s journey is being hindered by Andrew Ryan, the former ruler of Rapture who built the city in the first place. Ryan considers Jack a spy and a pest that needs to be destroyed. Jack recieves help in his adventure from a mysterious man called Atlas and a strange woman called Dr. Tennembaum. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bioshock has rich and facinating story which is told both from the perspective of the present and the past. The player can find posters and audio logs that tell the story of what happened in Rapture before Jack&amp;#39;s arrival. When Jack arrives in Rapture for the first time the city is a shambles, its citizens have mostly been killed in a civil war and the survivors are mostly drug addicts addicted to a powerful liquid called ADAM. ADAM allows these addicts (called splicers) to alter their DNA and gives them extrordinary powers. Throught the game Jack also uses these powers, but ADAM only comes from one source: little sisters. little sisters are little girls that look like they have been pocessesed by deamons, they are guarded by big daddies: huge hulking diving suits armed with either a drill or a rivet gun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few interesting dynamics going on in the game, the player mostly fights splicers of various varieties (some have guns, some use melee, some can teleport, and some can climb like spiders) and has to fight big daddies in order to get ADAM from the little sisters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game has a combat-heavy focus; the player can use a variety of cool weapons from the humble revolver to the mighty grenade laucher. The player can also use a variety of powers that they can buy with the ADAM they earn, these powers range from powerful bolts of lightning to unleashing a swarm of bees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love this game to bits; there is nothing like clearing out a room of splicers by shocking them lightnighting then mowing the them down with the tommy gun. I love the story, i love the backstory behind ADAM and Rapture, i love the characters of Andew Ryan and Atlas, i love the plot (espeically one part near the middle that you might be able to see coming a mile away but i wont spoil it just in case), i love the style choices (all the 1950s-1960s stuff is really cool), i just love the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the game wasnt without its issues on PC; it ran pretty poorly even with the patch, the textures looked dodgy in some places, it used DX9 and DX10 only so the graphics werent amazing, you couldnt change the FOV (not without console commands anyway) so that was a bummer, the physics were a bit hokie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite its short comings i still loved the game. Thankfully 2K released a remastered version on Steam that fixes a lot of the problems. I can play Bioshock Remastered in glorious 4K, never going below 60FPS with the FOV jacked all the way up and everything on max. Its glorious! they redid the physics engine, improved the shadows and dynamic lighting, fixed bugs and scripting issues of the original, and made general improvements that im very happy with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do i recommend this game? Should you go out a buy it? Well the answer is a firm yes, but for the remastered edition. I can&amp;#39;t recommend the original anymore, it wont even run on most PCs without great difficulty. If you are and XBOX 360 or PS3 owner then by all means get yourself a copy of the original game, but if you are PC/XBOX:ONE/PS4 owner then i implore you to run out and get the remaster immediately! Its such a fun game thats well worth the price. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game is a solid 5/5 for me and is one of my all time favorites! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Preface:**\n\nI originally posted this review yesterday, however it was pointed out that i used a spoiler that was essential to the plot. \n\nAt first i didnt consider it an important spoiler, but after consideration i have decided to post the review again this time without the controversial spoiler. \n\nThank you to those who pointed it out to me, hopefully this review will serve this subreddit better. \n\n\n**Introduction:**   \n\nThe year is 2007 and Bioshock hit the shelves for PC and Xbox 360 (and later for PS3).
