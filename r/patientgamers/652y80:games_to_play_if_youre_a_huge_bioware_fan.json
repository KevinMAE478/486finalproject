The first game starts off really slow and you are limited to where you can go initially, but once you go to the second world, you will have a lot of freedom where to go next and you will meet new companions and people who needs you to fix a problem.\n\nOkay, I ramble on from this point on about the games, because I find it the be one of the best games I've every played.\n\nEach one of your companions have their own backstory and they will continue to open up to you as the game goes on. For some of them you will have to do special things to unearth their backstory. The second game expands on this by talking to your companions in the right manner will increase the influence you will have over them and impacts their abilities, plus you can unlock a new class for them! You are allowed to take two companion with you on your adventures.\n\nThe games have plenty of different environments. There's deserts, jungles, a water world, barren world, sophisticated cities, war torn establishments, etc. Kotor 1 is more lively, while Kotor 2 has a \"cold, dead on the inside\" feeling to it, which is completely intentional.\n\nThe max level in KOTOR 1 is 20 and in KOTOR 2 it's 50 (you won't reach it). You have 3 classes to choose from at the beginning, which will affect the levels that you gain attributes, feats (abilities), your starting abilities, and how many skill points you gain per level. Later on, you are allowed to pick a second tier of 3 classes (Main character only). You class choices can change the way you approach the game and combat. For example, a Scoundrel has the ability to sneak attack opponents for bonus damage, which means either attacking them in stealth mode, while they are stunned, or from behind, compared to a Soldier, who just strong-arm everything head-on.\n\nThe game has a crafting system. As you explore the world, you will find components you can use to further customize specific weapons and armors. The second game expands on this greatly and your skills matter a lot of what you can craft. There are a shit ton of customization options for your gear in KOTOR 2, compared to KOTOR 1 and there is way more gear your can tweak. If I remember correctly, you can even craft weapons and armor in the second game!\n\nFinally, the game has a morality system. In typical BioWare fashion, you have the choice in dialogue between the good option, neutral option, and bad/asshole option. It doesn't really impact how people see you in the game world of the first game (excluding a few parts of the main quest line), but being either a \"light side Jedi\" or a \"dark side Jedi\" will influence some of the Jedi powers you will or won't be able to use. Both sides of the force has damaging abilities, but the dark side has more cc, while the light side has more buffs. Some gear can only be worn depending on which side of the force you are on. Of course as I mentioned earlier, your dialogue options matter a lot when talking to your companions in the second game, so try not to go full asshole on them, unless you want them to clam up.\n\nFinally, finally, make sure to download the restoration patch for the second game.
