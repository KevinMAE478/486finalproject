I have a 90&amp;#39;s movie night with my fianc\u00e9e every week recently using the CRT in our garage and we stream older movies to it through a Roku 1, instead of paying $30 for movie theater tickets. There are lots of movies that are already out that I can find for cheap, that I missed out on and actually want to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to games, I mostly missed out on them as a kid and in my 20&amp;#39;s, so I&amp;#39;ve got a backlog stretching back about 25 years now. For instance, I&amp;#39;m just about to finish Chrono Trigger for the first time. Why pay $60 for a &amp;quot;blockbuster&amp;quot; &amp;quot;AAA&amp;quot; video game that plays like a Michael Bay film when I&amp;#39;ve got so much catching up to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dgb78ss", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492320449.0, "created_utc": 1492291649.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h6dx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb7qh2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nokarmawhore", "parent_id": "t3_65h6dx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I feel unproductive playing video games now in my mid twenties.
