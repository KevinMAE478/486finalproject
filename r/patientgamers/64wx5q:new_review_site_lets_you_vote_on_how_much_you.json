In my experience, the people I know who make six figures a year still use coupons and shop sales instead of paying full price. Just like someone who spends $10,000 a year on their hobby, someone can spend $100 a year on that hobby and have a similar perspective on value as the upper range spender. I&amp;#39;d be more concerned about the people voting on these values having very limited income (i.e. kids in high school/college who can only afford a couple games a year) that value games lower because their income is way below the average.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dga6fwg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492253387.0, "created_utc": 1492224587.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tp1y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Junoh315", "parent_id": "t1_dg69idm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "$100 a month isn't bad but if someone's spending $10000 on games each year then their perspective will drastically change.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;$100 a month isn&amp;#39;t bad but if someone&amp;#39;s spending $10000 on games each year then their perspective will drastically change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg9tp1y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236052.0, "created_utc": 1492207252.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69idm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mb2707", "parent_id": "t1_dg5yo6u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;This only works if the people that are voting happen to have limited income.\n\nIn what way?
