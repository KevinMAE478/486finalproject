Diverse knowledge bases, yes, but the only skill required is the ability to tell a good story -- which is, in itself, monumental. Painting, sculpture, song-writing -- these are all seen as forms of individual expression,  not collaborative creativity. Each one deals with one specific skill or ability.\n\nMaking a film, a game, a comic, a play -- these all require multiple people and various skills.

I really, really love that game. I got it for like $3. I think it was less, actually. It&amp;#39;s insane how massive that game is and how little I paid for it. Plus, it doesn&amp;#39;t look outdated really at all, and the gameplay is top notch and doesn&amp;#39;t feel old... fantastic game!
