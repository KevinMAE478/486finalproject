Judging by the talk, I think this game is first and foremost a comedy game - philosophical discussion is mostly incidental.

Because I certainly did find it funny, and laughed at many of the narrator&amp;#39;s quips. But some of the gameplay jokes were so dry I didn&amp;#39;t see them as jokes at first. For example, pressing buttons just because the words on the screen told me to. I thought the game was just making fun of me, but now I think it was an exceedingly dry joke that this section of the game amounts to the very bare minimum of what constitutes a game.
