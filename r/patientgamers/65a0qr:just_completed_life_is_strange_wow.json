It really shows the impact of your decision and a long scene of a funeral. The bad ending is about 4 min and feels really rushed, just a short scene of them driving away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I played the games, but right before you have to make the decision some different dimension version of Max shows up telling how it&amp;#39;s wrong to meddle with time. And she pretty much tells you you should undo everything you have done since the start of the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I thought really sucks, because the game is telling you the right thing is to kill Chloe and undo everything. So every choice you made during the game becomes undone. And since you really get to know and bond with Chloe you don&amp;#39;t really want to kill her.\nBut if you sacrifice the bay and save her it doesn&amp;#39;t really feel that emotionally satisfying because of the short cutscene.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dgb3ebh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315140.0, "created_utc": 1492286340.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9396g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EdenFragment", "parent_id": "t1_dg92o5s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;  There is very clearly a 'right' and a 'wrong' ending. \n\nSince it's so clear, could you elaborate on which is which and why?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is very clearly a &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; and a &amp;#39;wrong&amp;#39; ending. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;#39;s so clear, could you elaborate on which is which and why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg9396g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203230.0, "created_utc": 1492174430.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg92o5s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WoolyWookie", "parent_id": "t1_dg8r4d4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I disliked the ending as well.
