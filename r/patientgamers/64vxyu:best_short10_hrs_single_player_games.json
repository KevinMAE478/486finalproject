It takes less than 6 hours to beat the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg5yhot", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037191.0, "created_utc": 1492008391.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vxyu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6mnty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Healthing", "parent_id": "t3_64vxyu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bastion, Undertale, To the moon should get you started", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bastion, Undertale, To the moon should get you started&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg6mnty", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492062810.0, "created_utc": 1492034010.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vxyu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6i3wk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "undocumented_admin", "parent_id": "t3_64vxyu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Gun's pretty cool for game that's that short.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gun&amp;#39;s pretty cool for game that&amp;#39;s that short.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg6i3wk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057668.0, "created_utc": 1492028868.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vxyu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76yqb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Drkxero13", "parent_id": "t3_64vxyu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Metal Gear Solid 1\n\nI used to stay up all night with my dad beating it in one go.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metal Gear Solid 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to stay up all night with my dad beating it in one go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg76yqb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089631.0, "created_utc": 1492060831.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vxyu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7asck", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cosmicosme", "parent_id": "t3_64vxyu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Apotheon is a very beautiful fighting-oriented platformer with excellent mechanics, astonishing music and interesting boss fights.
