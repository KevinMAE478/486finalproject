It got a bit out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a personal list of what I enjoyed, there are still many games I haven&amp;#39;t played, and some big titles I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy, so I know that &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;insert your favourite game here&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Games with title link as &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the ones that stood out the most to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1980&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ever wondered where the term &amp;quot;roguelike&amp;quot; comes from? Well, here&amp;#39;s the answer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork\"&gt;Zork&lt;/a&gt; If you enjoy reading, this was an amazing text-adventure game. Both sequels &lt;strong&gt;Zork II&lt;/strong&gt; (1981) and &lt;strong&gt;Zork III&lt;/strong&gt; (1982) also highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1981&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga\"&gt;Galaga&lt;/a&gt; Technically the 2nd game in the series, after &lt;strong&gt;Galaxian&lt;/strong&gt; (1979), but &lt;strong&gt;Galaga&lt;/strong&gt; was so great it made everyone forget about the first.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; Basic but unique game, countless remakes were made.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord\"&gt;Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; The birth of one of the best RPG series ever.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultima&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The birth of one of the best RPG series ever.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)\"&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/a&gt; No need to introduce him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1982&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban\"&gt;Sokoban&lt;/a&gt; Great puzzle game, many remakes available.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!\"&gt;Pitfall!&lt;/a&gt; A classic platformer, didn&amp;#39;t age that well though.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man\"&gt;Ms. Pac-man&lt;/a&gt; Fixed everything that the original &lt;strong&gt;Pac-man&lt;/strong&gt; (1980) had wrong.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)\"&gt;Centipede&lt;/a&gt; Atari 2600 version.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)\"&gt;Tron&lt;/a&gt; Totally trippy game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1983&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alley Cat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reaaaally hard game, with very questionable colour palette, but I spent many hours on that one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digger_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A classic and amazing game, also had a ton of more recent remakes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)\"&gt;Bomberman&lt;/a&gt; Another game with countless remakes, many of them are worth a shot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair_(1983_video_game)\"&gt;Dragon&amp;#39;s Lair&lt;/a&gt; A game that made people have a glimpse of what gaming could become, graphically amazing, makes Dark Souls feel like a walk in the park.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_Position_II\"&gt;Pole position II&lt;/a&gt; Looked really good at that time, with great gameplay too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1984&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash\"&gt;Boulder dash&lt;/a&gt; Another one that spawned countless remakes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugwars\"&gt;Drugwars&lt;/a&gt; Later remade as Dope Wars end of 90s, simple trading game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness\"&gt;Marble Madness&lt;/a&gt; Interesting physics / puzzle / racing game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I\"&gt;King&amp;#39;s Quest&lt;/a&gt; Forget about the 1990 remake, the original (and its many sequels) are the way to go, will probably feel slow today though.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt; One of the first Capcom hits. Really good WWII vertical scroll shooter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1985&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush&amp;#x27;n_Attack\"&gt;Rush&amp;#39;n Attack&lt;/a&gt; Aka &lt;strong&gt;Green Beret&lt;/strong&gt;, shoot&amp;#39;em up.

Still had lots of fun with it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1986&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yie_Ar_Kung-Fu_II\"&gt;Yie Ar Kung-Fu II&lt;/a&gt; Lots of time spent on that one, simple fighting game, but with 2 players you could control a woman, in a fighting game, that was never seen before.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enduro_Racer\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enduro Racer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Quite a hard dirt bike game, in which you could modify your bike with points gained depending on your result in each race. This mod system made the game really interesting IMO, finding the optimal bonuses depending on how many points you got was nice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Oh god, just play this if you haven&amp;#39;t played it yet. Like, now, stop reading, go and have fun.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_Fight\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slap Fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Played on Thomson version, really good scrolling shooter, full power-up was crazily overpowered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.uvlist.net/fr/game-206149-Les+Cavernes+de+Thenebe\"&gt;Les cavernes de Thenebe&lt;/a&gt; A game you probably never heard about, looked &lt;a href=\"http://dcmoto.free.fr/programmes/les-cavernes-de-thenebe/04.png\"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;, basically lots of challenging puzzles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by02CLAFLp0\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; Another unknown title I absolutely loved, very challenging game where you play a random guy whose car break down in front of a castle, at midnight, and set off to save a damsel in distress, kidnapped by vampires, and witches, and dragons, and...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1987&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion\"&gt;Maniac Mansion&lt;/a&gt; While the game is amazing, I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend playing it unless you loved its sequel: &lt;strong&gt;Day of the Tentacle&lt;/strong&gt; (1993). This one was not remastered and didn&amp;#39;t really age well, it already felt old when the sequel was released.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Zone_II:_The_Tears_of_Opa-Opa\"&gt;Fantasy Zone II&lt;/a&gt; Really fun side-scrolling shooter game. Trippy colourful world.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golvellius\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golvellius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An amazing underrated Action/RPG on Master System, aged quite well too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Islands:_The_Story_of_Bubble_Bobble_2\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rainbow Islands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Technically the sequel to &lt;strong&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/strong&gt;, but a totally different game. Very addictive platformer with some neat ideas. Players &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; rainbows that serves both as weapon and platforms on which they can walk. Really recommending this one, even now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizball\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wizball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Such a unique game, I spent hours just trying to fully understand it. Very challenging and absolutely amazing once you start mastering the controls and power ups.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R-Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There should be no need to introduce this one. If you feel there&amp;#39;s a need, you haven&amp;#39;t played it, so stop reading and do it, now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)\"&gt;Asteroids&lt;/a&gt; Basic but fun and somewhat challenging game (Atari 7800).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_(video_game)\"&gt;Renegade&lt;/a&gt; While this game was from 1986 originally, it was released in 1987 for DOS. Basic beat&amp;#39;em up, but the best at that time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1988&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Blood_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captain Blood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Amazing concept, hard and sometimes extremely confusing. A sequel, &lt;strong&gt;Commander Blood&lt;/strong&gt;, was made in 1994 too, while praised, I really preferred the original.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouls_%27n_Ghosts\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghouls&amp;#39;n Ghosts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Remained one of the best platformer to me for years.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_World\"&gt;Psychic World&lt;/a&gt; An underrated game for me. Not very well known action platformer. I absolutely loved the power-ups in that one. Some levels had really great and challenging design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_Spirits\"&gt;Scramble Spirits&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;d say this was one of the best vertical scrolling shooter from that time. 2 players mode was amazing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Bros 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Best &lt;strong&gt;Mario&lt;/strong&gt; game for me, wasted many, many hours on this game. Still enjoyable nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Chess\"&gt;Battle Chess&lt;/a&gt; While it would now look basic, this game probably made some people start chess just to watch all those crazy capture animations. Lots of fun references too. But in the end, it&amp;#39;s just a chess game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Volleyball\"&gt;Arcade Volleyball&lt;/a&gt; An extremely basic game, but soooo addictive. Really good with friends. Physics were also quite good for that time, many remakes and &amp;quot;inspired&amp;quot; games came out mostly in the 90s.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1989&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia\"&gt;Prince of Persia&lt;/a&gt; Incredible animation and graphics for the year.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)\"&gt;Sim City&lt;/a&gt; The game that would make city building a popular genre, and start a long series of games, spin-offs and rip-offs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_II_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darius II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;strong&gt;Sagaia&lt;/strong&gt;) I&amp;#39;d say this game was, along with &lt;strong&gt;R-Type&lt;/strong&gt; (1987) the best shoot&amp;#39;em up from that time. Sadly, this one if much less known.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_III:_The_Dragon%27s_Trap\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wonderboy III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Completed this one countless times, great action-adventure game that aged well, still playing it from time to time. Each chapter ends in yourself being transformed into a different animal with different weaknesses and strengths. A remake is planned for 2017, I really hope it manages to keep the spirit of this game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_2_Megablast\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xenon 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You can only have a megablast playing this. Sorry. Amazing shooter with shop to buy/sell power ups, very challenging, and once over you can start again in very-very challenging mode.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_I_%26_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ys I &amp;amp; II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An improves version of the first 2 games (from 1987 and 1998), really great Action RPG for that time, might seem a bit dated today, &lt;strong&gt;Ys I &amp;amp; II Chronicles+&lt;/strong&gt; (2013) is more recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(video_game)\"&gt;Populous&lt;/a&gt; If you haven&amp;#39;t heard of Peter Molyneux, this is the game that absolutely launched his career in video gaming industry. He&amp;#39;s basically seen as one of the geniuses of video games history, that guy worked on so many amazing games (&lt;strong&gt;Theme Park&lt;/strong&gt; (1994), &lt;strong&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/strong&gt; (1994), &lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Keeper&lt;/strong&gt; (1997), &lt;strong&gt;Black &amp;amp; White&lt;/strong&gt; (2001), &lt;strong&gt;Fable&lt;/strong&gt; (2004), etc.). Populous might be the very first &amp;quot;god simulator&amp;quot;, a management/strategy game where you play the role of a god. You had to trade your life to end this game (500 levels to beat).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1990&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Secret of Monkey Island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still the best point &amp;amp; click for me. Nothing beats the original Guybrush Threepwood.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parodius!_From_Myth_to_Laughter\"&gt;Parodius!&lt;/a&gt; Lots of nonsense, then more nonsense. And then, nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Baron_(1990_video_game)\"&gt;Red Baron&lt;/a&gt; Might be a bit vomit-inducing today, but an amazing 3D plane simulator for the year.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous_2\"&gt;Rick Dangerous 2&lt;/a&gt; Great platformer with puzzle elements, that fixed everything that was wrong in the first game. Some say the wait for Half-Life 3 is too long, but many still wait for the sequel of that one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_or_Die\"&gt;Ski or Die!&lt;/a&gt; Follow up of &lt;strong&gt;Skate or Die&lt;/strong&gt; (1988), fun game with 5 different mini-games, snowball blast was, well, a blast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1991&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The intro alone made me launch this game many, many times, recent remake seem good, haven&amp;#39;t tried it yet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)\"&gt;Scorched Earth&lt;/a&gt; A very simple, yet entertaining game, basically trying to hit each other with artillery. Single player was uninteresting, but 2 players games were amazing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)\"&gt;Lemmings&lt;/a&gt; A really interesting concept, great game that had many sequels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(video_game)\"&gt;The Blues Brothers&lt;/a&gt; Loved the gameplay, and music, also a great 2 players game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(8-bit_video_game)\"&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt; There&amp;#39;s no such thing as &amp;#39;too fast&amp;#39;. Every platformer felt slow after this one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of the first game that made me lose the concept of time, still playing it despite the outdated graphics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_the_Fox\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moktar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Challenging platformer, later released as &lt;strong&gt;Titus the Fox&lt;/strong&gt;, but I think the music and sound changed, and the original were awesome.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines_(video_game)\"&gt;Micro Machines&lt;/a&gt; Perfect time waster, especially in multiplayer mode.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_II:_Trials_of_the_Olympian_Gods\"&gt;Populous II&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to, and as hard to describe as &lt;strong&gt;Populous&lt;/strong&gt; (1989). As the first one, the game was gigantic, with this time 1000 levels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1992&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Amazing adventure game, followed by some amazing first glimpse at what would become RTS in the last stage of the game, definitely worth playing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dune II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Didn&amp;#39;t age as well as the first one, RTS went a long way since then, while this game was not technically the first RTS, it&amp;#39;s one that set the entire basis of the genre and inspired countless titles since then. Played through the entire game many times, and can still get into it nowadays (despite the very annoying limits, such as single unit selection, and the need to select action before doing anything). I&amp;#39;m still amazed Westwood Studios managed to get these 2 games out in the same year.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Strike\"&gt;Desert Strike&lt;/a&gt; Isometric shoot&amp;#39;em up with very smooth gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zool\"&gt;Zool&lt;/a&gt; Beautiful, smooth, very fast and hard platformer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(1992_video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Incredible animation and graphics for the year (yeah, I said that 3 years ago). Forget about the 2103 remake.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1993&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistorik_2\"&gt;Prehistorik 2&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to &lt;strong&gt;Prehistorik&lt;/strong&gt; (1991), this platformer was simply amazing. Really beautiful game, with lots of details and hidden content, had a really high replayability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day of the Tentacle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of the best point and click ever made. Really great graphics for the year, funny and witty game. Full of characters you&amp;#39;ll remember 25 years after playing. A remake is available, go get it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; Do I need to say anything about that one? This game was simply a revolution in the land of FPS, so much the genre was basically called Doom-like for years after this release.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia#Book_Two_-_The_Hand_of_Fate\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyrandia 2 - The Hand of Fate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An underrated point and click, sometimes twisted (you&amp;#39;ll get the reference if you&amp;#39;ve played it enough). Definitely worth at least a playthrough, while this is the 2nd game in the series (of 3), there&amp;#39;s no need to play the first game to understand it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maker_2\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Princess Maker 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to &lt;strong&gt;Princess Maker&lt;/strong&gt; (1991), while the first game was already great, this is the game that would make the series popular. Your role in this game is to raise a princess from age 10 to 18, choosing what she is going to study, or what jobs she&amp;#39;ll be doing, each action influencing the character stats. A lot of specific events can also happen, in which the outcome can be decided by your choices or her statistics. Really high replayability, with lots of different outcomes (74 different endings), not always very SFW (like, she can end up working as a &amp;quot;bondage queen&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Comet\"&gt;Shadow of the Comet&lt;/a&gt; One of the games based on HP Lovecraft&amp;#39;s Cthulhu. The game was really, really good, but messed up by having bad controls. A sequel was also made, &lt;strong&gt;Prisoner of Ice&lt;/strong&gt; (1995), but was overall less interesting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1994&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Vikings\"&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/a&gt; While the game was released in 1993 on SNES, I listed it in 1994 because its best edition came out this year, adding some content to the original game. Good mix of platform and puzzle games. First big success of Blizzard Entertainment, which left many legendary games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; While &lt;strong&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/strong&gt; was a big success for Blizzard, it was nothing compared to the first &lt;strong&gt;Warcraft&lt;/strong&gt; game, which started a long (and loved) series of games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_120%25_Burning_Fest\"&gt;Asuka 120% Burning Fest&lt;/a&gt; Not a very well known fighting game, but an amazing one. 100% female characters, with very varied fighting styles. Many versions were made, some feel less dated than the original.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The sense of freedom of movement you got in that game was amazing. One of the very few games for which I&amp;#39;d recommend getting a joystick, made it so immersive. Probably the best gameplay of any full 3D game available at that time. Level design was also really clever, especially in solo mode.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows\"&gt;Raptor&lt;/a&gt; An exceptionally good looking shooter for that time. Enemies were a mix of flying and ground (and water) units and buildings, and you had to learn to switch between weapons adapter to each of them. This game seemed to have somewhat resurrected recently, showing up again on Steam/Gog and even had an updated release in 2015.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Park_(video_game)\"&gt;Theme Park&lt;/a&gt; Very first games in the &amp;quot;Theme&amp;quot; series by Bullfrog and Peter Molyneux, which is mostly known for this game and &lt;strong&gt;Theme Hospital&lt;/strong&gt; (1997). This remained the best amusement park management game for long, until &lt;strong&gt;RollerCoaster Tycoon&lt;/strong&gt; (1999) set the bar much higher.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Wheels\"&gt;Wacky Wheels&lt;/a&gt; A fun racing game, sadly didn&amp;#39;t age well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A mix of action, strategy and (kind of) god game, once more by Peter Molyneux. A hard to describe one, but one of those addictive games that would make hours disappear.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1995&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Baku_Animal\"&gt;Baku Baku Animal&lt;/a&gt; Very simple puzzle game, yet really entertaining, especially in 2 players mode.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_II\"&gt;Caesar II&lt;/a&gt; An interesting game for city-builder fans, this was one of the first to mix city-building with strategy. While I really enjoyed the city building part, I felt the strategy part was underwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Racing\"&gt;Fatal Racing&lt;/a&gt; Aka &lt;strong&gt;Whiplash&lt;/strong&gt;. Very arcade-oriented racing game. Fast, with crazy tracks making your car fly in every direction, in which destroying opponents cars was not just possible, but highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fury3\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fury 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This game, along with &lt;strong&gt;Terminal Velocity&lt;/strong&gt; (1995), developed by the same people, with the same engine, and the same everything. I still preferred &lt;strong&gt;Fury 3&lt;/strong&gt; since I played it first, but it got bad ratings overall (understandably). Both will probably look dated today, but were extremely enjoyable games at that time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Octane\"&gt;Hi-Octane&lt;/a&gt; A not very known racing game, in the same vein as &lt;strong&gt;Wipeout&lt;/strong&gt; (1995). Despite being released a few months before it, &lt;strong&gt;Hi-Octane&lt;/strong&gt; was totally eclipsed by its release.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_2\"&gt;Magic Carpet 2&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to &lt;strong&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/strong&gt; (1994), as hard to describe as the first, but also as recommended. While I wasn&amp;#39;t a big fan of underground levels, the game did add a lot of variety to the original gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_TT_Super_Bike\"&gt;Manx TT Super Bike&lt;/a&gt; Released in 1997 on PC and Saturn. One of my favourite motorbike arcade racing game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria_(video_game)\"&gt;Phantasmagoria&lt;/a&gt; A very original point and click game. Which tried to mix live action with the genre. While the game itself was relatively average, it was a huge hit. I quite liked Adrienne, but the entire thing really looked like a random B-movie.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An amazing RTS, while the first &lt;strong&gt;Warcraft&lt;/strong&gt; was enjoyable, it still suffered from tedious controls. &lt;strong&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/strong&gt; fixed most of those issues. It also looked fantastic for 1995, and still doesn&amp;#39;t look ugly. The variety of units was amazing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First title in what would become a long (and still ongoing) series of games, with lots of spin-offs and a ton of rip-offs. For many reasons, this one remains my favourite in the series, mainly because I had ton of fun with friends, and because I liked the darker theme that was replaced by a very funny/party oriented theme in the following games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1996&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer - Red Alert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To me, still the best title in the &lt;strong&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/strong&gt; series, did everything perfectly and set very high standards for RTS, especially for controls.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_II\"&gt;Descent 2&lt;/a&gt; Nothing particularly new in this one, but the first game was amazing, and the sequel remained on the same track.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_Derby_2\"&gt;Destruction Derby 2&lt;/a&gt; Combat racing game, looked good and was tons of fun with many different game modes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; No need to introduce this one. While its successor, &lt;strong&gt;Diablo II&lt;/strong&gt; (2000) gets all the praise, I probably played the first one even more. Sadly, offline or closed game with friends was the way to go, online was full of cheaters. Still remember the very first time I connected to battle.net, before I even left the town someone had dropped a full set of one of the best endgame gear for me. Kind of broke the entire online experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D\"&gt;Duke Nukem 3D&lt;/a&gt; Some preferred &lt;strong&gt;Quake&lt;/strong&gt; (also 1996), for me, it was Duke Nukem all the way, I mean, why just kill some monsters when you can kill some monsters and visit strip clubs and space, and strip clubs in space? First game that made me use a level editor, built a few entire levels for it (sadly, all lost).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace_2\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megarace 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Totally over the top game, crazy real actors cutscenes, crazy races with weapons, crazy level design, crazy everything. Totally recommended. &lt;strong&gt;Megarace&lt;/strong&gt; (1993) was also great, but far from the fun of 2. &lt;strong&gt;Megarace 3&lt;/strong&gt; (2002) doesn&amp;#39;t exist (I wish).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_the_Realm_II\"&gt;Lords of the Realm II&lt;/a&gt; An interesting mix of turn-based management game and RTS. Currently still available for cheap, if you enjoy original ideas, strategy and don&amp;#39;t fear dated graphics, I can only recommend giving it a try.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screamer_2\"&gt;Screamer 2&lt;/a&gt; Rally racing game, not very realistic but very enjoyable game. Really good graphics, animation and soundtrack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Settlers II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Along with &lt;strong&gt;Civilization&lt;/strong&gt; (1991), one of the few games that would hook me for hours every time I launched it at that time (and both still do). One of the best management / RTS ever made. I&amp;#39;d spend hours just looking at all those units doing things on their own, or doing nothing, since they&amp;#39;d start doing funny things when having nothing to do. I&amp;#39;d also wait for some resources to be moved for a few minutes, just to see a pig carried by a donkey. Seriously, if you don&amp;#39;t see what I&amp;#39;m talking about, go get the game (or the 10th anniversary edition from 2006), and get a pig on a donkey. You&amp;#39;ll like it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(1996_video_game)\"&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/a&gt; The birth of a long series. While the game was pretty much revolutionary at that time, if now looks really dated. &lt;strong&gt;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&lt;/strong&gt; (2007) remade this one in a much more enjoyable way by today standards. People nowadays will never understand the idea of spending 5 minutes trying to get your character in a corner just to look at boobs made of 3 polygons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_2097\"&gt;Wipeout 2097&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;strong&gt;Wipeout XL&lt;/strong&gt;) An amazingly well designed game. Futuristic racing game with weapons, very challenging to master.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_(series)\"&gt;F-22 Lightning II&lt;/a&gt; One of the few combat flight simulator I really played. &lt;strong&gt;F-22 Lightning 3&lt;/strong&gt; (1999), the 3rd game in the series (while II is the first, confusing, I know) is also worth taking a look at. The 2nd game, &lt;strong&gt;F-22 Raptor&lt;/strong&gt; (1997) was more forgettable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroes of Might and Magic II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Many would disagree, but this is the best in the series for me. I still play it from time to time and I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll spend hours on it every time I launch the game. An expansion was released in 1997 too, also recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1997&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Annihilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 1997 was the year of RTS. Total Annihilation is the one I spent the most time on, and I still enjoy it from time to time now that it&amp;#39;s back on Steam. It took strategy to a new dimension, with so many units compared to anything before. And by so many units I mean both so many available, and so many controlled at once. Sound track was also some amazing classical music, that would change depending on what you were currently doing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game)\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt; The birth of a very well-known series, for some reason, I never really enjoyed the game after it went 3D with the 3rd opus. This one remains my favourite by far. Spent weeks creating an entire custom city with a friend. Lost it. Am sad now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth:_The_Fallen_Lords\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A really impressive fantasy tactical game. It looked really good for that year, the story was interested, and the level design was very clever and challenging. 2 sequels were made, &lt;strong&gt;Myth II: Soulblighter&lt;/strong&gt; (1998), also highly recommended, and &lt;strong&gt;Myth III: The Wolf Age&lt;/strong&gt; (2001), somewhat less interesting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Rampage\"&gt;Redneck Rampage&lt;/a&gt; The title actually says almost everything about this game, all you need more is to know it&amp;#39;s a FPS.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quake II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For me, this was the most impressive game at launch in the &lt;strong&gt;Quake&lt;/strong&gt; series. It felt like 3D FPS suddenly leaped into a new area. Gameplay and graphics were a huge step up from anything before.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Reign:_The_Future_of_War\"&gt;Dark Reign&lt;/a&gt; 1997 was really the golden age of RTS, this one had a really unique art style and some interesting mechanics. A sequel, &lt;strong&gt;Dark Reign 2&lt;/strong&gt; (2000) also gets high praises, but I didn&amp;#39;t feel the move to full 3D was that successful, and never finished it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_(video_game)\"&gt;Claw&lt;/a&gt; A somewhat forgotten but very enjoyable plarformer. You&amp;#39;re both a cat and a pirate, how could you not enjoy it?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Racer\"&gt;Moto Racer&lt;/a&gt; Possibly the motorcycle racing game I played the most. The feeling of speed was amazing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_2140\"&gt;Earth 2140&lt;/a&gt; Did I already say something about this year being one of the best for RTS? This one also brought lots of interesting ideas to the table, especially with a great AI and units.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hard to talk about this game without starting a war on which Final Fantasy was the best. Well, it was this one. Now, I said it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Strike\"&gt;Nuclear Strike&lt;/a&gt; Fifth game in the &amp;quot;Strike&amp;quot; series, started by &lt;strong&gt;Desert Strike&lt;/strong&gt; (1992). For some reasons, all other entries in this series were mostly forgettable. While this one didn&amp;#39;t get as much praise as the first one, it was still a very enjoyable shooter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_(video_game)\"&gt;Ignition&lt;/a&gt; Also knows as &lt;strong&gt;Fun Tracks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Bleifuss Fun&lt;/strong&gt;. Another somewhat underrated game, really fast miniature cars racing game with clever and beautiful track design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_%2776\"&gt;Interstate 76&lt;/a&gt; A very unusual game, which looked like some fun weaponized car action game, but was actually closer to a strategy/simulation game, which actually makes sense since it was based on &lt;strong&gt;MechWarrior 2&lt;/strong&gt; (1995) engine. I thought a long time about including &lt;strong&gt;MechWarrior 2&lt;/strong&gt; in this list actually, the game felt really good, and I tried countless times to get into it, but never managed to do so. &lt;strong&gt;Interstate 76&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, sucked many hours out of my life.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_Death\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Such a good racing game, looked particularly amazing on PC with MMX instructions. While the game was definitely a technical demonstration of these new capabilities, it was also really fun and easy to play.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Culture\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A kind of open world and very unique game. It might be short and non challenging, but I spent so much time on this one. You control a submarine, salvage/mine/trade things, and engage in missions with 2 nations at war with each other. With a kind of short main storyline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_Lost_Children#Video_game\"&gt;The City of Lost Children&lt;/a&gt; While that adventure game received terrible reviews, I absolutely loved it, the atmosphere was really well made.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKnD_(video_game)\"&gt;KKnD&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, 1997, RTS, something something. Xtreme edition mostly recommended, not sure I ever played the basic edition, one more amazing RTS. Had a sequel the next year: &lt;strong&gt;KKnD 2&lt;/strong&gt; (1998), but I preferred the first one by a long shot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1998&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent:_FreeSpace_%E2%80%93_The_Great_War\"&gt;Descent: FreeSpace&lt;/a&gt; Despite the name, and the same developers, this has little to do with &lt;strong&gt;Descent&lt;/strong&gt; (1995). A great single player space simulation, multiplayer was apparently very flawed, but I never played online or LAN. Setting up your ship before a mission added a small strategy aspect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed_III:_Hot_Pursuit\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need For Speed III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Visually, the most impressive game of 1998 to me, by far. First 2 games in the series (1994 and 1997) were good, but this one was amazing. It brought back police chases from the first and made it the central part of the game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogo:_Mobile_Armor_Division\"&gt;Shogo: MAD&lt;/a&gt; An unusual FPS, where you control either your character, or a mecha depending on the level, sadly eclipsed by &lt;strong&gt;Half-Life&lt;/strong&gt;, released soon after.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_1602\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anno 1602&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Really good and challenging RTS / city builder game. Played it so much that I can still hear Greensleaves while I write this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_II:_The_Chosen\"&gt;Blood II&lt;/a&gt; Sequel from &lt;strong&gt;Blood&lt;/strong&gt; (1997), both are actually pretty good FPS, with lots of violence and dark humour.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur&amp;#x27;s_Gate\"&gt;Baldur&amp;#39;s Gate&lt;/a&gt; Kind of revived the AD&amp;amp;D genre that had no big and popular titles since &lt;strong&gt;Eye of the Beholder&lt;/strong&gt; (1990), and led to many sequels and similar games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000\"&gt;Dune 2000&lt;/a&gt; An underrated &lt;strong&gt;Dune&lt;/strong&gt; game, while it wasn&amp;#39;t as revolutionary as the first two, it had very little flaws, and was very enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon_II:_Carpocalypse_Now\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carmageddon II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to &lt;strong&gt;Carmageddon&lt;/strong&gt; (1997), this game sparked a quite big controversy at the time, and was censored in many countries. A totally crazy &amp;quot;racing&amp;quot; game, which actually ended up having very little to do with racing most of the time. Instead, you&amp;#39;d wreck every opponent and pedestrian, or throw them against a wall with huge springs, or hit them with giant flails attached to the back of your car, or...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Cop:_LAPD\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Cop: LAPD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A mostly forgotten game, even at that time. I had amazing times playing it with a friend in coop mode. Basically a third person shooter where you control the police, and kill everything. Had a lot of great ideas, and apparently inspired modern MOBA games. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half-Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nah, I don&amp;#39;t need to say anything. Just play it if you haven&amp;#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Jackrabbit_2\"&gt;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&lt;/a&gt; Classic platformer, not really adding anything new, but doing everything right. Also had a great level editor, and once again, I lost everything I made with it. And am sad.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandos:_Behind_Enemy_Lines\"&gt;Commandos&lt;/a&gt; The game that made real time tactics popular. Challenging and unforgiving game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_II:_Soulblighter\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Same as the first, just better in every way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Railroad Tycoon II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still the best train management game I ever played, looked and sounded amazing (that soundtrack).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DethKarz\"&gt;DethKarz&lt;/a&gt; An underrated combat racing game. Fast with great graphics and gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_(1998_video_game)\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt; Simple arcade / shooter game, but extremely enjoyable, I sank a lot of time on this one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper_Racing\"&gt;Viper Racing&lt;/a&gt; Very enjoyable racing game that sadly lacked content. Could have been a huge hit IMO.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tacticalsoft.com/arsenal1/arsenal.htm\"&gt;A.R.S.E.N.A.L - Taste the Power&lt;/a&gt; A really interesting new take on RTS from a small studio. Tactically much more complex than most RTS, especially with addition of things like fuel management.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiN\"&gt;SiN&lt;/a&gt; Underrated FPS. Interesting story and overall design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1999&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana:_Little_Sister\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kana: Little Sister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Adult visual novel. While there is very little graphic scenes, and all very soft, what made this game a very adult game were the themes. Do not play when depressed, seriously, this is the very first game that had me totally in tears in front of my computer, and yet I could not stop playing, I had to know what would happen, I had to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_2\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Keeper 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You should be familiar with Peter Molyneux by now. He created the first &lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Keeper&lt;/strong&gt; (1997), which was an amazing mix of RTS, god game and management, with unique themes and characters. While he wasn&amp;#39;t involved in this one (as far as I know), this game took the first one to the next level, and turned it in a pure masterpiece.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeworld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I really, really hoped this game would start a new major branch of RTS, the idea of a RTS with 6 degrees of freedom hadn&amp;#39;t even crossed my mind before I heard about this game. And my first thought was that it would be really hard to play. How wrong I was, the gameplay was simply perfect. Sadly, there hasn&amp;#39;t been many similar games, except for &lt;strong&gt;Homeworld 2&lt;/strong&gt; (2003). Both were remastered in 2015.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSpace_2\"&gt;FreeSpace 2&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to &lt;strong&gt;FreeSpace&lt;/strong&gt; (1998), it was superior in every way, fixing most issues the first had, and improving everything it already did well. Amazing story and graphics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2\"&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/a&gt; One of the first &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; FPS to successfully include RPG elements. Highly recommended along with &lt;strong&gt;Deux Ex&lt;/strong&gt; (2000).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_II:_Combat_Commander\"&gt;Battlezone II&lt;/a&gt; It took some time for the developers to fix the game that had game-breaking bugs on release, which kind of hindered its success. The game was an amazing mix of RTS and FPS, really enjoyable once its original issues were fixed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II\"&gt;Age of Empires II&lt;/a&gt; Still the best title in &lt;strong&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/strong&gt; series to me. Very enjoyable RTS, both in solo or multiplayer. &lt;strong&gt;Age of Empires II HD&lt;/strong&gt; (2013) is more modern release of this game, but it feels horribly overpriced to me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcast_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sadly, not many could play this game on launch, because of absolutely crazy hardware requirements for the time. One of the first game that would really classify as open-world 3D.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_versus_Predator_(1999_video_game)\"&gt;Aliens vs Predator&lt;/a&gt; Probably the best AvP game ever made, I&amp;#39;d even say the best Alien game. Playing marine made it a complete horror game, it really managed to put you in the shoes of a single lost marine fighting those crazy monsters (and dying, and dying, and dying again). And playing as those crazy monsters was also really enjoyable, especially running on walls as an alien to stalk on those marines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omikron:_The_Nomad_Soul\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omikron: The Nomad Soul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I don&amp;#39;t know where to start for this one. This game was an amazing mix of genres, in a (kind of) open-world 3rd person game, that included some shooter parts, and some fighting (as in 3D fighting game, &lt;strong&gt;Virtua Fighter&lt;/strong&gt; style). A world that felt huge, with interesting characters everywhere, and such a great story. And Bowie (both in game, and partly behind it).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament\"&gt;Unreal Tournament&lt;/a&gt; No need to introduce that one. &lt;strong&gt;Quake 3&lt;/strong&gt; (also 1999) and UT were the 2 big FPS of the end of 90s. My preference went to UT for multiplayer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Volt\"&gt;Re-Volt&lt;/a&gt; Radio controlled car racing game, with weapons, what&amp;#39;s not to love about that?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Soldier:_Expendable\"&gt;Expendable&lt;/a&gt; Very basic shoot-em-up, looked absolutely fantastic when it came out, with crazy effects everywhere, kind of like &lt;strong&gt;Incoming&lt;/strong&gt; (1998). Great game to play with a friend.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkstone:_Evil_Reigns\"&gt;Darkstone&lt;/a&gt; While it wasn&amp;#39;t the most beautiful game, this is one of the first Diablo-like that successfully went full-3D. Great gameplay and replayability, but probably too ugly for most by today&amp;#39;s standards (it already kind of was by 99&amp;#39;s standards).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_of_Mages\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rage of Mages 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This game was so incredibly addictive, spent a lot of days on this one. An original mix of RPG and RTS, and definitely much harder than most games from any of these genres.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_(video_game)\"&gt;Pharaoh&lt;/a&gt; One of the best city-building games ever made for me. Challenging and interesting campaign, also great music.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Sooo, someone told me recently that I had played A LOT of very varied games, for a very long time, and gave me the idea of making a small list of games I enjoyed by year, which is what I did. It got a bit out of hand.\n\nThis is a personal list of what I enjoyed, there are still many games I haven't played, and some big titles I didn't enjoy, so I know that **&lt;insert your favourite game here&gt;** is missing.\n\nGames with title link as [**bold**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold) are the ones that stood out the most to me.\n\n### 1980\n- [**Rogue**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game\\)) Ever wondered where the term \"roguelike\" comes from? Well, here's the answer.\n- [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) If you enjoy reading, this was an amazing text-adventure game. Both sequels **Zork II** (1981) and **Zork III** (1982) also highly recommended.\n\n***\n\n### 1981\n- [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) Technically the 2nd game in the series, after **Galaxian** (1979), but **Galaga** was so great it made everyone forget about the first.\n- [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) Basic but unique game, countless remakes were made.\n- [Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord) The birth of one of the best RPG series ever.\n- [**Ultima**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness) The birth of one of the best RPG series ever.\n- [Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game\\)) No need to introduce him.\n\n***\n\n### 1982\n- [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) Great puzzle game, many remakes available.\n- [Pitfall!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!) A classic platformer, didn't age that well though.\n- [Ms. Pac-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man) Fixed everything that the original **Pac-man** (1980) had wrong.\n- [Centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game\\)) Atari 2600 version.\n- [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game\\)) Totally trippy game.\n\n***\n\n### 1983\n- [**Alley Cat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game\\)) Reaaaally hard game, with very questionable colour palette, but I spent many hours on that one.\n- [**Digger**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digger_(video_game\\)) A classic and amazing game, also had a ton of more recent remakes.\n- [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game\\)) Another game with countless remakes, many of them are worth a shot.\n- [Dragon's Lair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair_(1983_video_game\\)) A game that made people have a glimpse of what gaming could become, graphically amazing, makes Dark Souls feel like a walk in the park.\n- [Pole position II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_Position_II) Looked really good at that time, with great gameplay too.\n\n***\n\n### 1984\n- [Boulder dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash) Another one that spawned countless remakes.\n- [Drugwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugwars) Later remade as Dope Wars end of 90s, simple trading game.\n- [Marble Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness) Interesting physics / puzzle / racing game.\n- [King's Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I) Forget about the 1990 remake, the original (and its many sequels) are the way to go, will probably feel slow today though.\n- [1942](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game\\)) One of the first Capcom hits. Really good WWII vertical scroll shooter.\n\n***\n\n### 1985\n- [Rush'n Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush'n_Attack) Aka **Green Beret**, shoot'em up. Was never really acclaimed as a great game, but I loved it.\n- [**Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F_(1985\\)) Gets harder every year considering this game kind of teaches you geography and countries, and those things changes (hello Soviet Union?).\n- [**Ultima IV**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar) For me the best **Ultima**, loved it so much I created an entire map of the world myself using squared A4 paper (my copy, despite being official, didn't include the map) to help me get around.\n- [Dragon Buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Buster) Overall an average game, but it was one of the first to introduce a few things that are now common in video games (double jump and health bar). Still had lots of fun with it.\n\n***\n\n### 1986\n- [Yie Ar Kung-Fu II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yie_Ar_Kung-Fu_II) Lots of time spent on that one, simple fighting game, but with 2 players you could control a woman, in a fighting game, that was never seen before.\n- [**Enduro Racer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enduro_Racer) Quite a hard dirt bike game, in which you could modify your bike with points gained depending on your result in each race. This mod system made the game really interesting IMO, finding the optimal bonuses depending on how many points you got was nice.\n- [**Bubble Bobble**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble) Oh god, just play this if you haven't played it yet. Like, now, stop reading, go and have fun.\n- [**Slap Fight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_Fight) Played on Thomson version, really good scrolling shooter, full power-up was crazily overpowered.\n- [Les cavernes de Thenebe](http://www.uvlist.net/fr/game-206149-Les+Cavernes+de+Thenebe) A game you probably never heard about, looked [like this](http://dcmoto.free.fr/programmes/les-cavernes-de-thenebe/04.png), basically lots of challenging puzzles.\n- [Vampire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by02CLAFLp0) Another unknown title I absolutely loved, very challenging game where you play a random guy whose car break down in front of a castle, at midnight, and set off to save a damsel in distress, kidnapped by vampires, and witches, and dragons, and...\n\n***\n\n### 1987\n- [Maniac Mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion) While the game is amazing, I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you loved its sequel: **Day of the Tentacle** (1993). This one was not remastered and didn't really age well, it already felt old when the sequel was released.\n- [Fantasy Zone II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Zone_II:_The_Tears_of_Opa-Opa) Really fun side-scrolling shooter game. Trippy colourful world.\n- [**Golvellius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golvellius) An amazing underrated Action/RPG on Master System, aged quite well too.\n- [**Rainbow Islands**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Islands:_The_Story_of_Bubble_Bobble_2) Technically the sequel to **Bubble Bobble**, but a totally different game. Very addictive platformer with some neat ideas. Players \"shoot\" rainbows that serves both as weapon and platforms on which they can walk. Really recommending this one, even now.\n- [**Wizball**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizball) Such a unique game, I spent hours just trying to fully understand it. Very challenging and absolutely amazing once you start mastering the controls and power ups.\n- [**R-Type**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) There should be no need to introduce this one. If you feel there's a need, you haven't played it, so stop reading and do it, now.\n- [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game\\)) Basic but fun and somewhat challenging game (Atari 7800).\n- [Renegade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_(video_game\\)) While this game was from 1986 originally, it was released in 1987 for DOS. Basic beat'em up, but the best at that time.\n\n***\n\n### 1988\n- [**Captain Blood**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Blood_(video_game\\)) Amazing concept, hard and sometimes extremely confusing. A sequel, **Commander Blood**, was made in 1994 too, while praised, I really preferred the original.\n- [**Ghouls'n Ghosts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouls_%27n_Ghosts) Remained one of the best platformer to me for years.\n- [Psychic World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_World) An underrated game for me. Not very well known action platformer. I absolutely loved the power-ups in that one. Some levels had really great and challenging design.\n- [Scramble Spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_Spirits) I'd say this was one of the best vertical scrolling shooter from that time. 2 players mode was amazing.\n- [**Super Mario Bros 3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3) Best **Mario** game for me, wasted many, many hours on this game. Still enjoyable nowadays.\n- [Battle Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Chess) While it would now look basic, this game probably made some people start chess just to watch all those crazy capture animations. Lots of fun references too. But in the end, it's just a chess game.\n- [Arcade Volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Volleyball) An extremely basic game, but soooo addictive. Really good with friends. Physics were also quite good for that time, many remakes and \"inspired\" games came out mostly in the 90s.\n\n***\n\n### 1989\n- [Prince of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia) Incredible animation and graphics for the year.\n- [Sim City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game\\)) The game that would make city building a popular genre, and start a long series of games, spin-offs and rip-offs.\n- [**Darius II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_II_(video_game\\)) (aka **Sagaia**) I'd say this game was, along with **R-Type** (1987) the best shoot'em up from that time. Sadly, this one if much less known.\n- [**Wonderboy III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_III:_The_Dragon%27s_Trap) Completed this one countless times, great action-adventure game that aged well, still playing it from time to time. Each chapter ends in yourself being transformed into a different animal with different weaknesses and strengths. A remake is planned for 2017, I really hope it manages to keep the spirit of this game.\n- [**Xenon 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_2_Megablast) You can only have a megablast playing this. Sorry. Amazing shooter with shop to buy/sell power ups, very challenging, and once over you can start again in very-very challenging mode.\n- [**Ys I &amp; II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_I_%26_II) An improves version of the first 2 games (from 1987 and 1998), really great Action RPG for that time, might seem a bit dated today, **Ys I &amp; II Chronicles+** (2013) is more recommended.\n- [Populous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(video_game\\)) If you haven't heard of Peter Molyneux, this is the game that absolutely launched his career in video gaming industry. He's basically seen as one of the geniuses of video games history, that guy worked on so many amazing games (**Theme Park** (1994), **Magic Carpet** (1994), **Dungeon Keeper** (1997), **Black &amp; White** (2001), **Fable** (2004), etc.). Populous might be the very first \"god simulator\", a management/strategy game where you play the role of a god. You had to trade your life to end this game (500 levels to beat).\n\n***\n\n### 1990\n- [**The Secret of Monkey Island**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island) Still the best point &amp; click for me. Nothing beats the original Guybrush Threepwood.\n- [Parodius!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parodius!_From_Myth_to_Laughter) Lots of nonsense, then more nonsense. And then, nonsense.\n- [Red Baron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Baron_(1990_video_game\\)) Might be a bit vomit-inducing today, but an amazing 3D plane simulator for the year.\n- [Rick Dangerous 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous_2) Great platformer with puzzle elements, that fixed everything that was wrong in the first game. Some say the wait for Half-Life 3 is too long, but many still wait for the sequel of that one.\n- [Ski or Die!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_or_Die) Follow up of **Skate or Die** (1988), fun game with 5 different mini-games, snowball blast was, well, a blast.\n\n***\n\n### 1991\n- [**Another world**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game\\)) The intro alone made me launch this game many, many times, recent remake seem good, haven't tried it yet.\n- [Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game\\)) A very simple, yet entertaining game, basically trying to hit each other with artillery. Single player was uninteresting, but 2 players games were amazing.\n- [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game\\)) A really interesting concept, great game that had many sequels.\n- [The Blues Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(video_game\\)) Loved the gameplay, and music, also a great 2 players game.\n- [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(8-bit_video_game\\)) There's no such thing as 'too fast'. Every platformer felt slow after this one.\n- [**Civilization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game\\)) One of the first game that made me lose the concept of time, still playing it despite the outdated graphics.\n- [**Moktar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_the_Fox) Challenging platformer, later released as **Titus the Fox**, but I think the music and sound changed, and the original were awesome.\n- [Micro Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines_(video_game\\)) Perfect time waster, especially in multiplayer mode.\n- [Populous II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_II:_Trials_of_the_Olympian_Gods) Sequel to, and as hard to describe as **Populous** (1989). As the first one, the game was gigantic, with this time 1000 levels.\n\n***\n\n### 1992\n- [**Dune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(video_game\\)) Amazing adventure game, followed by some amazing first glimpse at what would become RTS in the last stage of the game, definitely worth playing.\n- [**Dune II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II) Didn't age as well as the first one, RTS went a long way since then, while this game was not technically the first RTS, it's one that set the entire basis of the genre and inspired countless titles since then. Played through the entire game many times, and can still get into it nowadays (despite the very annoying limits, such as single unit selection, and the need to select action before doing anything). I'm still amazed Westwood Studios managed to get these 2 games out in the same year.\n- [Desert Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Strike) Isometric shoot'em up with very smooth gameplay.\n- [Zool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zool) Beautiful, smooth, very fast and hard platformer.\n- [**Flashback**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(1992_video_game\\)) Incredible animation and graphics for the year (yeah, I said that 3 years ago). Forget about the 2103 remake.\n\n***\n\n### 1993\n- [Prehistorik 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistorik_2) Sequel to **Prehistorik** (1991), this platformer was simply amazing. Really beautiful game, with lots of details and hidden content, had a really high replayability.\n- [**Day of the Tentacle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle) One of the best point and click ever made. Really great graphics for the year, funny and witty game. Full of characters you'll remember 25 years after playing. A remake is available, go get it.\n- [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game\\)) Do I need to say anything about that one? This game was simply a revolution in the land of FPS, so much the genre was basically called Doom-like for years after this release.\n- [**Kyrandia 2 - The Hand of Fate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia#Book_Two_-_The_Hand_of_Fate) An underrated point and click, sometimes twisted (you'll get the reference if you've played it enough). Definitely worth at least a playthrough, while this is the 2nd game in the series (of 3), there's no need to play the first game to understand it.\n- [**Princess Maker 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maker_2) Sequel to **Princess Maker** (1991), while the first game was already great, this is the game that would make the series popular. Your role in this game is to raise a princess from age 10 to 18, choosing what she is going to study, or what jobs she'll be doing, each action influencing the character stats. A lot of specific events can also happen, in which the outcome can be decided by your choices or her statistics. Really high replayability, with lots of different outcomes (74 different endings), not always very SFW (like, she can end up working as a \"bondage queen\").\n- [Shadow of the Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Comet) One of the games based on HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu. The game was really, really good, but messed up by having bad controls. A sequel was also made, **Prisoner of Ice** (1995), but was overall less interesting.\n\n***\n\n### 1994\n- [The Lost Vikings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Vikings) While the game was released in 1993 on SNES, I listed it in 1994 because its best edition came out this year, adding some content to the original game. Good mix of platform and puzzle games. First big success of Blizzard Entertainment, which left many legendary games.\n- [Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans) While **The Lost Vikings** was a big success for Blizzard, it was nothing compared to the first **Warcraft** game, which started a long (and loved) series of games.\n- [Asuka 120% Burning Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_120%25_Burning_Fest) Not a very well known fighting game, but an amazing one. 100% female characters, with very varied fighting styles. Many versions were made, some feel less dated than the original.\n- [**Descent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game\\)) The sense of freedom of movement you got in that game was amazing. One of the very few games for which I'd recommend getting a joystick, made it so immersive. Probably the best gameplay of any full 3D game available at that time. Level design was also really clever, especially in solo mode.\n- [Raptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows) An exceptionally good looking shooter for that time. Enemies were a mix of flying and ground (and water) units and buildings, and you had to learn to switch between weapons adapter to each of them. This game seemed to have somewhat resurrected recently, showing up again on Steam/Gog and even had an updated release in 2015.\n- [Theme Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Park_(video_game\\)) Very first games in the \"Theme\" series by Bullfrog and Peter Molyneux, which is mostly known for this game and **Theme Hospital** (1997). This remained the best amusement park management game for long, until **RollerCoaster Tycoon** (1999) set the bar much higher.\n- [Wacky Wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Wheels) A fun racing game, sadly didn't age well.\n- [**Magic Carpet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_(video_game\\)) A mix of action, strategy and (kind of) god game, once more by Peter Molyneux. A hard to describe one, but one of those addictive games that would make hours disappear.\n\n***\n\n### 1995\n- [Baku Baku Animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Baku_Animal) Very simple puzzle game, yet really entertaining, especially in 2 players mode.\n- [Caesar II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_II) An interesting game for city-builder fans, this was one of the first to mix city-building with strategy. While I really enjoyed the city building part, I felt the strategy part was underwhelming.\n- [Fatal Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Racing) Aka **Whiplash**. Very arcade-oriented racing game. Fast, with crazy tracks making your car fly in every direction, in which destroying opponents cars was not just possible, but highly recommended.\n- [**Fury 3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fury3) This game, along with **Terminal Velocity** (1995), developed by the same people, with the same engine, and the same everything. I still preferred **Fury 3** since I played it first, but it got bad ratings overall (understandably). Both will probably look dated today, but were extremely enjoyable games at that time.\n- [Hi-Octane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Octane) A not very known racing game, in the same vein as **Wipeout** (1995). Despite being released a few months before it, **Hi-Octane** was totally eclipsed by its release.\n- [Magic Carpet 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_2) Sequel to **Magic Carpet** (1994), as hard to describe as the first, but also as recommended. While I wasn't a big fan of underground levels, the game did add a lot of variety to the original gameplay.\n- [Manx TT Super Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_TT_Super_Bike) Released in 1997 on PC and Saturn. One of my favourite motorbike arcade racing game.\n- [Phantasmagoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria_(video_game\\)) A very original point and click game. Which tried to mix live action with the genre. While the game itself was relatively average, it was a huge hit. I quite liked Adrienne, but the entire thing really looked like a random B-movie.\n- [**Warcraft II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness) An amazing RTS, while the first **Warcraft** was enjoyable, it still suffered from tedious controls. **Warcraft II** fixed most of those issues. It also looked fantastic for 1995, and still doesn't look ugly. The variety of units was amazing.\n- [**Worms**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game\\)) First title in what would become a long (and still ongoing) series of games, with lots of spin-offs and a ton of rip-offs. For many reasons, this one remains my favourite in the series, mainly because I had ton of fun with friends, and because I liked the darker theme that was replaced by a very funny/party oriented theme in the following games.\n\n***\n\n### 1996\n- [**Command &amp; Conquer - Red Alert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert) To me, still the best title in the **Command &amp; Conquer** series, did everything perfectly and set very high standards for RTS, especially for controls.\n- [Descent 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_II) Nothing particularly new in this one, but the first game was amazing, and the sequel remained on the same track.\n- [Destruction Derby 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_Derby_2) Combat racing game, looked good and was tons of fun with many different game modes.\n- [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game\\)) No need to introduce this one. While its successor, **Diablo II** (2000) gets all the praise, I probably played the first one even more. Sadly, offline or closed game with friends was the way to go, online was full of cheaters. Still remember the very first time I connected to battle.net, before I even left the town someone had dropped a full set of one of the best endgame gear for me. Kind of broke the entire online experience.\n- [Duke Nukem 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D) Some preferred **Quake** (also 1996), for me, it was Duke Nukem all the way, I mean, why just kill some monsters when you can kill some monsters and visit strip clubs and space, and strip clubs in space? First game that made me use a level editor, built a few entire levels for it (sadly, all lost).\n- [**Megarace 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace_2) Totally over the top game, crazy real actors cutscenes, crazy races with weapons, crazy level design, crazy everything. Totally recommended. **Megarace** (1993) was also great, but far from the fun of 2. **Megarace 3** (2002) doesn't exist (I wish).\n- [Lords of the Realm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_the_Realm_II) An interesting mix of turn-based management game and RTS. Currently still available for cheap, if you enjoy original ideas, strategy and don't fear dated graphics, I can only recommend giving it a try.\n- [Screamer 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screamer_2) Rally racing game, not very realistic but very enjoyable game. Really good graphics, animation and soundtrack.\n- [**The Settlers II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_II) Along with **Civilization** (1991), one of the few games that would hook me for hours every time I launched it at that time (and both still do). One of the best management / RTS ever made. I'd spend hours just looking at all those units doing things on their own, or doing nothing, since they'd start doing funny things when having nothing to do. I'd also wait for some resources to be moved for a few minutes, just to see a pig carried by a donkey. Seriously, if you don't see what I'm talking about, go get the game (or the 10th anniversary edition from 2006), and get a pig on a donkey. You'll like it.\n- [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(1996_video_game\\)) The birth of a long series. While the game was pretty much revolutionary at that time, if now looks really dated. **Tomb Raider: Anniversary** (2007) remade this one in a much more enjoyable way by today standards. People nowadays will never understand the idea of spending 5 minutes trying to get your character in a corner just to look at boobs made of 3 polygons.\n- [Wipeout 2097](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_2097) (aka **Wipeout XL**) An amazingly well designed game. Futuristic racing game with weapons, very challenging to master.\n- [F-22 Lightning II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_(series\\)) One of the few combat flight simulator I really played. **F-22 Lightning 3** (1999), the 3rd game in the series (while II is the first, confusing, I know) is also worth taking a look at. The 2nd game, **F-22 Raptor** (1997) was more forgettable.\n- [**Heroes of Might and Magic II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_II) Many would disagree, but this is the best in the series for me. I still play it from time to time and I'm sure I'll spend hours on it every time I launch the game. An expansion was released in 1997 too, also recommended.\n\n***\n\n### 1997\n- [**Total Annihilation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation) 1997 was the year of RTS. Total Annihilation is the one I spent the most time on, and I still enjoy it from time to time now that it's back on Steam. It took strategy to a new dimension, with so many units compared to anything before. And by so many units I mean both so many available, and so many controlled at once. Sound track was also some amazing classical music, that would change depending on what you were currently doing.\n- [Grand Theft Auto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game\\)) The birth of a very well-known series, for some reason, I never really enjoyed the game after it went 3D with the 3rd opus. This one remains my favourite by far. Spent weeks creating an entire custom city with a friend. Lost it. Am sad now.\n- [**Myth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth:_The_Fallen_Lords) A really impressive fantasy tactical game. It looked really good for that year, the story was interested, and the level design was very clever and challenging. 2 sequels were made, **Myth II: Soulblighter** (1998), also highly recommended, and **Myth III: The Wolf Age** (2001), somewhat less interesting.\n- [Redneck Rampage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Rampage) The title actually says almost everything about this game, all you need more is to know it's a FPS.\n- [**Quake II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II) For me, this was the most impressive game at launch in the **Quake** series. It felt like 3D FPS suddenly leaped into a new area. Gameplay and graphics were a huge step up from anything before.\n- [Dark Reign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Reign:_The_Future_of_War) 1997 was really the golden age of RTS, this one had a really unique art style and some interesting mechanics. A sequel, **Dark Reign 2** (2000) also gets high praises, but I didn't feel the move to full 3D was that successful, and never finished it.\n- [Claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_(video_game\\)) A somewhat forgotten but very enjoyable plarformer. You're both a cat and a pirate, how could you not enjoy it?\n- [Moto Racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Racer) Possibly the motorcycle racing game I played the most. The feeling of speed was amazing.\n- [Earth 2140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_2140) Did I already say something about this year being one of the best for RTS? This one also brought lots of interesting ideas to the table, especially with a great AI and units.\n- [**Final Fantasy VII**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII) Hard to talk about this game without starting a war on which Final Fantasy was the best. Well, it was this one. Now, I said it.\n- [Nuclear Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Strike) Fifth game in the \"Strike\" series, started by **Desert Strike** (1992). For some reasons, all other entries in this series were mostly forgettable. While this one didn't get as much praise as the first one, it was still a very enjoyable shooter.\n- [Ignition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_(video_game\\)) Also knows as **Fun Tracks** or **Bleifuss Fun**. Another somewhat underrated game, really fast miniature cars racing game with clever and beautiful track design.\n- [Interstate 76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_%2776) A very unusual game, which looked like some fun weaponized car action game, but was actually closer to a strategy/simulation game, which actually makes sense since it was based on **MechWarrior 2** (1995) engine. I thought a long time about including **MechWarrior 2** in this list actually, the game felt really good, and I tried countless times to get into it, but never managed to do so. **Interstate 76**, on the other hand, sucked many hours out of my life.\n- [**Pod**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_Death) Such a good racing game, looked particularly amazing on PC with MMX instructions. While the game was definitely a technical demonstration of these new capabilities, it was also really fun and easy to play.\n- [**Sub Culture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Culture) A kind of open world and very unique game. It might be short and non challenging, but I spent so much time on this one. You control a submarine, salvage/mine/trade things, and engage in missions with 2 nations at war with each other. With a kind of short main storyline.\n- [The City of Lost Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_Lost_Children#Video_game) While that adventure game received terrible reviews, I absolutely loved it, the atmosphere was really well made.\n- [KKnD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKnD_(video_game\\)) Yeah, 1997, RTS, something something. Xtreme edition mostly recommended, not sure I ever played the basic edition, one more amazing RTS. Had a sequel the next year: **KKnD 2** (1998), but I preferred the first one by a long shot.\n\n***\n\n### 1998\n- [Descent: FreeSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent:_FreeSpace_%E2%80%93_The_Great_War) Despite the name, and the same developers, this has little to do with **Descent** (1995). A great single player space simulation, multiplayer was apparently very flawed, but I never played online or LAN. Setting up your ship before a mission added a small strategy aspect.\n- [**Need For Speed III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed_III:_Hot_Pursuit) Visually, the most impressive game of 1998 to me, by far. First 2 games in the series (1994 and 1997) were good, but this one was amazing. It brought back police chases from the first and made it the central part of the game.\n- [Shogo: MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogo:_Mobile_Armor_Division) An unusual FPS, where you control either your character, or a mecha depending on the level, sadly eclipsed by **Half-Life**, released soon after.\n- [**Anno 1602**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_1602) Really good and challenging RTS / city builder game. Played it so much that I can still hear Greensleaves while I write this.\n- [Blood II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_II:_The_Chosen) Sequel from **Blood** (1997), both are actually pretty good FPS, with lots of violence and dark humour.\n- [Baldur's Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate) Kind of revived the AD&amp;D genre that had no big and popular titles since **Eye of the Beholder** (1990), and led to many sequels and similar games.\n- [Dune 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000) An underrated **Dune** game, while it wasn't as revolutionary as the first two, it had very little flaws, and was very enjoyable.\n- [**Carmageddon II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon_II:_Carpocalypse_Now) Sequel to **Carmageddon** (1997), this game sparked a quite big controversy at the time, and was censored in many countries. A totally crazy \"racing\" game, which actually ended up having very little to do with racing most of the time. Instead, you'd wreck every opponent and pedestrian, or throw them against a wall with huge springs, or hit them with giant flails attached to the back of your car, or...\n- [**Future Cop: LAPD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Cop:_LAPD) A mostly forgotten game, even at that time. I had amazing times playing it with a friend in coop mode. Basically a third person shooter where you control the police, and kill everything. Had a lot of great ideas, and apparently inspired modern MOBA games. \n- [**Half-Life**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game\\)) Nah, I don't need to say anything. Just play it if you haven't.\n- [Jazz Jackrabbit 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Jackrabbit_2) Classic platformer, not really adding anything new, but doing everything right. Also had a great level editor, and once again, I lost everything I made with it. And am sad.\n- [Commandos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandos:_Behind_Enemy_Lines) The game that made real time tactics popular. Challenging and unforgiving game.\n- [**Myth II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_II:_Soulblighter) Same as the first, just better in every way.\n- [**Railroad Tycoon II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_II) Still the best train management game I ever played, looked and sounded amazing (that soundtrack).\n- [DethKarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DethKarz) An underrated combat racing game. Fast with great graphics and gameplay.\n- [Swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_(1998_video_game\\)) Simple arcade / shooter game, but extremely enjoyable, I sank a lot of time on this one.\n- [Viper Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper_Racing) Very enjoyable racing game that sadly lacked content. Could have been a huge hit IMO.\n- [A.R.S.E.N.A.L - Taste the Power](http://www.tacticalsoft.com/arsenal1/arsenal.htm) A really interesting new take on RTS from a small studio. Tactically much more complex than most RTS, especially with addition of things like fuel management.\n- [SiN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiN) Underrated FPS. Interesting story and overall design.\n\n***\n\n### 1999\n- [**Kana: Little Sister**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana:_Little_Sister) Adult visual novel. While there is very little graphic scenes, and all very soft, what made this game a very adult game were the themes. Do not play when depressed, seriously, this is the very first game that had me totally in tears in front of my computer, and yet I could not stop playing, I had to know what would happen, I had to.\n- [**Dungeon Keeper 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_2) You should be familiar with Peter Molyneux by now. He created the first **Dungeon Keeper** (1997), which was an amazing mix of RTS, god game and management, with unique themes and characters. While he wasn't involved in this one (as far as I know), this game took the first one to the next level, and turned it in a pure masterpiece.\n- [**Homeworld**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld) I really, really hoped this game would start a new major branch of RTS, the idea of a RTS with 6 degrees of freedom hadn't even crossed my mind before I heard about this game. And my first thought was that it would be really hard to play. How wrong I was, the gameplay was simply perfect. Sadly, there hasn't been many similar games, except for **Homeworld 2** (2003). Both were remastered in 2015.\n- [FreeSpace 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSpace_2) Sequel to **FreeSpace** (1998), it was superior in every way, fixing most issues the first had, and improving everything it already did well. Amazing story and graphics.\n- [System Shock 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2) One of the first \"modern\" FPS to successfully include RPG elements. Highly recommended along with **Deux Ex** (2000).\n- [Battlezone II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_II:_Combat_Commander) It took some time for the developers to fix the game that had game-breaking bugs on release, which kind of hindered its success. The game was an amazing mix of RTS and FPS, really enjoyable once its original issues were fixed.\n- [Age of Empires II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II) Still the best title in **Age of Empires** series to me. Very enjoyable RTS, both in solo or multiplayer. **Age of Empires II HD** (2013) is more modern release of this game, but it feels horribly overpriced to me.\n- [**Outcast**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcast_(video_game\\)) Sadly, not many could play this game on launch, because of absolutely crazy hardware requirements for the time. One of the first game that would really classify as open-world 3D.\n- [Aliens vs Predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_versus_Predator_(1999_video_game\\)) Probably the best AvP game ever made, I'd even say the best Alien game. Playing marine made it a complete horror game, it really managed to put you in the shoes of a single lost marine fighting those crazy monsters (and dying, and dying, and dying again). And playing as those crazy monsters was also really enjoyable, especially running on walls as an alien to stalk on those marines.\n- [**Omikron: The Nomad Soul**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omikron:_The_Nomad_Soul) I don't know where to start for this one. This game was an amazing mix of genres, in a (kind of) open-world 3rd person game, that included some shooter parts, and some fighting (as in 3D fighting game, **Virtua Fighter** style). A world that felt huge, with interesting characters everywhere, and such a great story. And Bowie (both in game, and partly behind it).\n- [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) No need to introduce that one. **Quake 3** (also 1999) and UT were the 2 big FPS of the end of 90s. My preference went to UT for multiplayer.\n- [Re-Volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Volt) Radio controlled car racing game, with weapons, what's not to love about that?\n- [Expendable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Soldier:_Expendable) Very basic shoot-em-up, looked absolutely fantastic when it came out, with crazy effects everywhere, kind of like **Incoming** (1998). Great game to play with a friend.\n- [Darkstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkstone:_Evil_Reigns) While it wasn't the most beautiful game, this is one of the first Diablo-like that successfully went full-3D. Great gameplay and replayability, but probably too ugly for most by today's standards (it already kind of was by 99's standards).\n- [**Rage of Mages 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_of_Mages) This game was so incredibly addictive, spent a lot of days on this one. An original mix of RPG and RTS, and definitely much harder than most games from any of these genres.\n- [Pharaoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_(video_game\\)) One of the best city-building games ever made for me. Challenging and interesting campaign, also great music.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "653xkj", "gilded": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 1390, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ysilla", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_653xkj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.patientgamers", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cPue2puYA6XBjWGw347RyQpbHH084Eqo7qfIaV7abFE.png?s=9978713c754a6e276157efc861acf920", "width": 584, "height": 438}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cPue2puYA6XBjWGw347RyQpbHH084Eqo7qfIaV7abFE.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=a2960776fd384bc8acf513327eddfaad", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cPue2puYA6XBjWGw347RyQpbHH084Eqo7qfIaV7abFE.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=0c2442dd7a5d1f46c711bc2ed3987106", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cPue2puYA6XBjWGw347RyQpbHH084Eqo7qfIaV7abFE.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=4c917d46e2a792555ace0cd772ca03f3", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "bNv6VEvRNfb3YNpWN5_QxX1A_JsC6G2YG7OEnvJ3ALc"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "edited": 1492139956.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/patientgamers/comments/653xkj/dont_know_what_to_play_small_list_of_games_i/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492095203.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/653xkj/dont_know_what_to_play_small_list_of_games_i/", "author_flair_text": "moo.", "quarantine": false, "title": "Don't know what to play?

Mostly mindless hack'n slash, with a few tactical elements sometimes.\n- [Serious Sam 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Sam_2) Not as great as the first one, but still a very enjoyable FPS.\n- [F.E.A.R.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R.) Possibly one of the best mix of horror and FPS. While I enjoyed the game overall, I was really put down by its very erratic difficulty.\n- [Dungeon Siege II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Siege_II) Sequel to **Dungeon Siege** (2002), didn't really bring anything new to the table, so it was overall an OK game, but started to feel a bit dated by 2005 standards.\n\n***\n\n### 2006\n- [**Oblivion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion) 2006 would have been a really empty year in gaming without this one.\n\n***\n\n### 2007\n- [BioShock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock) Atmosphere was everything, everything was made in this game to suck the player into the world it was set in.\n- [**Recettear**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recettear:_An_Item_Shop%27s_Tale) A very well-made mix of Action RPG and shop management.\n- [Supreme Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_(video_game\\)) While it didn't get to the level of its predecessor **Total Annihilation** (1997), this was still a really good RTS.\n\n***\n\n### 2008\n- [**WoW: Wrath of the Lich King**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King) For me, the best time in WoW. I played on and off since beta when this came out, and it made the entire game sooo much better it sucked my life in for some time. Fixed a lot of existing issues, including making the game more accessible to non-hardcore players, while still introducing things like hard-modes at the same time. And 2 of the best raids ever created. Ulduar and ICC were the best times I had in any MMO raids.\n- [Valkyria Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyria_Chronicles) Such an amazingly well designed tactical RPG / shooter. Strong storytelling makes you really involved in what happens to the characters.\n- [Spore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game\\)) One more UFO in the world of gaming. Basically, you're god, and you develop a new species from nothing until it conquers the universe.\n- [Mirror's Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%27s_Edge) A non-traditional cyberpunk world and character. Great art and gameplay, might be missing a bit on story and freedom though.\n- [**Gemcraft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GemCraft) One of the best Tower Defense game IMO. Interesting concept that scales to crazy endgame. While this game was already amazing, 2014 sequel was superior in every ways.\n\n***\n\n### 2009\n- [Flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_(video_game\\)) Chiiiiiiilllllll.\n- [Br\u00fctal Legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BCtal_Legend) \\m/ \\m/\n- [**Torchlight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight) **Diablo 2** (2000) with modern gameplay and a colourful world.\n- [Risen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risen_(video_game\\)) Many find this one the best in the series (3 games now), personally preferred the 2nd.\n- [**Divinity II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity_II) Not the most loved RPG, but I really enjoyed this one, spent a long time to complete almost 100% side content.\n- [Blood Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Bowl_(2009_video_game\\)) Violent Fantasy Football either real time or turn based? Sign me in.\n\n***\n\n### 2010\n- [**Civilization V**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V) I loved **Civilization** (1991), but never got into any following Civilization game, until V. Yes, it did make me think \"one more turn\", as I realized the sun was starting to rise.\n- [**Fallout: New Vegas**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas) I played this game countless times since it was released, I still feel like I'm missing a lot of content to explore and builds to try.\n- [**Hyperdimension Neptunia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_(video_game\\)) For fans of J-RPG and J-Silliness only. Many references will be hard to get without some weird (and sometimes obscure) anime/manga knowledge.\n\n***\n\n### 2011\n- [Skyrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim) Not the best in the series, but still very enjoyable.\n- [Alice: Madness Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice:_Madness_Returns) Not as good as its predecessor **Alice** (2000), but also visually amazing.\n- [Dead Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Island) Progression really felt too slow, but overall a great game.\n- [Deus Ex: Human Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution) While I didn't enjoy it as much as the first **Deus Ex** (2000), this was also an amazing game.\n- [Dungeon Defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Defenders) Amazing game with friends, online mode is a mess full of cheaters though.\n- [**Saint's Row: The Third**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row:_The_Third) Started the game having no idea what it was. Few minutes later I was jumping off a helicopter in a panda suit through fire rings killing hordes of other mascots with chainsaw. One of the best \"random game launch\" surprise I ever had.\n\n***\n\n### 2012\n- [**Risen 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risen_2:_Dark_Waters) Best in the series for me. Absolutely loved this one. Yarr!\n- [The Secret World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_World) A great and different MMO, lots of varied content and quests that you want to read... which is definitely uncommon.\n- [**Torchlight II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight_II) Amazing quality for release price ($20), no major change from the first game, but this one just did everything perfectly.\n- [Long Live the Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Live_the_Queen_(video_game\\)) An interesting game based on the same system as Princess Maker 2.\n- [Diablo III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III) It wasn't perfect, especially at launch, but the gameplay was amazing.\n- [Sleeping Dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Dogs_(video_game\\)) Didn't spend that much time in this game, but overall a great open world game, with really beautiful design.\n\n***\n\n### 2013\n- [**Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Dogma#Dragon.27s_Dogma:_Dark_Arisen) Amazing game, lots of great ideas, especially the pawn system that make you create and share party members with friends/random people. Lots of farming and can be hard to get into if you're not into Japanese A-RPG.\n- [**Tomb Raider**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(2013_video_game\\)) Best reboot ever.\n- [Path of Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_Exile) Great online timewaster. League system makes the game very active and ever changing, but you'll have to drop everything you did and start again from scratch every few months if you want to keep up to date with new content. Still the best Free to play game out there.\n\n***\n\n### 2014\n\n- [**Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GemCraft) Best tower defense game if you have a few thousand hours to spend.\n- [Hero Siege](http://store.steampowered.com/app/269210/) Well made basic hack&amp;slash with roguelike elements.\n- [Shadow of Mordor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth:_Shadow_of_Mordor) While quickly repetitive, this game had some great ideas, especially the nemesis system.\n- [**Child of Light**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_Light) Short but amazing game, definitely worth a playthrough, very few games make me want to read all the text they throw at me, but I loved every single word this game fed me.\n- [Wolfenstein: The New Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein:_The_New_Order) Alternative history FPS. Way over the average FPS in terms of storytelling and fight variety.\n\n***\n\n### 2015\n- [The Witcher 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt) Beautiful game, interesting story, not a fan of the combat, and somewhat too much boring/repetitive side content, and too much of it (yes, that's a thing for me).\n- [Dead or Alive 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_or_Alive_5_Last_Round) Despite the DLC bullshit, I love this game, simple but very enjoyable gameplay, and yet hard to master.\n- [Victor Vran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Vran) Great action-RPG. Hard to play after **Witcher 3** though, having the same voice actor makes it really strange.\n- [Mad Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_(2015_video_game\\)) Technically amazing, could make that game work on some low end PC far below specs. Game itself was fun for quite a long time, but fuck those mines missions. Bit repetitive too fast.\n- [Fallout 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4) Really good FPS with some basic RPG elements, but really bad Fallout game.

While I enjoyed the game overall, I was really put down by its very erratic difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Siege_II\"&gt;Dungeon Siege II&lt;/a&gt; Sequel to &lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Siege&lt;/strong&gt; (2002), didn&amp;#39;t really bring anything new to the table, so it was overall an OK game, but started to feel a bit dated by 2005 standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2006&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oblivion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2006 would have been a really empty year in gaming without this one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2007&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock\"&gt;BioShock&lt;/a&gt; Atmosphere was everything, everything was made in this game to suck the player into the world it was set in.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recettear:_An_Item_Shop%27s_Tale\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recettear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A very well-made mix of Action RPG and shop management.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_(video_game)\"&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/a&gt; While it didn&amp;#39;t get to the level of its predecessor &lt;strong&gt;Total Annihilation&lt;/strong&gt; (1997), this was still a really good RTS.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2008&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WoW: Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For me, the best time in WoW. I played on and off since beta when this came out, and it made the entire game sooo much better it sucked my life in for some time. Fixed a lot of existing issues, including making the game more accessible to non-hardcore players, while still introducing things like hard-modes at the same time. And 2 of the best raids ever created. Ulduar and ICC were the best times I had in any MMO raids.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyria_Chronicles\"&gt;Valkyria Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; Such an amazingly well designed tactical RPG / shooter.

Lots of farming and can be hard to get into if you&amp;#39;re not into Japanese A-RPG.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(2013_video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Best reboot ever.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_Exile\"&gt;Path of Exile&lt;/a&gt; Great online timewaster. League system makes the game very active and ever changing, but you&amp;#39;ll have to drop everything you did and start again from scratch every few months if you want to keep up to date with new content.

An \"Anniversary Edition\" came out in 2015, with many upgrades from the original.\n- [Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(visual_novel\\)) If you like visual novels, one of the classics you shouldn't miss. Exist in editions with and without erotic content.\n- [**Alice**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee%27s_Alice) Graphically amazing game, with a very well designed and interesting universe. Storytelling was also top notch. A much more recent sequel was also made: **Alice: Madness Returns** (2011).\n- [Rollcage II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollcage_Stage_II) A good arcade oriented racing game, very fast paced.\n- [**Diablo II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II) No real need to introduce this one, such a great game it still has a big player base nowadays. The expansion, **Lord of Destruction**, is also very recommended.\n- [**Messiah**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(video_game\\)) A unique 3rd person shooter, IMHO very underrated. This game starts from a very original idea: you play an angel, who can possess any human (and much more), this is used to create some interesting puzzles. Also, great music.\n- [The Typing of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead) A great game to learn to type fast. Based on **The House of the Dead 2** (1998), where instead of shooting zombies with a gun, you need to type the letter/word/sentence that appears on them, without typo. This can easily go from trivial to extremely challenging.\n- [**Deus Ex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game\\)) IMHO, one of the best FPS every made. The game includes lots of RPG elements, and some stealth action too. If you haven't played it yet, it's worth a shot.\n- [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_2) This is the only skateboarding game that managed to really get my attention. Really solid gameplay and surprisingly a lot of things to do.\n\n***\n\n### 2001\n- [**Oni**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni_(video_game\\)) A very underrated game, animations and controls were perfect, and the game mixed melee fight (with a lot of moves) and shooter just flawlessly. I absolutely loved the design and characters too.\n- [Queen of Heart 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Bread_(game_developer\\)) A quite unknown fighting game. I loved the gameplay of that game with some totally crazy (and maybe unbalanced) combos. The studio behind it is mostly known for **Melty Blood** (2002)\n- [**Wizardry 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry_8) The last, and, to me, the best Wizardry game ever made, first (and only) one to use smooth movement instead of block. Still hoping for a revival of the series some day.\n- [Black &amp; White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_(video_game\\)) Another unusual game from Peter Molyneux. Once more a kind-of God simulation with a lot of interesting ideas, and a lot of flaws.\n- [Serious Sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Sam#First_Encounter) The birth of a long series of mindless FPS, and it did the mindless part very well.\n- [Max Payne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_(video_game\\)) Great atmosphere and gameplay, but the story often felt a little weak to me.\n- [**Final Fantasy X**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X) Another controversial title, but still the 2nd best in the series for me. Great content, universe and characters, tons of endgame side things and possibly the best storytelling in the series. A remaster is available, and greatly recommended.\n\n***\n\n### 2002\n- [Dungeon Siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Siege) One of those games I spent lots of hours with a friend. Not even playing in multiplayer, no, just in single player. The single level without loading screen was very impressive at that time, especially with graphics that good. Also a game made with player mods as a priority, which was also unusual at that time.\n- [**Morrowind**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind) Still the Elder Scrolls game I loved the most. One of the first games that really gave me an impression of freedom in everything.\n- [**DDR Extreme**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Dance_Dance_Revolution_Extreme) One of the best in the series for me. Spent so much time on that one. Few games beat the sense of achievements you get from AAA-ing some of those songs in heavy or challenge difficulties. I limited myself to a single DDR game in this list, but would recommend almost all of them.\n- [Higurashi no naku koro ni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higurashi_When_They_Cry) It took a very long time for this visual novel to get the success it deserved. A very well written open-ended horror / mystery story, that still has a very strong fanbase with tons of theories about the story.\n- [Industry Giant II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Giant_II) A somewhat underrated management game. Quite complex and challenging. Worth a look if you're into management games.\n- [Age of Mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology) Beautiful game for 2002, the very coherent art style still holds relatively well today. A great RTS, spin-off from **Age of Empires** series, with interesting ideas such as god powers.\n- [La Pucelle: Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Pucelle:_Tactics) A really good tactical RPG, preceded **Disgaea** (2003) in many ways.\n- [Wind: A breath of heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind:_A_Breath_of_Heart) Another visual novel mostly unknown outside Japan. Great writing and characters, worth a play if you like that kind of games. (warning: adult content)\n- [Ragnarok Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online) A very unique MMO, while it might look dated, and with much less content than most recent MMOs, this game had a unique feeling and community (more like many unique communities). A very open-ended game where you could spend hours in game without actually doing anything but chat.\n- [**RollerCoaster Tycoon 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2) Still the best amusement park management game ever made. I can still launch it and spend hours on that game.\n\n***\n\n### 2003\n- [**Star Ocean: Till the End of Time**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_Till_the_End_of_Time) One of those games I fully completed multiple times in 3 different versions (original JAP, director's cut JAP and EN). Really good Japanese A-RPG with lots of great characters and engaging combat system. Tons of side quests content too.\n- [**Homeworld 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld_2) **Homeworld** (1999) was already amazing. While the sequel didn't bring much novelty, it still did everything as well as the first, and is also worth spending many hours on it. Same as the first game, a 2015 remaster was made.\n- [**Freelancer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_(video_game\\)) To me, one of the best single player space trading and combat simulator ever made. Tons of NPCs, places and content to explore, and a lot of very different missions to complete.\n- [Disgaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgaea:_Hour_of_Darkness) Brilliant tactical RPG. Lots of funny characters (Laharl-Samaaaa) and engaging story. First game in a quite long and underrated series.\n- [Eve Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online) One of those very niche MMOs. The best economy I saw in any MMO so far, trading can be very interesting in it. The game is mostly known for its gigantic battles involving thousands of players for hours. A very unforgiving game that requires a lot of commitment.\n- [Beyond Good &amp; Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil_(video_game\\)) A beautiful (by 2003 standards) action adventure game. Lots of content to explore, and a great and unique story.\n- [Max Payne 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_2:_The_Fall_of_Max_Payne) While this was a great game overall, I felt it didn't add much to the original **Max Payne** (2001)\n\n***\n\n### 2004\n- [Sacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_(video_game\\)) An interesting take on Diablo-like action-RPG/hack'n slash. Tons of quests, great gameplay, and lots of farming, and lots of farming, and lots of farming, and lots of farming.\n- [**Puyo Pop Fever**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Pop_Fever) The fifth game in a long series that started with **Puyo Puyo** (1991) and still ongoing. An extremely challenging puzzle game. I'd say one of the best in the genre.\n- [Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy) Another UFO in video gaming history. You basically roll a ball to grab everything and make giant balls of everything. Also had some characters that words can't really describe. (yeah, that's not very a specific description, but try it, and you'll understand the challenge of describing... that)\n- [The Bard's Tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard%27s_Tale_(2004_video_game\\)) Overall a great A-RPG with lots of funny moments. Nothing groundbreaking, but worth a playthrough.\n- [**Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Bloodlines) An absolutely amazing game, if it didn't have that many small flaws it would be on top of the best games ever made. The story and storytelling are both flawless, especially for anyone familiar with the tabletop RPG this was based on. Sadly, combat was meh, and the game had too many technical issues. But it still deserves to be called the best 2004 game for me. YES, I KNOW, **Half-Life 2** was also from 2004, but... I still haven't played it. So **Vampire** it is.", "edited": 1492145324.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2000&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandia_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grandia II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The first RPG that really managed to get my attention since &lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/strong&gt; (1997), despite a bland story, the amazing combat system was enough to keep me going for multiple playthroughs. An &amp;quot;Anniversary Edition&amp;quot; came out in 2015, with many upgrades from the original.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(visual_novel)\"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; If you like visual novels, one of the classics you shouldn&amp;#39;t miss. Exist in editions with and without erotic content.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee%27s_Alice\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Graphically amazing game, with a very well designed and interesting universe. Storytelling was also top notch. A much more recent sequel was also made: &lt;strong&gt;Alice: Madness Returns&lt;/strong&gt; (2011).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollcage_Stage_II\"&gt;Rollcage II&lt;/a&gt; A good arcade oriented racing game, very fast paced.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diablo II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; No real need to introduce this one, such a great game it still has a big player base nowadays. The expansion, &lt;strong&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/strong&gt;, is also very recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A unique 3rd person shooter, IMHO very underrated. This game starts from a very original idea: you play an angel, who can possess any human (and much more), this is used to create some interesting puzzles. Also, great music.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead\"&gt;The Typing of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; A great game to learn to type fast. Based on &lt;strong&gt;The House of the Dead 2&lt;/strong&gt; (1998), where instead of shooting zombies with a gun, you need to type the letter/word/sentence that appears on them, without typo. This can easily go from trivial to extremely challenging.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; IMHO, one of the best FPS every made. The game includes lots of RPG elements, and some stealth action too. If you haven&amp;#39;t played it yet, it&amp;#39;s worth a shot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_2\"&gt;Tony Hawk&amp;#39;s Pro Skater 2&lt;/a&gt; This is the only skateboarding game that managed to really get my attention. Really solid gameplay and surprisingly a lot of things to do.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2001&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni_(video_game)\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oni&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A very underrated game, animations and controls were perfect, and the game mixed melee fight (with a lot of moves) and shooter just flawlessly. I absolutely loved the design and characters too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Bread_(game_developer)\"&gt;Queen of Heart 2001&lt;/a&gt; A quite unknown fighting game. I loved the gameplay of that game with some totally crazy (and maybe unbalanced) combos. The studio behind it is mostly known for &lt;strong&gt;Melty Blood&lt;/strong&gt; (2002)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry_8\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wizardry 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The last, and, to me, the best Wizardry game ever made, first (and only) one to use smooth movement instead of block. Still hoping for a revival of the series some day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_(video_game)\"&gt;Black &amp;amp; White&lt;/a&gt; Another unusual game from Peter Molyneux. Once more a kind-of God simulation with a lot of interesting ideas, and a lot of flaws.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Sam#First_Encounter\"&gt;Serious Sam&lt;/a&gt; The birth of a long series of mindless FPS, and it did the mindless part very well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_(video_game)\"&gt;Max Payne&lt;/a&gt; Great atmosphere and gameplay, but the story often felt a little weak to me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Another controversial title, but still the 2nd best in the series for me. Great content, universe and characters, tons of endgame side things and possibly the best storytelling in the series. A remaster is available, and greatly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2002&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Siege\"&gt;Dungeon Siege&lt;/a&gt; One of those games I spent lots of hours with a friend. Not even playing in multiplayer, no, just in single player. The single level without loading screen was very impressive at that time, especially with graphics that good. Also a game made with player mods as a priority, which was also unusual at that time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morrowind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still the Elder Scrolls game I loved the most. One of the first games that really gave me an impression of freedom in everything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Dance_Dance_Revolution_Extreme\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDR Extreme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of the best in the series for me. Spent so much time on that one. Few games beat the sense of achievements you get from AAA-ing some of those songs in heavy or challenge difficulties. I limited myself to a single DDR game in this list, but would recommend almost all of them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higurashi_When_They_Cry\"&gt;Higurashi no naku koro ni&lt;/a&gt; It took a very long time for this visual novel to get the success it deserved. A very well written open-ended horror / mystery story, that still has a very strong fanbase with tons of theories about the story.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Giant_II\"&gt;Industry Giant II&lt;/a&gt; A somewhat underrated management game. Quite complex and challenging. Worth a look if you&amp;#39;re into management games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology\"&gt;Age of Mythology&lt;/a&gt; Beautiful game for 2002, the very coherent art style still holds relatively well today. A great RTS, spin-off from &lt;strong&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/strong&gt; series, with interesting ideas such as god powers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Pucelle:_Tactics\"&gt;La Pucelle: Tactics&lt;/a&gt; A really good tactical RPG, preceded &lt;strong&gt;Disgaea&lt;/strong&gt; (2003) in many ways.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind:_A_Breath_of_Heart\"&gt;Wind: A breath of heart&lt;/a&gt; Another visual novel mostly unknown outside Japan.

(warning: adult content)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online\"&gt;Ragnarok Online&lt;/a&gt; A very unique MMO, while it might look dated, and with much less content than most recent MMOs, this game had a unique feeling and community (more like many unique communities). A very open-ended game where you could spend hours in game without actually doing anything but chat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still the best amusement park management game ever made.

Really good Japanese A-RPG with lots of great characters and engaging combat system. Tons of side quests content too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld_2\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeworld 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Homeworld&lt;/strong&gt; (1999) was already amazing.

Did you just not play many, or did nothing fit your tastes?  Or both?\n\nHere are some games I enjoyed in 2016.  Maybe something on here you haven't tried will pique your interest (7/10 is my minimum rating for a game to be considered 'good').\n\n- Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen PC release (10/10)  The first action RPG to grab (and keep) my attention in many years.  I tried it back on PS3, but the performance issues turned me off.  The PC release fixes those, and it turns out it has some amazing gameplay.  The class system is really interesting, the boss battles are epic, and I found the constantly chattering party members endearing (not everyone felt this way, lol).  This is also the first fantasy game to actually make me want to play as a spellcaster.  Some of those spells are fucking amazing.\n\n- Darkest Dungeon (7/10)  Admittedly stressful, but the dark and despairing nature of the game was something else.  Never finished it, but worth looking into if you like turn-based RPGs with (very) dark themes.\n\n- Final Fantasy Explorers (7/10) admittedly not great, but a Monster Hunter clone with a Final Fantasy setting made this a guilty pleasure.\n\n- Style Savvy: Fashion Forward (7/10) Yes, yes, I know.  I'm a weird fuck.  But a laid-back game where I dress up women in cute outfits was fun for me.  \n\n- Death Road to Canada (7/10) Frustrating, but with a low price and fun customization features it was worth it for me.  The fun increases when you make the characters people you know/favorite characters from games/movies/shows.  Zombies are overdone, but the fun tone and humor of this game makes up for it.\n\n- World of Final Fantasy (9/10) This game was a surprise hit for me.  I was initially turned off by the art direction (those chibi characters are hideous to me), and the demo made it worse.  But when I played the actual game I discovered a surprisingly interesting story, (mostly) likable characters, and a ATB battle system.  Recommended for anyone who can look past the art style.\n\n- Total War: Warhammer (9/10) The Total War series' first foray into a fantasy setting, and I consider it a huge success.  I love strategy games, and fantasy elements add a whole new layer to strategies.  Definitely recommend waiting a bit for this one for folks on this sub, since the game + all the DLC will run you up quite a bit of cash.  But anyone who likes Fantasy/Warhammer and/or strategy games should give it a go.  The AI does cheat sometimes on the campaign map though, which made it lose the 10/10 from me.\n\n- Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir (9/10) A remaster of an old PS2 game, but with extra content and even an over-hauled combat system.  The beautiful hand-painted assets and fun, almost fighting game type combat made for a really fun game.  \n\n- Gravity Rush: Remastered (8/10) A niche game that got overlooked thanks to a Vita-only release, the remaster for PS4 helped get the game a little more exposure.  Unique gameplay (controlling gravity), an interesting world, and a lovable main character made this game a delight to play.  Small enemy roster and some annoying sidequests hurt the game a bit, but the sequel that came out in 2017 makes up for pretty much all of it.\n\n- Dangonronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (10/10) This was a truly bizarre experience, with a bizarre plot to match.  An 'action' based trial system accompanied by detective/investigation segments, quirky characters, and some damn intense scenarios, makes this a really special game.  Definitely niche, but a blast for those who can get into it.\n\n- Way of the Samurai 3 (10/10 for me, probably more like a 5/10 for most people) This is my guilty pleasure game.  It's wonky and has a lot of issues, but the 'Groundhog Day' style gameplay is amazing for me.  There's a shit-ton of endings, and tons of branching story paths that most games never come close to reaching.  The sequel, Way of the Samurai 4, got its PC release last year, and is a better game in a lot of ways, including gameplay.  A must-try for people who like historical samurai settings and/or games with branching story paths.\n\n- Samurai Warriors 4: Empires (10/10) The Warriors games are pretty niche, and a lot of people don't like them, but this game was an absolute blast for me.  The kingdom/character management aspect added an extra layer to the gameplay that made things more interesting than the main-line Warriors games (I love those too, but not as much as the Empires games).  If you love light kingdom management sims, character interactions, and lightly strategic hack and slash gameplay, it's definitely worth a shot.\n\nThose aren't *all* of the games I played in 2016, but they're the top ones that come to mind.  Hopefully I've given you at least one thing to look at, but if not I hope you have a better gaming year in 2017 \\^_\\^\n\nOh, and I also liked FFXV, but since you already listed it I figured it didn't need to be on the list.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn, that sucks.

Just wow!\n\nThis post is a sight to behold of your incredibly vast experience in video games. Really, thank you for posting this. \n\nI'd like to share my own thoughts on games you've played\n\n* Galaga : I had one of the clones that came in-built in the TV. Had a blast (and surprisingly my parents liked it too)\n\n* Bomberman (NES) : I was actually a little terrified by this game. The fact that you could die by our own mistakes.\n\n* King's Quest : Played the very original in 2013 (via the free browser version). Felt quite weird but interesting. I heard great things about the fan remake (not the official one)\n\n* Ultima IV : I tried playing it (original as well as with the fan patch). I couldn't get into it, but I really appreciate what it brought to the table. [This video helped me with that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPQ5rLzP8Qo)   \nI've read debates that Ultima V onward, Avatar was being shoehorned into scenario where he did un-Avatar like things, and that instead should have gone with another protagonist.\n\n* R-Type : Tried the SNES version (R-Type III). It was super hard, man!\n\n* Ghouls'n Ghosts : Played the SNES one. Hard AF boi! I mean, I've played a good share of action platformers, but this was the first time I was having difficult finishing the first level.\nAlso, give Maldita Castilla a try. (There is a free and paid version).\n\n* Mario 3 : I'm torn between Mario 3 and Super Mario World as to the best Mario game, though personally like World much more.\n\n* Battle Chess : Came bundled with our first PC. I had just learnt the chess rules, so I had a blast playing it. I still laugh at the encounter animation, esp. between King and Queen.\n\n* Prince of Persia : This to came bundled (and also there was another PoP game too). This game made me very terrified of falling in games. Those deaths from spikes...\n\n* Monkey Island 1 + 2 : Played the remakes in 2014, and they are easily one of my favorite Point n Click adventure games for me.\n\n* Padorius : Never played Gradius, and I love \"WTF Japan?!\" stuff, so I give it a try. They weren't lying when they said Konami used to make some of the hardest games in the 90s.\n\n* Another World : I'm a bit conflicted by this game, but that's mostly down to the circumstances. I tried this game when I wasn't in the mood to play any platformers. I didn't enjoy playing it, but what did impressed me where the graphics and the animations.   \nI watched a Let's Play on YouTube. :/\n\n* Decent : I've not played this game, but one I really want to try. In fact I want try try the whole flight sim genre (including the Star Wars games). I can't though, since I can't find any joysticks in the place I live in.\n\n* Caeser II : I've not play this too, but I've heard Caesar III (and even IV) are much better. I've played III and it's very appealing and fun to play.\n\n* Tomb Raider : I'm one of those who has been raised on old school TR, and I definitely agree that Anniversary is the best version to play. That said TR4 is the best game to play when it comes to old school TRs.\n\n* Myth : Oh boy, I remember me and my friend playing the demo. The \"grenades\" blasted the enemies into pieces and it was a glorious sight.\n\n* Quake II : While I agree it's a much better shooter than the original, I loved the Cthulu-esque atmosphere  of the original.\n\n* Claw : Ahh... haven't heard that name in a long time. There was a rumor among my friends that this game was based off a very famous cartoon. Ahh... those were the days.\n\n* Moto Racer : My first PC video game. I was in awe when I first saw a computer, and even more shocked when I learnt that you could play games on them (always thought consoles did that purpose). The sense of speed is still amazing, and the Motocross stages are surprisingly good.\n\n* Final Fantasy VII : As a FF fan, I highly recommend you play FF VI as well. \n\n* Interstate 76 : Played it a few months back. I'm surprised how much playable it is still today (even though it can feel dated at times). Incredible sense of charm, nice controls, and the \"poem\" button.\n\n* Carmageddon : I really liked it back when I played it on my friend's PC. I just played it recently, but don't found it that interesting, and was a little frustrated.\n\n* Commandos : \"Save Scumming\" : The Video Game. Also, the stand alone sequel (Beyond Call of Duty), is one of the hardest isometric game ever.\n\n* Wizardry 8 : I haven't played it, but a lot of Wizardry likes exists (esp. ones made in Japan). However, those are more inspired from Wiz 1-5, rather than 6-8.\n\n* Serious Sam 2 : Good game, but Serious Same Second Encounter feels like a much better game.\n\n* 2006 : You said 2006 would have been an empty year? Have you played Okami?\n\n* Tomb Raider 2013 : I.. disagree. As an old school TR fan, I was not happy with this game. As an action adventure fan, I liked it, it was quite good at places, but it wasn't really memorable. \n\n* Witcher 3 : Please don't take me as a fanboy as I'm still trying to grasp the game, but I'd like to say that while side quest are quite run-of-the-mill mechanically, the stories attached to them are what makes them great.   \nAnd I also agree, the game as *too* many things in it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!

Really, thank you for posting this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to share my own thoughts on games you&amp;#39;ve played&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galaga : I had one of the clones that came in-built in the TV. Had a blast (and surprisingly my parents liked it too)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bomberman (NES) : I was actually a little terrified by this game. The fact that you could die by our own mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;King&amp;#39;s Quest : Played the very original in 2013 (via the free browser version). Felt quite weird but interesting. I heard great things about the fan remake (not the official one)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultima IV : I tried playing it (original as well as with the fan patch). I couldn&amp;#39;t get into it, but I really appreciate what it brought to the table. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPQ5rLzP8Qo\"&gt;This video helped me with that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve read debates that Ultima V onward, Avatar was being shoehorned into scenario where he did un-Avatar like things, and that instead should have gone with another protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;R-Type : Tried the SNES version (R-Type III). It was super hard, man!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghouls&amp;#39;n Ghosts : Played the SNES one. Hard AF boi! I mean, I&amp;#39;ve played a good share of action platformers, but this was the first time I was having difficult finishing the first level.\nAlso, give Maldita Castilla a try. (There is a free and paid version).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mario 3 : I&amp;#39;m torn between Mario 3 and Super Mario World as to the best Mario game, though personally like World much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battle Chess : Came bundled with our first PC. I had just learnt the chess rules, so I had a blast playing it. I still laugh at the encounter animation, esp. between King and Queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince of Persia : This to came bundled (and also there was another PoP game too). This game made me very terrified of falling in games. Those deaths from spikes...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkey Island 1 + 2 : Played the remakes in 2014, and they are easily one of my favorite Point n Click adventure games for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Padorius : Never played Gradius, and I love &amp;quot;WTF Japan?!&amp;quot; stuff, so I give it a try. They weren&amp;#39;t lying when they said Konami used to make some of the hardest games in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another World : I&amp;#39;m a bit conflicted by this game, but that&amp;#39;s mostly down to the circumstances. I tried this game when I wasn&amp;#39;t in the mood to play any platformers. I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy playing it, but what did impressed me where the graphics and the animations.&lt;br/&gt;\nI watched a Let&amp;#39;s Play on YouTube. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decent : I&amp;#39;ve not played this game, but one I really want to try. In fact I want try try the whole flight sim genre (including the Star Wars games). I can&amp;#39;t though, since I can&amp;#39;t find any joysticks in the place I live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caeser II : I&amp;#39;ve not play this too, but I&amp;#39;ve heard Caesar III (and even IV) are much better. I&amp;#39;ve played III and it&amp;#39;s very appealing and fun to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomb Raider : I&amp;#39;m one of those who has been raised on old school TR, and I definitely agree that Anniversary is the best version to play. That said TR4 is the best game to play when it comes to old school TRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myth : Oh boy, I remember me and my friend playing the demo. The &amp;quot;grenades&amp;quot; blasted the enemies into pieces and it was a glorious sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quake II : While I agree it&amp;#39;s a much better shooter than the original, I loved the Cthulu-esque atmosphere  of the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claw : Ahh... haven&amp;#39;t heard that name in a long time. There was a rumor among my friends that this game was based off a very famous cartoon. Ahh... those were the days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moto Racer : My first PC video game. I was in awe when I first saw a computer, and even more shocked when I learnt that you could play games on them (always thought consoles did that purpose). The sense of speed is still amazing, and the Motocross stages are surprisingly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy VII : As a FF fan, I highly recommend you play FF VI as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interstate 76 : Played it a few months back. I&amp;#39;m surprised how much playable it is still today (even though it can feel dated at times). Incredible sense of charm, nice controls, and the &amp;quot;poem&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmageddon : I really liked it back when I played it on my friend&amp;#39;s PC. I just played it recently, but don&amp;#39;t found it that interesting, and was a little frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commandos : &amp;quot;Save Scumming&amp;quot; : The Video Game. Also, the stand alone sequel (Beyond Call of Duty), is one of the hardest isometric game ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wizardry 8 : I haven&amp;#39;t played it, but a lot of Wizardry likes exists (esp. ones made in Japan). However, those are more inspired from Wiz 1-5, rather than 6-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious Sam 2 : Good game, but Serious Same Second Encounter feels like a much better game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2006 : You said 2006 would have been an empty year? Have you played Okami?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomb Raider 2013 : I.. disagree. As an old school TR fan, I was not happy with this game. As an action adventure fan, I liked it, it was quite good at places, but it wasn&amp;#39;t really memorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witcher 3 : Please don&amp;#39;t take me as a fanboy as I&amp;#39;m still trying to grasp the game, but I&amp;#39;d like to say that while side quest are quite run-of-the-mill mechanically, the stories attached to them are what makes them great.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd I also agree, the game as &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many things in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg7n550", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123609.0, "created_utc": 1492094809.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653xkj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7nefv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LardPhantom", "parent_id": "t3_653xkj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This list is amazing!
