More often than not you&amp;#39;re placed against 4 or 5 much stronger enemies, placing you in situations more than unfair (which is something that the series always was against). In my opinion, the graphic enhancement doesn&amp;#39;t pay off for the change on the gameplay. And since both are on 60 fps on PC, I don&amp;#39;t see why get the SOTFS (unless you&amp;#39;re planning to coop a lot, since the base version is pretty much dead at this point).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg451wc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491939570.0, "created_utc": 1491910770.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64po4p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4owll", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thank_You_Love_You", "parent_id": "t3_64po4p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dark souls 2 is probably the worst of the franchise without SOTFS, for me SOTFS makes the game amazing.
