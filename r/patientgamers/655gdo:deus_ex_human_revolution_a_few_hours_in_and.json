At least, I didn&amp;#39;t think I did. I know the original Deus Ex is very well-regarded, and I have been catching up on PS3 games for the past year/year and a half... so I picked this game up for &amp;lt;$3 at Gamestop. It&amp;#39;s great to be catching up on PS3 games so many years later because you can literally get an amazing, immersive game for a few dollars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m really surprised that I like this game so much. I usually don&amp;#39;t like stealth gameplay, and I&amp;#39;m not super into RPG&amp;#39;s- having to talk to a bunch of people and do quests and stuff... it was never really my thing, but I guess I just never found the game that &amp;quot;did it&amp;quot; for me. This game is so deep and immersive, and I&amp;#39;ve only just gotten to Hengsha for the first time after beating Barrett. Already I can tell that I&amp;#39;m going to want to keep playing and exploring everything. It&amp;#39;s not tedious to look around and try and hack every lock or safe that I can. It&amp;#39;s fun to go around and talk to people and complete side quests. Honestly, this game really makes me feel as if I am &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;. Like I really am taking on the character of Adam Jensen, and I feel like I&amp;#39;m actually in the world that the game presents. This is tough for me, as it&amp;#39;s usually hard for me to suspend disbelief and get really immersed in a game environment. But the world is so atmospheric and detailed and complex that I can&amp;#39;t help but fall into it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought that I was going to go through this game as a FPS and just go all out combat. I knew it wasn&amp;#39;t really geared toward that kind of playing, but I was like eh, whatever, I&amp;#39;m going to play it like that because I&amp;#39;m not good at stealth, and since it&amp;#39;s got guns and the ability to kill people I&amp;#39;ll just play it like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very quickly I realized that I would have to do things differently and use my head to be successful in this game. I also very quickly realized that it was FUN to utilize different methods of achieving goals and progressing. I was still using my guns and killing people, but I started to see that utilizing a variety of methods to do things was really cool. I started to like hacking more and saw it&amp;#39;s merit. I completed a part of a mission and got the Smooth Operator and Ghost rewards for not alerting anyone- and it was really fun and really cool to be stealthy like that! I have never enjoyed stealth until I nabbed those XP... and now I have been enjoying stealth a lot more in this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very quickly I realized- I&amp;#39;m not going to be playing this just as an action FPS game- I&amp;#39;m going to utilize different methods and skills. I even got the Social Enhancer aug early on because I see the merit in manipulating the dialogue. I think what makes this game so much fun is that there are SO many options to do things, and your choices affect the game and what goes on. If one thing doesn&amp;#39;t work, I can try another, and if all else fails, I can just kill everyone, haha. But instead of my original thoughts of just upgrading everything combat wise and playing this like a typical FPS, disregarding all the other cool stuff, I find myself upgrading other skills that allow me to do things without violence. I guess I became so used to FPS games being so straightforward that I didn&amp;#39;t realize how different and unique they can be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share my thoughts on this awesome game and see if I could spark discussion. I also wanted to ask- what have I been missing?? What other games are similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution? Are there any games similar to this, in terms of immersion and depth? I still need some action and combat, so I don&amp;#39;t really like full-on RPG&amp;#39;s... but this game really has changed my taste I think, and I am looking for more interesting experiences that are similar to this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Usually, I don't like this kind of game.
