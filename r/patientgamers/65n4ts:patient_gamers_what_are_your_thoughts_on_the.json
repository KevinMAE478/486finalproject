Because the writing of your side characters is my favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like others have said, half the open world quests suck.  So just use your head, and if someone wants you to gather 8 blankets then skip that quest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also played as a mage, and the fighting animations for the mage looks great, it blew me away their take on how a mage would fight, they don&amp;#39;t just wave their hands but spin around and do flips and it all looks great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, I thought Inquisition has the best &amp;#39;base building&amp;#39; mechanics I have played in any RPG.  And the various environments you visit are all so good looking, and all have unique plant and animal life! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, I think the Trespasser DLC adds a lot of cool stuff to the main story, so try to pick up that as well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dgczez7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492425346.0, "created_utc": 1492396546.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n4ts", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0tep", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LoxonStag", "parent_id": "t3_65n4ts", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Origins is a lot of fun.
