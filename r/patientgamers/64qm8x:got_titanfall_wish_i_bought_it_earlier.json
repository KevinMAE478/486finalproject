Would've actually bought the game if it didn't have titans to split that tiny player base but oh well.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played Tfall 2 during their free weekend and liked quite a bit except I only liked the titanless modes, in fact I hated the modes with titans. I like fast paced skill-intensive gameplay not that farm for a titan then roll over everyone who doesn&amp;#39;t have one, didn&amp;#39;t even spawn my titan when I got one I liked running around on walls killing people more. Seems like it&amp;#39;s designed to make worse players feel better about themselves because they can kill players better than them sometimes, or how to make a popular multiplayer game, gotta make people of all skill levels feel like they can compete (see overwatch, or why quake isn&amp;#39;t popular)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I was doubtful about the player count since I was only looking for titanless modes which is like 2/10 modes and it once put me in a US server when Im from EU probably because it couldn&amp;#39;t find a better game.
