It was hard to find a new game of that genre that I wanted to play due to the lacking review scores. I went for the most critically acclaimed of the bunch, Etrian Oddysey, and did not like it at all. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the other hand had a lower Metascore than Etrian Oddysey (84 vs 79) and is a game that I LOVED.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in short, if you want to learn about &amp;quot;underrated&amp;quot; games you gotta first understand what your niche is, which type of games you enjoy so much that you can look past it flaws and still love it. Once you know that you can use filters to find all the games in your favorite genres and, well, read reviews or play demos to decide if the flaws of the game are a dealbreaker to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg5sidj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028972.0, "created_utc": 1492000172.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v9ab", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5qlxr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bash7", "parent_id": "t3_64v9ab", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What struck me on steam, was that the **Two Worlds** series was received very bad.  \nI played those games in my childhood and loved them back then - they were buggy as hell (think Gothik III) but solid RPGs with cool loot.  \nThe world is really great imo and also rather big.  \nI remember in 2 that there are tons of books where you can spend hours reading in-game if that is your thing :D", "edited": 1491996838.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What struck me on steam, was that the &lt;strong&gt;Two Worlds&lt;/strong&gt; series was received very bad.&lt;br/&gt;\nI played those games in my childhood and loved them back then - they were buggy as hell (think Gothik III) but solid RPGs with cool loot.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe world is really great imo and also rather big.&lt;br/&gt;\nI remember in 2 that there are tons of books where you can spend hours reading in-game if that is your thing :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "name": "t1_dg5qlxr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492025107.0, "created_utc": 1491996307.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v9ab", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v9ab", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v9ab", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg78df1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "meanspirit", "parent_id": "t1_dg6nqqy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/patientgamers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For sure.

I picked it up in a bargain bin somewhere, back when physical PC games were still a thing. \n\nIt really didn't do anything wildly different than other FPS games, but I enjoyed the heck out of it. For its time, I thought it looked incredible. The effect when you shot bullets through glass was really well done, the shooting mechanics felt pretty tight, and the single player campaign is actually really long (to some this is good and others it's a detriment). \n\nI used to play when the multiplayer was active, and it was a great time! They also released a level editor which allowed for some scripting, and I remember making some fun custom maps. \n\nThe not-so-good parts: the voice acting and writing leaves something to be desired. It feels awkward at times from translation, and the delivery of lines can be pretty bad. For me this is a plus though, as I enjoy the \"so bad it's good\" type of stuff. Many people complain that the enemies are way too accurate and rely totally on hitscan and will unfairly wait around corners, causing many unfair deaths. It's somewhat true, so don't feel bad playing on a lower difficulty! \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if about 90% of players who played the game completely abandoned it at the stealth level that they make you play early on. It's an incredible pain, where one mistake causes you to die and retry. It's atrocious but as far as I'm aware it's the only level like this.\n\nAll in all, I actually remember the game very fondly. It's sitting at a 66% critic score and 7.2 user score on metacritic.

I picked it up in a bargain bin somewhere, back when physical PC games were still a thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really didn&amp;#39;t do anything wildly different than other FPS games, but I enjoyed the heck out of it. For its time, I thought it looked incredible. The effect when you shot bullets through glass was really well done, the shooting mechanics felt pretty tight, and the single player campaign is actually really long (to some this is good and others it&amp;#39;s a detriment). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to play when the multiplayer was active, and it was a great time! They also released a level editor which allowed for some scripting, and I remember making some fun custom maps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The not-so-good parts: the voice acting and writing leaves something to be desired. It feels awkward at times from translation, and the delivery of lines can be pretty bad. For me this is a plus though, as I enjoy the &amp;quot;so bad it&amp;#39;s good&amp;quot; type of stuff. Many people complain that the enemies are way too accurate and rely totally on hitscan and will unfairly wait around corners, causing many unfair deaths. It&amp;#39;s somewhat true, so don&amp;#39;t feel bad playing on a lower difficulty! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if about 90% of players who played the game completely abandoned it at the stealth level that they make you play early on.
