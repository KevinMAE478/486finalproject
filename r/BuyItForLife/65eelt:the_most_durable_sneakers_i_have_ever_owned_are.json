Not a shill and very aware of the bad things about Nike/Jordan as a company, yet wanted to share my experience. I bought the old pair at least 6 years ago! Though I did not wear them daily, I wore them a lot and put them through more abuse than vast majority of people do. I always wear these when I go skateboarding, to intense moshpits and often when working professionally in a bike workshop. The old ones have barely! worn in the sole, no discernible damage anywhere, are still totally usable and do not smell. They cost me 50. The new ones are very similar but slightly! higher model that is almost all leather (fairly high grade leather, top grain I think) and cost 75. What I love about these shoes other than extreme durability is that you can use them for almost anything, they are almost as protective as some boots (in terms of weather and protecting ankle/feet) but with less weight and more flexibility. For the record they both look better in person, I used flash, which made the old look much more dirty/old and the new ones more shiny. Anyone else have stellar experience with any sneakers? For me it is all about a durable sole that is stitched throughout, top grain leather etc. Puma, Adidas and more offer similar choices.
