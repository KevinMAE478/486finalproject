Well... first, if you pay almost triple, I&amp;#39;d hope it&amp;#39;d be better, and second - the MacBook would only be a replacement for the Compaq if you had no specific software requirements. At the time, a lot of software that would run on the Compaq would not run on the MacBook - did Consumer Reports point any of this out? No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the main ding on Speed Queen is lack of cycles and they use more water. This could be bad - but most people who come and say they want a long lasting washer also aren&amp;#39;t interested in the latest 300th cycle. They might however be interested in water use. I&amp;#39;m not, and got the Digital Washer / Dryer top loader. I have a well, and don&amp;#39;t pay for water really, and live where we tend to have a LOT of water / rain, so it&amp;#39;s not a huge problem for me to use 100 gallons to do a load of laundry. It could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to the &amp;quot;lot of money&amp;quot; - the Speed Queen prices for top loaders were similar to other top loaders I was looking at. The Front Loaders though - those are pricy. That said, if you can find a showroom, go compare the SQ to say the Kenmore, Samsung, or Maytag - they just feel more substantial all the way around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will that mean it lasts longer? IDK I only have had mine for 2 years, but I can say the things that felt flimsy the day I bought them on average last noticeably less time than the things that felt solid. I do think the SQ will have more maintenance though - the belt tends to need to be replaced every 5 years I&amp;#39;ve heard, whereas the direct drives work till they don&amp;#39;t, but that might be 3 years or 15 years according to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "BuyItForLife", "name": "t1_dg92pu5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492202234.0, "created_utc": 1492173434.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg86eyp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shubniggurat", "parent_id": "t1_dg82n0k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BuyItForLife", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's a toss-up; when you pay a lot of money for something, there's a strong psychological incentive to be satisfied with your purchase.
