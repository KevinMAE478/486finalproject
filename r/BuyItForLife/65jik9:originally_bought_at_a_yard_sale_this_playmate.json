My brother, a few years older than me, started getting harassed by a kid a couple years older than him. I mean, I think he was harassing him. I'm pretty sure he was, though I suppose there is a small chance it was just a rougher kind of play a kid of 5 or 6 couldn't really understand. It's a little hazy, and it's not really that important. \n\nPoint is, I said, \"Hey! Leave my brother alone!\" and tried to grab the older kid's arm. He shoved me away. \n\nIt just so happened that my Playmate Igloo cooler was in hand. I was told later the older kid had a green belt in karate or something. Maybe he did, but I'm guessing they never taught him what to do when a 5 year old kid swings a hard plastic cooler at your dome. (Protip: Duck.)\n\nLong story short, I ended up at a public school for 1st grade, some green belt got stitches, and my older brother continues to insist that I \"saved\" him from a friend that was rough-housing with him. \n\nPoint is, the Playmate Igloo cooler is a damn fine lunch carrying contraption, in every way superior to a brown paper bag or soft plastic substitute you might be forced to carry after it's decided that the Igloo isn't \"safe\" anymore.
