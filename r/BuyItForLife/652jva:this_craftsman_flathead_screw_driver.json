If I have a phillips screw, then I use a phillips screwdriver; a torx screw uses a torx driver; a square/Robertson screw requires a square driver... but what if I have a flathead screw?  What screwdriver handles that?  In truth, you have no way of knowing based just on that description because that flathead screw could have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the drive types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end it&amp;#39;s all pedantry.
