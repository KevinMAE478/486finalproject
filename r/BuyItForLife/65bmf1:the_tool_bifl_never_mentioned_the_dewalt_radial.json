These saws are built to last, readily available (used of course) and very cheap ($50-$100). Some background for the radial arm saw, Mr. DeWalt, the man whose name is still on the very popular DeWalt power tool line, was actually the inventor of the radial arm saw, and he sold his company to American Machinery and Foundry in 1949. After that, he had no involvement in tools at all, but the DeWalt was so well made and had such a great reputation no one wanted to get rid of the name, and of course it is still being used today. Black and Decker acquired DeWalt in 1960 and still kept DeWalt\u2019s name on the saw for many years. There is even a company today still making radial arm saws with the original DeWalt molds, they\u2019re called The Original Saw Company and their 12\u201d radial arm saws start at $4000+. My local Home Depot actually has one. That is how expensive these saws are to produce, in an operation today a 12\u201d saw costs that much to manufacture. [Original Saw Company RAS](http://i.imgur.com/JJVro6J.jpg)  \nNow, many of you may be thinking, \u201care these saws even that useful today, and aren\u2019t they too dangerous to use?\u201d Well the truth is, in the 70s and 80s a ton of radial arm saws were produced by companies that were trying to compete to have the lowest prices (Craftsman). This led to most people having used a Craftsman radial arm saw which does not have a solid cast arm and usually an underpowered motor which gave the RAS a terrible reputation. Also, the RAS has a very high potential for being an unsafe saw. What I mean by that is, if used improperly it can be very dangerous. For example, there is only one end of the saw you want to feed lumber through while ripping. The side you feed it through depends on if you have the motor in the out or in rip position. And unfortunately, the way you feed the lumber to rip correctly is not what conventional wisdom would say, which means there\u2019s a lot of people out there who have used a RAS incorrectly and just deemed it too dangerous.  \nIf used properly, with the correct guards, I feel the RAS is safer than a table saw. Speaking of table saws, there is a large community of guys out there who feel that a RAS can replace a table saw in a small shop. That and a track saw or a decent circular saw for ripping sheets to width. But, you need a solid arm DeWalt. There are some great models by Delta and even a couple from Craftsman, but it\u2019s much harder to track them down. I don\u2019t have a ton of experience with these saws, so I have stuck to DeWalt. \nOne way to tell if a DeWalt is a solid arm, is to look for the round arm like I included in the title. That is the easiest way, but, there are some DeWalts with a square arm that are also solid well-built machines. I have 2 of them.\nMy first saw, I acquired for $60. It's a mint condition DeWalt 925 with everything. I purchased it from the original owner. The saw was sold in 1959 and when you adjust for inflation, the saw cost $2000. The 925 was also the smallest saw that DeWalt produced, and the cheapest. [Dewalt 925](http://i.imgur.com/96YWGkf.jpg)\nMy second saw, I purchased for $75, it is also a square arm but has a much more powerful motor and a larger cross cut capacity. The 925 has an 11 amp motor and this [7790](http://i.imgur.com/gZGVtrO.jpg) has a 17 amp motor. The 925 will swing a 9\u201d blade, but is best left with an 8\u201d. The 7790 will swing a 12\u201d blade bus is best used with a 10\u201d. \nThe biggest advantage of the RAS for a homeowner who wants to do some woodworking, is that It can be laid flat against a wall and unlike a table saw, does not need to be in the middle of your workshop. Because you turn the motor to rip, you only need 3 sides of the saw open. In my circumstance, when I get my 7790 going, I will be able to set both saws next to each other, use the 7790 for ripping and the 925 for crosscutting.
