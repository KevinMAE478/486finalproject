I had recently lost my job, like most people at the time, and was having to do odd jobs on craigslist just to get by. I recruited a friend to help me do the various odd jobs since he was in a similar situation. We pooled our resources and cobbled together enough equipment to do landscaping work (along with other odd jobs that you&amp;#39;d hire manual labor for). We were both young, like early twenties, and didn&amp;#39;t really know when we were getting scammed or fooled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got a call on one of our ads to go do some landscaping work for a guy who happened to live about a mile away. Awesome! We won&amp;#39;t have to spend much on gas, but we will have to sacrifice our Labor Day weekend to do the job since it was a large job. The guy asked us to put in a raised bed that essentially wrapped around his entire house. Imagine a house in a newly built subdivision that has a smallish yard and few trees. He wanted the bed to be built with landscaping bricks and wanted us to copy a style that his neighbor had done. Cool, no problem. We try to discuss payment, but he keeps giving us the runaround. Because we were in a desperate situation, we get fooled into doing the work with no agreed upon labor fee (this was our mistake, one that was never made again). We were just happy to have some work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent two full days working our asses off in the middle of summer not really knowing what we were getting paid. We were using our tools, truck, and time, grinding away, but we kept wondering why this guy was acting so shady. Finally, on day three, near the end of the day, I&amp;#39;m fed up with the runaround and knock on the door and confront the guy about payment. He starts getting all aggressive and starts threatening us with non-payment, which immediately escalates the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grab my friend and bring him into the argument. After about 30 minutes of arguing, the guy decides he will pay us $70 for the work. Ya, 70 fucking bucks to split between us after 3 days of labor. Cool, fuck us right? We loaded up our truck with the tools, then wait for the guy to come out with our cash. This asshole comes out with a huge wad of cash, but proceeds to still only hand over $70. Cunt. We collect our money and grab our last item, a tarp. We had been using a really large tarp to put weeds, grass, and extra dirt on to make our lives easier since we didn&amp;#39;t have a wheelbarrow at the time. The accumulated mound on this thing had to have been 4 feet high. We drag it into the middle of his front yard and dump the tarp. This is the first fuck you.
