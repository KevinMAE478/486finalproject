In Minnesota having a parking space close to an entrance, especially in winter, is highly desirable. At this location I had really lucked out! There was a small parking space close to the door that only a compact car could fit, if situated just right. Meaning, as long as I hugged the curb on the driver side there would be proper space between my passenger door and the next vehicle&amp;#39;s driver door. Everyday that I came to work, no matter how early or late, that space was available. I was truly enjoying one of those perks that life gives you every once-in-awhile.\nOne day I pull into the office parking lot - to my surprise and anger, a thoughtless person parked their car just over the &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; into my beloved space! Knowing that this could become a habitual act by this person, I decided to teach them a lesson in courtesy &amp;amp; shoehorned the car into &amp;quot;my&amp;quot; parking space so that they would have to enter from the passenger seat, haha. My car was nothing special so as long as they weren&amp;#39;t mad enough to break any glass I was not concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My company used the entire 4th floor and exiting the elevator led directly to the receptionist area.  My cubicle was relatively close to there and around noon I could hear an agitated voice speaking loudly. Moments later my phone rang and was told someone is asking for me in the reception area. Knowing full well why the person wanted to see me, I asked a colleague to accompany me.  As I approach the area she correctly assumed I was the horrible man that so rudely parked her &amp;quot;in&amp;quot; by proceeding to raise her voice even louder telling me &amp;quot;That was not a parking space!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I could have you to towed&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;What a horrible thing to do&amp;quot; etc.. Well this was extremely embarrassing for me as it was an open air office and normally quiet but now disturbed by an obnoxious woman telling what a jerk I am. To get her out of there, I immediately said I would move my car and quickly proceeded to the elevator along with my colleague. The ride down the elevator, through the atrium and into the parking lot this woman would not shut up. It was so over-the-top that I couldn&amp;#39;t take it any longer. I stopped 20 feet prior to reaching my car and said &amp;quot;You can climb over your seat&amp;quot; and walked back into the office building with her next to me shouting how she was going to have my car towed. As we enter the atrium she heads for the property management office, even though I knew I was parked legally I followed her to ensure I could move my car before any tow truck arrives. I enter the management office 10 seconds after her and hear them tell her I was perfectly in my right to park there and nobody was going to get towed. Angrily she turns, sees me, and storms out threatening to call the Cops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole time I was really curious as to how this woman knew that I owned the car and worked on the 4th floor? On my way out, I ask the management people if they somehow keep track of the vehicle owners by company. They responded negative and said they only know names of employees for each company and that is all they provided her. I could tell they didn&amp;#39;t like being duped into giving out my whereabouts which led to her badgering me and everyone else, so I felt confident letting this play itself out as I returned to my desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understand this woman was not crazy, she came across authoritatively of being in total control of the situation and not afraid to use every means possible. She was used to getting her way and was not going to stop until she did - so she called the cops. In the mean time my colleague was running around the office filling people in on what is going on. It just so happens that I can see the car clearly from my cubicle window as I, along with 10 others, watch as a cop car pulls up. Knowing full well she was convincing the police what an inconsiderate jerk that parked there, I expected a call any minute. Sure enough there was an impatient male voice on the other end of the phone &amp;quot;telling&amp;quot; me to move my car...immediately! Although I knew I could refuse since it was a private parking lot and city police needed permission I wasn&amp;#39;t willing to pursue this any further. She won and knew it! In fact, she had her chin up with a sly grin on her face as I had to walk past her to move my car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the title you know it doesn&amp;#39;t end there - absolutely not! You remember how I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how she was able to match the car to my name?? Well, after I left the management office they decided to look into it themselves and come to find out she works for an insurance company that sells...car insurance! Employees would have access to the DMV database and it is illegal to use government motor vehicle information for personal reasons. So the property management company contacts her employer to complain about unauthorized use of DMV data for abuse against an office attendant...me. They, in turn, fire her that afternoon! People in my office couldn&amp;#39;t wait to tell me they saw her carrying out her boxes with tears streaming down her cheeks. I was even asked the next day to provide a statement on behalf of her former employer in case she tried to sue for firing her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This woman was willing to do anything, even break the law, to get her way. I wish I could say she learned her lesson but I highly doubt it...lying and breaking the law was a natural response for her. At least I experienced sweet revenge in the form of justice - those times are rare!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Still getting the &amp;quot;coward&amp;quot; response from those that believe you always fight fire with fire. For them, a quote by Napoleon &amp;quot;Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.&amp;quot;  IF I would have told her off in the Property mgmt office, good chance all they would have cared about is getting the both of us out of there. My lack of being drawn into a heated argument isolated her as belligerent, unstable which motivated the property folks to pursue the DMV issue. Granted, my strategy was to play the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; guy to get information to pursue the DMV issue as I did not expect them to do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thought regarding the &amp;quot;coward&amp;quot; thinkers. I read reddit mainly for entertainment, but closely behind is to learn. Fortunately most redditors are funny, witty, and knowledgeable which makes reddit the go-to place for many of us. Myself, like many, find areas that we can contribute thru stories, comments etc.. in other words bring something to the table rather than just take. Others use it to be cantankerous just for the sake making themselves sound superior and/or tough. Before the internet (yes, I am old) the dredges of society had no platform to express their surly personality with others. Work (even at home) they were rightfully isolated and unable to have someone listen more than 5 seconds to their blabber - now they troll the internet like gangs in a neighborhood. We all know what happens when neighborhoods get taken over and become more dangerous...people leave. Myself, I have thick skin thanks to 3 older brothers, so I only respond to trolls in hopes they will change...I know, I know wishful thinking.  I worry that others in my same camp will just say the hell with this!
