My family owned a very prestigious and well known restaurant that had been in business for over 40 years. It was ran by my mother, my father passed away leaving her to run the restaurant and raise me. She was successful at running it and did so for about 18 years and I stepped in to help run it as I got older. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The restaurant was located in this boutique style plaza building with designer shops etc. At one point my mom owned this building with partners, but we eventually sold it to new owners who then became our landlords. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After operating successfully for all those years, times got tough, money became very tight and the area didn&amp;#39;t have a place for our restaurant anymore. So we had to close it down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our savings were very low from all the money we put in to keep the place alive, we owed people money, and we had loans against our home for the place after we fell on hard times. After closing we were trying to sell and liquidate whatever we could to make ends meet and payoff money owed. It was hard, and my mom was stressed beyond belief. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A smaller restaurant we would to go to on occasion was located across town. We were a French restaurant, this one was Italian. Both of our places were upscale so we sort of befriended the owner. He was pretty arrogant and big headed so we&amp;#39;ll call him BH. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once BH learned of us closing our restaurant, he approached us with an opportunity for us to revive our restaurant with a new concept that involved a partnership between the two of us and both of us working as chefs to be drive its success. He had an investor so we were interested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We show BH the entire restaurant and its million dollar renovations we&amp;#39;ve done, all the equipment and assets we have to run this business. It was a very good idea in the beginning. All we needed to do was have BH and his investor buy in for a very reasonable price, they didn&amp;#39;t even try to talk us down on the buy in. However it took quite a while for them to move forward, we waited until finally the landlord told us to get out immediately. No more time to wait for this opportunity or liquidate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little did we know this entire time BH was working with the landlords behind our backs to basically take the possession of the restaurant space and all of it&amp;#39;s assets to move his current restaurant across town into what used to be our restaurant... This amounted to millions of dollars in equipment, fixtures, furniture, and inventory that we desperately needed to liquidate to payoff the bank so we wouldn&amp;#39;t loose our home. The Landlords signed the new lease to BH and only charged him first months rent, no &amp;quot;key-fee&amp;quot; like most commercial rentals do when there&amp;#39;s equipment and assets already in the space. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now without that key-fee and BH having possession of the restaurant. The landlord decides to try and regain that money by trying to sue my mother for the remainder of the lease, since we broke the lease. The landlord inflated the rent amount to about $2,000 higher than we were actually paying and we basically owned them $220,000 in rent for the remainder of the lease even though we were no longer tenants of the restaurant space. My mom was in absolute tears when she got the letter, but nothing ever happened from that because she filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Revenge&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For about 5 years after this all happened, I stepped away from the restaurant business for a little bit and became very successful from getting into various trades with the internet and automotive industry. I won&amp;#39;t go into detail about how I became successful, but some people showed me the ropes to these trades, I ended up getting creative with them forming niches and learned how to market it. This resulted in me reviving my former restaurant in a new city and open a couple of successful bars/clubs (good ones, not dirty clubs) that I tend to sell after sometime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this time I kept my eye on BH&amp;#39;s restaurant. It was always dead, and I was always heard from former employees about the labor laws he was violating with taking ALL his waiters&amp;#39; tips and pulling shady tricks to screw over his employees out of pure greed. While he acts like he&amp;#39;s the world&amp;#39;s best chef and restauranteur he would even trying to talk down on me when I&amp;#39;d run into him. He was constant liar, he claimed he brought fine dining to the area, when we our restaurant was actually known by word of mouth that we we&amp;#39;re the original fine dining restaurant of the area. (To this day people say how much they miss it, but I always encourage them to visit the new one.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now, A lot of the shops in the plaza of where the restaurant is located have closed and the building is pretty vacant. Only BH&amp;#39;s restaurant and about 4 or 5 other stores remained. The building goes up for sale by, you guessed it, the landlords who screwed me and my mother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For sometime I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to open a nice modern, mid-sized nightclub in the area of which our old restaurant was once located. The area needed one, demographic are right and everything. I was planning to acquire and revive an existing nightclub in the area but the plans fell through. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out this old building was the perfect location for the nightclub concept I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to open. I ended up purchasing the entire building from these shithead landlords for almost half of what my mother and her partners originally sold it for. Mother and partners sold it $1M even, I bought it myself for just over $600k. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a confrontation and awkward moment but they had no choice but to sell it to me. So the landlords took a big loss on their building. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After purchasing the building and finalizing everything, I had dinner at BH&amp;#39;s restaurant for the first time. Totally awful experience, BH refused to modify my order because &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;s done&amp;quot;, and kept me there for 4 hours with nobody else in the restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After paying my bill I served him with an eviction notice letting him know I was terminating the lease and demolishing the building to build my new nightclub. He was also reported to the department of labor and may not be able to move his restaurant somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Constant typos I keep finding.
