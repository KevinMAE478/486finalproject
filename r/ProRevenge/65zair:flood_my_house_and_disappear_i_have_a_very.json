[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "ProRevenge", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settle in for a story of naivete, betrayal, and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to get a new back patio. I&amp;#39;m a reasonably smart tech guy, but I don&amp;#39;t know anything about contractors. I decide to use a site, let&amp;#39;s call it $fixmyshit. $fixmyshit allows you to get multiple bids from different professionals on a job, they have reviews, pictures, the whole works. We get several bids submitted. We carefully look at each proposal, making sure it includes everything we need (new concrete patio, stamping, sealing, warranty, etc). We check to make sure they have lots of reviews and the average is high (mistake #1). We don&amp;#39;t go with the cheapest bid, we&amp;#39;re not looking to cheap out or get a fly-by-night operation, but it turns out crooks are just as happy to screw you over for $$ as they are for $.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hire $craptastic concrete to do our job. I pay 1/2 up front. Dude named $genericname shows up.They show up, tear out some concrete and call me to let me know that I need to pay for drains if I don&amp;#39;t want the house to flood. Technically this made sense to me, and I could see the need for drains. It would have been obvious to this guy when he gave us the bid, so I was annoyed at the bait-and-switch but whatever. We pick our stamp and colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pour the concrete, and it looks ok from far away. They put the color powder on it. They let me know that the job is done. As in &amp;quot;the concrete comes pre-sealed but if you want it to look really good we can &amp;#39;shine&amp;#39; it for an extra $500.00&amp;quot;. Those who understand concrete will laugh. Basically this guy wanted to walk away in the middle of the job and charge me extra to seal my concrete. I&amp;#39;m an idiot so I initially agreed, and I write them a check for the remainder, with the understanding they&amp;#39;ll come back and &amp;#39;shine&amp;#39; in a day or two after they&amp;#39;ve power washed it and let it dry. They are also supposed to do some yard cleanup then (to repair the damage their heavy machinery left).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;ve paid about 1.5x the original bid, and I haven&amp;#39;t looked at the work that closely because I don&amp;#39;t want to walk all over the color powder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They show up and spend literally 10m dumping some sealant on the patio. It&amp;#39;s a disaster, they don&amp;#39;t even come close to covering the patio. Now that I can walk on the  work, I can see how bad it is. Footprints in the concrete, corners that look like they were made by a 5 year old with mud. Just shoddy quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still playing Mr. nice guy, being a pushover. My wife and I aren&amp;#39;t sure what to do, you don&amp;#39;t really sue someone over kind of crappy work. We just figure hey we&amp;#39;ll have them put the final coat of seal on there, fix the spots they missed, fix the yard, and call it good. We&amp;#39;ll be able to enjoy our patio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the guy says he won&amp;#39;t put on the 2nd sealant coat unless we give him a good review, which we won&amp;#39;t promise to do. (Now I understand why this guy has mostly good reviews). He says he will come over, but won&amp;#39;t give us a date. He starts to get mad and yell at us that he&amp;#39;s not a crook. He insults my wife and from now on will only talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally stop being Mr. Nice guy. I text him some pictures of the shit work he&amp;#39;s done and tell him we have other people coming to do work and we need the patio done. He needs to get over and do what he&amp;#39;s agreed to do. Now he won&amp;#39;t respond to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point we&amp;#39;re ready to report him for fraud (lying about the sealant/&amp;#39;shine&amp;#39;), leave some bad reviews, and finish sealing ourselves. I&amp;#39;m still being more than reasonable. I just wanted the guy to finish his 1/2 assed work, take the money he over-charged me for, and go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day it rains, and at 5am I discover our basement is flooding. I&amp;#39;m not sure where to start. He won&amp;#39;t respond to me (even though he claimed he had a million dollar insurance policy). He won&amp;#39;t give me his contractor license info or insurance info. I&amp;#39;m getting the sinking feeling he doesn&amp;#39;t have either of those things. I start attempting to reach him via $fixmyshit, because they have a guarantee. I send him messages asking for a timeline and plan to fix the flooding. He doesn&amp;#39;t respond. I ask him for insurance info and contractors license info. Crickets. The guy has officially gone AWOL and I realize that I have about 4 pieces of info about this guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A first name&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A phone number&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A business name that seems to exist only on 2 websites. $fixmyshit and $localareafixmyshit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A different business name that I made the check out to, that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to exist anywhere. We&amp;#39;ll call it $sketchyco&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m feeling down. My house is flooding, my contractor has disappeared. I&amp;#39;m talking to lawyers and they are telling me that I don&amp;#39;t have the info to go after this guy and even if I get the info, odds of me collecting on a judgement are pretty low. I&amp;#39;m just going to have to hope $fixmyshit&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;property damage guarantee&amp;quot; helps. They have a minimum period in which you have to try and resolve your dispute before they will step in. I&amp;#39;m dutifully messaging this guy and laying a paper trail, but he&amp;#39;s not responding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, is when I go fullon internet creeper. I&amp;#39;m a tech guy. I know how to google. I know how to interweb &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well. I&amp;#39;m going to find this guy&amp;#39;s info so that I can take him to court if needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start with his phone number and running various reverse searches. Nothing really comes up other than his ad on $localareafixmyshit. There&amp;#39;s one false lead where a previous owner had a similar name to his fake name, but unless she somehow became a 300lb tongan man, that was a dead end. I find denied contractor licence applications in public records databases. Check for $fixmyshit business license info, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We must go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start chasing down leads. I cold call local concrete truck companies in hopes I can find a record of the pour. They actually have an account for phone number: Person: $genericname Company:$sketchyco. But they can&amp;#39;t give me any more info w/o clearing it with a higher up. I leave a message on one of their exec&amp;#39;s phones, and wait for a call back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$genericname mentioned he did the work for a neighborhood near me. I drive over there and start knocking on doors. People are actually amazingly nice. Nicer than I&amp;#39;d be if a bearded dude in a EFF hoodie showed up at my door. They direct me to the house of the owner of the development/neighborhood. Main developer isn&amp;#39;t home but a nice grandma and grandaughter invite me in. Grandma knows the guy they use for concrete, but his name isn&amp;#39;t $genericname. She wonders if maybe $genericname worked on his crew. Says she&amp;#39;ll have her husband call me if he knows anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m frustrated now, but I feel like this case is crackable. I keep chasing down leads. I wonder if maybe any of his work sample images can lead me to his website or contact info. I use tin eye, and find out he stole his work samples from a company halfway across the country. I call that company and verify that he stole the work. I find a random advertisement pdf sitting on a random server. Using whois and reverse searching the given domains pointing to that IP, I eventually figure out this is an add he placed in the newspaper and I contact them looking for info on this guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night I&amp;#39;m sitting in bed on my laptop doing google searches chasing things down, and I somehow stumble across $scetchyco&amp;#39;s facebook page. There&amp;#39;s no contact info there, but I find that there are a ton of people who appear to be in the industry who work for $scetchyco. I&amp;#39;m getting very close. Somehow a lightbulb goes off. I looked up $scetchyco contractor license info, but I hadn&amp;#39;t actually checked their business license!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look up their business license and it exists! There&amp;#39;s a bullshit name, and an address. I look up the property records for who owns the address. There&amp;#39;s about 20 people who have lived at that house, mostly with the same last name, with some overlap in the people I saw on facebook. I look for $genericname $lastname.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A mugshot pops up. Busted. I got you $realname. I click through and see his rap sheet. He&amp;#39;s been defrauding people for decades. Construction w/o a license, bids w/o a license, and the cherry(s) on top: assault, child abuse, and kidnapping. Yikes. Turns out kidnappers have to register on the same website sexual offenders register on. I see an updated pic and vehicle info. There&amp;#39;s no doubt in my mind who this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I have his real name and I can double down on the googling. Turns out he&amp;#39;s owned several construction businesses. Most of them have been blacklisted by my state&amp;#39;s consumer protection agency. One of those businesses has a AKA $craptastic concrete. The circle is complete! The dots are all connected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do I do now? Here comes the justice part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take all the research I&amp;#39;ve done, summarized up with references and diagrams, and I send it to $fixmyshit, letting them know they sent a kidnapper to my house who screwed up my yard and flooded my house. I suspect legally they aren&amp;#39;t liable for crap, but in the new &amp;quot;sharing/gig&amp;quot; economy, they&amp;#39;d rather people not know they are sending kidnappers to people&amp;#39;s homes. They end up maxing out $realname&amp;#39;s credit card and sending me the money and suspending his account. So now he&amp;#39;s off of one website and I have a decent chunk of my money back. They end up also paying for some of the damages out of their pocket. I now have most of my money back, but still have to pay for more concrete and yard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m feeling good now. Justice has been served for me. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I&amp;#39;d get any money back, so getting most of it back is great, but what about for everyone else he&amp;#39;s been screwing over?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call up $localareafixmyshit, his ad gets taken down there. So now I&amp;#39;ve at least removed him from the internet. I also report him to the right licensing/compliance people so they can shut him down for operating w/o a license. At this point I could do more ProRevenge, but meh, who has the time? I got some justice, I&amp;#39;ve protected my fellow man, he didn&amp;#39;t get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He thought he could fuck with my house with no consequences. He thought I couldn&amp;#39;t find him. I deconstructed every single lie and basically built the government&amp;#39;s case against him.
