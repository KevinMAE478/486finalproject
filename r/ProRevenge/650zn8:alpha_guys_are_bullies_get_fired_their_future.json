This takes place 10 or so years ago, in the years before the housing bubble burst. I was a young graduate that through dumb luck (clicked with my interviewer) had landed a very prestigious internship at a major company. Think Finance/Banking/Law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a high stress, high pressure job with lots of money on the line and it was the kind of internship that let you walk into pretty much any company doing the same thing. So, both the internship and the company reputation drew a certain kind of &amp;#39;Type A&amp;#39; personalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of our internship they sent us all to their company version of &amp;#39;the farm&amp;#39; - basically a fancy hotel/country club. 8-12 hours of training a day, followed by an open bar when all the &amp;#39;adults&amp;#39; went home. Recipe for... well, a lot of mayhem, but that is another story. This set-up was pretty much intentional to see who could handle it and as an excuse for our bosses to drink with us and &amp;#39;assess&amp;#39; our client skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early on I was paired on an exercise with a guy, his name starts with J, so will call him Jack. But, think Piggy from Lord of the Flies, but taller. He was smart, shy, a bit awkward with odd hobbies. But, nice enough guy, and worked hard. I got along fine with him, and we had a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second or third day, Jack got paired with two guys in another group exercise. These two, let&amp;#39;s call them Adam and Bill, were your typical rich, spoiled &amp;#39;alpha&amp;#39; guys. Both had gone to top universities, and fancy private schools before that. They were both set up for a career in the business - loud, brash, charming, aggressive, the rest. Their conversational repertoire was women, drinking and sports. They were the type that knew the cost of everything and the value of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night at the bar, I had to listen to an endless tirade of abuse towards Jack (who wasn&amp;#39;t there, cause he didn&amp;#39;t drink...). Basically, the totality of their wit could be summarised as the words &amp;#39;fatty, faggot and loser&amp;#39; described over and over again. I couldn&amp;#39;t even figure out what Jack had done to in their eyes deserve it - in the end I put it down to Jack being &amp;#39;not like them&amp;#39;. They had already gathered a little crew of similar people and while I could probably have fit in, I excused myself eventually and found some other people to drink with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, every day after that, at every opportunity, Adam and Bill threw not-so-hidden insults at Jack, backed up by laughs from their &amp;#39;friends&amp;#39;. Sometimes to his face, sometimes laughing behind his back. Jack took it all with some grace, but the relentlessness of it was overbearing, even for me. It was childish high-school stuff that most of us had outgrown. Now and then they would focus on other people for their daily bullying, but most of us gave as good as we got and they soon left us alone. But they kept at Jack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the two weeks were over, we went to our individual desks and bosses. I was at the same desk as a girl which I got along fine with, and our boss was cool (if highly autistic). Most people were spread across various floors/buildings, and between that and intentional Chinese Walls, it was therefore hard to communicate with other interns save for an email list that higher-ups used to communicate to all of us at the same time. And, to be honest, most of us were working so long hours that socialising outside work wasn&amp;#39;t really worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, a month in, disaster struck. Leaving work with with my desk, we were heading for a bar for end of week drinks, I was clipped by a car [drunk driver ran a red, but at low speed]. I was fine, a concussion and cuts/bruises, and the doctor suggested I take some time off to recover. As mentioned, by boss was a nice guy and signed off on a week of sick leave for me without doubt. Who knew getting hit by a car in front of your boss worked out well?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I came back to work, I opened up my desktop, and was greeted with 400+ emails in my inbox. This was rare, I usually got like 10 a week or something as I couldn&amp;#39;t/wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to communicate with other desks and everything else was done verbally as we all sat next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, someone had figured out how the emailing list that was used for all the interns worked, and reverse-mapped the aliased email addresses each of us had. It allowed people to communicate via email using the list, including and excluding the aliases as relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the head email was an announcement from higher-ups that one of the interns was performing at a company event. Guess who? Jack. He was apparently a talented musician. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What followed that email was 250+ emails of Adam and Bill&amp;#39;s crew throwing insults back and forth about Jack, using the aforementioned &amp;#39;hack&amp;#39; to exclude people they didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to. But, only by mistake I can imagine, they left me in the chain. As for the content of the emails, if you imagine every possible way you could fail sensitivity training, it was there, not once, not twice, but pretty much 10-30 emails from each person, including attacks on not only Jack but pretty much every intern that wasn&amp;#39;t in their crew. Most of it was rage-inducing in the kicking puppies kind of way. This was not idle stupidity, this was intentional cruelty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I spent most of Monday morning reading this and getting more and more angry. Weirdly enough, I wasn&amp;#39;t mentioned, but lots of people I liked was. By lunch I was fuming, not a big fan of bullying as you can imagine. But, not much I could do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, serendipity. I was based on the same floor as company HR and the news of my accident had gotten around, so Vice-VP of HR, the woman in charge of all the interns, had seen me and come over to chat and ask how I was. This is how the conversation went:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VP: [Pleasantries]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: [Pleasantries]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above repeated x 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;#39;Oh, do you know what all these emails are about?&amp;#39;. I asked this in as much innocence as I could, setting her up for her obvious follow-up. I knew that people would burn. Not only were we forbidden to communicate with each other, it was going to get worse once they read the emails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VP: &amp;#39;No, what is it about?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t know, I just opened my email and had lots of email from all the other interns. I thought you might now.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VP: [Looking very concerned] &amp;#39;Hmm, would you mind if I had a look at them, you really shouldn&amp;#39;t be talking to each other&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: [Not at all grinning like a maniac inside] &amp;#39;Of course, I&amp;#39;ll zip them all up and send them to you.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did. And then I went on with my work as usual. With a smile. I bought my desk a round of drinks that night to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I heard through gossip that Adam and Bill had been escorted out of the building and another bunch of interns were on &amp;#39;disciplinary supervision&amp;#39;. The week after, an email came out that all interns had to do &amp;#39;interpersonal relationship&amp;#39; training. I asked the VP about it, and she said I didn&amp;#39;t have to go as it didn&amp;#39;t concern me (she even praised my integrity...). She let slip that the emails had made rounds at board level, and basically anyone that had participated would not be considered to stay on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, this particular business is a fairly small world, and most people know most people. And as this was a good story (a lot of the content of the emails was between cringe-worthy and shocking cruelty), it was one the higher-ups talked about when they met. The names of Adam and Bill went around quickly and they found themselves persona non grata - I knew some people that knew them, and neither found job in this sector again, both moving on to work with something else. This prestigious internship is also missing from their LinkedIn profiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since my input was all so accidental, I never really thought much about it before I decided to write this. Thought you&amp;#39;d all enjoy it though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Alpha guys bullies nice guy, leaves behind evidence.
