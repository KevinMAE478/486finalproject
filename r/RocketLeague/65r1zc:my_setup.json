There&amp;#39;s a decent chance my chair/desk setup cost more than your sofa. Believe me mate, it&amp;#39;s comfortable as fuck. I also get that sweet 144Hz and 1ms delay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional, some people do care about those little things, I&amp;#39;m one of them and am in a position to afford that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason the top players of ALL games play at 144hz. It&amp;#39;s simply better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RocketLeague", "name": "t1_dgdjk8p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468150.0, "created_utc": 1492439350.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_30cz1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r1zc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_30cz1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r1zc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_30cz1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r1zc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnvof", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tossit999", "parent_id": "t1_dgd5x8i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RocketLeague", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Double yuck.
