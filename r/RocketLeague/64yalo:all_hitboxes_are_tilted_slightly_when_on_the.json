The hitbox isn&amp;#39;t bolted to the ground but the wiggling (!while driving!) is so minor it can be completely disregarded. If you don&amp;#39;t know how small 0.01 unreal units is then let me tell you that it literally doesn&amp;#39;t show up at all on a 1080p screen because the ball moves less than a pixel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Other implications&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than the cars being different heights from front to back, having tilted hitboxes has more implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, the cars might not be as high as you think they are.

The car hits the ball with the frontside and we draw the vector. The 2nd drawing shows what would've happened if the car was shorter. The ball would've gotten closer to the centre of mass and therefore the angle gets steeper. Now what Psyonix does in that hacky code which I'm not really supposed to go into detail about is \"bending\" the vector. So you will get the green hit direction even though the car is longer.\n\nNow in this [2nd example](http://i.imgur.com/wNiEG7K.png) where the ball hits the roof at an angle then if the car is a bit shorter you would still get 100% the same angle. But Psyonix' code \"bends\" the vector anyway so you'll still get the green arrow. If the ball hits the roof at a perfect 90\u00b0 angle then no \"bending\" is done.\n\nThe damping of the up direction has nothing to do with that part. I probably shouldn't have only mentioned it in the summary. So additionally to that change I already talked about the vector gets the upwards direction slightly dampened. Upward meaning the actual up direction of the map so even if you're shooting from the wall the game will try to change the vector so the ball moves across the field instead of straight up. This doesn't mean that the power gets weaker only the direction gets changed.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, look at this &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/saN1oXX.png\"&gt;1st drawing&lt;/a&gt;. The car hits the ball with the frontside and we draw the vector. The 2nd drawing shows what would&amp;#39;ve happened if the car was shorter. The ball would&amp;#39;ve gotten closer to the centre of mass and therefore the angle gets steeper. Now what Psyonix does in that hacky code which I&amp;#39;m not really supposed to go into detail about is &amp;quot;bending&amp;quot; the vector. So you will get the green hit direction even though the car is longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now in this &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wNiEG7K.png\"&gt;2nd example&lt;/a&gt; where the ball hits the roof at an angle then if the car is a bit shorter you would still get 100% the same angle. But Psyonix&amp;#39; code &amp;quot;bends&amp;quot; the vector anyway so you&amp;#39;ll still get the green arrow. If the ball hits the roof at a perfect 90\u00b0 angle then no &amp;quot;bending&amp;quot; is done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The damping of the up direction has nothing to do with that part. I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have only mentioned it in the summary. So additionally to that change I already talked about the vector gets the upwards direction slightly dampened. Upward meaning the actual up direction of the map so even if you&amp;#39;re shooting from the wall the game will try to change the vector so the ball moves across the field instead of straight up. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the power gets weaker only the direction gets changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RocketLeague", "name": "t1_dg6ll1j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061517.0, "created_utc": 1492032717.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6d756", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ENIGMA_PLEASE_", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wxpb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RocketLeague", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not sure I fully understand the \"bit of hacky code\" part of episode 6, is the damping always towards the \"up\" vector of the car?
