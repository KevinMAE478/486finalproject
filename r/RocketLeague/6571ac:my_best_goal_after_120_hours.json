And regarding the aerial: I have done so much training for car control on the ground and the air and trained a lot of air dribbles and freestyles, which, even if I can't consistently (*cough* I actually never pulled off a single, good air dribble since starting to train it... 4-8 weeks ago, putting in a good 10-20h in training) air dribble in-game*, it IMMENSELY improved my overall car control to a level even I am surprised sometimes. I know many people here say don't learn air dribbles, but for me, this pushed me from being a good silver/gold player to a low platinum player within a few weeks. Car Control is such a crucial thing. Of course I also worked on other stuff, but these came more naturally, f.e. better positioning, keeping momentum, wall shots (play Dropshot! Perfect game mode to improve your wall shots/game), strong shots, etc.\n\nIf anyone wants to know which resources used, these are the YT videos for Car Control:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ed8owajA0Lc\nhttps://youtu.be/3YtxID9OgRQ\n\n.. and air dribbles:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5B4HW6blWk4\nhttps://youtu.be/GFc6k-HX0y4\n\nFreestyling came by itself, although I'm not very good at it yet, but my primary focus is on turning my car how I need it to be, not on making it look good. I couldn't find any better videos regarding these topics, bur that was a while ago - there may be newer ones now!\n\nIf you'd say this is a hard aerial with 1400h, try those car control trainings, work on your wall game, feathering your boost and double jump aerials, i.e. check out those trainings and play some Dropshot!\n\n\\* I can do air dribble (wall and ground) easily and relatively consistently (let's say 7-8/10 times I can score a goal) in free play or whatever training mode, but it seems like I just freak out under pressure and always fuck up the timing or go way too fast even if I have the muscle memory 100% down to a level where I can literally feel the whole sequence in my mind when thinking about it. It gets better, though. I pulled of some half-assed.. somethings where I at least connect once now, but doing freestyled air dribbles with wall bounce vs. not even connecting in real games is kinda frustrating.", "edited": 1492158240.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that do many players have such huge difference in skill relative to hours played?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 400 hours and did similar shots, although I have to say OP&amp;#39;s goal is beautifully clean! What I want to say is: this would not be a hard aerial for me. On a scale from 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) I&amp;#39;d rate this a 4-5. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I wouldn&amp;#39;t hit aerials like this, all the GC&amp;#39;s, Champions and my team mates in Platinum (Standard) would kick the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just seems to make no sense to me, the only reason I can think of is that actual training improves skills much better/faster than just playing matches. And regarding the aerial: I have done so much training for car control on the ground and the air and trained a lot of air dribbles and freestyles, which, even if I can&amp;#39;t consistently (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; I actually never pulled off a single, good air dribble since starting to train it... 4-8 weeks ago, putting in a good 10-20h in training) air dribble in-game*, it IMMENSELY improved my overall car control to a level even I am surprised sometimes. I know many people here say don&amp;#39;t learn air dribbles, but for me, this pushed me from being a good silver/gold player to a low platinum player within a few weeks. Car Control is such a crucial thing. Of course I also worked on other stuff, but these came more naturally, f.e. better positioning, keeping momentum, wall shots (play Dropshot! Perfect game mode to improve your wall shots/game), strong shots, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to know which resources used, these are the YT videos for Car Control:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/ed8owajA0Lc\"&gt;https://youtu.be/ed8owajA0Lc&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/3YtxID9OgRQ\"&gt;https://youtu.be/3YtxID9OgRQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.. and air dribbles:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/5B4HW6blWk4\"&gt;https://youtu.be/5B4HW6blWk4&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/GFc6k-HX0y4\"&gt;https://youtu.be/GFc6k-HX0y4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freestyling came by itself, although I&amp;#39;m not very good at it yet, but my primary focus is on turning my car how I need it to be, not on making it look good. I couldn&amp;#39;t find any better videos regarding these topics, bur that was a while ago - there may be newer ones now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d say this is a hard aerial with 1400h, try those car control trainings, work on your wall game, feathering your boost and double jump aerials, i.e. check out those trainings and play some Dropshot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* I can do air dribble (wall and ground) easily and relatively consistently (let&amp;#39;s say 7-8/10 times I can score a goal) in free play or whatever training mode, but it seems like I just freak out under pressure and always fuck up the timing or go way too fast even if I have the muscle memory 100% down to a level where I can literally feel the whole sequence in my mind when thinking about it. It gets better, though.
