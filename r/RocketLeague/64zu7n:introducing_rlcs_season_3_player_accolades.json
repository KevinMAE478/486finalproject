That&amp;#39;s dumb. It&amp;#39;s more than just encouraging people to goal-steal, it encourages general selfish play, and playing more offensively than would be optimal to ensure a win. Also, the best defence in RL is to not allow shots, to keep being faster to the ball than the opposite team so they can&amp;#39;t make a shot, so the saviour medal will probably go to a player from one of the worst teams. But 500 bucks isn&amp;#39;t much out of the $300k prize pool so hopefully players ignore it and play purely to win :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "RocketLeague", "name": "t1_dg6j1f1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492058644.0, "created_utc": 1492029844.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_30cz1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zu7n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_30cz1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zu7n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg71cuw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dmrawlings", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ov50", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RocketLeague", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, a player must have a minimum of 15 games in League Play to be eligible for accolades.

The primary reason for not giving us rewards for certifications is that they don't want us to change the way that people play the game. Right now, no one cares about stays, goals steals, etc. and just cares about the winning and losing (and some play to have fun). They don't want that to change, and neither do I. Players in ranked don't usually make risky plays when the game is fairly close, so seeing a teammate whiff a wide open goal because they're trying to turtle would be pretty infuriating. \n\nSo, what are some of the potential downsides of rewarding stats?\n\n1. The situation I described previously about playing differently that one normally would. Goal stealing, shooting when they would usually pass, waiting for the ball to get closer to the goal before they save it... this would change the outcome for many games, lead to a more toxic environment, likely an increase in false accusations for teammates who legitimately screwed up... you get the point.\n\n2. In unranked, I imagine stat farming would become very prevalent. Unranked would be the easiest way to achieve and would lead to other problems, such as: purposefully deranking to play easier opponents, a less populated ranked playlist, and a dip in the quality of play in unranked games due to players religiously trying to build a single stat.\n\nNow, how could we combat these potential issues?\n\nWell, for one, I have to bring up the question of how the game was affected when certifications were first released. I don't ever remember seeing posts complaining about any of these issues. This was at a time where many of us wanted to build up the stats and assumed there would be rewards in the foreseeable future. It was a while before many of us discovered that the stats would never amount to anything.\n\nWe could restrict stat tracking to unranked game modes. This would remove concern over tainting the competitive playlist, although it wouldn't solve the other problems I discussed.\n\nWe could restrict stat tracking to games won. If you want your stats to count towards your item, then you have to win the game. Plain and simple. This would do a great job of mitigating the number of people doing stupid stuff in game and keeping the primary goal what it should be. This wouldn't solve the issue of deranking, but in sure there is something that could be thought up.\n\nAdding a report option specific to stat farming. If implemented properly and with appropriate punishments, this could be rather affective.\n\nCertified stats should not be transferable via trade, which is the current system, but stats should be remembered for particular items so as to not accidentally lose stats.\n\nIf people aren't convinced that novelty certifications, such as turtle goals and backwards goals, could be mitigated enough by any strategy, then the rewards could be restricted to the more practical statistics, with additional being added, such as shutouts and passes.\n\n*On a side note, if passes were a stat that was tracked in general, and perhaps shown after the game, then I think that players might actually improve and focus more on awareness and team play. A simple algorithm, while not expected to be perfect, could definitely be developed in a short amount of time to do track this.\n\nThe rewards could be something that no one ever sees, like trophies in a trophy case. Players would be less inclined to abuse the system if the reward was something players wouldn't see, but could still feel rewarded by receiving this and building up their trophy room.\n\n\nAnyways, I'll stop there for now. The solutions aren't perfect, but the point is that there is always a way to do something if it's well-thought out. Issues like this are treated as black and white when they aren't. My solutions are merely suggestions at some potential starting points. I take similar issue with people who shut down the idea of daily, weekly, or monthly objectives because they don't want the game to feel like a chore. Lots of people would love that sort of system and it could be compromised to appeal to both crowds if given enough consideration.\n\nAnd it's important to remember that no system is perfect.
