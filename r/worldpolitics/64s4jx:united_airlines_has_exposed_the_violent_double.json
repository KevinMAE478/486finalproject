No biggie, this is one of those 10% cases, I just gotta refund a ticket. No volunteers, well pick a name out of the hat. They pick the name and that guy doesn&amp;#39;t want to leave. What is the plane owner to do? Abandon his responsibility to his kid? That isn&amp;#39;t an option, so the most fair thing to do is make that rando leave. If he refuses, that guy would call the cops and the same thing could happen, because a customer isn&amp;#39;t following the rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you can criticize overbooking practices, you can criticize company policy of making employees higher priority than customers, you can criticize the use of force the police used and you SHOULD criticize the tone deaf CEO, HOWEVER, this is capitalism working as intended. While you may not agree with how it happened, the legal rules were followed, the only person who wasn&amp;#39;t following the rules was the guy who got booted from the plane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When police officers tell you to do something, you do that thing at that time, even if it&amp;#39;s wrong. ESPECIALLY when you know that the whole incident is being so documented, all the evidence is on your side, you&amp;#39;d be a fool to resist the guys with guns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll repeat. If you think the system of consensual exchanges of goods and services for profits led to this, you have a child&amp;#39;s understanding of reality and need to get some fucking context like an adult.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldpolitics", "name": "t1_dg4vx2p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972001.0, "created_utc": 1491943201.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4uuk5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fuzzyshorts", "parent_id": "t1_dg4tw1l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldpolitics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The authority of the public police to protect the profits of the private corporation.
