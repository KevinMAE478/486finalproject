Couple that with an unemployment rate of ~26% (near Great Depression levels) and an authoritarian regime that's been maintaining power forcefully through two generations since 1974. Technology really opened up lines of communication and exposed people to the rest of the world and a revolution that had been brewing in the region for decades. Syria is ~70% Sunni Muslim and is ruled by the Alawite Shi'ite al Assad family. Shi'ites make up something like 8-12% of the Syrian population and a similar percentage of worldwide Muslims. So it's a minority government governing a majority populace. \n\nThe Free Syrian Army was created by high-ranking defectors from the Syrian military. The FSA is sort of a catch-all for people of many different backgrounds who want to see the government fall. ISIS are Wahhabi/Salafist hardline ultra-conservative Muslims who want a theocracy ruled directly from the Qur'an and the Sunnah.
