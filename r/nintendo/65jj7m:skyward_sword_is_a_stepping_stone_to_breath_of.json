Zelda exposits at you and it does a bad job of establishing you as her friend, as everything you do together more or less has to happen due to the festival. Link gets EVERYTHING in that opening story handed to him, he's the clear favourite of every person and it makes Groose feel like the underdog hero, and Link seem like a spoiled rich kid. Hell, Link doesnt even really choose to save Zelda \u2013 Fi leads him to the sword in his sleep, then Gaepora tells him to go. There's very little agency shown by Link in Skyward Sword.\nThe controls are a mixed bag. The amount of issues people have had with them makes me think it can't just be player-side. There is some level of bad response, which makes the controls worse than any other Zelda game which doesn't have the space to make those errors.\nThe entire world (almost the entire world) is made of small, enclosed, linear environments, and dowsing removes a lot of the exploration that you are given.

Zelda exposits at you and it does a bad job of establishing you as her friend, as everything you do together more or less has to happen due to the festival.
