You're saying that you shouldn't have to pay 60$ for a game that includes all the DLC + extra, but the flaw in your logic, is that the game also comes with it. So you aren't paying for the extra content alone, you're also paying for the full game. Granted, you're buying it again, but you also have the option to simply *not.* But you can't say it's the same game, because by saying that you're effectively ignoring the extra content, as well as the functionality of it being on a new and shiny console.\n\nAnd sure, it could have been DLC, but why bother making it DLC on a dead console when it makes so much more sense to release it on the new console with all the content (plus extra) and creating a better experience for people who already have the game, as well as creating a new experience for newcomers to the game. The same exact logic goes for Splatoon 2.\n\nI also noticed you brought up the new Zelda as a point, and yes, that's a port, but the only reason it was released on Wii U at all is because they were able to recognize that a lot of people bought the console for Zelda or can't access the switch immediately. They're just being courteous. You can't complain about that; you pick one.
