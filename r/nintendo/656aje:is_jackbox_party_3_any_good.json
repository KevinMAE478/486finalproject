Since people can play from their phone or tablet, it makes playing easy  since you dont have to bring along the console and controllers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quiplash 2 is basically cards against humanity where you fill out the cards yourself.\nTrivia Murder Party is trivia with a twist, lots of fun.\n TeeKO is hard to explain (everyone draws and makes up slogans, they are distributed randomly and everyone needs to make shirts with what they have and they go head to head) but if you get a group of people who get it and are into it it&amp;#39;s really fun\nFaking it is great if you have a group of people who all know each other (ie people from work or school, family gatherings) but is less effective if its a group of people where people are meeting for the first time. In the right group, it is a blast.\nGuesspionage you need ot guess what percentage of people do a certain things (stuff like what percentage of people put ketchup over the fries rather than on the side), it is the weakest game imo but it is also the easiest one to get people into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, it is available pretty much everywhere and you can probably find it cheaper on steam or on PS or Xbox ( I got mine on PS4 for about $5 on a sale, and I had bought quiplash for $1 on steam).
