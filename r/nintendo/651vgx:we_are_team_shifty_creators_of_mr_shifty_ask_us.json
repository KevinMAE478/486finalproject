The developer response has largely been to either downplay the importance of the issue or over promise while under delivering on any updates.  It&amp;#39;s a big issue for those of us who are primarily PC and Switch gamers as it can really detract from your gaming experience when you&amp;#39;re used to a fluid 60+fps experience.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a game I wouldn&amp;#39;t likely purchase on PC outside of a steam sale but it&amp;#39;s a great game for the portability of the Switch.  I was planning on it being a day 1 purchase because I&amp;#39;d love to support the effort your team put in but I may wait to see if the issues actually get resolved first or how severe they are.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dg745c3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084964.0, "created_utc": 1492056164.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6txmq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "josh_s_dev", "parent_id": "t1_dg6tm02", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Switch version has some trouble at times, more towards the end of the game.
