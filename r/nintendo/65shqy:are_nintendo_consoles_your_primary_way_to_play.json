Barring any FF13 level letdowns of course, even Other M had enough redeeming factors in the gameplay that I could ignore/dismiss the story and enjoy the game otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Switch changes things up a bit for me. The portability is attractive, and there are games I will buy on it instead of PC (or buy again if I already have them on PC,) simply because being able to take them with me any time, anywhere, that&amp;#39;s very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do have a laptop that&amp;#39;s rather capable as a gaming system when I go back home for the holidays and don&amp;#39;t want to lug my tower along, but even the laptop is just huge and bulky for day to day gaming wherever, whenever. I&amp;#39;ve been waiting on something like the Switch since the original Gameboy... Android tablets/phones don&amp;#39;t cut it because they&amp;#39;re still crappy mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft&amp;#39;s Surface line while never powerful enough to play all the games I&amp;#39;d like to play, it could play some, however it&amp;#39;s main turn off for me was the form factor... can&amp;#39;t just hold it in my hands to play games, gotta make sure to bring a keyboard and mouse, or a controller, or all three, plus a battery pack and/or A/C adapter... at that point a proper laptop with enough power to play pretty much all the games I&amp;#39;d like to play just makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgdsx03", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479035.0, "created_utc": 1492450235.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65shqy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdukvp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Xtreme-Redditor", "parent_id": "t3_65shqy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nintendo for everything.\n\nThe games that come out on other consoles simply don't attract me. ~~(I'm poor as fuck anyway so no way I could ever buy them)~~", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo for everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The games that come out on other consoles simply don&amp;#39;t attract me. &lt;del&gt;(I&amp;#39;m poor as fuck anyway so no way I could ever buy them)&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgdukvp", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480859.0, "created_utc": 1492452059.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65shqy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdvo4z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aequusnox", "parent_id": "t3_65shqy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like some other commenter I don't have time to play everything.
