Buying a Blu-ray and playing it for a large group of friends isn't piracy, but it's still technically a breach of contract because you don't have the rights to put on a public showing. Using a cheat device in any way technically breaks your EULA with Nintendo, [and they even *sued* Game Genie \\(and lost\\) based on the argument that it was illegal and a form of piracy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Galoob_Toys,_Inc._v._Nintendo_of_America,_Inc.) \n\nThe courts found that it was perfectly legal for users to modify the code of games they purchase. This is one of the big cases that proved that game mods were legal. Using mods or cheat tools (like an NFC spoofer) *might* break your EULA, but it isn't illegal, and it depends on the specific EULA.\n\nThis is a really important distinction because there's a huge difference between piracy and breaking an EULA, even if both are technically wrong. But let's not talk about the law, lets talk about ethics for a bit:\n\nI really hesitate to compare the Amiibo content to DLC because it's so insignificant. The unique content is entirely cosmetic, there's very little of it, and most of the items that Amiibo can give you are stuff that's already in the game. In fact, Amiibo are far more likely to drop normal items than exclusive items. I own all of the Amiibo, and I've had several days where I scanned them all and got *zero* Amiibo-exclusive items. \n\nIf we were talking about unlocking entirely new levels or missions or characters that would be one thing, but we're talking about a slim chance at getting a pair of pants or a horse skin. With one exception (the Twilight bow) the Amiibo-exclusive items are easily outclassed by the standard in-game items. The physical Amiibo statue is clearly the primary product being sold, and the in-game stuff is just a fun perk, like getting a downloadable wallpaper when you preorder a game. NFC spoofing won't get you an actual copy of the Amiibo, so you're still not getting the full product, or even the primary product that Nintendo is selling. I think that makes it more of a grey area, ethically.\n\nIt's exactly the same as using a game shark or fan-made mods to unlock \"bonus\" content in an unexpected way. Here's an old-school example of a similar situation:\n\nYou weren't supposed to be able to catch Mew in Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue/Yellow without going to a special Nintendo-sponsored event... but you could still catch him with a cheat device, or by using glitches. Is that stealing? Piracy? Unethical? Technically you're altering the game code and accessing things without going through the proper process. \n\nIt wasn't actually possible for every Pok\u00e9mon fan to go to those events. Maybe you didn't have a location nearby, or didn't have access to transportation. Maybe you bought the game after the distribution events had ended. If it's *genuinely impossible* for someone to pay Nintendo to access Mew (like it is today) is it okay for them to use a cheat device or glitch to access the content? \n\nPeople who cheat will still miss out on the special in-person events (which were often really cool) but by cheating they can still enjoy a the bonus content hidden in their game. They're not hurting anyone, they're not breaking the law (just their EULA), and the whole thing is so inconsequential that it's hard to feel like anyone has been wronged. \n\nAn even better example would be the original Animal Crossing. It's full of cool NES games you can get in your room, but the only way to access them is by owning a GBA, a GBA-to-GCN cable, an accessory called the e-reader, and some special amiibo-like Animal Crossing cards that you could scan in. Or you can cheat by printing your own cards or using a cheat device to hack your save file. It's very similar to the current situation, but the stuff you unlocked (full NES games) was way more significant. Problem is, Nintendo didn't make very many of those special Amiibo-like cards. In fact, due to low sales, they didn't even finish making the entire series! There are several in-game items that are impossible to get without cheating because the cards were discontinued before the full series had been printed. \n\nIs it wrong to use cheats to access those NES games and get those items when Nintendo made it extremely difficult or *literally impossible* to get them any other way? As far as I can tell the law says no, and so do I.\n\nI think the ethical situation with out-of-stock Amiibo is similar, as long as the content is inconsequential and Nintendo shows no signs of re-stocking. If it's genuinely impossible to pay Nintendo to access this content, who are you hurting by breaching the EULA and accessing it? You still won't own the Amiibo.\n\nThis content was never intended to be difficult or impossible to access, and it was never intended to be the primary product, just a cool bonus. It's not the same as DLC from a legal or ethical perspective. \n\n**TL;DR** Obviously this is a grey area and different people will draw the line at different places, but it's clearly not piracy because we're talking about unauthorized access of *content that you already possess,* not distributing content that you have no right to posses. Unauthorized usage of content you have a legal right to posses is handled by the EULA, assuming the EULA even mentions this kind of situation. If it doesn't, you're not breaking any laws or contracts at all. This is what makes it just like a Game Genie or any other old-school cheat device.

Amiibo spoofing and hacking DLC are different because money is involved.", "edited": 1492019937.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;ll get to use the cosmetic stuff that&amp;#39;s already inside the game you purchased. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t own everything in your game&amp;#39;s code when you buy the game.  Games hover in a weird legal gray area between physical products and licenses where you pay for the right to have the disc and the right to play it on your console, but you do not own the code or the game&amp;#39;s contents.  Ripping the game&amp;#39;s code and spoofing or modifying it is a breach of that contract.  Most games even explicitly say making backups and such is prohibited. And since Nintendo has locked things in the code behind an amiibo paywall, circumventing that paywall is tantamount to stealing from them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the argument of whether piracy is moral when legitimately purchasing the product is impossible is a different issue altogether, but what we&amp;#39;re talking about here &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; absolutely piracy.  With a Gameshark or mods, you are generally not accessing content which is normally behind a paywall.  You are either manipulating available assets or creating new ones.  You are technically breaking your agreement by accessing the game&amp;#39;s code, but so long as you don&amp;#39;t benefit monetarily from it there&amp;#39;s no real moral dilemma.
