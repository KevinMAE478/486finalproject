No hitscan weapons and battle environments must complement advanced movement systems rather than fall back on cover shooter tropes.\n\nFor Samus' new acquired abilities:\n\n- Grapple beam that latches to anything, enables complete free-body swinging (i.e. playing Spider Man with real physics instead of video game logic) and pulling and throwing arbitrary objects.\n\n- Parkour boost system that enables unlimited horizontal wall running and limited vertical wall running, plus a bullet jump and a second mid-air jump with the classic Samus spin.\n\n- Cryo beam capable of forming movable ice platforms and affecting water flow.\n\n- Thermo beam capable of melting arbitrary ice objects, which form puddles of water, and evaporating water to form steam.\n\n- Electro beam capable of spreading damage across conductors (including both metal and water) and jump-starting circuits\n\n- Concussive weapons that can dislodge objects that can be moved with grapple beam.\n\n- Spider ball that clings to any arbitrary surface.\n\n- Speed boost that allows use of centrifugal force to circle the insides of pipes or corkscrews.\n\n- Aaaaand anything else you can think of that can fundamentally change how you approach the world.  (That's pretty much Super Metroid's upgrade system in a nutshell -- almost every upgrade makes you look at how you approach everything in a different way).\n\nUse BotW's systems-based problem solving, and design the levels so alternative solutions are possible, rather than the lock/key style puzzles of so many other games.  For instance, puzzles could include:\n\n- Deliver power to the door.  There is a generator nearby but the circuit is incomplete.  There are multiple options for completing the circuit, including breaking off metal rails and grappling them to the right locations, breaking a water pipe and flooding the floor (completes the circuit but makes the floor a shock hazard), or if you already have the electro beam, skip the puzzle and just directly shoot the door.\n\n- Get up to a specific high place.  There's a way to activate an elevator somehow, but you might also be able to grapple some objects and stack them up to stand on, or there might be another accessible high place and an appropriate ceiling to spider-man grapple yourself over there, or if you already have advanced parkour or spider ball then you can already make the jump/climb there.\n\n- Get through the ice.  Obviously you could melt it with a thermo beam, but there's also a floating platform that floats because it's using a flame booster, and you can pull it over if you have grapple but not thermo, or maybe there's an enemy with some kind of thermal weapon that you can lure into shooting it for you.\n\n- And of course some puzzles or obstacles that can *only* be solved if you have a certain ability.  Gotta gate it off somehow so the loopback is necessary and interesting :)\n\nMix in elements of Super Metroid's world design -- specifically, a few areas with remarkably similar challenges, designed to make you remember to go back to them once you have the right ability, and showing you the same sort of challenge right after you get the right ability so you immediately recognize the challenge when you see it next, plus a world design that loops back on itself so backtracking feels natural and interesting rather than repetitive and chore-like.\n\nAnd then make Samus be a character whose primary purpose is to link the player into the world, instead of a cinematic pawn with daddy issues.\n\nWhile I didn't dislike the scanning mechanic in Prime, and thought it was a great way of subtle storytelling and foreshadowing and getting hints, I think it could be improved upon by making it somewhat more automatic.  Holding a \"fine aim\" button automatically activates scanning of whatever you're looking at.  And then, Prime has an option (on by default but can be turned off) to tell you some next critical point if you spend too long not going in the right direction.  That could be expanded on with if you spend too long in a specific room trying to solve a puzzle, the power suit's AI gives a subtle hint about what to do.

For instance, puzzles could include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deliver power to the door.  There is a generator nearby but the circuit is incomplete.  There are multiple options for completing the circuit, including breaking off metal rails and grappling them to the right locations, breaking a water pipe and flooding the floor (completes the circuit but makes the floor a shock hazard), or if you already have the electro beam, skip the puzzle and just directly shoot the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get up to a specific high place.  There&amp;#39;s a way to activate an elevator somehow, but you might also be able to grapple some objects and stack them up to stand on, or there might be another accessible high place and an appropriate ceiling to spider-man grapple yourself over there, or if you already have advanced parkour or spider ball then you can already make the jump/climb there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get through the ice.  Obviously you could melt it with a thermo beam, but there&amp;#39;s also a floating platform that floats because it&amp;#39;s using a flame booster, and you can pull it over if you have grapple but not thermo, or maybe there&amp;#39;s an enemy with some kind of thermal weapon that you can lure into shooting it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course some puzzles or obstacles that can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be solved if you have a certain ability.  Gotta gate it off somehow so the loopback is necessary and interesting :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mix in elements of Super Metroid&amp;#39;s world design -- specifically, a few areas with remarkably similar challenges, designed to make you remember to go back to them once you have the right ability, and showing you the same sort of challenge right after you get the right ability so you immediately recognize the challenge when you see it next, plus a world design that loops back on itself so backtracking feels natural and interesting rather than repetitive and chore-like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then make Samus be a character whose primary purpose is to link the player into the world, instead of a cinematic pawn with daddy issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I didn&amp;#39;t dislike the scanning mechanic in Prime, and thought it was a great way of subtle storytelling and foreshadowing and getting hints, I think it could be improved upon by making it somewhat more automatic.  Holding a &amp;quot;fine aim&amp;quot; button automatically activates scanning of whatever you&amp;#39;re looking at.  And then, Prime has an option (on by default but can be turned off) to tell you some next critical point if you spend too long not going in the right direction.  That could be expanded on with if you spend too long in a specific room trying to solve a puzzle, the power suit&amp;#39;s AI gives a subtle hint about what to do.  Again, optional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instant GOTY, possible GOAT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dg7vggg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492132541.0, "created_utc": 1492103741.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6roi9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wes2les", "parent_id": "t1_dg6fmkw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably because the engine is pretty good, and many games would be very interesting to see as an open-world title, even if it wasn't in the exact engine as BotW.\n\nThose four you mention sound very plausible as open world titles.
