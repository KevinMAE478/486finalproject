This is opposed to a home console where a family will often share a single console (or maybe a few).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, my dad and I are fairly fanatical about Zelda, but up until now we&amp;#39;d usually just share a single console with a single copy of the game and use multiple save game slots or multiple accounts. This time however, we both purchased individual Switches with individual copies of Zelda, because we use them individually. Instead of sharing everything except the savegame, now we just share the dock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nintendo made us buy double the &amp;quot;home console&amp;quot; at launch and double the game copies, for a home console price, and we&amp;#39;re happy about it because of the portability. It&amp;#39;s genius, they&amp;#39;ve essentially created a &amp;quot;premium handheld&amp;quot; market that didn&amp;#39;t exist before. Of course not everyone will buy a personal Switch though (and I expect many people to still share), but I have a strong feeling that buying a &amp;quot;personal Switch&amp;quot; will be more common than not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgdhuu6", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492465726.0, "created_utc": 1492436926.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ujxa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdil76", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JapanStan", "parent_id": "t1_dgdckig", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can't wait for a monster hunter on the Switch.

It&amp;#39;s arguably the best Mario Kart and the remastared version is probably even better. However, I doubt they&amp;#39;ll release a new metroid any time soon. Mario odyssey looks interesting but the next 2D Mario will probably outsell it as usual, so there will come more mario 2D games than 3D and I&amp;#39;m not getting the switch just for one 3D Mario game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing nintendo they&amp;#39;ll probably release a switch mini with longer battery time next, but what I&amp;#39;m looking forward to is one with a much better screen that supports VR, hopefully in a couple of years.
