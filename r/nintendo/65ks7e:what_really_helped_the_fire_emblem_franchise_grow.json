The series became really popular around Awakening, mostly because Awakening come out at a good time on the 3DS, it was actually advertised (compared to its predecessors, which received little to no advertising and poorly-timed releases), and Awakening was more accessible with things like Casual Mode and pair-up, and with the gameplay being simpler (in some regards) to its predecessors. Regardless of what people say, it wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;#39;waifus&amp;#39; that made the series popular (though appealing to anime fans and people who enjoy pairing characters together was certainly a part of it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me personally, it was due to Smash Bros, shortly after Robin&amp;#39;s reveal. The grid-based strategy-RPG gameplay also interested me for a while, so I decided to take the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgb27d1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492313532.0, "created_utc": 1492284732.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ks7e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb4o99", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lishy1_5", "parent_id": "t3_65ks7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lots of curious kids wondering who Marth and Roy were, picking up Fire Emblem 7 GBA, and meeting Lyn at the height of puberty.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of curious kids wondering who Marth and Roy were, picking up Fire Emblem 7 GBA, and meeting Lyn at the height of puberty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgb4o99", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492316902.0, "created_utc": 1492288102.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ks7e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgblaxr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thaidystopia", "parent_id": "t3_65ks7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are a few reasons that pushed fire emblem in the west.\n1.

It&amp;#39;s honestly a bit much to get invested in if you&amp;#39;re not familiar with the series, whereas Awakening is just one story, with DLC expansions if you&amp;#39;re into that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a Wii U, you can get FE7 (named just Fire Emblem with no subtitle, since that was the first one to be released outside of Japan), Sacred Stones, and Shadow Dragon via VC. Of those, I&amp;#39;d recommend FE7 first simply because it has a really in-depth tutorial that can&amp;#39;t be skipped the first time you play the game. Technically you could get Sacred Stones on 3DS but that requires an Ambassador 3DS so... yeah.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgbp8dc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347026.0, "created_utc": 1492318226.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbo34p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AdroIOrdo", "parent_id": "t3_65ks7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've never played a FE game and I've got a 3DS where do I begin?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never played a FE game and I&amp;#39;ve got a 3DS where do I begin?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgbo34p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492345013.0, "created_utc": 1492316213.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ks7e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrfdw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MBCnerdcore", "parent_id": "t3_65ks7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Rock solid reviews for Awakening, and the choice to make Awakening one of the first Nintendo games to get modern DLC.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock solid reviews for Awakening, and the choice to make Awakening one of the first Nintendo games to get modern DLC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nintendo", "name": "t1_dgbrfdw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492351365.0, "created_utc": 1492322565.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ks7e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcr8rx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mando44646", "parent_id": "t3_65ks7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nintendo", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Awakening was actually treated like a real thing that was promoted like other serious releases.
