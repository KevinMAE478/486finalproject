I by no means have the golden ears or whatever, or do I have own and tested every headphone in the world. This is just my opinion, and what I heard put into words. Another word, these reviews are extremely subjective. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buying the Koss Porta pro and using it in public is an interesting journey. At first I was skeptical as hell. The build quality and the headphone just straight up look dorky. Which is seriously not the case here. I needed a portable headphone that is relatively cheap. What is better than the koss porta pro? With a life time warranty and can be folded that fit in your jacket.... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The headphone is built extremely well. These if not stored in my jacket is crushed between heavy textbooks and laptop in my backpack and I have these for maybe 2 months ish now. Although I have noticed a little clamping and the sizing mechanism slowly losing its force a day or two in, however, I havent noticed any changes after that first couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does these look dorky? Not really. I think it makes me look quite fashionable. lol. Also, lets be honest. No one gives a fuck about you in public. Even if someone do, and imho I kinda look like a really professional person wearing these. Not a hipster. But quite cool. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wear glasses when I study, or do anything. The only time I am not wearing glasses is when I was still a basketball player. But ever since I stopped playing basketball. I got fat and never had any real reason to take off my glasses. I am saying this because, these sucks with glasses. The headphone is always pressing my ear into my glasses and that shit hurts after like 5 minutes. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt; There is this weird mechanism call &amp;#39;ComfortZone&amp;#39;. It pretty much moves the driver a little further out and have the side of your head rest on the cushion on the headphone instead of the driver itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The drivers themselves is connected to a &amp;#39;&amp;#39;ball&amp;#39;&amp;#39; system similar to how a shoulder is connected to an arm.... I cant really complain about this. It works and does it job without any real complain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mechanism to adjust the size of the headphone tho. That shit is some alien shit. I will need a ELI5 to how the hell by moving two plastic on two metal band changes the size of the headphone. But that shit is dope. This shit has to be patented or something, because I dont see anyone else doing this. This whole mechanism is the whole reason why I chose this headphone. It can make the headphone so big, or extremely small that my cat can wear em....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cable tho. I mean I cant really expect much anyway. These are braided in the most basic way you can ever think of and have the most basic Y-splitter you can think of and then terminated with the most &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; L shape 3.5mm connector you can ever think of. I have seen some mod on these that changes the cable out or to put in removable cable. I do have a licence to work in the workshop that my university has as a per-requisite for my business class, and is reasonably skillful in soldering. But I am the laziest person in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only real complain I can give... is the earpad. Its not that its uncomfortable. Its perfectly fine. But it is so hard to replace. The pads are fixed in place with these tiny needle behind the driver, which means that if you were to change the pads, it basically means that the pad that you have right now is straight up broken, because by just attempting to change the pads, it is certain that you will destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOUND&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets just start off with that these have an increase in bass a little bit when they are plugged into an amplifier. But I dont really use these with any amplification so .... eh. Otherwise its. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iphone 6s Plus &amp;gt; headphone. 100% of the time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not really have anything to compare these to. 40 aussie dollars and this size. I do not think there is really anything that we can compare with this. Not to mention these headphones are open. O they are open, I believed I havent mention that. I stay in the library for like 14 hours straight on some day of the week. Meaning that these headphones are probably not the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; in public area. It leaks and sounds come in. But luckily I stay in the &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; a lot. Therefore, the sound dont really come in. However I have to be extremely careful with the people around me when I listen to these. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound signature of these headphone can be described as warm. The mid and low is definitely emphasised, compare to the high. I would probably describe these as borderline bassheads. Meaning that the bass is tasteful and not exhausting to listen to. It is responsive and it has a great range(although I think the low bass can do a little more work). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mid is coloured a little. But in a very tasteful way. I dont hate it, but I will be lying if I say I like it. The female vocal when trying to hit a certain pitch just feels a little softer, not lower, but softer. A little quieter. Where as a deep male voice is very good. Like John Legend. There is really nothing I can talk about this. Its good. Female vocal, or high mids are a little coloured. But its good, its tasteful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The high is definitely pushed down a little, but this is not to say that this is bad. There is a great separation between every instrument, and sounds and etc. But I have definitely heard better. It is not inaccurate, but due to the nature of this headphone. The high are not exactly accurate either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The soundstage is pretty good, being open and all. You can tell where each instrument comes from and its for the most part extremely accurate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; love this headphone. Is it the best headphone in the world? No. Is it this or that. Probably not. But what it is, is that it has a beautiful sound, easy to drive, extremely portable and durable. Not to mention again, the lifetime warranty. All of that for 40aud, so like 30 usd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it the most &amp;#39;&amp;#39;audiophile&amp;#39;&amp;#39; headphone. No. But does it sound good and musical. Yes. But I would like to think that this type of sound is not for everyone, it is for me. But I would still strongly recommend that someone, anyone owning this headphone. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I quite enjoy writing review, it makes me feel special. haha. \n\n\n[pics](https://imgur.com/a/vTb3o)\n\n\nIt is currently Easter break in Australia, and I finally have a break from Law school and to have the weekend to enjoy the NBA playoff.
