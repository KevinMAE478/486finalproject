I'd like different suggestions for different price ranges inside my maximum, if possible. I am potentially shopping for multiple devices of different use cases and/or different levels of risk (theft/damage), and otherwise would like the information to be able to do my own price-to-performance evaluations by ~~ab~~using my local hifi stores' in-home audition policies.\n\n&gt; Source\n\nVaries. Ideally I need something that can be acceptably driven by the whole gamut of low- to mid-end audio. From an unamped/CMOY/E11 Zune to an A5+AK120II, and occasionally an O2+ODAC from laptop.\n\n&gt; Requirements for Isolation\n\nI hike, I take long walks, I travel semi-frequently (solo interstate drives, trains, 15 hour flights to Asia, that kind of thing). Isolation appropriate for public transit (i.e. city busses or subways) would be cool, but not required; I don't want some joker coming in asking me if I've tried the latest QuietComfort yet.\n\n&gt; Will you be using these Headphones in Public?\n\nJa, mein freund.\n\n&gt; Preferred Type of Headphone\n\nCircumaural.\n\n&gt; Preferred tonal balance\n\nI listen to a variety of things and my tastes change semi-frequently. I like a decent amount of air in my music, I like my drums (specifically, bass and toms) punchy, I like my piano and chimes to really glitter with that fine reverb, and I like my bass deep and present but not overpowering. I like a (not-overwhelming) degree of intimacy with my music; I want to be embraced by it, not have it dissected and put on display. Not to be confused with excessively \"forward\" or \"close\" sound, mind. That said, I'd probably lean towards balanced just because I haven't really figured out what signature actually works for my tastes yet, or perhaps worse, where they might clash when my tastes change, and maybe EQ/amp can make up for the difference.\n\n&gt; Past headphones\n\nSound: Prefer not to say for various reasons, not the least of which is that my setup and tastes kept changing, and I never bothered to put down notes on how I felt about a given combination or changes to a different one.\n\nComfort: I've owned a few Audio-Technicas and I love how their wire+wing design feels on my head. I can't stand the foldable \"DJ style\" cans like MDRs or M-0x.\n\n&gt; Preferred Music\n\nCurrently favored genres: Jpop, trance, power metal, symphonic metal, Vocaloid (it is more productive to define it as its own genre than to verbosely identify the genres which it overlaps)\n\n* Livetune - Last Night, Good Night [Album: Re:Package] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mMMYSqlM4\n* niki feat.

I&amp;#39;d like different suggestions for different price ranges inside my maximum, if possible. I am potentially shopping for multiple devices of different use cases and/or different levels of risk (theft/damage), and otherwise would like the information to be able to do my own price-to-performance evaluations by &lt;del&gt;ab&lt;/del&gt;using my local hifi stores&amp;#39; in-home audition policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Source&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Varies. Ideally I need something that can be acceptably driven by the whole gamut of low- to mid-end audio. From an unamped/CMOY/E11 Zune to an A5+AK120II, and occasionally an O2+ODAC from laptop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Requirements for Isolation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hike, I take long walks, I travel semi-frequently (solo interstate drives, trains, 15 hour flights to Asia, that kind of thing). Isolation appropriate for public transit (i.e. city busses or subways) would be cool, but not required; I don&amp;#39;t want some joker coming in asking me if I&amp;#39;ve tried the latest QuietComfort yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will you be using these Headphones in Public?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ja, mein freund.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred Type of Headphone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Circumaural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred tonal balance&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I listen to a variety of things and my tastes change semi-frequently. I like a decent amount of air in my music, I like my drums (specifically, bass and toms) punchy, I like my piano and chimes to really glitter with that fine reverb, and I like my bass deep and present but not overpowering. I like a (not-overwhelming) degree of intimacy with my music; I want to be embraced by it, not have it dissected and put on display. Not to be confused with excessively &amp;quot;forward&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; sound, mind. That said, I&amp;#39;d probably lean towards balanced just because I haven&amp;#39;t really figured out what signature actually works for my tastes yet, or perhaps worse, where they might clash when my tastes change, and maybe EQ/amp can make up for the difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Past headphones&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound: Prefer not to say for various reasons, not the least of which is that my setup and tastes kept changing, and I never bothered to put down notes on how I felt about a given combination or changes to a different one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort: I&amp;#39;ve owned a few Audio-Technicas and I love how their wire+wing design feels on my head. I can&amp;#39;t stand the foldable &amp;quot;DJ style&amp;quot; cans like MDRs or M-0x.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred Music&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently favored genres: Jpop, trance, power metal, symphonic metal, Vocaloid (it is more productive to define it as its own genre than to verbosely identify the genres which it overlaps)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Livetune - Last Night, Good Night [Album: Re:Package] &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mMMYSqlM4\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mMMYSqlM4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;niki feat.

I also like headphones that don&amp;#39;t exacerbate poor recording quality like my Denon AH-MM400s, which are relentless when it comes to revealing recording flaws. I also think it&amp;#39;s fair to say I like really lush midrange, which I suppose is something they often talk about in the LCD-2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like thin sounding headphones, which is one of the reasons why I thought the LCD-2 would work for me.
