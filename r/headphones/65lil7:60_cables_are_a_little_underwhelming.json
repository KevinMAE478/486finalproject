When you want a shorter cable, you simply cut it to length.  Then you solder on a new jack.  I like Neutrik jacks and they&amp;#39;re about $5 at Redco.  You can get a $5 soldering iron at Harbor Freight.  You would have saved $50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, for the record, cables are nothing but a scam.  They make no difference at audio frequencies.  Cables only matter when you get into the gigahertz range or are dealing with high voltage electricity.  This is true because &lt;em&gt;science determined it to be true.&lt;/em&gt;  You got ripped off.  Someone make $40 or $50 of profit off you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "headphones", "name": "t1_dgc41n8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492383369.0, "created_utc": 1492354569.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb76ly", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Degru", "parent_id": "t3_65lil7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/headphones", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Basically, I needed a short cable for my HD600's because the stock one was way too long and having a bundle hanging off the middle is annoying.

The red tinting is a good bit more noticeable in real life than the Amazon images show, and frankly I think it&amp;#39;s gorgeous. The wrap is decent. It&amp;#39;s not fabric, but it&amp;#39;s not too stiff, it doesn&amp;#39;t cause any microphonic issues that I&amp;#39;ve experienced, and it doesn&amp;#39;t really feel as cheap as it is. The combo jack that it&amp;#39;s terminated with is pretty nifty, and I think it strikes a nice balance between lightweight and not-too-cheap feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: it doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;ooze&amp;quot; quality, but it still doesn&amp;#39;t feel cheap. Really good value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I literally just noticed that the &amp;quot;red tint&amp;quot; is actually the underlying red wire in gaps in the sheathing. I had to zoom in on my pic to tell. Not sure how this will effect durability, but given the nature of this headphones and where this wire will live (at my desk), I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be an issue.
