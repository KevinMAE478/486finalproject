The Shures are built like tanks and Campfire Audio has a solid design as well using aluminum for the shells. They aren't heavy at all and it doesn't feel like cold metal is going into your ear. I've read that because of the odd shape some people can't get a good fit but I have no problem with these. They stick a little bit outside of ears. The cable is braided and doesn't feel as sturdy as my Shure cable but I think they'll hold up just fine. \n\nOk heres the exciting part, the sound. Im currently listening to the Novas with my Fiio X1 which has flac, mp3, and m4a. The vocals on Apricot (flac) by Diet Cig sounded absolutely amazing. I could hear when the singer took breaths and her presence was front and center. I tested sub bass with Rice Balls (m4a) by Pink Guy. Its reaches low, sounds very detailed but lacks a strong impact. It doesn't bleed at all into the mid bass and upper ranges. From the New World Symphony No. 9 (flac) really demonstrates the Novas soundstage. I get a sense of positioning for where the instruments are in terms which ones are closer to the front. On the recording for the symphony that I have there is a complaint (from other reviews) that the brass section sounds harsh. With the Novas they are definitely loud but they aren't harsh like they are on my other headphones.  On Killer Queen (mp3) the higher pitched vocals and  cymbals sound detailed and are never sibilant. \n\nIve only been listening for half an hour but so far I am in love with these and would recommend them. \n\nAmping: haven't tried them with my amp yet but they don't need amping. \n\nEdit: After wearing them for an hour straight they are starting to get a little irritating in terms of comfort but not enough to take them off. I think with time my ears will adjust to the shape. The first few sessions with my Shures weren't comfortable either but with time it felt natural to wear them. Also just listened to Kill the King by Megadeth and loved the crunchy guitars. They had a stronger presence than they do on the SE215. \n\nEdit 2: It would seem that the most problematic part of the design comes down to the screw on the bottom that is away from the other 2. It sticks out enough that it can irritate the ear after long wear.
