Mostly just outside your head at most.  Imaging is great and quite accurate when going left/right.  Sound separation is quite good from my listening as well.\n\nI personally don't really get fatigued by the W-shaped sound signature, but I've also had no problems with larger cans like the SHP9500 and Beyer DT 770s either.  The upper mids and highs can sound a bit \"artificial\" at times, but otherwise they are great.  If you put on a song that asks for bass, this IEM can provide a good amount.  Doesn't seem too bloated either which is great because it doesn't muddy up the vocals.\n\nThe stock cable is really rubbery.  If you have the KZ ATR, it's basically the same type of stuff.  Light, flexible, and grippy.  The silver cable is even more flexible, but isn't rubbery which is a big plus.  I measured it and it's 0.3Ohms less resistive than the stock cable.  Not like I heard any sound difference worth noting.  Both has a thin piece of metal that you bend.  A lot of people don't like this, but I don't mind it.\n\nFor my ears, the comfort isn't an all-day listener, but as stated before I've had these in my ears for over 6 hours now.  It's a little bit bulky towards the back of the ear for me and the \"starline\" tips need to be softer or maybe loosen up with break in.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend these pretty easily if you want an over-ear IEM that isn't overly bassy like a lot of chi-fi.  For longer listening sessions I find the KZ ZS3 fits in my ear without creating as many pressure points.  The ZS3 has a bassier profile with less highs which is less fatiguing I suppose.\n\nTo be honest though, I saw a picture online of this IEM/cable combo and was instantly sold.
