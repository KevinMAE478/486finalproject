I need general purpose high-fidelity playback which is accurate but not so analytical that it sounds strange or causes fatigue.

This is why I currently use my CIEMs most often even though they need a re-fit.

I am open to headphones, but I find them bulky at times. I especially value the portability that comes with IEMs. I believe I would enjoy a new pair of CIEMs that have a better fit and isolation (possibly silicon based).\n\n**Preferred tonal balance** - I love a neutral sound with punchy bass. Sparkly highs are great. I do not like veiled mids or highs. Soundstage isn't so important. Good sub-bass extension would be nice but isn't required.

Fantastic treble, cymbals are so clear and crisp. The treble really does amaze me every single time I listen to these. Soundstage is great too, but not as good as Noble X. Bass drum kick feels a little distant and could be punchier. I also believe I have damaged the left earpiece (slightly less volume on left than right). I also believe that due to inexperience, I never got a proper fit. I recently sent them back for an adjustment with no luck.

I really really love the sound. The bass is super punchy and there whenever the song calls on it. BUT, the treble can feel a little *off* to me. Its as if the treble is a little veiled. Especially coming from the JH5. This tends to have me going back to the JH5 when I listen to rock or metal.\n\n*MDR-1000x - *currently own but will likely return* Pretty neutral and comfortable. Cool features, but I think I could find something with better sound quality and isolation if I go back to using IEMs. They're pretty bukly and do very little to isolate high frequency sound. I love the ambient sound feature, though.\n\n*H7 - *currently own; may sell to increase budget to $800* I enjoy these, though there isn't much isolation and bass can be a little much. I like having wireless, but it can be a bit spotty. Also causes me discomfort after about an hour.\n\n*Bose QC35 - Underwhelmed with sound quality. Seemed very V shaped lacking in mids in my opinion. Incredible comfortable though.\n*Miles Davis Tribute - *currently own* I'll probably keep these forever just because they are unique. Pretty bass heavy, but I love the looks as they've gotten older and worn. Super cool even if the sound isn't to my preference. \n \n**Preferred Music** - I listen to everything, but mostly rock, metal, and occasionally edm.

Really enjoy hearing the small/crisp sounds that you miss with a shitty pair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past headphones: I have used my girlfriend&amp;#39;s beats before and I know everyone hates them, but they are a vast improvement on the $15.00 earbuds I use to workout with and use to study (these will remain my workout headphones). I used to own a pair of nose over ear headphones that i really liked, but they fell apart eventually and I never replaced them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred music: all over the spectrum from edm to jam bands and classic rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would you like improved on from previous: I loved my old Bose over ears but I feel like I can get better sound quality for the same price from what I&amp;#39;ve read online. Also, I need a really comfy pair of over ears as I am about to begin studying for the bar exam and my lessons are all online, which means I&amp;#39;ll need headphones that won&amp;#39;t hurt my big ears if worn for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I missed something (already accidentally responded to post rather than created my own), on mobile.

Specially the build quality and comfort. It&amp;#39;s the only headset I&amp;#39;ve had that I can use for several hours without even slight discomfort. \nBut everywhere I look online all I see is people writing about how bad the sound quality is on them and how the 7.1 surround sound is a gimmick. So I plan to use the a50s exclusively for console gaming, and a the new headphone for PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never owned proper headphones before. I&amp;#39;ve only ever owned &amp;quot;Gaming&amp;quot; headsets so this is why my budget is not to high.

It died a few years ago and was out of warrenty by a year or two. Anyway, my only source of analog signal is from my monitor (Acer preditor HB271 or something similar). I was always thinking about getting a separate DAC and Amp, to replace my monitor but never really did the research nor had the time to figure out what I should get so here I post to get your guy's recommendation.\n\nNow I have some K7xx's and some money to burn. I also want to say that my K7xx's while good, don't really sound all that full, and I may enjoy some closed back headphones more (more immersive, fuller bass/sound). Anyway, I would be willing to sell them and use that money plus the amount I put below as pool for an DAC, Amp, and headphones if you guys believe there would be some ones that would fit an DAC and Amp better. In short, add the amount I could get for selling some red K7xx's if you want to also add some headphones into the pool of recommendations if you feel I would like them more then the AKG's I'm using. I am saying the money as a pool as it can be distrubuted however you guys believe would be good (if 400$ headphones is the answer without changing anything else I will take it into consideration). \n\nThe list (and apologizes for the long intro, but it'd be more confusing trying to explain that all here):\n\nBudget - 400 USD, can be flexible by a hundred and a bit more if there is a reason to go farther into this rabbit hole. Add in the amount I could get for my K7xx's and then a bit if you want to add some headphones in your recommendation as well.\n\nSource - Desktop. My motherboards audio died a while ago so only output could be digital audio and USB. I have more desk then I need so a large tube amp or something big won't be an issue. As for the audio player itself is Foobar 2000.\n\nRequirements for Isolation - No requirements as they will be used in my bedroom without much outside noise. I do enjoy the immersive feeling of IEM's so I would probably enjoy some closed back headphones as well. Other then preference no need for any isolation. \n\nPreferred Type of Headphone - Prefer full sized. Weight isn't an issue, just need it to be supported by the top of my head and not with a vice clamp like my previous V-Moda's\n\nPreferred tonal balance - Full backround so a reletively smooth/flat curve, but some boosted mid-highs and bass-mids would be nice (drums and just above vocal range so piano and melody are boosted kinda like an M I guess). I also have no knowledge of what that would really sound like, but just based on what I imagine in my head that's what I believe I would like.\n\nPast headphones - V-moda's, don't remember much as  I didn't use them for long due to the vice grip issue. K7xx's, I like them they sound bright, but just not full. It's that uncanny valley of good but just not enough so you are never quite immersed and really can just sit back and enjoy the music. They are also probably a little too strong on the highs and a bit too bright for my liking. Also would like some more separation of instruments and sound.\n\nPreferred Music - I listen to J-rock (not normal stuff, only really ONE OK ROCK), and [here's an example](https://youtu.be/i9tWFGUIh4c). The drums are a bit too mixed and messy then I would like in a perfect setup (this of course could just be the music not being as punchy as I like but I digress). I also listen to a lot of electronic type of music. Mostly specific songs from compilations by Ninety9Lives. An example that would give a good example of what I like would be [Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdgPuWkUnBA).\n\nWhat would you like to improve on from your set-up - Sound quality mostly as I am tired of using my monitor which has inconsistent noise levels. I would also want to get the most out of my headphones or entirely new pair. I would like to hear the pop in the music again as currently it just sounds dry and decent. So maybe a little bit warmer, and more definition in detail. I can get detail from music, it's just hard to keep focusing on it to try and enjoy it when I should just be able to sit back and zone out while enjoying it. \n\nHope this wasn't too long (I know, I write like I talk for which I talk too much most of the time). I just want to get the best recommendation, but sometimes I add just too much.
