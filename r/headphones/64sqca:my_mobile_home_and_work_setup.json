I'm not an audiophile, but I tested a variety of headphones, from full sized cans to IEMs, from Sennheiser to Panasonic before going with these iSine 20s. \n\nI ended up getting them after trying the LCD-2s at a local headphone store and being absolutely floored by Audeze's quality and their \"house\" sound. I struggled with the idea of spending $1000+ on the LCD-2s and a decent DAC/AMP to drive them and also had worries about the stationary nature of such powerful headphones. My roots are in earbuds and on-ear headphones that run off any device I connect to so I'm definitely more accustomed to listening to my music off a phone in any locale rather than sitting in my dorm, wired to my desktop. \n\nSo, while I was interested in staying portable, at the same time I wanted to upgrade to something more... beefy? The quick and powerful bass of the LCD series really blew me away, so I knew I wanted something in the planar magnetic range but without the significant price tag. The EL-8 series looked/looks interesting, but I was concerned about its portability (even with the Titanium series, which I saw had so-so reviews).\n\nAnd then I saw the new iSine series reviews come in. I took a leap and bought a pair on the basis that it seemed to be the closest thing to a portable open back headphone that I would ever find. The $50 DAC/AMP iPhone connector would be my solution to not having a DAC/AMP and the $550 headphones (barely) fit my budget. The backorder was unfortunate, but I finally got them in the mail last week and have been listening to them ever since.\n\nAmateur Review:\nBoy, do they sound unlike any IEM I've ever tried in the best way possible. I'm definitely not a knowledgable audiophile, but the soundstage and bass response on these is wild for their size. To be fair, I tried the 800S headphones and (obviously) their soundstage is wider... But compare the size of the two! Nothing is muddied in the music I've tried, which is a variety of genres including classical, rock, rap, EDM, and contemporary pop. Instruments and vocals are clear and incredibly separated while the bass rumbles below. These headphones benefit from a well mastered track and have me considering Tidal so that I can take a dive into higher quality music rather than just Spotify Premium at 320 kbps.\n\nSomewhat of an elephant in the room is the semi-open nature of the iSine 20s. At higher volumes they do not distort and fully drown out most of the noise brought in from the outside (not recommended for long periods of time, they can get surprisingly loud). However, these portable headphones do struggle in one of my frequented locations, the subway. While they don't leak nearly as much as some might say, they let in so much sound from outside. It really depends on what you're listening to, but if your music demands a blank soundscape you'll want to go with a more isolating pair of headphones. I sometimes enjoy having some outside color to my music and it definitely helps me stay aware of my surroundings, whether walking on the street or listening for the next stop on the subway.\n\nTheir solid build quality comes with a literal weight that should not be forgotten. The included ear hooks work marvelously but without them you're unable to wear them. I haven't been able to figure out how the included ear locks work, but I believe they might be more comfortable than the ear hooks based on other reviewers I've read. However, the heft of them is due to a stellar build quality that has, so far, survived my travels well.\n\nIn all, these are the perfect upgrade for me as I spend far more time outside of my house than in it. In quiet locations, these blow most other full sized cans I've listened to out of the water, which would be my dorm and my work. For traveling, I may buy more isolating IEMs or even some noise cancelling headphones.\n\nAlso:\nFuck Apple for removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack and thank goodness for Audeze making such an amazing solution to their \"courage.\"\n\nI'm running these off my iPhone 7 Plus with Spotify Premium at 320 kbps (Extreme) streaming.", "edited": 1491940482.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Backstory:\nI&amp;#39;m a long time lurker of &lt;a href=\"/r/headphones\"&gt;/r/headphones&lt;/a&gt; who spent a while looking for a great first pair of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; headphones that fit my needs and my budget. I&amp;#39;m not an audiophile, but I tested a variety of headphones, from full sized cans to IEMs, from Sennheiser to Panasonic before going with these iSine 20s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting them after trying the LCD-2s at a local headphone store and being absolutely floored by Audeze&amp;#39;s quality and their &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; sound. I struggled with the idea of spending $1000+ on the LCD-2s and a decent DAC/AMP to drive them and also had worries about the stationary nature of such powerful headphones. My roots are in earbuds and on-ear headphones that run off any device I connect to so I&amp;#39;m definitely more accustomed to listening to my music off a phone in any locale rather than sitting in my dorm, wired to my desktop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while I was interested in staying portable, at the same time I wanted to upgrade to something more... beefy? The quick and powerful bass of the LCD series really blew me away, so I knew I wanted something in the planar magnetic range but without the significant price tag. The EL-8 series looked/looks interesting, but I was concerned about its portability (even with the Titanium series, which I saw had so-so reviews).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I saw the new iSine series reviews come in. I took a leap and bought a pair on the basis that it seemed to be the closest thing to a portable open back headphone that I would ever find. The $50 DAC/AMP iPhone connector would be my solution to not having a DAC/AMP and the $550 headphones (barely) fit my budget. The backorder was unfortunate, but I finally got them in the mail last week and have been listening to them ever since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amateur Review:\nBoy, do they sound unlike any IEM I&amp;#39;ve ever tried in the best way possible. I&amp;#39;m definitely not a knowledgable audiophile, but the soundstage and bass response on these is wild for their size. To be fair, I tried the 800S headphones and (obviously) their soundstage is wider... But compare the size of the two! Nothing is muddied in the music I&amp;#39;ve tried, which is a variety of genres including classical, rock, rap, EDM, and contemporary pop. Instruments and vocals are clear and incredibly separated while the bass rumbles below.
