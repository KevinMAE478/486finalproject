Ordered directly from veclan's site, ordered with EMS? i think it was shipping, wanted them sooner than others so the shipping cost a bit. Really enjoy these earbuds, fantastic!\n\npictured with my Project Polaris amp, so much power.. bass comes out more, sounds warmer (polaris is a warm tubey sound by nature), fantastic pairing so far! \n\ngrab yourself a pair if you havent already!\n\n2 more pics:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WtWjnSl\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ZHh2vlQ\n", "edited": 1492054499.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally my espresso arrived, 1week about to Texas. well worth the shipping, love the look of these, and the sound! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great soundstage, great imaging, probably best ive heard from earbuds (not that extensive), for 20$ its amazing how they sound.
