Had so much room left in my bag, that i decided to take my audio setup with me.

But when i moved out, i found myself in an apartment with almost no sound dampening in the walls. My neighbours were very kind, and watched some Movies on my Surround system with me, but there is always the one god damn mo**********, who is mad. So i thought i give Headphones a try. It all started with Hyper X Cloud 2s\u2026\nEnglish is not my native language, so excuse some grammar fails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some Impressions (in order of acquisition-date):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AKG K553&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got these through Massdrop half a year ago. These were my first pair of \u201eover 100\u20ac headphones\u201c, so i was excitet to death. When they arrived (damn you eternal international Massdrop shipping!) i got them, plugged them into my home theatre Amp and!.... was disappointed. They sounded hollow, bass-less and not very detailed. But after reading so much in the subreddit about the outputs of budget HT-amps, i tried another source. My phone (Lumia 830) helped me in my despair and gave me some nice detailed sound from Groove Music. But still, not impressed. \nSo the next source i got is my PC. Equipped with (insert marketing bullshit here) a headphone output, i was FINALLY impressed. So many details were in my music now. I can\u00b4t say, that i didn\u00b4t head them with my Hyper X Cloud 2s, but they are much more noticable now. \nMy tablet (Surface 3) has a terrible headphone out like my phone (compared to my PC), with no detail, almost no bass and it was too quiet. So i got myself a\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schiit Fulla 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first dedicated external Dac/Amp combo! It was like night and day compared to ALL my sources. The bass, oh that fu***** bass! The AKGs are bass-light, but amped right, they begin to shine. Everything was clear and i could head the quiet songs at a reasonable volume now. \nThe Schiit is an awesome device, but the\n&lt;strong&gt;Quality Control Issues&lt;/strong&gt; \nWere so huge, i just had to make them their own section in this review.\nAt first there was only a slight channel inbalance at around 8 o\u00b4clock. They developed into some real imbalances at 9, with cracking when changing the volume. I didn\u00b4t had time to send them back to Schiit, but i will definately do this\u2026\nBut all in all this is a great device for the price, when you get a properly working unit\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philips Fidelio X1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After loving my AKG\u00b4s for some time, and reading about the benefits of open headphones, i got myself the Philips Fidelio X1s. These were the only ones at this price range (i got them for 140\u20ac 1 week used with almost 2 years of warranty) which does\u00b4t have some fatal flaws. I looked for ATH AD700X, SHP 9500 (costing around 110\u20ac in germany), used HD 600 (were in the 250\u20ac price range) and some other cans. \nSo what can i say about the X1s? They are amazing!... when you get used to them. Coming from the direct, in your face sound of my AKGs, I got surprised with spacial, bass heavy and warm sounds. Not a bad thing, but i had to get used to it. They are a beautiful (literraly, i mean LOOK AT THIS GEORGEOUS HEADBAND) sidegrade to my AKGs. They are diffrent enough to justify not to give them away. But the detail is a biiiiiit lacking compared to my AKGs, but this is the price of soundstage, i guess. Speaking of the Soundstage, it it definately bigger than the one on my AKGs (surprise surprise!), but not as big as i expected after reading some reviews, which is not a bad thing. The seperation is excelent and on par with the AKGs. Yosi Horikawa\u00b4s \u201eLetter\u201c is a pleasure to listen to. \nMy girlfriend btw is also impressed with both headphones, but the standard sentence \u201eWhy do you need TWO headphones?\u201c fell very quickly\u2026\nWhat leads me to my last device. The\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective 2 Headphone Amplifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to try out some DIY-work, so i got a kit from Head\u00b4n\u00b4Hifi in switzerland for around 70\u20ac (including the Desktop kit with the chinch inputs/outputs and power plug at the back, and the 6,3mm output) and soldered it together. It was my first DIY project and second soldering job and it turned out pretty good! Appling the desktop kit was a bit tricky, but Head\u00b4n\u00b4Hifi has a great step by step instruction onine. So for 70\u20ac i got the legendary o2 amp, which is praised all over the internet and it is\u2026 the gratest little thing i had the chance to hold in my hands\u2026\nSo mayby there are some father-feelings for my DIY Amp, which i put together in two nights, but i love this thing. The sound through my AKGs is even better with more power out of the o2. The bass is tighter and the highs are less siblant, than on my Fulla. Normaly i listen to 9-11 o\u00b4clock at low gain (thank god for my highly efficient headphones), but sometimes i need to go to 12 or 1 o\u00b4clock when i really get into my music. So &amp;quot;Whole lotta love&amp;quot; will be my hearings nemesis in some years. I have to be careful with my ears with this thing\u2026\nThe volume pot is dead quiet and channel inbalance only occures at the lowest volumes, so nothing to complain about. When no music is playing the Amp is also dead quiet, like it should be (I\u00b4m looking at you, Xbox One Controller headphone out). The Fidelios don\u00b4t really need an amp, they sound great on my Phone\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here it is, the review of my gear, which is hopefully expanding soon. I just have to settle on an Upgrade. I\u00b4m looking for some good deals for the HD 6x0, tending to the 650\u00b4s but thats not decided\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this far, if you did.
