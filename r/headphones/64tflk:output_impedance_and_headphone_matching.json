If you haven&amp;#39;t encountered Ohm&amp;#39;s Law, here&amp;#39;s the twigs and berries:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Voltage = Current * Resistance\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, that&amp;#39;s basically it. You can also move junk around algebraically if you want. Voltage is the charge disparity between two points (e.g. a positive charge and a negative charge or a positive charge and &amp;#39;ground&amp;#39;). The music we listen to from an electronic device is also a type of voltage (but it is AC, not DC). A current is a flow of electric charge (like electrons moving around in a circuit) and it flows between charge disparities. A resistance is something that impedes this flow of current.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When resistors are in series (connected end to end), they share the same current. That is to say that the current through one must also pass through the others in the chain. &lt;a href=\"https://wtfamps.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/batteries.png\"&gt;See professional diagram here.&lt;/a&gt; The total current through a series resistance is calculated as input volts (between one end of the resistor chain and the other end) divided by the total resistance. The voltage across each individual resistor is calculated as the current in the circuit multiplied by the resistance of the respective resistor. So if one resistor is a much larger value than the other, it will have a larger portion of the supply volts across it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wtfamps.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/io-z.png\"&gt;Consider this diagram.&lt;/a&gt; If we only measure the voltage across R2, we will see:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ V(source) / (R1 + R2) ] * R2\n\nor rearranged as V(source) * R2 / (R1 + R2)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we want to see as much of the source voltage as possible across R2, we need to either maximize R2\u2019s value or minimize the value of R1. That&amp;#39;s because the same current must flow through both Rs and the voltage developed across them is proportional to their relative value. Now here comes the impedance bangers and mash.

Absorb that into your think meats for a moment. Now replace R1 with the output impedance of your amp and R2 with the impedance of your headphones. Higher headphone impedance (R2) or lower output impedance (R1) means a larger portion of the source voltage is developed across the headphones. Better voltage transfer generally means the amp doesn&amp;#39;t work as hard to achieve the same sound level. If the amp doesn&amp;#39;t work as hard, it will probably have less distortion and better dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you now successfully understand the basics of a most mysterious audio topic: impedance matching and signal transfer. It&amp;#39;s often said that low impedance headphones are current limited whereas high impedance headphones are voltage limited. This is kind of true (if you think about it in terms of AC current); but it&amp;#39;s probably much more useful to consider the output and headphone impedance in your rig as a voltage divider and how this affects the voltage that the amp can transfer to the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is one more piece to the puzzle and that&amp;#39;s power. AC power is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Watts = Volts^2 / Impedance\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This goes some way to explaining why high impedance headphones work well with tube amps (which typically operate at high supply voltage levels). Even though tubes tend to have high output impedance, the larger output voltages they are able to create mean more voltage developed across the headphone load (even if the impedance ratio isn&amp;#39;t ideal).

Let&amp;#39;s say we want a high damping factor and so we go with headphones of 1,500 ohm impedance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voltage transferred will be 8 * 1500 / (1500 + 120) or about 7.4V. The power will be 7.4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 1,500 or about 35mW. That&amp;#39;s not very much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we relax the damping factor requirement, we can use 250 ohm headphones.  We would be able to transfer about 8* 250 / (250 + 120) or 5.4V, which would allow for 5.4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 250 or 110 mW of power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens if we plug 32 ohm headphones in?  We can transfer 8 * 32 / (32 + 120) or 1.7V. This would allow for about 85mW of power, less than the slightly higher impedance 250 ohm cans, but more than the super high impedance 1500 ohm cans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, this would also make an amp with a 120 ohm output impedance rather unhappy (and it probably couldn&amp;#39;t actually put out 8V into the load), but that&amp;#39;s an amp design topic rather than simple impedance matching/bridging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of things in audio, there are always trade offs. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "headphones", "name": "t1_dg4z4g9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975771.0, "created_utc": 1491946971.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tflk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5054p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "beowulfpt", "parent_id": "t1_dg4xtss", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/headphones", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No. The CA Andromeda will show this very painfully by losing the bass and becoming too bright.
