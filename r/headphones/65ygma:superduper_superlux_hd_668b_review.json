It even stays true to the power of an electric bass and the warmth of a stand up bass. My favorite moment with them, was finally getting to really HEAR the bass line in Metallica's The Shortest Straw, in addition to some intimate fret action added into one of my favorite bass solo's. Synth Sub bass lines are the only draw back to the HD668B bass presentation in my opinion. I enjoy the extra speed and hardness that the HD668B has to it's bass response.\n\nThe mids are very dry, however out of my HM 601 I found a wonderful timbre to many brass wood winds. Trumpets, the sax and even flutes all had a very life like presentation, trumpets maintained a metallic edge without sounding tinny. The Alto and Tenure Sax both had excellent body and bite. The bright presentation of the HD668B also presented the quick breath taken in-between each note. It is problematic with stringed instruments. Heavy Metal riffs had a nice crunch, but not real bite to them. Acoustic guitars, while having great timbre in the lower notes, had a very uneven sound overall and the same can be said for almost all stringed instruments. The harmonics of many of those instruments were lost in the overall presentation of the HD 668B.\n\nTop end clarity is another pleasurable quality of the HD 668B, high hats, cymbals and the brightest guitar solos all have a wonderful sense of clarity and air. While some may find the treble to be too hot, or too bright, I really do like the shimmer that the HD668B brings, really makes you feel like you're walking on air.\n\nSound stage presentation is very wide, but lacks some depth. Left, right and center separation are excellent and though it lacks depth, the Superlux HD 668B holds you more or less equidistant from each instrument. On tracks with a very strong sense of depth it is audible, but it is by no means top of the line.\n\nIt's lack of depth is often overshadowed by it's amazing mirco detail or transparency, it's a headphone that will certainly add a sense of atmosphere and ambiance to your music. An let you really hear EVERYTHING.  With the Superlux HD668B the devil, is certainly in the details! Good or bad, the Superlux HD 668B brings detail, if it's captured, chances are you'll hear it. This is also true of the equipment that you pair the HD 668B to, my HM 601s warmth helped to improve the tone of the HD668B, it softened a very stiff bass, and helped balance out the low to central mids.\n\n[I've got many more pics here, along with some comments on the build and packaging.
