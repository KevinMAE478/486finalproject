For the computer I currently use Siberia 800, but before that my trusted companion for a long time was Siberia 2.\n\nPreferred Music: I listen to a lot of different types of music, hip-hop, daft punk, pop, rock (Queen!), Metallica, Frozen soundtrack today=)\n\nWireless is a huge plus but not 100% necessary\n\nMore than anything I want my new pair of headphones to be comfortable and have good isolation from my surroundings. As I said, I tried out the QC35 and PXC 550 and was thoroughly impressed by both, price difference wasn't that big in **Sweden** where I live.\n\nI was recommended by one guy at my local electronics store that the Sennheiser 4.50 HD BTNC was really good for the money but I never got an opportunity to try them out.\n\nI wear glasses and thus comfort becomes extra important, sound is obviously also important and to a lesser degree design. If I could find a pair of headphones for under 300$ I would be happy, but I might end up getting the QC35 or PXC 550 if I can't find a decent alternative.\n\nHelp me r/headphones, you're my only hope!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, mic quality would be good extra info, I'm worried that the QC25 mic is not good enough to take calls with while on the move compared to the QC35 and PXC 550", "edited": 1492102975.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=\"/r/headphones\"&gt;r/headphones&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;#39;m looking to invest in a new pair of headphones that I can use while commuting, at home and pretty much carry with me 24/7. I&amp;#39;ve been researching a lot online and I&amp;#39;ve been to stores and tried out the QC35 Bose, QC25, and Sennheiser PXC 550, and while I liked all 3 of them, the QC35 and PXC 550 were definitely better. Price on those are pretty steep for me, but I might end up getting one of the two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Budget: 400$&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: Galaxy S7, computer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isolation: A must&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public: Yes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred: Over-ear&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred Tonal Balance: I like to hear the bass, but I don&amp;#39;t have a particular preference aside from that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past Headphones: lots of in-ears, Sennheiser CX 300 II was my latest pair that just gave up. For the computer I currently use Siberia 800, but before that my trusted companion for a long time was Siberia 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred Music: I listen to a lot of different types of music, hip-hop, daft punk, pop, rock (Queen!), Metallica, Frozen soundtrack today=)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wireless is a huge plus but not 100% necessary&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than anything I want my new pair of headphones to be comfortable and have good isolation from my surroundings. As I said, I tried out the QC35 and PXC 550 and was thoroughly impressed by both, price difference wasn&amp;#39;t that big in &lt;strong&gt;Sweden&lt;/strong&gt; where I live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was recommended by one guy at my local electronics store that the Sennheiser 4.50 HD BTNC was really good for the money but I never got an opportunity to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wear glasses and thus comfort becomes extra important, sound is obviously also important and to a lesser degree design. If I could find a pair of headphones for under 300$ I would be happy, but I might end up getting the QC35 or PXC 550 if I can&amp;#39;t find a decent alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Help me &lt;a href=\"/r/headphones\"&gt;r/headphones&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;re my only hope!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Forgot to mention, mic quality would be good extra info, I&amp;#39;m worried that the QC25 mic is not good enough to take calls with while on the move compared to the QC35 and PXC 550&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "headphones", "name": "t1_dg7udse", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492131400.0, "created_utc": 1492102600.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654sx1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654sx1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654sx1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7zalm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "saifly", "parent_id": "t1_dg7t8yf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/headphones", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think I'd go with the QC35s out of those two, simply because I tried the touch functionality on the MDR1000x and it seemed gimmicky to me.\n\nBut are there any cheaper options than those two.
