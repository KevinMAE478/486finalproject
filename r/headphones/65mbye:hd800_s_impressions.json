They were going to let me try the headphones with the HDVD800, but they had sold it a few days ago apparently. Nevertheless, the NAIM setup, while not the best for driving the 800 S were still enough for me to get a reasonable idea of the sound they can produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort: I had heard people say the 800 was a comfortable set of headphones, but I really wasn&amp;#39;t expecting them to be that comfortable, especially as a glasses wearer. While they didn&amp;#39;t totally disappear from my head, they really were uncannily comfortable, feeling like just a very light touch on either side of my head, and very light on the top of my head. the huge earcups did extend into my peripheral vision though, which was strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Build: I didn&amp;#39;t expect plastic headphones to feel so solid and durable, but these really are an amazing piece of design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound: I went in having read several reviews and opinions of the HD800 S which said that despite the changes from the original HD800 these were still quite bright and fatiguing, but honestly that wasn&amp;#39;t my experience. Having come from using the very warm, slow Sony MDR Z7 and the RHA MA750i which i was using while I walked to the store, I expected to be underwhelmed by the bass quantity of the sennheisers, but playing tracks by The Weeknd and various electronic music, as well as various rock music, I found the bass to be almost perfect in quantity and impact, when it was called for, yet never overbearing, and also remaining fast and clear, adn was frankly a delight. Mids were also very enjoyable, both for vocals (male and female) and for instruments, especially in acoustic and jazz music. Treble, the aspect I was truly unsure about, was again, very enjoyable. Despite some very slight fatigue for the first 5-10 minutes of listening,  once my ears had adapted from the sound of my IEMs to the HD800 S, the treble wasn&amp;#39;t bothersome at all, and presented music very clearly and really brought out details. The soundstage wasn&amp;#39;t quite as mindblowing as I was expecting based on other people&amp;#39;s reviews, but was still very wide and deep, unlike any other headphones I have heard, but not the room sized image some people present the HD800 as having, though maybe that&amp;#39;s a difference between the 800 and 800S, idk. The only other thing I can really think to comment on is the isolation, or lack thereof; when the door to the listening room was open, I could hear everything going on in the store, these things really are super open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Genre Matching: A lot of reviews of the original HD800 will say they only work for a very few genres, mostly classical or jazz. Either the 800 S dramatically changes this, or these claims are unrealistic, and the 800 series is pretty capable with many genres.
