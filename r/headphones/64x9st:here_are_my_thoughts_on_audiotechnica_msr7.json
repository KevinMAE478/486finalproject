As I mentioned above I have never had an audiophile grade headphone before and I wanted to purchase my first pair for a very long time. About 2 months ago I finally started doing research about it everywhere, I read pretty much every forum, watched all of those popular headphone reviewers on youtube like Zeos, Metal571, lachlan and Innerfidelity and so on. As a result of my research I decided on these headphones : DT770 Pro 80ohms, MDR1-A, M50x, M40x or MSR7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found 2 local shops in which I could try m50x, msr7, dt770 and some other headphones so I tried them all. Sadly my laptop was not really enough to drive DT770 80ohms, even at the max level the volume was not &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot;. I liked how incredibly comfortable those headphones were, and the bass was also strong and deep. However I wasn&amp;#39;t really impressed by the overall sound signature, probably because I didnt have a setup that could get the most out of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I went on to try m50x and msr7 on some other shop. My expectations were : m50x with too much bass, and msr7 with like no bass at all, because according to some people m50x has an emphasis on bass while msr7 being more &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; and so on. However that wasn&amp;#39;t really the case, I couldn&amp;#39;t really hear a big difference in terms of bass performance between msr7 and m50x, in fact the bass on msr7 felt more deep and tight. So as I mentioned I am not an audiophile, but the only difference between m50x and msr7 in terms of sound signature was that, m50x has a bit more emphasis on the highs, like you can hear the drum bells louder on m50x, on msr7 it feels more natural, and I guess that&amp;#39;s why people say m50x is &amp;quot;v-shaped&amp;quot;. But I believe for longer listening sessions msr7 is a better option because even with msr7 sometimes highs on some songs are more than enough, so I guess m50x could be disturbing after some point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was expecting a poor bass performance from msr7 as people say that they are a &amp;quot;bright and neutral&amp;quot; pair, however I was still quite impressed by the amount of bass these headphones had. I listen to genres like death metal, thrash metal, funk, acid jazz and just a bit of rap &amp;amp; hip hop and the amount of bass these headphones have feels perfect for all of these genres. It feels &amp;quot;just right&amp;quot;, not too much or not to weak. Even depending on the song it can be quite deep and tight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to talk a bit about the build quality and the comfort aswell. The build quality feels fantastic compared to any other premium level headphones that I&amp;#39;ve tried before. Compared to headphones like DT770, M50x, Bose QC 25/35 and some Beats and JBL models, msr7 is the one that feels most premium and high quality. Even headphones like Bose QC35, which are supposed to be more premium and comfortable, doesn&amp;#39;t feel as high quality as msr7. The ear pads, the cables and the overall build quality definitely feels like it&amp;#39;s sturdy and high quality. The comfort is not the best, because DT770 and Bose QC35 are definitely more comfortable compared to msr7. However this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that msr7 is uncomfortable and bad for long listening sessions. Out of the box for the first couple of days the headband felt a bit too tight for me and it even hurted my head a bit. However it feels just fine and comfortable now, I guess it gets more loose and comfortable as you use it. The ear pads are super soft and deep, have no complaints about that part. I had listening sessions that lasted more than an hour as well as some gaming and movie sessions and didnt feel any discomfort whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The accessories that are included are really good for me. Having 3 options for cable is really nice. The carrying bag is really handy for me as I bring my headphones out almost everyday and it just feels great to have a nice carrying bag. The sound isolation feels good enough, the ear pads block out quite a bit of noise so it&amp;#39;s also good for listening outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are easy to drive, even at my iphone I can&amp;#39;t max out the volume because it gets a bit too much. At my laptop 50% volume is the most I&amp;#39;ve used so far, because more would be disturbing and harmful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I would like to ask a question. How much of a difference would it make if I bought an amp/dac combo like Fiio e10k right now, in terms of sound quality? Would it make a huge difference?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s already been a long post, so I would like to stop here.
