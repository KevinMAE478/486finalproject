Hard limit of $800 (this is if I sell my H7).\n\n**Source** - Pioneer XDP-100R\n\n**Requirements for Isolation** - Highest isolation is important to me, but I like to quickly remove my headphones. This is why I currently use my CIEMs most often even though they need a re-fit. Or, I elect to use the H7 despite less isolation for quick removal.\n\n**Preferred Type of Headphone** - I prefer IEMs, but comfort (or ability to get used to them after a few weeks) is very important. I am open to headphones, but I find them bulky at times. I especially value the portability that comes with IEMs. I believe I would enjoy a new pair of CIEMs that have a better fit and isolation (possibly silicon based).\n\n**Preferred tonal balance** - I love a neutral sound with punchy bass. Sparkly highs are great. I do not like veiled mids or highs. Soundstage isn't so important. Good sub-bass extension would be nice but isn't required. I like an analytical sound so that I can listen for details I have never heard in my music.\n\n**Past headphones** - \n\n*JH5 - *currently own* The only CIEM I have had. I love the sound. Fantastic treble, cymbals are so clear and crisp. The treble really does amaze me every single time I listen to these. Soundstage is great too, but not as good as Noble X. Bass drum kick feels a little distant and could be punchier. I also believe I have damaged the left earpiece (slightly less volume on left than right). I also believe that due to inexperience, I never got a proper fit. I recently sent them back for an adjustment with no luck. I am contemplating a reshell, but it may be a better decision to get something new (since the cost is $200).\n\n*Noble X* - *currently own* I bought these from Massdrop just so that I could try a Noble product. I really really love the sound. The bass is super punchy and there whenever the song calls on it. BUT, the treble can feel a little *off* to me. Its as if the treble is a little veiled. Especially coming from the JH5. This tends to have me going back to the JH5 when I listen to rock or metal.\n\n*MDR-1000x - *currently own but will likely return* Pretty neutral and comfortable. Cool features, but I think I could find something with better sound quality and isolation if I go back to using IEMs. They're pretty bukly and do very little to isolate high frequency sound. I love the ambient sound feature, though.\n\n*H7 - *currently own; may sell to increase budget to $800* I enjoy these, though there isn't much isolation and bass can be a little much. I like having wireless, but it can be a bit spotty. Also causes me discomfort after about an hour.\n\n*Bose QC35 - Underwhelmed with sound quality. Seemed very V shaped lacking in mids in my opinion. Incredible comfortable though.\n*Miles Davis Tribute - *currently own* I'll probably keep these forever just because they are unique. Pretty bass heavy, but I love the looks as they've gotten older and worn. Super cool even if the sound isn't to my preference. \n \n**Preferred Music** - I listen to everything, but mostly rock, metal, and occasionally edm. Some examples are Avenged Sevenfold, Volbeat, Amarante, Coheed and Cambria, In This Moment, Tool, A Perfect Circle, etc. I don't have any specific edm artists in mind.\n\n**What would you like to improve on from your set-up** - I am looking for sparkle, punchy bass, with an overall neutral sound. Comfort and isolation are extremely important. \n\n*Should I be looking at other CIEMs? Should they be acrylic or silicon? Would silicon alleviate the fit issues that I seem to keep having? \n\n*A refit from Inearz has been recommended for the JH5. Any opinions on this? Should I just fork over the $200 for a refit from JHA?\n\n*Etymotics have been recommended to me? Should I get them and a custom sleeve for better resale?\n\n*Are there any standard IEMs that are a mashup of the Noble X and JH5 with more detail and punchy bass? Are they comfortable and provide amazing isolation? Cable noise does bother me, so the less the better. \n\nI have the 'itch' for something new, but it could be that I'm looking for a unicorn in this price range.

No\nPreferred Type Leaning towards over ears.\n\nI have the Philips SPH9500 headphones which were recommended on here to me and so far I do not regret the decision. However my needs and wants have changed.\n\n1. I need closed back headphones. Other people around aren't taking to kindly to me gaming and hearing everything going on. I know I have been told open back are the best for gaming, but I need some headphones that will do the job in situations where open back is not practical.\n\n2. I use my SPH9500 with a Creative Sound Blaster SB1095. My issue is in game people say they can hear stuff that I can't seem to hear. I have fiddled with my settings in game and with the sound card drivers. I modified a lot here and there but I feel something is holding me back, either the headphones or the sound card.\n\nThe game in particular is Rainbow Six Siege. It seems some people can hear things across the map where I can only hear things close up. I'm looking for a next level up headphone and also I want to get a better sound card. I hear some people say a DAC is better over a USB Sound card. I would get an internal card, but I don't have any slots left.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.

Love the bass. However, the mids/highs are muffle and it has really bad imaging. Also the build quality is not good it broke after 1 drop. SHP9500. Wonderful build quality, comfort, sound clarity, imaging, and durability. But the bass is lacking and it\u2019s open back.
