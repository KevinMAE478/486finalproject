I learned three surprising things: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)  $4k headphones are a waste of money unless you already have everything else you could possibly want and have so much money that you just can\u2019t be bothered with choices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  The difference between $1000 headphones like LCD-2s and Elears and headphones upwards of $1600, or even $4000, isn\u2019t nearly as profound as the difference between the DAC in the Jotunheim and even mid-fi dedicated units. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)  Instead of upgrading my LCD-2s to something else, I may upgrade my upstream. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Okay, I&amp;#39;ll come up with some kind of comparison between my NFB-11 and Jotunheim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I had the opportunity to listen to a variety of high-end headphones under three different DAC/AMP conditions and my results were surprising. First, a bit about me. While I&amp;#39;m a committed enthusiast, I&amp;#39;m not an expert (so if I use jargon for describing sounds wrong don&amp;#39;t skewer me). I currently use Audeze LCD-2s off of a Jotunheim DAC/amp combo. While I love the warm and smooth, liquid musicality of my LCD-2s, I have the following two problems and am seeking an upgrade: a)    Some instruments, especially strings, are not forward enough for me. b) To bring those instruments forward, I have to increase the volume and the bass becomes a bit too overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried Sennheiser HD800S, Focal Elear, LCD-3, LCD-X, LCD-4, HiFiman HE-1000, and Focal Utopia. I also got to listen to these over a Jotunheim, a Jotunheim with a portable, stand-alone DAC in the $300 range (I don\u2019t remember what it was) and a $2500 Naim DAC-V1. I was mainly alternating between 4 different albums, including a best of Metallica album, a Bach cello concerto, DeadMau5, and Norah Jones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While all of these headphones offered a better\u2014or at least different\u2014sound signature, NOTHING made as big of a difference as DAC/Amp, or even just the DAC. This was very surprising for me because I was of the opinion that a DAC is a DAC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like night and day, bros. Even the Jotunheim with the external DAC made a huge difference that was immediately noticeable. And I mean IMMEDIATE\u2014not like listening for 10 minutes and being like \u201cOh, I think I hear a slight decrease in blah, blah, blah audiophile non-sense\u201d. Like it was BAM UP IN MY FACE. \nSwitching to the Naim DAC-V1\u2014which was fantastic btw\u2014I can report the following experiences with the above headphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audeze LCD-2 (my baseline):&lt;/strong&gt; While I still felt they were a bit too muted in some instruments, they sounded much better. I feel like I was getting to know them in a much more authentic way. They were still liquidy and beautiful, but somehow lacking in the presence and forwardness of instruments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audeze LCD-3:&lt;/strong&gt; Since I still love my LCD-2s, the 3s were the natural thing to try. Like many have said, the LCD-3s are basically like the LCD-2s but better in every way. I found this to be true. The mids and highs were definitely more present. They just sounded better the LCD-2s, but essentially similar in sound signature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audeze LCD-X:&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly, these were my favorites. I wasn\u2019t expecting to like these more than the 3s for some unknown reason (probably some kind of irrational bias that I think low-impedance headphones can\u2019t be good). But I was immediately blown away listening to the Bach cello concerto, and I\u2019m not really even into classical music. Like tear inducing strings. These cans still have the \u201cAudeze sound\u201d, but they are definitely very different than the rest of the LCD line. Very balanced but still so musical and enjoyable. They sounded fabulous with everything, but seriously.. those strings I could feel them in my soul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sennheiser HD800S:&lt;/strong&gt; I get it. I can see why some people love these things, though I am now confident that they aren\u2019t for me. They\u2019re so damn detailed and transparent. You hear every little thing. However, listening to the same concerto, I was already beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable after only 30 seconds or so\u2014not in terms of fitment, but like an acute ache in my head. Maybe the brightness? They are piercing somehow. They are so damn analytical.. I mean, if I wanted to sit around and analyze music I\u2019d want these, but I can\u2019t think of any time when I would choose them if I wanted to enjoy music. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014they\u2019re great headphones and I wouldn\u2019t kick them out of bed if someone gave them to me, but I have no interest in purchasing them against these other options. Lots of soundstage but like so what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focal Elear:&lt;/strong&gt; These are beautiful headphones but like the LCD-2s they are flawed, and in the opposite way. They\u2019re like the anti-LCDs. Whereas I feel like the LCD-2s just kind of mute much of the high end (albeit in a tasteful and smooth way), the low-end on these things just seemed wrong\u2014it was there but it sounded distorted like it was trying too hard in order to make it. The bass is rolled off, but somehow unevenly and clumsily. They\u2019re very lively and musical, but something is missing and conspicuously so. Maybe it\u2019s the mid-bass, I don\u2019t know. When the low-end isn\u2019t needed, they were liquid and lively. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was also very excited that I got to try some \u201csummit-fi\u201d headphones priced upwards of $3k. Let me first say that I was very gratified to have come away with the impression that there isn\u2019t much higher to go past the $2k mark. None of these gave me the \u201cwow\u201d I was expecting for the price. Were they all excellent headphones and \u201cbetter\u201d than the rest? I suppose. But the difference was very \u201cmeh\u201d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HiFiman HE-1000:&lt;/strong&gt; I don\u2019t know what I can really say about these. They were comfortable, attractive, and functionally flawless. I also have no desire to hear them again. They did everything well while still managing to be kind of boring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audeze LCD-4:&lt;/strong&gt; They\u2019re lighter and more comfortable than the LCD-3s, but this is probably only due to the carbon fiber headband, which you can buy and install on any other LCD can. Were they better than the LCD-3s? I suppose. Whereas the LCD-3 had a distinct sound\u2014perhaps due to some sacrifice or design choice by Audeze\u2014the LCD-4s didn\u2019t seem to. They were buttery like all the LCDs, balanced and more interesting than the HiFimans, but still I was totally underwhelmed for headphone that costs $4k. Total meh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focal Utopia:&lt;/strong&gt; I can see why people say these are the best headphones in the world, or at least the best dynamics. Whereas the Elear were flawed, these aren\u2019t. Everything is there and perfect. I heard well-reproduced low bass tones that were so damn clean and tight, while at the same time the highs and mids were all there and perfect, too. The dynamic range was astonishing. The imaging was flawless---listening to some wizzy noises in Deadmau5 moving left and right there as an accuracy and clarity that made it all somehow holographic, like a real thing was going on. I think the Utopias actually gave me a good sense of what $4k headphones sound like. Still, I was very disappointed. Are they the best dynamic headphones in the world? Yes. BUT are they THAT much better than headphones costing half the price? No way. Honestly, I think I still liked the LCD-X better. While not perfect, I just enjoyed them more. And considering that for the difference in price I could also get the $2500 Naim DAC-V1, this just isn\u2019t a difficult decision. I felt very gratified knowing that I will never have to spend $4000 dollars on headphones and can be totally okay with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** I tried a bunch of high-end stuff.

I too was blown away when I got my Modi Multibit, but later on I noticed that I was turning the volume down a bit because things were a bit louder than I was used to. Having noticed this, I dug the cable that I used to connect my onboard to my Magni and did a comparison. As expected, the DAC was louder, and here is the part that surprised me: after volume matching by ear, any major differences went away. \n\nAnother point of contention - one upon which I cannot give any personal experience so take the following with that in mind - is that different DACs, even ones that use the same actual converter like the ES9038 or AKM4490, can have different implementations that can make them sound different. This brings up the question of \"is different necessarily better?\" For example, Schiit really harps about their multibit thing, about how it is different and supposedly revolutionary, but I have never actually seen any evidence of this that cannot be attributed to psychology rather than sound quality. I cannot help but wonder if actually using the full 16 bits matters, given that even audiophiles have sung the praises of delta-sigma DACs,  [neither Tyll nor Bob Katz could tell between the Yggrasil and some ridiculous D-S DAC](http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/big-sound-2015-biting-bullet-bob-katz), and that we have ostensibly been fine with delta-sigma for quite a while without any serious \"something is missing\" issues. Even the anal-psychotic that runs [Noaudiophile.com](http://noaudiophile.com/Selah_Mejor/) does not use any kind of fancy DAC in his setup.\n\nTo conclude, I am not saying that DACs do not make a difference. I am saying that I did not notice any differences jumping out after I had crudely volume matched, and that I have not seen any serious evidence that anyone can tell the difference blindly. I am not even saying that conclusive evidence from a meticulously-designed double-blind experiment does not exist, just that *I* have not seen it. If anyone has, let me know.

As expected, the DAC was louder, and here is the part that surprised me: after volume matching by ear, any major differences went away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another point of contention - one upon which I cannot give any personal experience so take the following with that in mind - is that different DACs, even ones that use the same actual converter like the ES9038 or AKM4490, can have different implementations that can make them sound different. This brings up the question of &amp;quot;is different necessarily better?&amp;quot; For example, Schiit really harps about their multibit thing, about how it is different and supposedly revolutionary, but I have never actually seen any evidence of this that cannot be attributed to psychology rather than sound quality. I cannot help but wonder if actually using the full 16 bits matters, given that even audiophiles have sung the praises of delta-sigma DACs,  &lt;a href=\"http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/big-sound-2015-biting-bullet-bob-katz\"&gt;neither Tyll nor Bob Katz could tell between the Yggrasil and some ridiculous D-S DAC&lt;/a&gt;, and that we have ostensibly been fine with delta-sigma for quite a while without any serious &amp;quot;something is missing&amp;quot; issues. Even the anal-psychotic that runs &lt;a href=\"http://noaudiophile.com/Selah_Mejor/\"&gt;Noaudiophile.com&lt;/a&gt; does not use any kind of fancy DAC in his setup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I am not saying that DACs do not make a difference. I am saying that I did not notice any differences jumping out after I had crudely volume matched, and that I have not seen any serious evidence that anyone can tell the difference blindly. I am not even saying that conclusive evidence from a meticulously-designed double-blind experiment does not exist, just that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have not seen it. If anyone has, let me know. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "headphones", "name": "t1_dgeir05", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492509936.0, "created_utc": 1492481136.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65z8cf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65z8cf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65z8cf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgerjds", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "florinandrei", "parent_id": "t1_dgeip14", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/headphones", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As someone who was designing everything from automation to audio (low and high power) to radiofrequency to logic gates to systems with microprocessors, back in college, and almost went on to have a career in the electronics industry (but the Internet gold rush intervened) - all I can say is: if in 2017 a DAC still sucks (i.e. it's not perfect, because any audio domain DAC these days that has any flaw whatsoever is trash can material) after spending $300, then this world has gone to hell already.\n\nI'm not saying you didn't hear what you did hear.
