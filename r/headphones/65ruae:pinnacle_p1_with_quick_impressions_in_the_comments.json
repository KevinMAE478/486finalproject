So after some deliberation on what to pick up for nighttime listening, something with minimal sound bleed as not to disturb  others in my home, I decided on a set of IEM'S  Yesterday I saw the Pinnacle P1's on sale for 189$ CAD locally so I decided to give them a whirl after reading some positive reviews. First off the presentation is crazy for IEM'S, nice box with a butterfly opening with a magnet, looks and feels like you are buying a premium product. Includes 2 really nice cables, leather carrying case and 12 tips, 3 sets of which are Comply Foam. The IEM themselves have a really nice weight and feel to them, really smooth and they sit perfectly in my ear with the dual flange tips, like a missing puzzle piece from my skull haha This is my first experience with a decent set of IEMs so forgive me if some things I describe seem different from others. Right off the bat the sound is awesome, you can tell right away premium sound is being delivered into your ears. Everything across the frequency spectrum is full, and full of detail. There seems to be quite a bit of soundstage and they seem really fast as the imaging is super clear. I listen to fairly busy music with live drums and big electronic synths and fx, but was able to pin point each sound I was hearing. I powered them with my FiiO a3, and was suprised by how much power these can handle. At 50 or 55 ohms impedence I forget but I was between 6 and 7 on high gain on the Fiio for the best quality of sound without being too loud for me so I would be weary trying to power them straight off a mobile device or straight out of a motherboard. All and all, very happy with this, not really sure what competes with them in their price range but I can't imagine for less than 200$ CAD you will find better sound. I now know what people are saying when they describe the Nighthawks as warm and dark, as these sound not bright, but far more neutral than either the Nighthawk or SHP 9500 I come from.
