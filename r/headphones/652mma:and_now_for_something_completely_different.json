Open, large diaphragm iems. Unfortunately there are only two I know about. Fortunately, they're both killer headphones.\n\nI've had the i20 like 2-3ish months now and I've posted my initial impressions as well as followups in other i20 threads so I'll just recap here. Fast, low distortion drivers with a laid back presentation out of the analog cable. Big, thick(but controlled) bass, lots of midrange warmth, and a rolled off but highly detailed treble. The cipher cable cuts the midrange like 3db and boost 4k by 6db turning them into aggressive and tiring, but fun little detail monsters. \n\nI love them, but I wanted *more*. I had a growing interest in electrostats and came across the not very much talked about SR-002, aka SR-003, aka Baby Stax.\n\nThey're stupid. The i20s were fast, planar fast. But these are a whole new animal. There is space between instruments in passages I didn't think had space in them. Transients snap out of absolute blackness without any noticeable effort from the driver. Basically, everything but the bass sounds like it's appearing out of thin air. Just happening in my brain, like I've daydreaming the music. The bass and hard panned instruments break this illusion, but THE BASS on these. Oh geez. People said these didn't have the typical estat tuning, I'm guessing they were right because these have a throbbing, authoritative bass that I honestly wasn't expecting. The i20 has a low bass bump/emphasis, the Stax has more low-mid bass to me. The i20 also has a more impactful bass by way of air movement, while the Stax has snappier transients that make up for it a bit.\n\nThe mids are just different to what I've heard thus far. The only word I can think of is uncolored. Like, they're not lush, they're not hollow. I can hear the difference in mic frequency responses in acoustic albums that use separate mics for the vocalist and guitar. That kind of uncolored.\n\nTreble is incredibly detailed. Pretty similar to the i20, but the details kinda \"jump out\" at you like they do in the HD800. The i20 you kinda have to squint your ears, but all that detail is there, the stax is just like \"yo here you go\".\n\nOverall presentation between the two is similar. Surprisingly large Soundstages on both, with the i20 being slightly narrower than the Stax, which I find about equal to an HD700. The Stax, however, feels like it has more depth to it vs the i20. The Stax also feels more \"distant\", kinda in front of your face while the i20 is in line with your ears. This all contributes to that \"music beamed into my brain\" feeling the stax have that really only happens in the mid to upper treble of the i20.\n\nUsability wise the i20 is just leaps and bounds over the Stax. The Cipher cable is a godsend and they will always be my goto portables because of that. The stax is more fiddly, more involved. A portable amp that takes 2 AA batteries that drains in 4-6 hours and a thin kinky cable that I know I'll have to forever baby, ugh. Luckily most of my listening is at home, and I can plug the amp into a wall or a USB -&gt; DC cable.\n\nComfort, the Stax wins hands down for me. Significantly lighter, really easy to seal, no ear hooks or clips or hook clips, just pop em in and go. The i20 can kinda weigh you down after a couple hours and never disappear like the stax do.\n\nSo yea, there's my stream of consciousness ramblings on two headphones nobody seems to really care about, but damn are they both fucking sweet.
