After getting some time on it and feeling out what I like and want, I've worked towards a few changes and upgrades.   \n\n\n*Original:* (see http://www.sheldonbrown.com/centurion1984/pages/10pro-tour.html)  \n\n**Frame** - '84 Centurion Pro Tour 15 ('83 serial # but '84 paint and equipment so was likely produced at the end of '83 for the '84 market)  100% Tange Champion #2 double-butted chromoly with internal wiring (originally intended for for BB mounted dynamo, though I may use it for routing rear light wiring if I ever set up a hub dynamo), vertical drop outs.  Full chrome under the paint.  Low rider mounts.  Mid trail geometry.     \n\n**Wheels** - rims aren't both original but still 27's with 36 spokes in the front and 42 in the back.   \n\n**Cranks &amp; Derailleurs** - Sugino Aero Tour triple crankset (28, 45, 50), Suntour LeTech detrailleurs with granny half-step gearing  \n\n**Seatpost** SR Laprade aluminum.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \n\n*New/Altered:*   \n  \n\n**Saddle** - Brooks Fyer S Special (been really happy with it so far.  Still gradually breaking it in, even though I got it used for a pretty sweet deal.)  \n\n**Handlebars** - Nitto Noodle, 42cm (I like the slightly wider width here than found on the original bars, and the ergonomic bends to the tops for comfortable wrist positioning)  \n\n**Bar tape** - Brooks Microfibre tape in 'antique brown' (was starting to run low on fun money here so instead of actual leather, went the faux route.  Happy with the look and comfort.  First go at wrapping bars! Inadvertently matches the maroon-brick red lettering outlines and headbadge image colour.)  \n\n**Stem** - Nitto Technomic Deluxe, 90mm (with the size of the ergo aero levers, and just for general fit with the long top tube on this bike, I wanted to shave just a bit off the original 100mm stem.)  \n\n**Aero levers** - TRP RRL (this was a splurge but feels worth it.  Next to the smaller vintage look I was used to, I initially found them a bit gaudy but they've grown on me.  They're also comfy and make braking far easier from the hoods with my smaller hands.)  \n\n**Cable housing** - Jagwire pro cable kit in 'carbon silver' (wanted something to go with the frame colour, though I when it arrived I realized I was wholly committing to minimalism here, as it practically melts into the frame colour.  Still, it's a pretty shade, especially when the light catches it.)  \n\n**Front rack** - Nitto M12 (This was also a bit of a splurge.  Especially since it's mostly to rest a really pricey canvas bag on... but you know, slippery slopes.)  \n\n**Rear rack** - got for $5 off Craigslist but it's quite lightweight and has 'made in England' on it  \n\n**Pedals** - MKS Sylvan Touring (found I get enough grip and it's a solid platform without being visually 'big'.  Foot retention to date just isn't my bag so I've been happy with these.   \n\n**Bottle cages** - Velo Orange Retro Cage Mk II (tabless) x2 (I like that you can make them wider or narrower to fit your bottle without too much trouble. Holds snugly enough that they don't rattle.  Looks classy.)  \n\n**Fenders** - Velo Orange Hammered Fenders (paid a LBS to install these!) Fender line looks beautiful though even a bit of sand and grit and it can start to make annoying light rubbing noises. But I'm down to suffer for the beauty.  \n\n**Tires** - Schwalbe HS159 27 x 1 1/4\" wire bead white wall (Came with the bike - haven't ridden other tires on this, so hard to compare. Bike doesn't feel harsh.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been collecting bits and pieces and scrounging for the best deals since September and before (seasonal sales online, at local bike shops, through eBay and on Craigslist) and finally finished putting my bike together at the local bike co-op just in time for a (late) start &amp;#39;o the season Populaire ride!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally bought this bike used 2 years ago - my first bike with drop bars - after admiring vintage bikes from afar.  After getting some time on it and feeling out what I like and want, I&amp;#39;ve worked towards a few changes and upgrades.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original:&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"http://www.sheldonbrown.com/centurion1984/pages/10pro-tour.html\"&gt;http://www.sheldonbrown.com/centurion1984/pages/10pro-tour.html&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frame&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#39;84 Centurion Pro Tour 15 (&amp;#39;83 serial # but &amp;#39;84 paint and equipment so was likely produced at the end of &amp;#39;83 for the &amp;#39;84 market)  100% Tange Champion #2 double-butted chromoly with internal wiring (originally intended for for BB mounted dynamo, though I may use it for routing rear light wiring if I ever set up a hub dynamo), vertical drop outs.  Full chrome under the paint.  Low rider mounts.  Mid trail geometry.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheels&lt;/strong&gt; - rims aren&amp;#39;t both original but still 27&amp;#39;s with 36 spokes in the front and 42 in the back.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cranks &amp;amp; Derailleurs&lt;/strong&gt; - Sugino Aero Tour triple crankset (28, 45, 50), Suntour LeTech detrailleurs with granny half-step gearing  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seatpost&lt;/strong&gt; SR Laprade aluminum.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New/Altered:&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saddle&lt;/strong&gt; - Brooks Fyer S Special (been really happy with it so far.  Still gradually breaking it in, even though I got it used for a pretty sweet deal.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handlebars&lt;/strong&gt; - Nitto Noodle, 42cm (I like the slightly wider width here than found on the original bars, and the ergonomic bends to the tops for comfortable wrist positioning)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bar tape&lt;/strong&gt; - Brooks Microfibre tape in &amp;#39;antique brown&amp;#39; (was starting to run low on fun money here so instead of actual leather, went the faux route.  Happy with the look and comfort.  First go at wrapping bars! Inadvertently matches the maroon-brick red lettering outlines and headbadge image colour.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stem&lt;/strong&gt; - Nitto Technomic Deluxe, 90mm (with the size of the ergo aero levers, and just for general fit with the long top tube on this bike, I wanted to shave just a bit off the original 100mm stem.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aero levers&lt;/strong&gt; - TRP RRL (this was a splurge but feels worth it.  Next to the smaller vintage look I was used to, I initially found them a bit gaudy but they&amp;#39;ve grown on me.  They&amp;#39;re also comfy and make braking far easier from the hoods with my smaller hands.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cable housing&lt;/strong&gt; - Jagwire pro cable kit in &amp;#39;carbon silver&amp;#39; (wanted something to go with the frame colour, though I when it arrived I realized I was wholly committing to minimalism here, as it practically melts into the frame colour.  Still, it&amp;#39;s a pretty shade, especially when the light catches it.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front rack&lt;/strong&gt; - Nitto M12 (This was also a bit of a splurge.  Especially since it&amp;#39;s mostly to rest a really pricey canvas bag on... but you know, slippery slopes.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rear rack&lt;/strong&gt; - got for $5 off Craigslist but it&amp;#39;s quite lightweight and has &amp;#39;made in England&amp;#39; on it  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pedals&lt;/strong&gt; - MKS Sylvan Touring (found I get enough grip and it&amp;#39;s a solid platform without being visually &amp;#39;big&amp;#39;.  Foot retention to date just isn&amp;#39;t my bag so I&amp;#39;ve been happy with these.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottle cages&lt;/strong&gt; - Velo Orange Retro Cage Mk II (tabless) x2 (I like that you can make them wider or narrower to fit your bottle without too much trouble. Holds snugly enough that they don&amp;#39;t rattle.  Looks classy.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fenders&lt;/strong&gt; - Velo Orange Hammered Fenders (paid a LBS to install these!) Fender line looks beautiful though even a bit of sand and grit and it can start to make annoying light rubbing noises. But I&amp;#39;m down to suffer for the beauty.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tires&lt;/strong&gt; - Schwalbe HS159 27 x 1 1/4&amp;quot; wire bead white wall (Came with the bike - haven&amp;#39;t ridden other tires on this, so hard to compare. Bike doesn&amp;#39;t feel harsh. Tires have held up well so far, though I imagine the wire bead/kevlar protection means I&amp;#39;m likely sacrificing cushy riding for protection.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brake pads&lt;/strong&gt; - Kool Stop Salmon pads (OK this is a standard consumable, but I wanted to see what the fuss was about.
