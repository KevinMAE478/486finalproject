That&amp;#39;s already slightly more tickets per bicyclist vs driver, but if you take into account that the car number is the number of vehicles, and not trips, and that car trips are much longer than bike trips, the number of tickets per mile traveled is much, much higher for cyclists in the 9th Precinct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we&amp;#39;ve established that -- based on the admittedly incomplete numbers I&amp;#39;ve presented -- cyclists are ticketed at a much higher rate. But who should be ticketed more based on deadliness of collisions? Here&amp;#39;s a quote from a comment I made a few months ago:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, no pedestrians were killed by cyclists. 361 pedestrians were injured and 28 cyclists were injured in collisions between cyclists and pedestrians. 1 cyclist was killed in such a crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10,461 pedestrians were injured by cars and 137 were killed by cars. 4,433 cyclists were injured by cars and 14 were killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From those numbers, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear drivers should be ticketed at higher rates, and that&amp;#39;s not happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bicycling", "name": "t1_dgao3zz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492293617.0, "created_utc": 1492264817.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagq75", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimmerUK", "parent_id": "t3_65fkb8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bicycling", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;cyclists in the 9th Precinct were given 228 non-criminal summonses, while drivers were given 2,074.\n\nThis figure means nothing without knowing the proportion of cyclists to drivers. \n\nAre 10% of road users cyclists?
