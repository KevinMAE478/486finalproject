Now though, I&amp;#39;ve got two kids of an age (almost 2, almost 4) to enjoy a ride, so trailer it is. So basically, there&amp;#39;s pluses and minuses for each. I think the utility of the trailer is great: more space, room for two, some cargo and drink space, ability to convert to a stroller (we use this feature a lot!). For the seat, the closeness and communication is cool, and the lower wind resistance too. Safety wise, it&amp;#39;s probably a wash. I think the seat seems scarier, but I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think it is. Kid should be wearing a helmet either way, and they are basically made of rubber.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bicycling", "name": "t1_dgdpslk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475567.0, "created_utc": 1492446767.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u1ih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u1ih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge771c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aperturetattoo", "parent_id": "t1_dge6xhr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bicycling", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Amen on the feeling it on literally any incline at all thing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amen on the feeling it on literally any incline at all thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bicycling", "name": "t1_dge771c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492495330.0, "created_utc": 1492466530.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge6xhr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "siacn", "parent_id": "t1_dgdnlc6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bicycling", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've got a Burley Honey Bee and I think it's pretty great, but like u/aperturetattoo said, it's kind of like pulling a big parachute sometimes.
