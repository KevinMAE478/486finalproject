Wild Axes provide vision at the map center&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When casting Wild Axes, they provide vision at the center of the map until they fully returned to the caster. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter where the caster is or where he targets the spell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty straight-forward bug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB2mxYfUQXc\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. Wild Axes fly towards the caster&amp;#39;s facing angle, instead of targeted point&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like Wild Axes work like Shadowraze--go towards facing direction--so the targeting only is to make you face the direction and determine distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Beastmaster himself, this doesn&amp;#39;t really matter, because of the cast time he has on Wild Axes, he will always be fully facing the target point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for Rubick, this causes issues. Since he has a 0 second cast time, the axes may fly towards the wrong direction for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repro:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Steal Wild Axes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cast Wild Axes behind you&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; Rubick turns around to cast the spell. Once within the required angle, he casts it. But the axes do not fly towards the targeted point. They fly towards where Rubick was facing as the cast begun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected:&lt;/strong&gt; Wild Axes should fly towards where the spell was targeted, not towards where the caster is facing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK5xB2wJ5qU\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Primal Roar doesn&amp;#39;t destroy trees around units it shoves aside&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These kind of knockbacks usually destroy trees around the moved unit. Deafening Blast, Gust, Earth Spirit spells, Force Staff+upgrade, Blinding Light, Flamebreak, Walrus Kick, Greater Bash, all destroy trees around knocked enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Primal Roar doesn&amp;#39;t destroy trees. It probably should, like a small 100 radius around knocked units.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkfdfwQvScU\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. Primal Roar doesn&amp;#39;t slow and attempt to damage spell immune secondary targets&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Primal Roar fully pierces spell immunity on the primary target. It stuns it and applies its damage (which then gets reduced to 0).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its behavior against secondary targets is inconsistent. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; shove spell immune enemies aside. But it neither slows them, nor attempts to damage them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would make more sense for it to fully pierce, applying the slow and damage as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: For people who don&amp;#39;t get the damage part, no, it won&amp;#39;t make you lose hp, since it&amp;#39;s magical damage and you have 100% magic resistance. It would just affect interactions with several effects which react on damage, like Recall and Blade Mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rEROXgLvXs\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. Primal Roar does not shove aside enemes which are aligned with the caster and the target&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When an enemy unit is perfectly aligned with the Primal Roar caster and the primary target, they are not shoved aside. They are hit by it normally, but are basically just stunned, instead of shoved aside&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strangely, it does shove units when the caster and primary target are 920 range apart from each other. In this case, aligned secondary units are shoved towards the primary target, and not aside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the knockback is to &amp;quot;open a path&amp;quot; for Beastmaster to the target. So nearby enemies should always be shoved aside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vh4e2NzQdA\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6. Primal Roar&amp;#39;s knockback debuff is not visible in the HUD&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Primal Roar&amp;#39;s knockback is a hard-disable (a stun). Stuns should always be shown in the status bar, no matter how short. Even stuff like Lightning Bolt is displayed. Primal Roar&amp;#39;s debuff should be displayed as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfBTS7rst8Y\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;7. Box-selecting a Boar and a Hawk selects them based on creation order&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When box-selecting a Boar and a Hawk, the hawk sometimes ends up as the primary selected unit, which can mess with attack orders (since the hawk cant attack, it prevents giving attack orders to the selected group).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, the game decides the primary selected unit by creation order in the case of boars and hawks. This is not the case when selecting the beastmaster summons together with e.g. necro units. In this case, the necro units are always prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game should prioritise the boar over the hawk. In fact, the hawk should always be the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; unit in every selection group, since it&amp;#39;s basically a mobile ward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuqBH931axM\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;8. CTRL Unified Unit Orders gives the orders to the Hawk as well&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hawk is currently not selected with the &amp;quot;Select All Units&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Select All Other Units&amp;quot; hotkeys. But unified unit orders still include the hawk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unified Unit Orders should not affect the hawk for the same reason why Select All/All Other Units&amp;quot; do not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXZrVvbcRjE\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;9. The Hawk can leave the map boundaries&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hawk is the only unit which is still able to leave the map. All other units cannot do this anymore.. Well, the hawk and the flying courier can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering other units got fixed, units leaving the map seems to be not wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAkZ-Q8ZpP0\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;10. The Hawk&amp;#39;s invisibility ability is not disabled by Break&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very minor, barely matters currently. It may matter more in the future. For example, when an AoE Break ability gets introduced, the hawk would ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;#39;s a passive ability, Break should disable it. As a comparison, Riki invis is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKlMtp0qpQ\"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Visual glitches&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1. Enemy Wild Axes are floating in the air when they enter the fog of war&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When an enemy casts Wild Axes, they get stuck and spin in place when they enter the fog of war, until the spell finishes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works fine when Beastmaster is invisible. The axes actually fly towards where he currently is, even while invisible. Only the fog causes this issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Just like other projectiles, upon entering the fog, the axes should stop drawing and disappear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSSUkq-6ds\"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. When casting Wild Axes, Beastmaster still keeps a pair of axes in his hands&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Beastmaster sends his axes flying and calls them home again&amp;quot; -- from the spell description. But when casting the spell, Beastmaster clones his axes, keeping the ones in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funny part is, during early beta, Beastmaster actually threw his axes. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xum8I4MEQLQ\"&gt;You can see it in this video&lt;/a&gt;. This stopped working as his model was remade/updated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggRf8ASEPY\"&gt;This is how it currently looks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Beastmaster&amp;#39;s Wild Axes catch animations play even while dead&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beastmaster has a special animation for Wild Axes as they return: He catches them with his hands. This catching animation plays even while Beastmaster lies dead on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A9CQt0QfLE\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. Wild Axes&amp;#39; catch animation does not play when not having the spell anymore&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This matters for Rubick only, who also has the wild axes catch animation. When he loses the spell before the axes return, the animation is not used. It should be used, even after spell loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q05xPKFSEKo\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. Units knocked back by Primal Roar do not use their flail animations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually, when a unit gets knocked back, its flail animation plays. But this is not the case with Primal Roar. Here, the units just idle and slide on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Primal Roar should make shoved units flail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYGBswkXvC4\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6. Beastmaster&amp;#39;s mouth stays shut during Primal Roar&amp;#39;s cast animation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roaring with a shut mouth? His Roar animation does not have his mouth animated. He just leans forward with is arms pulled back. His mouth stays shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His mouth should be animated as well. As a comparison, Axe&amp;#39;s mouth opens when using Berserker&amp;#39;s Call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeQA0SBEtZA\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;7. Beastmaster&amp;#39;s rare idle animation plays during his injured phase&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a problem many heroes have, appearantly. Rare idle animations should not play when the unit is currently using its injured animations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeQl2MmQKD0\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Audio bugs&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1. Beastmaster&amp;#39;s responses upon controlling his summons do not work&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beastmaster has a set of voice responses which are supposed to be used by him when controlling his summons. There are voice lines for:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ordering the Boar to moved (&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7e/Beas_ability_summonsboar_02.mp3\"&gt;Hoof it.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/6c/Beas_ability_summonsboar_03.mp3\"&gt;Fetch!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ordering the Boar to attack (&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/c5/Beas_ability_summonsboar_05.mp3\"&gt;Go boy, go get um!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/b/b3/Beas_ability_summonsboar_06.mp3\"&gt;After them!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ordering the Hawk to moved (&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/aa/Beas_ability_summonsbird_02.mp3\"&gt;Fly my friend!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/f7/Beas_ability_summonsbird_03.mp3\"&gt;Soar and swoop!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/22/Beas_ability_summonsbird_04.mp3\"&gt;Soar!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These responses are even hooked up in Beastmaster&amp;#39;s response rules, with a 30% proc chance. But sadly, they do not work currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/C1wRiEe.png\"&gt;Screenshot of the response rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. Beastmaster&amp;#39;s rare kick attack animation uses axe sounds&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beastmaster has a rare attack animation where he kicks his target, instead of axing them. This kick uses his axe attack sounds. It should have a different sound, a thud similar to Alchemist punches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVeEtutFt8k\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Cosmetic item issues&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1. Wild Axes always use the default Beastmaster axe models, instead of what is equipped&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very disappointing thing about Beastmaster cosmetics, his Wild Axes use always the default model. Meanwhile, heroes like storm have a spell completely copy every equipped cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would make Beastmaster&amp;#39;s cosmetic items much more valuable if his spell would adapt. There is no downside to this, I&amp;#39;m sure his stuff would even sell better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I remember the devs saying in the past that they wanted to wait with this kind of stuff until Reborn. Well, Reborn is out for years now, where are the customizations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other disappointing spells are Troll&amp;#39;s Whirling Axes and Bounty Hunter&amp;#39;s Shuriken Toss. I&amp;#39;m sure there are more. Monkey King&amp;#39;s staff will probably be disappointing too when he gets custom staves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqdzi4RIH4\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. The Stun and Flail animations of all of the custom Boars and Hawks do not loop&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above might not be a bug (it&amp;#39;s just a disappointment), but this one definitely is. Stun and flail animations are supposed to loop and last as long as the stun/knockback do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This works fine for the default Boar and default Hawk. But all the custom Boars and Hawks are bugged. Their animations do not loop. They play one cycle and then stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dvat-5xbpU\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. All of Beastmaster&amp;#39;s custom Boars are missing footstep and death sounds&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a bug as well, mainly because it also affects gameplay (pay2win)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the custom Boars models Beastmaster has, they are fully silent. You (and enemies) cannot hear them move and cannot hear them die. This gives the custom models an advantage over the default model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The custom models should inherit the sound from the default model. The default sounds are luckily so that they&amp;#39;d fit pretty much any custom model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR8ikedsaHc\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. The Anunkasan Hawk from the Friends of the West set has portrait lighting and idle animation uses&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The portrait of &lt;a href=\"https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Anunkasan\"&gt;this custom hawk&lt;/a&gt; is not lighted properly. The upper half is illuminated, and the lower half is a void of blackness.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Its wings flap horizontally while idle. This is not how wings work. They should flap more vertically when not moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFUX5LJE5c4\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. The Ancestral Vest of Karroch chest item is floating on Beastmaster&amp;#39;s chest&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like the &lt;a href=\"https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ancestral_Vest_of_Karroch\"&gt;Ancestral Vest of Karroch&lt;/a&gt; chest item from the Custom Karroch set was not adapted to the size change Beastmaster received a couple of years ago. Beastmaster&amp;#39;s model size was decreased. So now, this item is too big for him. In the loadout, you can see that the item basically has no contact with Beastmaster&amp;#39;s skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7orF3Gf_88\"&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1. Add particle effects to the Boar&amp;#39;s Poison debuff&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Boar&amp;#39;s Poison is a very strong slow. It slows for &lt;em&gt;40%&lt;/em&gt; and basically lasts as long as the boar attacks you, which can be a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such a strong effect should have some visual feedback. So I suggest adding some green particle effects around poisoned enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocwb7FqoP6E\"&gt;Here is an example which could be used for it&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a modified version of Orb of Venom&amp;#39;s effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. Add particle effects to Primal Roar&amp;#39;s slow debuff&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another potent slow effect without any visual feedback. It does have an effect, but it only lasts half a second. This effect is for the knockback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A weaker version of the knockback visual effect could be used for the slow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJtnHJMEAw\"&gt;Here is an example effect&lt;/a&gt; (not using the knockback effect).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Give Call of the Wild: Boar a unique cast animation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Call of the Wild: Hawk and Call of the Wild: Boar use the same animation currently, although both have a separate animation entry on the model (both being identical).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current animation with his arms raising into the air fits well for the Hawk. The Boar could have Beastmaster point one of his axes forward, similar to his animation in WC3 DotA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/EUl80dg.png\"&gt;WC3 example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jRkHICEZ7M\"&gt;Video demo of current animations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would create an animation as a demo myself, but I have 0 experience, so it&amp;#39;d take too long for me to figure it all out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. Give Beastmaster&amp;#39;s Boar unique attack sounds&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, all units should have a unique attack sounds. Or at least they should be altered enough to be distinguishable, even when using the same sound still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beastmaster&amp;#39;s Boar has a powerful slowing attack, so it using the same attack sound as a range creep is unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8PuJhw5NI0\"&gt;Here is an example sound attack, projectile launch and impact&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to get something fitting to his spitting attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. Give the Boar and the Hawk their own response rules, separate from Beastmaster&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Boar&amp;#39;s and Hawk&amp;#39;s responses are bound to Beastmaster (although as stated previously, they currently do not work). This means (if they&amp;#39;d work) they only play when Beastmaster controls them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is kind of weird, why would they stop responding when controlled by other heroes? Rubick? Chen? Enchantress? Lifestealer? Anyone with Helm of the Dominator?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now, Warlock&amp;#39;s Golems are the only non-hero units with their own response rule file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the sounds currently in-game for the Boar and Hawk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/82/Beas_ability_boar_move_01.mp3\"&gt;Boar move 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/85/Beas_ability_boar_move_02.mp3\"&gt;Boar move 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/a3/Beas_ability_boar_attack_01.mp3\"&gt;Boar attack 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/a7/Beastmaster_Boar_death.mp3\"&gt;Boar death 1&lt;/a&gt; (currently in use)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/52/Beas_ability_boar_death_01.mp3\"&gt;Boar death 2&lt;/a&gt; (unused, this one could be used as a second attack response instead. One death response is enough.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/b/b9/Beas_ability_hawk_move_01.mp3\"&gt;Hawk move 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/de/Beastmaster_Hawk_death.mp3\"&gt;Hawk death 1&lt;/a&gt; (currently in use)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/8e/Beas_ability_hawk_death_01.mp3\"&gt;Hawk death 2&lt;/a&gt; (unused, this one could be used as a second move response instead. One death response is enough.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have created demo response rule files for these, which can be found &lt;a href=\"http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=279313\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6. Suggestions for some unused responses of Beastmaster&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, here are several suggestions for the hero&amp;#39;s unused voice responses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1. Enable Beastmaster&amp;#39;s Wild Axes cast responses&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are they not enabled anyway? They aren&amp;#39;t bad and fit quite well. Give them a 50% proc chance and it should be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/6f/Beas_ability_axes_01.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_axes_00&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Axes wild!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/72/Beas_ability_axes_03.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_axes_03&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;My blades fly!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/59/Beas_ability_axes_04.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_axes_04&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Boomeraxe.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/9/95/Beas_ability_axes_05.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_axes_05&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Wingblade.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7c/Beas_ability_axes_06.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_axes_06&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heyuhh!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/cd/Beas_exert_01.mp3\"&gt;beas_exert_01&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hoaarr&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/e/e4/Beas_exert_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_exert_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Haar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/3/33/Beas_exert_03.mp3\"&gt;beas_exert_03&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hough&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/f4/Beas_exert_04.mp3\"&gt;beas_exert_04&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heeagh&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2. Enable Beastmaster&amp;#39;s rare immortality, haste and invisibility lines&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, why are this not enabled? They are good lines, and other heroes have more ridiculous/vague lines which are enabled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/fd/Beas_immort_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_immort_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;A strict no-kill policy.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/1f/Beas_haste_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_haste_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Fast as falcon wings.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/8e/Beas_invis_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_invis_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Even eagle eyes couldn&amp;#39;t see me.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;3. Use Beastmaster&amp;#39;s anger/noise responses as rare move/attack responses&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beastmaster is a man from the wild. He has many lines where he just makes noises (growling and similar). How about using them as move and attack responses, but with a lower proc chance, like 30%? Bunty Hunter has a similar system with his non-english responses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following would fit as move responses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7d/Beas_anger_01.mp3\"&gt;beas_anger_01&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heereh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/80/Beas_anger_05.mp3\"&gt;beas_anger_05&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heneneh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/12/Beas_anger_06.mp3\"&gt;beas_anger_06&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Eurgh&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/4d/Beas_happy_01.mp3\"&gt;beas_happy_01&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/58/Beas_ability_failure_01.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_failure_01&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Herreh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And these would fit as attack responses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/21/Beas_anger_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_anger_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heararaeh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/85/Beas_anger_03.mp3\"&gt;beas_anger_03&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Harreh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/4d/Beas_anger_04.mp3\"&gt;beas_anger_04&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heranene.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/ae/Beas_ability_failure_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_failure_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Heh-noo!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/66/Beas_ability_failure_03.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_failure_03&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Errehehehh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this one would work as a level up response&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/4f/Beas_ability_animalsound_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_animalsound_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Aroo arooew!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;4. Use this unused call of the wild response as a spawn response&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/50/Beas_ability_callwild_01.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_callwild_01&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Beasts, to me!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;5. Use this unused call of the wild response as a BattleBegins response&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/2e/Beas_ability_callwild_02.mp3\"&gt;beas_ability_callwild_02&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Wild ones, come!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;6. Use this unused pain response as a meeting-an-ally response towards Bristleback&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/ac/Beas_pain_14.mp3\"&gt;beas_pain_14&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey, you poked me!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;7. I know these aren&amp;#39;t enable for thematic reasons, but they still could be enabled as an easter egg, with a 1% chance of happening, and not happeing more than once per game. Talking about these rare lines which play upon repeatedly selecting the hero.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/dc/Beas_rare_04.mp3\"&gt;beas_rare_04&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Basshunter, on the hunt.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/0/05/Beas_rare_05.mp3\"&gt;beas_rare_05&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Basshunter, on the hunt.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Tooltip stuff&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wild Axes do not mention their damage/cut radius.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boar&amp;#39;s Poison lists a damage type. It does not deal any damage, so it shouldn&amp;#39;t show a damage type.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boar&amp;#39;s Poison description is too vague. It does not say that the boar&amp;#39;s attacks apply the effect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Primal Roar&amp;#39;s SHOUT WIDTH: trait shows amplified value when holding ALT. It&amp;#39;s listing an effect width, not a damage amount, it should not show amp&amp;#39;d values.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all actual issues. Here are some extra stuff which could be changed (lore changes can be seen in the image)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wild Axes has an unnecessary note telling it pierces spell immunity. Info is already in the header.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wild Axes has an unnecessary note saying it cuts trees. This info is already in the ability description.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Hawk and Call of the Wild: Boar share the same lore text. A small tweak to both could be applied to have them unique.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hawk&amp;#39;s Invisibility does not have a lore text.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boar&amp;#39;s Poison does not have a lore text.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Primal Roar has an unnecessary note telling it pierces spell immunity. Info is already in the header.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some new ALT notes for his spells:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wild Axes note: The axes fly for a maximum of 2 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wild Axes note: The axes spread 353 range apart from each other, trees and enemies inbetween them may not be hit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wild Axes note: The axes have 350 range flying vision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Hawk note: Recasting Call of the Wild: Hawk does not replace alredy existing hawks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Hawk note: The hawk is a flying unit, so it has unobstructed pathing and vision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Hawk note: The hawk has a bounty of 30/40/50/60 gold and 77 experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Boar note: Recasting Call of the Wild: Boar does not replace alredy existing boars.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Boar note: The boar has 550 attack range, 1.25 base attack time, 350 movement speed and 1400/800 vision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wild: Boar note: The boar has a bounty of 26-38 gold and 60/70/80/90 experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boar Poison note: Multiple instances of Poison do not stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inner Beast note: Affects invulnerable units.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Primal Roar note: Only enemies are shoved aside, over 300 range for 0.6 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Primal Roar note: Enemies are fully disabled while getting shoved aside.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Primal Roar note: The pushback and slow have a dynamic range, based on the distance between Beastmaster and the primary target.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/71IAjrJ.jpg\"&gt;Image comparing the changes to the current tooltips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=279314\"&gt;dota_english and npc_abilities changes can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Trying out one-long-post-per-hero this time, see how it works out.\n\nHero 1: Abaddon [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5s91yi/hero1_everything_wrong_with_abaddon_part_12_a_new/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5sawt1/hero1_everything_wrong_with_abaddon_part_22/)\n\nHero 2: Alchemist [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5tboxq/hero2_everything_wrong_with_alchemist_part_12/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5tbqie/hero2_everything_wrong_with_alchemist_part_22/)\n\nHero 3: Ancient Apparition [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5v8lsa/hero2_everything_wrong_with_ancient_apparition/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5v8vk5/hero3_everything_wrong_with_ancient_apparition/)\n\nHero 4: Anti-Mage [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5wgact/hero4_everything_wrong_with_antimage_part_11/)\n\nHero 5: Arc Warden [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5xuyx0/hero5_everything_wrong_with_arc_warden_part_12/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5xvpns/hero5_everything_wrong_with_arc_warden_part_22/)\n\nHero 6: Axe [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5ylcrc/hero6_everything_wrong_with_axe_part_12/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5ylcrj/hero6_everything_wrong_with_axe_part_22/)\n\nHero 7: Bane [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/60jgyz/hero7_everything_wrong_with_bane_part_12/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/60jgz4/hero7_everything_wrong_with_bane_part_22/)\n\nHero 8: Batrider [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6361e7/hero8_everything_wrong_with_batrider_part_12/), [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6361eh/hero8_everything_wrong_with_batrider_part_22/)\n\n---\n##[](/hero-beastmaster) Beastmaster\n\n* Total number of subjects: 31\n* Number of bugs: 10\n* Number of visual glitches: 7\n* Number of audio bugs: 2\n* Number of cosmetic item issues: 5\n* Number of suggestions: 6\n* +1 tooltip stuff\n\n---\n##Bugs\n---\n\n#1. Wild Axes provide vision at the map center\n\nWhen casting Wild Axes, they provide vision at the center of the map until they fully returned to the caster. It doesn't matter where the caster is or where he targets the spell.\n\nPretty straight-forward bug.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB2mxYfUQXc)\n\n\n---\n#2. Wild Axes fly towards the caster's facing angle, instead of targeted point\n\nIt looks like Wild Axes work like Shadowraze--go towards facing direction--so the targeting only is to make you face the direction and determine distance.\n\nFor Beastmaster himself, this doesn't really matter, because of the cast time he has on Wild Axes, he will always be fully facing the target point.\n\nBut for Rubick, this causes issues. Since he has a 0 second cast time, the axes may fly towards the wrong direction for him.\n\n**Repro:**\n\n1. Steal Wild Axes\n2. Cast Wild Axes behind you\n\n**Result:** Rubick turns around to cast the spell. Once within the required angle, he casts it. But the axes do not fly towards the targeted point. They fly towards where Rubick was facing as the cast begun.\n\n**Expected:** Wild Axes should fly towards where the spell was targeted, not towards where the caster is facing.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK5xB2wJ5qU)\n\n---\n#3. Primal Roar doesn't destroy trees around units it shoves aside\n\nThese kind of knockbacks usually destroy trees around the moved unit. Deafening Blast, Gust, Earth Spirit spells, Force Staff+upgrade, Blinding Light, Flamebreak, Walrus Kick, Greater Bash, all destroy trees around knocked enemies.\n\nPrimal Roar doesn't destroy trees. It probably should, like a small 100 radius around knocked units.\n\n[Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkfdfwQvScU)\n\n---\n#4. Primal Roar doesn't slow and attempt to damage spell immune secondary targets\n\nPrimal Roar fully pierces spell immunity on the primary target. It stuns it and applies its damage (which then gets reduced to 0).\n\nIts behavior against secondary targets is inconsistent. It *does* shove spell immune enemies aside. But it neither slows them, nor attempts to damage them.\n\nIt would make more sense for it to fully pierce, applying the slow and damage as well.\n\nNote: For people who don't get the damage part, no, it won't make you lose hp, since it's magical damage and you have 100% magic resistance. It would just affect interactions with several effects which react on damage, like Recall and Blade Mail.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rEROXgLvXs)\n\n---\n#5. Primal Roar does not shove aside enemes which are aligned with the caster and the target\n\nWhen an enemy unit is perfectly aligned with the Primal Roar caster and the primary target, they are not shoved aside. They are hit by it normally, but are basically just stunned, instead of shoved aside\n\nStrangely, it does shove units when the caster and primary target are 920 range apart from each other. In this case, aligned secondary units are shoved towards the primary target, and not aside.\n\nThe purpose of the knockback is to \"open a path\" for Beastmaster to the target. So nearby enemies should always be shoved aside.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vh4e2NzQdA)\n\n---\n#6. Primal Roar's knockback debuff is not visible in the HUD\n\nPrimal Roar's knockback is a hard-disable (a stun). Stuns should always be shown in the status bar, no matter how short. Even stuff like Lightning Bolt is displayed. Primal Roar's debuff should be displayed as well.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfBTS7rst8Y)\n\n---\n#7. Box-selecting a Boar and a Hawk selects them based on creation order\n\nWhen box-selecting a Boar and a Hawk, the hawk sometimes ends up as the primary selected unit, which can mess with attack orders (since the hawk cant attack, it prevents giving attack orders to the selected group).\n\nCurrently, the game decides the primary selected unit by creation order in the case of boars and hawks. This is not the case when selecting the beastmaster summons together with e.g. necro units. In this case, the necro units are always prioritised.\n\nThe game should prioritise the boar over the hawk. In fact, the hawk should always be the *last* unit in every selection group, since it's basically a mobile ward.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuqBH931axM)\n\n---\t\n#8. CTRL Unified Unit Orders gives the orders to the Hawk as well\n\nThe hawk is currently not selected with the \"Select All Units\" and \"Select All Other Units\" hotkeys. But unified unit orders still include the hawk.\n\nUnified Unit Orders should not affect the hawk for the same reason why Select All/All Other Units\" do not.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXZrVvbcRjE)\n\n---\n#9. The Hawk can leave the map boundaries\n\nThe hawk is the only unit which is still able to leave the map. All other units cannot do this anymore.. Well, the hawk and the flying courier can.\n\nConsidering other units got fixed, units leaving the map seems to be not wanted.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAkZ-Q8ZpP0)\n\n---\n#10. The Hawk's invisibility ability is not disabled by Break\n\nVery minor, barely matters currently. It may matter more in the future. For example, when an AoE Break ability gets introduced, the hawk would ignore it.\n\nSince it's a passive ability, Break should disable it. As a comparison, Riki invis is disabled.\n\n[Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKlMtp0qpQ)\n\n---\n---\n---\n##Visual glitches\n---\n\n#1. Enemy Wild Axes are floating in the air when they enter the fog of war\n\nWhen an enemy casts Wild Axes, they get stuck and spin in place when they enter the fog of war, until the spell finishes.\n\nIt works fine when Beastmaster is invisible. The axes actually fly towards where he currently is, even while invisible. Only the fog causes this issue.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Just like other projectiles, upon entering the fog, the axes should stop drawing and disappear.\n\n[Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSSUkq-6ds)\n\n---\n#2. When casting Wild Axes, Beastmaster still keeps a pair of axes in his hands\n\n\"Beastmaster sends his axes flying and calls them home again\" -- from the spell description. But when casting the spell, Beastmaster clones his axes, keeping the ones in his hands.\n\nFunny part is, during early beta, Beastmaster actually threw his axes. [You can see it in this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xum8I4MEQLQ). This stopped working as his model was remade/updated.\n\n[This is how it currently looks] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggRf8ASEPY)\n\n---\n#3. Beastmaster's Wild Axes catch animations play even while dead\n\nBeastmaster has a special animation for Wild Axes as they return: He catches them with his hands. This catching animation plays even while Beastmaster lies dead on the ground.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A9CQt0QfLE)\n\n---\n#4. Wild Axes' catch animation does not play when not having the spell anymore\n\nThis matters for Rubick only, who also has the wild axes catch animation. When he loses the spell before the axes return, the animation is not used. It should be used, even after spell loss.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q05xPKFSEKo)\n\n---\n#5. Units knocked back by Primal Roar do not use their flail animations\n\nUsually, when a unit gets knocked back, its flail animation plays. But this is not the case with Primal Roar. Here, the units just idle and slide on the ground.\n\nPrimal Roar should make shoved units flail.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYGBswkXvC4)\n\n---\n#6. Beastmaster's mouth stays shut during Primal Roar's cast animation\n\nRoaring with a shut mouth? His Roar animation does not have his mouth animated. He just leans forward with is arms pulled back. His mouth stays shut.\n\nHis mouth should be animated as well. As a comparison, Axe's mouth opens when using Berserker's Call.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeQA0SBEtZA)\n\n---\n#7. Beastmaster's rare idle animation plays during his injured phase\n\nThis is a problem many heroes have, appearantly. Rare idle animations should not play when the unit is currently using its injured animations.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeQl2MmQKD0)\n\n---\n---\n---\n## Audio bugs\n---\n\n#1. Beastmaster's responses upon controlling his summons do not work\n\nBeastmaster has a set of voice responses which are supposed to be used by him when controlling his summons. There are voice lines for:\n\n* Ordering the Boar to moved ([Hoof it.] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7e/Beas_ability_summonsboar_02.mp3), [Fetch!] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/6c/Beas_ability_summonsboar_03.mp3))\n* Ordering the Boar to attack ([Go boy, go get um!] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/c5/Beas_ability_summonsboar_05.mp3), [After them!] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/b/b3/Beas_ability_summonsboar_06.mp3))\n* Ordering the Hawk to moved ([Fly my friend!](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/aa/Beas_ability_summonsbird_02.mp3), [Soar and swoop!](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/f7/Beas_ability_summonsbird_03.mp3), [Soar!](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/22/Beas_ability_summonsbird_04.mp3))\n\nThese responses are even hooked up in Beastmaster's response rules, with a 30% proc chance. But sadly, they do not work currently.\n\n[Screenshot of the response rules] (http://i.imgur.com/C1wRiEe.png)\n\n---\n#2. Beastmaster's rare kick attack animation uses axe sounds\n\nBeastmaster has a rare attack animation where he kicks his target, instead of axing them. This kick uses his axe attack sounds. It should have a different sound, a thud similar to Alchemist punches.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVeEtutFt8k)\n\n---\n---\n---\n##Cosmetic item issues\n---\n\n#1. Wild Axes always use the default Beastmaster axe models, instead of what is equipped\n\nA very disappointing thing about Beastmaster cosmetics, his Wild Axes use always the default model. Meanwhile, heroes like storm have a spell completely copy every equipped cosmetic.\n\nIt would make Beastmaster's cosmetic items much more valuable if his spell would adapt. There is no downside to this, I'm sure his stuff would even sell better.\n\nAnd I remember the devs saying in the past that they wanted to wait with this kind of stuff until Reborn. Well, Reborn is out for years now, where are the customizations?\n\nOther disappointing spells are Troll's Whirling Axes and Bounty Hunter's Shuriken Toss. I'm sure there are more. Monkey King's staff will probably be disappointing too when he gets custom staves.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqdzi4RIH4)\n\n---\n#2. The Stun and Flail animations of all of the custom Boars and Hawks do not loop\n\nThe above might not be a bug (it's just a disappointment), but this one definitely is. Stun and flail animations are supposed to loop and last as long as the stun/knockback do.\n\nThis works fine for the default Boar and default Hawk. But all the custom Boars and Hawks are bugged. Their animations do not loop. They play one cycle and then stop.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dvat-5xbpU)\n\n---\n#3. All of Beastmaster's custom Boars are missing footstep and death sounds\n\nThis is definitely a bug as well, mainly because it also affects gameplay (pay2win)\n\nAll the custom Boars models Beastmaster has, they are fully silent. You (and enemies) cannot hear them move and cannot hear them die. This gives the custom models an advantage over the default model.\n\nThe custom models should inherit the sound from the default model. The default sounds are luckily so that they'd fit pretty much any custom model.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR8ikedsaHc)\n\n---\n#4. The Anunkasan Hawk from the Friends of the West set has portrait lighting and idle animation uses\n\n1. The portrait of [this custom hawk] (https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Anunkasan) is not lighted properly. The upper half is illuminated, and the lower half is a void of blackness.\n2. Its wings flap horizontally while idle. This is not how wings work. They should flap more vertically when not moving forward.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFUX5LJE5c4)\n\n---\n#5. The Ancestral Vest of Karroch chest item is floating on Beastmaster's chest\n\nIt looks like the [Ancestral Vest of Karroch] (https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ancestral_Vest_of_Karroch) chest item from the Custom Karroch set was not adapted to the size change Beastmaster received a couple of years ago. Beastmaster's model size was decreased. So now, this item is too big for him. In the loadout, you can see that the item basically has no contact with Beastmaster's skin.\n\n[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7orF3Gf_88)\n\n---\n---\n---\n##Suggestions\n---\n\n#1. Add particle effects to the Boar's Poison debuff\n\nThe Boar's Poison is a very strong slow. It slows for *40%* and basically lasts as long as the boar attacks you, which can be a long time.\n\nSuch a strong effect should have some visual feedback. So I suggest adding some green particle effects around poisoned enemies.\n\n[Here is an example which could be used for it] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocwb7FqoP6E). It's a modified version of Orb of Venom's effect.\n\n---\n#2. Add particle effects to Primal Roar's slow debuff\n\nAnother potent slow effect without any visual feedback. It does have an effect, but it only lasts half a second. This effect is for the knockback.\n\nA weaker version of the knockback visual effect could be used for the slow.\n\n[Here is an example effect] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJtnHJMEAw) (not using the knockback effect).\n\n---\n#3. Give Call of the Wild: Boar a unique cast animation\n\nCall of the Wild: Hawk and Call of the Wild: Boar use the same animation currently, although both have a separate animation entry on the model (both being identical).\n\nThe current animation with his arms raising into the air fits well for the Hawk. The Boar could have Beastmaster point one of his axes forward, similar to his animation in WC3 DotA.\n\n[WC3 example] (http://i.imgur.com/EUl80dg.png)\n\n[Video demo of current animations] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jRkHICEZ7M)\n\nI would create an animation as a demo myself, but I have 0 experience, so it'd take too long for me to figure it all out.\n\n---\n#4. Give Beastmaster's Boar unique attack sounds\n\nIn my opinion, all units should have a unique attack sounds. Or at least they should be altered enough to be distinguishable, even when using the same sound still.\n\nBeastmaster's Boar has a powerful slowing attack, so it using the same attack sound as a range creep is unjustified.\n\n[Here is an example sound attack, projectile launch and impact] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8PuJhw5NI0). I tried to get something fitting to his spitting attack.\n\n---\n#5. Give the Boar and the Hawk their own response rules, separate from Beastmaster\n\nCurrently, the Boar's and Hawk's responses are bound to Beastmaster (although as stated previously, they currently do not work). This means (if they'd work) they only play when Beastmaster controls them.\n\nThis is kind of weird, why would they stop responding when controlled by other heroes? Rubick? Chen? Enchantress? Lifestealer? Anyone with Helm of the Dominator?\n\nAs of now, Warlock's Golems are the only non-hero units with their own response rule file.\n\nThese are the sounds currently in-game for the Boar and Hawk\n\n* [Boar move 1] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/82/Beas_ability_boar_move_01.mp3)\n* [Boar move 2] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/85/Beas_ability_boar_move_02.mp3)\n* [Boar attack 1] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/a3/Beas_ability_boar_attack_01.mp3)\n* [Boar death 1] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/a7/Beastmaster_Boar_death.mp3) (currently in use)\n* [Boar death 2] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/52/Beas_ability_boar_death_01.mp3) (unused, this one could be used as a second attack response instead. One death response is enough.)\n* [Hawk move 1] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/b/b9/Beas_ability_hawk_move_01.mp3)\n* [Hawk death 1] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/de/Beastmaster_Hawk_death.mp3) (currently in use)\n* [Hawk death 2] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/8e/Beas_ability_hawk_death_01.mp3) (unused, this one could be used as a second move response instead. One death response is enough.)\n\nI have created demo response rule files for these, which can be found [here] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=279313)\n\n---\n#6. Suggestions for some unused responses of Beastmaster\n\nAs always, here are several suggestions for the hero's unused voice responses\n\n\n###1. Enable Beastmaster's Wild Axes cast responses\n\nWhy are they not enabled anyway? They aren't bad and fit quite well. Give them a 50% proc chance and it should be just fine.\n\n* [beas_ability_axes_00] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/6f/Beas_ability_axes_01.mp3): \"*Axes wild!*\"\n* [beas_ability_axes_03] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/72/Beas_ability_axes_03.mp3): \"*My blades fly!*\"\n* [beas_ability_axes_04] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/59/Beas_ability_axes_04.mp3): \"*Boomeraxe.*\"\n* [beas_ability_axes_05] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/9/95/Beas_ability_axes_05.mp3): \"*Wingblade.*\"\n* [beas_ability_axes_06] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7c/Beas_ability_axes_06.mp3): \"*Heyuhh!*\"\n* [beas_exert_01] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/cd/Beas_exert_01.mp3): \"*Hoaarr*\"\n* [beas_exert_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/e/e4/Beas_exert_02.mp3): \"*Haar*\"\n* [beas_exert_03] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/3/33/Beas_exert_03.mp3): \"*Hough*\"\n* [beas_exert_04] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/f4/Beas_exert_04.mp3): \"*Heeagh*\"\n\n###2. Enable Beastmaster's rare immortality, haste and invisibility lines\n\nAgain, why are this not enabled? They are good lines, and other heroes have more ridiculous/vague lines which are enabled.\n\n* [beas_immort_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/fd/Beas_immort_02.mp3): \"*A strict no-kill policy.*\"\n* [beas_haste_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/1f/Beas_haste_02.mp3): \"*Fast as falcon wings.*\"\n* [beas_invis_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/8e/Beas_invis_02.mp3): \"*Even eagle eyes couldn't see me.*\"\n\n###3. Use Beastmaster's anger/noise responses as rare move/attack responses\n\nBeastmaster is a man from the wild. He has many lines where he just makes noises (growling and similar). How about using them as move and attack responses, but with a lower proc chance, like 30%? Bunty Hunter has a similar system with his non-english responses.\n\nThe following would fit as move responses\n\n* [beas_anger_01] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7d/Beas_anger_01.mp3): \"*Heereh.*\"\n* [beas_anger_05] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/80/Beas_anger_05.mp3): \"*Heneneh.*\"\n* [beas_anger_06] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/12/Beas_anger_06.mp3): \"*Eurgh*\"\n* [beas_happy_01] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/4d/Beas_happy_01.mp3): \"*Heh.*\"\n* [beas_ability_failure_01] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/58/Beas_ability_failure_01.mp3): \"*Herreh.*\"\n\nAnd these would fit as attack responses\n\n* [beas_anger_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/21/Beas_anger_02.mp3): \"*Heararaeh.*\"\n* [beas_anger_03] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/85/Beas_anger_03.mp3): \"*Harreh.*\"\n* [beas_anger_04] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/4d/Beas_anger_04.mp3): \"*Heranene.*\"\n* [beas_ability_failure_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/ae/Beas_ability_failure_02.mp3): \"*Heh-noo!*\"\n* [beas_ability_failure_03] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/66/Beas_ability_failure_03.mp3): \"*Errehehehh.*\"\n\nAnd this one would work as a level up response\n\n* [beas_ability_animalsound_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/4f/Beas_ability_animalsound_02.mp3): \"*Aroo arooew!*\"\n\n###4. Use this unused call of the wild response as a spawn response\n\n* [beas_ability_callwild_01] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/50/Beas_ability_callwild_01.mp3): \"*Beasts, to me!*\"\n\n###5. Use this unused call of the wild response as a BattleBegins response\n\n* [beas_ability_callwild_02] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/2e/Beas_ability_callwild_02.mp3): \"*Wild ones, come!*\"\n\n###6. Use this unused pain response as a meeting-an-ally response towards Bristleback\n\n* [beas_pain_14] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/ac/Beas_pain_14.mp3): \"*Hey, you poked me!*\"\n\n###7. I know these aren't enable for thematic reasons, but they still could be enabled as an easter egg, with a 1% chance of happening, and not happeing more than once per game. Talking about these rare lines which play upon repeatedly selecting the hero.\n\n* [beas_rare_04] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/dc/Beas_rare_04.mp3): \"*Basshunter, on the hunt.*\"\n* [beas_rare_05] (https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/0/05/Beas_rare_05.mp3): \"*Basshunter, on the hunt.*\"\n\n---\n---\n---\n## Tooltip stuff\n---\n\n1. Wild Axes do not mention their damage/cut radius.\n2. Boar's Poison lists a damage type. It does not deal any damage, so it shouldn't show a damage type.\n3. Boar's Poison description is too vague. It does not say that the boar's attacks apply the effect.\n4. Primal Roar's SHOUT WIDTH: trait shows amplified value when holding ALT. It's listing an effect width, not a damage amount, it should not show amp'd values.\n\nThese are all actual issues. Here are some extra stuff which could be changed (lore changes can be seen in the image)\n\n1. Wild Axes has an unnecessary note telling it pierces spell immunity. Info is already in the header.\n2. Wild Axes has an unnecessary note saying it cuts trees. This info is already in the ability description.\n3. Call of the Wild: Hawk and Call of the Wild: Boar share the same lore text. A small tweak to both could be applied to have them unique.\n4. Hawk's Invisibility does not have a lore text.\n5. Boar's Poison does not have a lore text.\n6. Primal Roar has an unnecessary note telling it pierces spell immunity. Info is already in the header.\n\n\nHere are some new ALT notes for his spells:\n\n* Wild Axes note: The axes fly for a maximum of 2 seconds.\n* Wild Axes note: The axes spread 353 range apart from each other, trees and enemies inbetween them may not be hit.\n* Wild Axes note: The axes have 350 range flying vision.\n* Call of the Wild: Hawk note: Recasting Call of the Wild: Hawk does not replace alredy existing hawks.\n* Call of the Wild: Hawk note: The hawk is a flying unit, so it has unobstructed pathing and vision.\n* Call of the Wild: Hawk note: The hawk has a bounty of 30/40/50/60 gold and 77 experience.\n* Call of the Wild: Boar note: Recasting Call of the Wild: Boar does not replace alredy existing boars.\n* Call of the Wild: Boar note: The boar has 550 attack range, 1.25 base attack time, 350 movement speed and 1400/800 vision.\n* Call of the Wild: Boar note: The boar has a bounty of 26-38 gold and 60/70/80/90 experience.\n* Boar Poison note: Multiple instances of Poison do not stack.\n* Inner Beast note: Affects invulnerable units.\n* Primal Roar note: Only enemies are shoved aside, over 300 range for 0.6 seconds.\n* Primal Roar note: Enemies are fully disabled while getting shoved aside.\n* Primal Roar note: The pushback and slow have a dynamic range, based on the distance between Beastmaster and the primary target.\n\n[Image comparing the changes to the current
