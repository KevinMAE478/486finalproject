I think Techies can be eventually balanced and/or reworked such that the spirit of the hero remains intact but it is no more hated than, say, Slark or Tinker. 7.00 was a step forward in that regard, but if left unchanged, I think 7.05 was two steps back. Allow me to explain, starting with 7.00. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.00: A New Techies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7.00 came with a massive rework to Techies, including replacing Landmines with Proximity Mines. This change resulted in a host of new techniques regarding mine placement, all centered around using strategically placed Stasis Traps to root foes in just the right place to allow Proximity Mines to detonate onto them. You can read about it in detail &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/5u0a3m/techies_demolitions_mining_manual/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#39;ll briefly explain the relevant portion below as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although Proximity Mines cannot be placed directly on top of each other, they can be placed near enough that their AoEs overlap to form a Venn-Diagram-like shape. A Stasis Trap can then be strategically placed such that enemies will likely be rooted within the overlap area. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/a3T2hUJ.png\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a trap intended to catch enemies coming up the stairs. The Stasis should root them right in the middle of all three Proximity Mines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mechanic was complex, nuanced, and fun, requiring knowledge, creativity, and no small degree of intelligence to figure out how best to configure the mine setup taking into account surrounding terrain, neutral creep camps, lane creep walking paths, and likely enemy hero approach vectors. Combined with the other changes to Techies, the hero felt just as - or even more - fun as he did before the rework while also being less &amp;quot;cancerous&amp;quot; and a pain to deal with in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.05: A Necessary Nerf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have grown to trust Icefrog over the years, so right now I am steeling myself to accept that the 7.05 change (discussed briefly below) was needed. However, I will confess that when I first saw the patch notes my confidence in the Frog&amp;#39;s balance acumen was severely chipped. Whether he disregarded the above mining techniques or was simply not aware of them, neither option bodes well for those trusting the DotA team to take Techies in a good direction. Of course, I am getting ahead of myself; let us first discuss the 7.05 change and why I think they did it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of 7.05, Proximity Mines make a sound whenever an enemy steps into their radius. This is audible even if the mine itself cannot be seen. The most likely reason this was done was the Proximity Mine&amp;#39;s admittedly extreme strength when hidden in trees. Before the change, it was practically impossible to avoid the mines without avoiding every single treeline, due to them exploding before they could be seen. With the sound effect, this strength is somewhat balanced, keeping their extreme area denial but allowing foes the option of backing out instead of just blowing up every time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Death of Advanced Mining&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, even if we accept that the noise is needed to balance Proximity Mine&amp;#39;s power when they are scattered throughout the treeline, the noise alert effectively killed the advanced mining techniques I discussed in the first section. If it not clear why, view &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/a3T2hUJ.png\"&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; again. See how an enemy coming up the stairs will enter the Proximity Mine&amp;#39;s AoEs before the Stasis Trap&amp;#39;s AoE? This means that they will be alerted to the Trap&amp;#39;s presence before they are rooted, effectively rendering the trap completely nonviable against competent opponents. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that regardless of how you feel about Techies, removing such an interesting and nuanced mechanic from the game is unequivocally a bad thing. 7.00 introduced a new Techies that was simultaneously more fun to play with, as, and against. &lt;strong&gt;Even if you think Techies is in no way fun to play against, 7.00 was still a step in the right direction.&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s the point I am trying to stress here. 7.00 was good for Techies lovers and haters alike. It does not have to be a zero-sum game. 7.05, however, removed a lot of the nuance and viability of the hero, which will inevitably come back in the form of different buffs that may or may not add the same depth or depend on the same skill as the original &amp;#39;advanced mining&amp;#39; mechanics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Revive Advanced Mining&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I suggest advanced mining could be revived while still keeping the noise effect: &lt;strong&gt;Make Proximity Mines inactive while they are within the full detonation radius of a live Stasis Trap&lt;/strong&gt;. Recall that while the trigger radius of a Stasis Trap is 400, the full detonation AoE once it explodes is 600. &lt;strong&gt;Affected Proximity Mines are still revealed when enemies come near, they just will not make a sound or explode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a nerf right? Wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/a3T2hUJ.png\"&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; yet again. As we said earlier, enemies coming up the stairs will be alerted by the noise effect before they are rooted. However, imagine if the above change was implemented. All three Proximity Mines are within the (full) detonation AoE of the Stasis, so while they will be revealed when the enemy gets in range, they will not try to explode (and thus will not make a sound). Then, when the enemy triggers the Stasis Trap the Stasis Trap detonates, killing itself and thus freeing the Proximity Mines. All three Proximity Mines would then make their sounds and start their 1.6 second countdown to denotation, which the enemy is of course rooted during. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This simultaneously keeps the intended reason for the noise effect intact (assuming my interpretation is correct), since this only affects Proximity Mines paired with Stasis Traps as opposed to those just scattered in trees. Meanwhile, it makes all the unique, nuanced, and just downright &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; stuff you can do with Proximity Mines when combined with Stasis Traps viable again. It would also open up a ton of new possible configurations! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you feel about Techies, 7.00 pushed him in the right direction. Eventually I think Icefrog can get him to a place where he is no more hated than the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; most hated heroes like Slark or Naga Siren. However, while 7.05 did balance one arguably broken aspect of Proximity Mines, it killed an entire set of techniques that added a lot of fun, unique depth to the hero. I suggest a &amp;#39;fix&amp;#39; here that keeps the 7.05 nerf intact but revives &amp;#39;advanced mining&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and feedback! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Forward**\n---\n\nThe hero referred to in the title is Techies, but I know many will reflexively downvote any Techies-related complaint post so I left that part out.
