Overall it is a service that is in no way &amp;quot;necessary&amp;quot; or does anything good for the community - the only reason there are boosters is because people think they&amp;#39;re better than their actual MMR. The result is that the Boosting is not only ruining games on the way up, but also on the way down when an account buyers start losing DOZENS of games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a high MMR player/streamer/pro smurfs, it is in some sense necessary for him. He isn&amp;#39;t doing that to show off how good he is or to dumpster low mmr players, he is doing it because otherweise they have queue times of literally 60-100 minutes PER GAME. Additional to that, depending on the bracket, they aren&amp;#39;t even tryharding. Waga lost multiple games in a row in 3k bracket. He just randoms and plays his game and wins because he is playing better and smarter over the whole course of the game, not because he is dumpstering people in the mid lane and snowballing to victory within 30 minutes. All this &amp;quot;ruins&amp;quot; a game much less for all players than it would if there was a booster in the game. And in addition to that, it&amp;#39;s only the way up. These players need these accounts at some point, they don&amp;#39;t sell them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end, it&amp;#39;s a huge difference between a smurfing pro/streamer and a booster, not only in the end result, but also in the motivation/reason of playing in a lower bracket. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DotA2", "name": "t1_dg4bdhy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491949370.0, "created_utc": 1491920570.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ac7o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ullu13", "parent_id": "t1_dg44tq0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you wanna play for fun go play in low priority man.
