That type of micro isn&amp;#39;t hard for someone like day9, but what enables that play is game sense and knowledge of how opponents will act and what the limits of the hero are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr he needs more game sense to be at equal skill with his opponents and succeed with meepo. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DotA2", "name": "t1_dg72iss", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492082577.0, "created_utc": 1492053777.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651z4b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7f4wd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Innundator", "parent_id": "t1_dg70wn2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Viper in low MMR is abusively strong because that moment where you go 'I'm not going to win this fight, I thought I might but I have to get out now' people don't really have that thought at that mmr, so fights they thought they could win they just go oh well, I don't think I'll win this, then watch their hero die.
