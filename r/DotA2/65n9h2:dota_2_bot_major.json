What could that be, you may ask, that is the battle of AI for the throne of the best Dota 2 non human player (I doubt animals and alliens play dota 2). Since valve introduced the ability to make your own bots in 7.00, many good bots for dota 2 appeared! Most of them claim to be much better than stock ones, as well as better than others! Well, IT IS TIME WE PUT THAT TO THE TEST!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found 24 bots on the workshop, all top subscribed ones are participating, as well as most of the less subscribed ones, only ones that are not participating are bots that have same author and (same/similar) name as the bot that has more subs than it, as well as 1 v 1 bots. For example there are 2 &amp;quot;Russian Pub&amp;quot; bots from the same author, I picked the one that has more subs and mid only bots like [JPBOT] 1v1 SF MID, I also tried to pick bots with more features if possible, rather than more subbed one with less, example: [XIAODIGUA] bot, I picked the one that has Underlord in the description, despite the one without it being more subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seeded them as well, by the number of subs, that is not the most accurate seeding, but it is something, if a lot of people are using it, it must be good, right? IDK, we will see! Default bots are participating as well, as they are most definitely the most used bots of them all, and probably one of the better bots in the game since they are made by a big company rather than a small team or single individual who tried to make something as a hobby. All bots will be set to &amp;#39;Unfair&amp;#39; difficulty. \nyou can see the seeding of bots at the google drive link here: &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o43wT8OzS3t4dNrxqe9Iay_BdofrYn8i0rtL0zWg1M4/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o43wT8OzS3t4dNrxqe9Iay_BdofrYn8i0rtL0zWg1M4/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There will be 4 groups, 6 teams each, they will be playing best of 1 with every other team in the group, with best 2 bots advancing into knock-out round, which is single elimination, best of 3 (single because bots don&amp;#39;t just have a bad day, and make mistakes, and too keep the tournament shorter, it took me very long to organize it already)\nYou can see (at the link) that I assigned them to groups by the method  A-B-C-D-D-C-B-A.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes very long to organize this tournament because I wanted to record every game and upload it to Youtube, most of the games will not be very fun to watch, but I will point out games that were close as &amp;#39;GOOD&amp;#39; and the ones that are worst to watch as &amp;#39;BAD&amp;#39;. I will be releasing videos every 30 min on April 17th starting at 12 PM Central European Time, to make experience more &amp;quot;real tournament like&amp;quot; obviously it will not be even close, since bots are not as skilled as humans, and there will be no casters, and camera will be directed camera...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I will not be uploading nor recording some BAD games since they take too much time and are not fun to watch at all, BAD games are the ones where bots were not programmed to push at all, so it is more of a luck who wins, because creeps do all the pushing, and they are not clearing out creeps that are a threat for their towers, but rather randomly when they clear out the jungle first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the tournament bracket here: &lt;a href=\"http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94036\"&gt;http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94036&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rules are: 1 point for the win, 0 for loss (0 for draw), best of 1 in the group stage (teams are randomized weather they play on radiant or dire side), there will be no draws since it is best of 1.\nTiebreaker goes as following 1. Points 2.Score among teams in question 3. In game Kill/Death score 4. Rematch\n(3 and 4 are only needed if there are more than 2 teams tied)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If both teams playing the match are out of the competition, or there is no chance for the match to change the standings in the group, match will not be played, meaning if teams A and B are both out of the competition, and have match to play, it will be a 0-0 draw with 0 points going to each team, as well as if Team C claimed 1st place in the group and has to play team A what is either out of the competition, or 2nd place for sure, the game will not be played, but will be 0-0 Draw or 0-0 Win in favor of team C if that is required to make team first in the group (since bracketcloud has a different tie breaker, and uses in game score as secondary tool)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knock-out tournament bracket can be found here: &lt;a href=\"http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94038\"&gt;http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94038&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be updating the scores in those brackets as soon as I can, after the match has finished playing on the youtube, after the duration of video has passed from the time it was published. Videos are not edited or anything just uploaded raw as they were recorded, since it already took me a long time to make them because Directed camera is not available for the actuall game, but only for the replay, because bot only game has to be cast on local server, and DotaTV is not available for local servers. Since there are some bugs in dota with replays not saving from time to time, I had to rerun some games until I got the result I got in the first place (only who wins, not the exact kill score)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Group A will be played on 17th, B on 18th, C on 19th and D on 20th, Knockout stage will be on 21st, for the quarter finals and semi finals, and 3rd place playoff and finals will be on 22nd, all the same start times at Noon central European time.\nKnock out stage will be played top team on radiant, and bottom on dire, and switched for the game 2 (bottom team on radiant, top on dire).\nif game 3 is needed, team that was 1st in the group will play on the side it won it&amp;#39;s game, if it is needed with two 1st placed or two 2nd placed teams (semi finals) I will use random.org to generate number 1 or 2 (1 being top team, 2 being bottom team) and that team will play on the side they won.\nSame rules apply for game 5 in the finals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be posting links to some of the most interesting games here, as well as every 1st game of the day, also some &amp;quot;News&amp;quot; about upsets and interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why am I doing this? I have always liked organizing tournaments, and I think this is the fun way to find out what bot is the best bot out there. Also creators have a chance to see their bots do well (or not so well) in the tournament and improve on a lot of things, most of the bots are not very competent at the moment, but there was no way to find that out without stacking them to play against each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also plan to organize this before the next major to see how bots improved and new bots that were created, how well do they do. There will be many more bots next time, so this is a chance for some bots (top 8) to qualify directly for the next &amp;quot;BOT Major&amp;quot;. who knows, maybe one day this could become a legit tournament!\nI came up with this idea when I wanted to practice a new hero, and I used default unfair bots, and got a rampage in min 10 of the first game with a hero I have never played before, so I went to see if there are some better bots out there, but couldn&amp;#39;t decide which ones are better, so I will practice heroes using bots that win this tournament from now on (I hope they will be better than stock bots).\nAll bots were updated on 10th of April, and the ones that reach the playoffs will be updated again before I start recording Knock-Out stage (updating means unsubscribe, and subscribe again, some might auto update in the mean time, there is nothing I can do about it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in any details, you can read the stuff above, I think I explained most of it in max amount of detail.\nThere will be a bot tournament with unfair stock bots and most of custom bots, I will upload group games and results on 17th-20th (this month) 1 group every day, and knock out on 21st and 22nd.\nResults will be here : &lt;a href=\"http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94036\"&gt;http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94036&lt;/a&gt;\nand here: &lt;a href=\"http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94038\"&gt;http://bracketcloud.com/tournament/94038&lt;/a&gt;\nI will post links to games here as well.\nYou can see all the groups at the first link for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CHANNEL LINK: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PswwUBrOMy3b6KsWw032A\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PswwUBrOMy3b6KsWw032A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DAY 1\nGROUP A GAME 1: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/_F-q_Zo1WdU\"&gt;https://youtu.be/_F-q_Zo1WdU&lt;/a&gt; (will be available at noon central European time, just google &amp;quot;Berlin noon in my time&amp;quot; to find out when it is for you)\nDEFAULT UNFAIR vs GEMU_BOT_2017-2-14 5:54:14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BEST GAME OF THE DAY 1 : &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/2v7qhBq-5ug\"&gt;https://youtu.be/2v7qhBq-5ug&lt;/a&gt;\n??? vs ???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will not be posting links for other games for day 1, they will all be on the same channel at 12:30, 13:00, 13:30......
