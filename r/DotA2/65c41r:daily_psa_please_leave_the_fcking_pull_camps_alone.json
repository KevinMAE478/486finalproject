You understand that only a well constructed team can win games. Sometimes you don't get that though, and that can be frustrating.\n\nI play jungle heros quite frequently. While personally I try to communicate my plans with you I know sometimes others do not. It's true that my laning mechanics are not the best. Hell, I can play support at a 4k level but my mid lane mechanics sure aren't at a 4k level. That shit's scary.\n\nI mentioned that I play support. I do my best to keep the map warded and give you the space to gain your gold. I'll stack camps and zone the off laner for you. Sometime's I screw up though. \n\nSometimes I pull a camp too early and make you lose last hits. Sometimes I overextend while I try to zone and get caught out. Sometimes I forget to buy wards and leave the map dark.\n\nBut you make mistakes too OP! You can't claim that you land every single last hit. You don't perform perfectly in every single possible team fight. You sometimes don't even buy the right items for the situation you need them for. \n\nAnd yet... you claim it's never your fault. It's ALWAYS someone else's \"fault\". It's my \"fault\" that you died to the aggressive enemy laner because you think that you can still kill him 2 levels down. It's the mid laners \"fault\" for not ganking your lane. It's the offlaners \"fault\" that he's not being your \"tank\".\n\nI and other players like myself can only handle so much of your hate and frustration. When it gets to be too much, we retreat to the calm and peaceful recluses of the jungle. The neutrals don't bring our spirits down. They just give us a simple task, a break from the stress. Gain levels and items for myself and try make an impact.\n\nYou and I both know that this hardly works as well as a team working together. But you keep pushing your teammates away from you and you expect us to stick around? You keep berating and lecturing us and expect us to be perfect but we're not, and you're not perfect either...\n\nbut that's OK. If we were perfect then our win rate would be 100%. Not even the best players in the world have a win rate that high.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that our attitudes need to change. We have to be supportive of each other, not try and tear each other down. If you see a jungle player understand that he could be hurting just like us. I'm not saying encourage his habits but be supportive. If he comes to your aid in your lane then let him know you appreciate it! If he lands a great ultimate cheer him on! Sometimes you'll have to buy a ward yourself, but if he contributes vision then thank him for it.\n\nThe only way we can truly improve is if we open ourselves up to others. After all this is a team game, and we want to win. The only  possible way I can see that happening is if we work together and be kind to one another.\n\nSincerely, your support.", "edited": 1492188097.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I assumed OP was a carry player, so this is more directed towards carries.
