Do you want to hear actual insightful analysis  from pro players who play DotA for a living or do you want to hear people like Sheever who probably doesn&amp;#39;t even play DotA in her free time to get better and only speaks rubbish most of the time during analysis like in DAC? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is the point of having an &amp;#39;analyst desk&amp;#39; when 90% of the time it is going to be filled with casters who don&amp;#39;t even play the game enough to understand it better? I prefer this direction that Valve is heading in: inviting more pro players to give their insight on the panel so that the community as a whole can get better at DotA, but it&amp;#39;s a shame that some of the people here are more concerned about their voices than their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DotA2", "name": "t1_dga80jq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492255775.0, "created_utc": 1492226975.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga5xm7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zvraz", "parent_id": "t1_dga26x0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a 2k player, I am super excited to see what the pro players have to say about the game, however I probably wouldn't watch as much pro DotA without the crazy hype caters.
