It's also why Ember Spirit carries harder, as well as coming online earlier. I'm not suggesting they are the same sort of hero, just that they share one similarity.\n\nI am not sure what you are trying to say by mentioning that you \"have all your spells as Invoker.\"\n\n&gt; because I would suggest that @ your level kiting is far less common and far less skilfully done\n\nThis is 100% correct. I am mostly basing things off of my own experiences, but still from what I have seen of higher level gameplay there is a good chance you have to commit.\n\n&gt; I would venture to suggest your games are not representative of high skill play in this regard especially.\n\nMaybe, maybe not. I don't think Str cores having a lot of HP necessarily means they are worse but again that's a possibility. Then again, if it works, I don't see the issue.\n\n&gt; the rest isn't.\n\nHow so? 2200 HP with that little armor is pretty squishy (not support-level squishy, but he isn't exactly Tidehunter), and invis/movespeed are not reliable escapes. He has 1 spell that pierces BKB (Sun Strike) and another that is a buff to physical damage (Alacrity). Everything else is magical damage (Forge Spirits DPS is pathetic and they are really there for the armor reduction, so you can make it 7 if you want but I didn't consider that should be counted).\n\n&gt; Aghanim's and OC are part of your core.\n\nAghs, yes, but Octarine is usually purchased after Euls+BoTs+Blink in most cases, and in many cases games can end before that. Usually. Maybe you might want to get it earlier but such cases are pretty rare.\n\n&gt; yes, BKB counters your spells for a bit, but the fact that you are so mobile and have high physical damage allows you to play around it by kiting, going for the squishy backline or split pushing.\n\nInvoker is not a particularly strong split pusher. He's good, but he's no Furion. His physical damage is, at the end of the day, moderate, maybe a bit on the high side. Is it too high considering that he's meant to be a spellcaster? Probably, if you're factoring in Alacrity. Then again it isn't so high to the point of being gamebreaking.\n\nBKB on Antimage is not uncommon so it's not like its an incredibly deviating build that is solely there for Invoker. If you are buying Linken's on Invoker you are going to be making a pretty big sacrifice in another area. Missing out on an OC or a Euls or a Blink is pretty big.\n\n~~You're also forgetting~~ You didn't mention what a lot of people tend to forget about Antimage, his passive which raises his magical resistance to a total of like 62%, effectively making him more than twice as resistant to Invoker's spell damage as most other heroes. This means that if you can dodge Deafening Blast (which has 40sec cooldown) and you have an Aghs or Linken's to defend against Cold Snap you don't even need BKB because you can tank a lot of his damage. Bonus points if you go Heart or BKB on top of/instead of that, you can now tank almost all of his damage, burn away his mana, and nuke him hard. I'd say it's a pretty good counter, although of course the 8 other heroes in the match will come into play so you can't make such a straightforward judgment about how effective it will be.\n\n&gt; I've had games where I was camped so hard I only had Midas at 13 minutes but was top networth at the end.\n\nI'd like to see the individual matches to judge but my guess is that the opponents made significant mistakes or had absolutely no idea how to control the map effectively. If they are not able to win the game effectively 4v5 against an Invoker in the early game with only a Midas then they screwed up pretty hard.\n\n&gt; can easily come back.\n\nTakes quite a bit of time for him to do that though. If the enemy team allows that to happen that's on them knowing the strengths and weaknesses of enemy heroes.\n\n&gt; I also don't really see how you can say he doesn't synergise with anyone.\n\nWhen I said that I meant really strong synergy, as in SD-Luna level synergy. He actually did have a period of that with the Brewmaster Earth panda but that was thankfully nerfed. Of course there are heroes who work better with him than other and play to his strengths, otherwise he wouldn't be picked, but there isn't really a hero where when someone says \"I'll play Invoker\" you say \"yeah ok then for sure I am playing x\" in the same way as SD-Luna.\n\n&gt; Aghanim's is the only item you get to boost your strengths. everything else is literally for covering your weaknesses.\n\nOk that doesn't really nullify my point even if it's true, although it depends on what items you get. If you are getting the standard BoT + Midas + Octarine + Aghs + Blink + Euls, BoT improves mobility, Midas improves farming, Octarine improves spell spamming (combined with Aghs), Aghs is self explanatory, Blink again improves mobility, and Euls improves disabling and spell combos. The only areas where you are covering for weaknesses is health pool from Octarine Core and mana regen from Euls but if you are really wanting to cover for those weaknesses there are much better items to buy. The reason those are bought is because of the utility they offer, with the rest as more of a bonus. If you go Linkens of BKB for example I would consider that to be covering for your weaknesses.\n\n\nAgain I'm not saying he's perfectly balanced, Alacrity and Tornado are too strong and CDR/Spell Lifesteal on him are bullshit, and the movement speed may be an issue, maybe it isn't, but he isn't so gamebreaking to the point where nothing can be done about him or else he would be in every game like he was in 6.86.", "edited": 1492357249.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but you have to itemise for it and the game changes accordingly. conversely, you always have all your spells as Invoker. orher than Aghanim&amp;#39;s, everything is just mobility/survivability/sustain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course you have to itemize for it, which is why I mentioned it.

If they are not able to win the game effectively 4v5 against an Invoker in the early game with only a Midas then they screwed up pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;can easily come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Takes quite a bit of time for him to do that though. If the enemy team allows that to happen that&amp;#39;s on them knowing the strengths and weaknesses of enemy heroes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t really see how you can say he doesn&amp;#39;t synergise with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I said that I meant really strong synergy, as in SD-Luna level synergy. He actually did have a period of that with the Brewmaster Earth panda but that was thankfully nerfed. Of course there are heroes who work better with him than other and play to his strengths, otherwise he wouldn&amp;#39;t be picked, but there isn&amp;#39;t really a hero where when someone says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll play Invoker&amp;quot; you say &amp;quot;yeah ok then for sure I am playing x&amp;quot; in the same way as SD-Luna.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aghanim&amp;#39;s is the only item you get to boost your strengths. everything else is literally for covering your weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok that doesn&amp;#39;t really nullify my point even if it&amp;#39;s true, although it depends on what items you get. If you are getting the standard BoT + Midas + Octarine + Aghs + Blink + Euls, BoT improves mobility, Midas improves farming, Octarine improves spell spamming (combined with Aghs), Aghs is self explanatory, Blink again improves mobility, and Euls improves disabling and spell combos. The only areas where you are covering for weaknesses is health pool from Octarine Core and mana regen from Euls but if you are really wanting to cover for those weaknesses there are much better items to buy. The reason those are bought is because of the utility they offer, with the rest as more of a bonus. If you go Linkens of BKB for example I would consider that to be covering for your weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again I&amp;#39;m not saying he&amp;#39;s perfectly balanced, Alacrity and Tornado are too strong and CDR/Spell Lifesteal on him are bullshit, and the movement speed may be an issue, maybe it isn&amp;#39;t, but he isn&amp;#39;t so gamebreaking to the point where nothing can be done about him or else he would be in every game like he was in 6.86.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DotA2", "name": "t1_dgc5smy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385861.0, "created_utc": 1492357061.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0yaj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gmdotes", "parent_id": "t1_dgapfgz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Ember Spirit is another example of a hero who is currently played as a spellcaster (sort of?) and yet is capable of putting out a lot of physical damage in the lategame (although requiring more itemization, then again Ember Spirit is strong from level 10 and onwards).

Now keep in mind these test were done against a target that does not have BKB, and the Spirits' Melting Strike does not pierce spell immunity so it is somewhat skewed, total DPS without Melting Strike was more around 700.\n\nGuess what the opposing team can do to negate your damage?

If we&amp;#39;re gonna count the total cost of the items you mentioned, that&amp;#39;s 19,550 gold&amp;#39;s worth of items and at the end of it at level 25, six slotted, you get 2220 health, 263 damage with Exort, and 8.59 armor (still less than what Terrorblade starts with). So you do not have 400 attack damage with these items that you listed, even with Alacrity (which can be purged by the way) you have 363 damage. Compare this to the Drow Ranger, who with a Hurricane Pike, Butterfly, Silver Edge, and Manta has 478 damage at her disposal, and at a much higher attack speed. When tested on a dummy target (without the Manta illusions) this gave about 1200 DPS. On the same dummy, the 6-slotted 3-Exort Invoker hit for about 375 DPS without Alacrity or Spirits. With Alacrity it was 620, with Spirits it was about 800. Now keep in mind these test were done against a target that does not have BKB, and the Spirits&amp;#39; Melting Strike does not pierce spell immunity so it is somewhat skewed, total DPS without Melting Strike was more around 700.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guess what the opposing team can do to negate your damage?
