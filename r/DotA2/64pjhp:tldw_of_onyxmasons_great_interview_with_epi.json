We weren&amp;#39;t feeling it when we talked to these people or played with them. So we looked outside of NA.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Abed was interested in joining a team so Bulba or Jimmy got in contact with him and tried to convince him to move to NA.

It isn&amp;#39;t good to be whiny or cancerous.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everyone but Abed is a veteran in the scene so they remain calm and unbiased.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everyone tries to be supportive and they suppress the urge to bitch and whine. Objectivity and neutrality is key.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#39;s a middle ground between flaming and sugarcoating, honesty is very important.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Being an asshole and critiquing teammates is not Mason&amp;#39;s idea of good criticism.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1283\"&gt;EG.Mason 0:21:23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Back in EG Mason was very new to the scene. He was just there to play his game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason received the most criticism in that iteration of EG.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As a game leader Mason has grown a lot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason&amp;#39;s time on EG helped him learn a lot about DotA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason talks to RTZ everyday.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1385\"&gt;Good Teams Right Now 0:23:05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IG are way better than everyone else atm. They&amp;#39;re very methodical and systematic whilst retaining their individual plays and skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;OG, EG, Newbee are also insanely good.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IG take early towers yet manage to defend their own with ease.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IG drafts in a way that they can win their lanes, take objectives, and still manage to scale into the late game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3084258454\"&gt;There was this one game where Burning was playing Weaver&lt;/a&gt; in a trilane and he made ridiculously good rotations all game. He kept putting insane amounts of pressure on the map. That was very impressive because it wasn&amp;#39;t like old Burning. It was ridiculously efficient, aggressive, and mobile.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1712\"&gt;Carry Rotations (0:28:30)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason can&amp;#39;t say too much about this even though he has his own theory on when the carry should rotate. There&amp;#39;s specific things Mason looks for before he rotates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Burning is awesome because despite being a veteran he was able to adapt so well into this meta. Some older players get stubborn and refuse to adapt.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1843\"&gt;More Talk about Teams (0:30:41)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason want to beat IG, OG, and then VP.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VP and IG&amp;#39;s playstyles are actually quite similar whilst OG&amp;#39;s is different.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Onyx has only scrimmed NA teams yet. They can only assess non-NA teams by their official games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Onyx will start bootcamping for Kiev in a week so they&amp;#39;ll get to scrim all those teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1942\"&gt;Pocket Strats (0:32:45)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#39;s definitely some pocket strats that have yet to be revealed. Meta is still quite fresh.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NP&amp;#39;s Medusa mid was surprisingly strong. Their Dazzle+Beastmaster was very strong.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Medusa was strong because she counters Lifestealer who was one of the popular picks at the tournament. Plus, everyone was doing midas gaming which is really slow and Medusa benefits tremendously from slow DotA. On top of that she&amp;#39;s very hard to gank middle. MK can&amp;#39;t gank a Medusa mid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2084\"&gt;Abed&amp;#39;s Meepo (0:34:44)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meepo is niche and you can&amp;#39;t first pick him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Abed&amp;#39;s Meepo is OP through and &lt;a href=\"https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3053809319\"&gt;he could even play it against a Winter Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2187\"&gt;Between EG.Mason and Onyx.Mason (0:36:27)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason took a break after EG and was questioning his future in DotA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He once said in an interview that he won&amp;#39;t do competitive DotA unless it&amp;#39;s with friends. However, he takes that statement back because competition is fulfilling for Mason.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After TI5 Mason got on some teams that were barely teams. It was like a stack and that&amp;#39;s it. No captain, no strats, just scrims. No one was going the extra mile.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;No one would try to go the extra mile. A bunch of people who wanted to play but didn&amp;#39;t want to put everything on the line.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On Onyx no one is going to school and they do and discuss DotA all day. The commitment is real.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason was eventually tired of these nonsense teams that were half-serious. Playing and losing all the time is very frustrating, stressful, and draining.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I want to be part of a team that gives a shit and be successful.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Artour talked to Bulba about Mason joining Onyx and then Bulba approached Mason.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;It sucked going from EG to playing with these stacks. [Forget about] not doing well in a LAN, I&amp;#39;m not even going to LANs! I&amp;#39;m not even qualifying for LANs! I&amp;#39;m not even getting second place in the qualifiers. This is so much worse than EG. It&amp;#39;s kind of sad in a sense but I didn&amp;#39;t let it get me down. I just pushed myself harder every single time.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason still learned from stacks. He learned what NOT to do. So it wasn&amp;#39;t a complete waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2593\"&gt;Lessons Learnt (0:42:11)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To not have an attitude problem. Be positive and kind to other players.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To pick up your teammates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To treat other players like actual people. They have feelings and you should respect that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify your mistakes. &amp;quot;What did they do well? What did I not do well?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Healthy post-game discussions are very very useful.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Discussion should be short and not a 2 hour rant.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2832\"&gt;Bulba (0:47:12)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bulba has a LOT of DotA experience. He&amp;#39;s played with the best of the best and he&amp;#39;s even coached teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He sees the game from a lot of perspectives and that brings something new to the table.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;He has, probably, more experience than anyone!&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He&amp;#39;s a DotA fiend.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;His analysis is concise and precise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You need people like that, you need people who care and are kind of nerdy in a sense.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3011\"&gt;Team Environment (0:50:11)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4 of us are low energy and Bulba is high energy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bulba screams sometimes and goes wild with energy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3170\"&gt;DotA Homies (0:52:50)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ritsu, Yawar, RTZ, Waytosexy... NA Goons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Waytosexy is Onyx&amp;#39;s coach and is a huge help.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dubu and Waytosexy started off rocky because Dubu had no idea who Waytosexy was but they&amp;#39;ve grown much closer and have a lot of respect for each other&amp;#39;s ideas now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3308\"&gt;Demon (0:55:08)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jimmy is a good teammates in game and outside the game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jimmy is super relaxed and encourages everyone.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In game Jimmy always makes the best smoke and rosh calls.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3380\"&gt;Dubu (0:56:20)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mason didn&amp;#39;t know much about Dubu so he was a bit unsure about him but they grew a lot closer over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Calm captain with a good attitude.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Never flames anyone.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Genuinely nice [guy].&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3423\"&gt;Abed (0:57:03)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t say much. Probably shy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PPD said, &amp;quot;you need a polarizing player&amp;quot; and Abed does that for Onyx.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Onyx plays around Abed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Really good player with a lot of potential.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3471\"&gt;Swindlezz Beef (0:57:51)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I respect him [for] the fact that he tries and he&amp;#39;s clearly dedicated and emotional about DotA. But as a person I think we are really different. If I ran into him at a LAN I wouldn&amp;#39;t run up to him and say, &amp;#39;What&amp;#39;s your problem!?&amp;#39; I wouldn&amp;#39;t run up on him or anything. But I&amp;#39;d probably just keep my distance.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3528\"&gt;Drama (0:58:48)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone tries to stay friendly with each other to avoid exactly what happened between EE and Puppey. It&amp;#39;s kind of... I don&amp;#39;t want to say embarrassing or something like that but... idk... I just... I get into altercations in pubs with people but I usually try to keep the flaming itself at a minimal. Beefs aren&amp;#39;t good for the scene right now. People are way too PC. No one wants the Puppey/EE drama. Just play DotA and move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I love drama, it&amp;#39;s great to read but at the same time you don&amp;#39;t really want to be a part of it.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3646\"&gt;Pet Peeves in Pubs (1:00:45)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PSA: Please listen to each other and play as a team. Way too many people with egos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pubs sometimes is just watching everyone farm and trying to make solo plays.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I had a game last night with some of my Peruvian comrades. My support made me third pick core and so I picked Slark because it looked like an OK Slark game but then it got followed up by two counters: Axe and Void. They&amp;#39;re pretty good vs Slark. I say during the game as our throne is falling, &amp;#39;Man, I can&amp;#39;t third pick Slark and you fourth pick a roamer! You need to help me in lane!&amp;#39; My last pick Alchemist starts flaming me, shoutout to vanN, and I&amp;#39;m just like &amp;#39;Dude, you picked Alchemist while I&amp;#39;m Slark and you&amp;#39;re not making any space for me. Alchemist Slark dual core is not good. They&amp;#39;re both pretty bad together.... Stuff like that. Zero concepts of teamwork.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3761\"&gt;Will the Pub Mentality Ever Change? (1:02:39)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I played LoL... It&amp;#39;s hard in DotA. There&amp;#39;s so much more ego in DotA. I mean LoL isn&amp;#39;t the greatest community either but in DotA particularly there&amp;#39;s so much ego and everyone wants to play core only because supports are boring or whatever. There&amp;#39;s also NA and EU you have Russians and Peruvians with language barriers and that can be annoying. In LoL it&amp;#39;s a little different and it isn&amp;#39;t as bad there. It&amp;#39;s really just DotA where no one wants to listen and play with each other.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Peruvians are fine for the most part but if they don&amp;#39;t speak English I cant communicate with them. I don&amp;#39;t want to generalize but some of the higher MMR Peruvians in NA don&amp;#39;t give a shit and they throw over the littlest things.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3948\"&gt;Reddit (1:05:48)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Reddit is... I still read it every single day. &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; and not just &lt;a href=\"/r/Dota2\"&gt;r/Dota2&lt;/a&gt;. Reddit is fine but when it comes to media people flame Fox News because they have an agenda and they just make things up. I feel like &lt;a href=\"/r/Dota2\"&gt;r/Dota2&lt;/a&gt; is like that too. People just make stuff up and it gets upvoted and all of a sudden this thing that was upvoted, regardless of its veracity, becomes a fact. People start bandwagoning. It&amp;#39;s kind of shitty but I still enjoy Reddit.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=4066\"&gt;Shoutouts (1:07:47)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you to everyone who has supported us and nice words people have said to me and my teammates.

Abed said he needed some time to think about such a big decision.\n* 2 Hours later he said yes.\n\n*[Mason's Take on the 7.xx (0:10:40)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=640)*\n\n* 7.00-7.03 changed how DotA was played and it favoured aggression.\n* 7.04 is still fast but slower.\n* There's like 5 heroes that are way better than all other heroes. MK is one of them.\n* Mason is reminded of 6.83 Sniper/Troll meta.\n* Not much cheese just some OP heroes.\n* People pick heroes for their talent trees. See: LD, Lina.\n* Shrines make the offlane easier. They also make it hard to get map control before you take a Tier 3 tower.\n\n*[Dealing with Stresses in Game (0:14:50)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=896)*\n\n* PPD was good for the most part but he got mad sometimes but it was silent mad.\n* In Onyx they instantly talk about what's wrong. It isn't good to be whiny or cancerous.\n* Everyone but Abed is a veteran in the scene so they remain calm and unbiased.\n* Everyone tries to be supportive and they suppress the urge to bitch and whine. Objectivity and neutrality is key.\n* There's a middle ground between flaming and sugarcoating, honesty is very important.\n* Being an asshole and critiquing teammates is not Mason's idea of good criticism.\n\n*[EG.Mason 0:21:23](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1283)*\n\n* Back in EG Mason was very new to the scene. He was just there to play his game.\n* Mason received the most criticism in that iteration of EG.\n* As a game leader Mason has grown a lot.\n* Mason's time on EG helped him learn a lot about DotA.\n* Mason talks to RTZ everyday.\n\n*[Good Teams Right Now 0:23:05](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1385)*\n\n* IG are way better than everyone else atm. They're very methodical and systematic whilst retaining their individual plays and skills.\n* OG, EG, Newbee are also insanely good.\n* IG take early towers yet manage to defend their own with ease.\n* IG drafts in a way that they can win their lanes, take objectives, and still manage to scale into the late game.\n* [There was this one game where Burning was playing Weaver](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3084258454) in a trilane and he made ridiculously good rotations all game. He kept putting insane amounts of pressure on the map. That was very impressive because it wasn't like old Burning. It was ridiculously efficient, aggressive, and mobile.\n\n*[Carry Rotations (0:28:30)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1712)*\n\n* Mason can't say too much about this even though he has his own theory on when the carry should rotate. There's specific things Mason looks for before he rotates.\n* Burning is awesome because despite being a veteran he was able to adapt so well into this meta. Some older players get stubborn and refuse to adapt.\n\n*[More Talk about Teams (0:30:41)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1843)*\n\n* Mason want to beat IG, OG, and then VP.\n* VP and IG's playstyles are actually quite similar whilst OG's is different.\n* Onyx has only scrimmed NA teams yet. They can only assess non-NA teams by their official games.\n* Onyx will start bootcamping for Kiev in a week so they'll get to scrim all those teams.\n\n*[Pocket Strats (0:32:45)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=1942)*\n\n* There's definitely some pocket strats that have yet to be revealed. Meta is still quite fresh.\n* NP's Medusa mid was surprisingly strong. Their Dazzle+Beastmaster was very strong.\n* The Medusa was strong because she counters Lifestealer who was one of the popular picks at the tournament. Plus, everyone was doing midas gaming which is really slow and Medusa benefits tremendously from slow DotA. On top of that she's very hard to gank middle. MK can't gank a Medusa mid.\n\n*[Abed's Meepo (0:34:44)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2084)*\n\n* Meepo is niche and you can't first pick him.\n* Abed's Meepo is OP through and [he could even play it against a Winter Wyvern](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3053809319).\n\n*[Between EG.Mason and Onyx.Mason (0:36:27)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2187)*\n\n* Mason took a break after EG and was questioning his future in DotA.\n* He once said in an interview that he won't do competitive DotA unless it's with friends. However, he takes that statement back because competition is fulfilling for Mason.\n* After TI5 Mason got on some teams that were barely teams. It was like a stack and that's it. No captain, no strats, just scrims. No one was going the extra mile.\n* \"No one would try to go the extra mile. A bunch of people who wanted to play but didn't want to put everything on the line.\"\n* On Onyx no one is going to school and they do and discuss DotA all day. The commitment is real.\n* Mason was eventually tired of these nonsense teams that were half-serious. Playing and losing all the time is very frustrating, stressful, and draining.\n* \"I want to be part of a team that gives a shit and be successful.\"\n* Artour talked to Bulba about Mason joining Onyx and then Bulba approached Mason.\n* \"It sucked going from EG to playing with these stacks. [Forget about] not doing well in a LAN, I'm not even going to LANs! I'm not even qualifying for LANs! I'm not even getting second place in the qualifiers. This is so much worse than EG. It's kind of sad in a sense but I didn't let it get me down. I just pushed myself harder every single time.\"\n* Mason still learned from stacks. He learned what NOT to do. So it wasn't a complete waste of time.\n\n*[Lessons Learnt (0:42:11)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2593)*\n\n* To not have an attitude problem. Be positive and kind to other players.\n* To pick up your teammates.\n* To treat other players like actual people. They have feelings and you should respect that.\n* Identify your mistakes. \"What did they do well? What did I not do well?\"\n* Healthy post-game discussions are very very useful.\n* Discussion should be short and not a 2 hour rant.\n\n*[Bulba (0:47:12)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=2832)*\n\n* Bulba has a LOT of DotA experience. He's played with the best of the best and he's even coached teams.\n* He sees the game from a lot of perspectives and that brings something new to the table.\n* \"He has, probably, more experience than anyone!\"\n* He's a DotA fiend.\n* His analysis is concise and precise.\n* \"You need people like that, you need people who care and are kind of nerdy in a sense.\"\n\n*[Team Environment (0:50:11)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3011)*\n\n* 4 of us are low energy and Bulba is high energy.\n* Bulba screams sometimes and goes wild with energy.\n\n*[DotA Homies (0:52:50)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3170)*\n\n* Ritsu, Yawar, RTZ, Waytosexy... NA Goons.\n* Waytosexy is Onyx's coach and is a huge help.\n* Dubu and Waytosexy started off rocky because Dubu had no idea who Waytosexy was but they've grown much closer and have a lot of respect for each other's ideas now.\n\n*[Demon (0:55:08)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3308)*\n\n* Jimmy is a good teammates in game and outside the game.\n* Jimmy is super relaxed and encourages everyone.\n* In game Jimmy always makes the best smoke and rosh calls.\n\n*[Dubu (0:56:20)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3380)*\n\n* Mason didn't know much about Dubu so he was a bit unsure about him but they grew a lot closer over time.\n* Calm captain with a good attitude.\n* Never flames anyone.\n* \"Genuinely nice [guy].\"\n\n*[Abed (0:57:03)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3423)*\n\n* Doesn't say much. Probably shy.\n* PPD said, \"you need a polarizing player\" and Abed does that for Onyx.\n* Onyx plays around Abed.\n* Really good player with a lot of potential.\n\n*[Swindlezz Beef (0:57:51)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3471)*\n\n* \"I respect him [for] the fact that he tries and he's clearly dedicated and emotional about DotA. But as a person I think we are really different. If I ran into him at a LAN I wouldn't run up to him and say, 'What's your problem!?' I wouldn't run up on him or anything. But I'd probably just keep my distance.\"\n\n*[Drama (0:58:48)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3528)*\n\n* \"Everyone tries to stay friendly with each other to avoid exactly what happened between EE and Puppey. It's kind of... I don't want to say embarrassing or something like that but... idk... I just... I get into altercations in pubs with people but I usually try to keep the flaming itself at a minimal. Beefs aren't good for the scene right now. People are way too PC. No one wants the Puppey/EE drama. Just play DotA and move on.\"\n* \"I love drama, it's great to read but at the same time you don't really want to be a part of it.\"\n\n*[Pet Peeves in Pubs (1:00:45)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3646)*\n\n* PSA: Please listen to each other and play as a team. Way too many people with egos.\n* Pubs sometimes is just watching everyone farm and trying to make solo plays.\n* \"I had a game last night with some of my Peruvian comrades. My support made me third pick core and so I picked Slark because it looked like an OK Slark game but then it got followed up by two counters: Axe and Void. They're pretty good vs Slark. I say during the game as our throne is falling, 'Man, I can't third pick Slark and you fourth pick a roamer! You need to help me in lane!' My last pick Alchemist starts flaming me, shoutout to vanN, and I'm just like 'Dude, you picked Alchemist while I'm Slark and you're not making any space for me. Alchemist Slark dual core is not good. They're both pretty bad together.... Stuff like that. Zero concepts of teamwork.\"\n\n*[Will the Pub Mentality Ever Change? (1:02:39)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3761)*\n\n* \"I played LoL... It's hard in DotA. There's so much more ego in DotA. I mean LoL isn't the greatest community either but in DotA particularly there's so much ego and everyone wants to play core only because supports are boring or whatever. There's also NA and EU you have Russians and Peruvians with language barriers and that can be annoying. In LoL it's a little different and it isn't as bad there. It's really just DotA where no one wants to listen and play with each other.\"\n* \"Peruvians are fine for the most part but if they don't speak English I cant communicate with them. I don't want to generalize but some of the higher MMR Peruvians in NA don't give a shit and they throw over the littlest things.\"\n\n*[Reddit (1:05:48)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=3948)*\n\n* \"Reddit is... I still read it every single day. r/all and not just r/Dota2. Reddit is fine but when it comes to media people flame Fox News because they have an agenda and they just make things up. I feel like r/Dota2 is like that too. People just make stuff up and it gets upvoted and all of a sudden this thing that was upvoted, regardless of its veracity, becomes a fact. People start bandwagoning. It's kind of shitty but I still enjoy Reddit.\"\n\n*[Shoutouts (1:07:47)](https://youtu.be/UvBeChssGLg?t=4066)*\n\n* \"Thank you to everyone who has supported us and nice words people have said to me and my teammates. Some times people get flamey but we really appreciate the nice words. Thank you to BTS for letting us bootcamp there for Kiev Qualifiers. Thank you to Peter (Waytosexy), our coach, and also KGB, our manager. Thank you to Epi for interviewing me.\"\n\n****\n*[Please follow Epi on twitter and let him know who you want him to interview next.](https://twitter.com/EpiDota2/)*", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Interview | eSports", "id": "64pjhp", "gilded": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 744, "report_reasons": null, "author": "limaj_daas", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64pjhp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.DotA2", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "author_cakeday": true, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "interview esports", "author_flair_css_class": "pennant teamnp", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/DotA2/comments/64pjhp/tldw_of_onyxmasons_great_interview_with_epi/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491926847.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/64pjhp/tldw_of_onyxmasons_great_interview_with_epi/", "author_flair_text": "Resident Transcriber", "quarantine": false, "title": "tl;dw of Onyx.Mason's great interview with Epi", "created_utc": 1491898047.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 204, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 744}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pjhp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pjhp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pjhp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg46iwc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wavemode", "parent_id": "t1_dg45pzq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's lots of people on NA leaderboards who I suspect just maintain their MMR by carrying wins in 5k average games but throw everything else.

Then W33ha and Misery get kicked, Secret start doing worse, and suddenly they only won Shanghai cause W33ha carried them. Shit like this happens all the damn time on this sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally as an Alliance fan thats watched every single game since Loda and Akke joined NTH, it drives me crazy when complete bullshit about their playstyle etc gets upvoted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure its the same for fans of other teams/players. Watching people who so clearly know nothing about the team or players sprout made up shit and get upvoted for it is one of the most frustrating things on this sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DotA2", "name": "t1_dg41b5d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491928956.0, "created_utc": 1491900156.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 129}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pjhp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pjhp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4wj7t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dat_Speed", "parent_id": "t1_dg4783d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I feel like im reading a 1900s telegram style writing with modern context lol.
