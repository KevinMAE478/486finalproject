I searched this Spiderman and Elsa stuff on YouTube and apparently I went down an alternate, equally disturbing path. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first video I found was mostly normal with a few very inappropriate &amp;quot;jokes&amp;quot; (e.g., oh look a magic trick, what&amp;#39;s under the cloth? It&amp;#39;s my hand, grab.) that I could explain as stupid people who don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s appropriate for children...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I went further and suddenly most of the women are wearing bikinis and dancing and the male heroes are trying to get close with them...? Enter some weird love-triangle thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the next video was pretty much softcore fetish porn  &lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FM2ZGbo4j30\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FM2ZGbo4j30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what the fuck is going on but I can&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s being allowed to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dgd1v7k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492428834.0, "created_utc": 1492400034.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 83}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rkxv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rkxv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgczpgv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 48, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JaBooty", "parent_id": "t1_dgcxiz8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[this explains the second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBWf6Zvn0jQ) but I have no idea about the first one", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBWf6Zvn0jQ\"&gt;this explains the second one&lt;/a&gt; but I have no idea about the first one&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dgczpgv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492425758.0, "created_utc": 1492396958.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcxiz8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 51, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rednblue525252", "parent_id": "t1_dgcrxvq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dgcxiz8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492422704.0, "created_utc": 1492393904.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 51}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rkxv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd1z2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GingerBiscuitss", "parent_id": "t1_dgcrxvq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They view-bot too.
