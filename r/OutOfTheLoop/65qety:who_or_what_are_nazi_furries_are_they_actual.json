There are a bunch of stories claiming that a \"nazi group\" took over, but there's little evidence to substantiate this as far as I can tell. The group being accused is called the \"Furry Raiders\", and while they did have some disputes with the con staff over room booking (which were eventually resolved with no hard feelings), nobody's been able to come up with any evidence that this is a \"nazi\" group. The common complaint is that they wear [arm bands](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdYIwuUUMAAG60G.jpg) that sort of resemble Nazi arm bands. The Furry Raiders website states:\n\n&gt;Furry Raider's mission is to help build a stronger and better community while encouraging personal creativity and expression. \n\n&gt;\\&gt;Why does the group have questionable imagery?\n\n&gt;Our white and black paw logo was created by the group and any use of the color or pattern is personal choice by each member. Currently, the default color is red created by Furry Raider CEO.\n\n&gt;\\&gt;Do we have a political agenda or stance?\n\n&gt;Furry Raiders do not have any political agenda or stance as a group. All members have their own personal preference.\n\nSome drama on Twitter happened between members of the convention staff and some attendees (or people who gave the impression that they were attending while actually not intending to... it's complicated, see 2's video), threats of violence were involved, and all this caused a perfect shitstorm which may have contributed to the convention's decision to close its doors.\n\nI feel obligated to add: the furry fandom is one of the most accepting and understanding groups of people you'll ever come across, and if there even *are* any \"Nazi Furries\", they're an extremely small minority just like Nazis are an extremely small minority in America overall. Unfortunately, the mainstream media jumped all over this story because it's pretty juicy (at least it seems that way, if you're going off of the shit being thrown around online).\n\nNobody's really sure what *exactly* caused RMFC to shut down at this point, and nobody's really sure what the purpose of this \"Furry Raiders\" group is, but people have a way of stirring up drama on the internet and the reality is likely pretty mundane.
