If he was at any time instructed by a crew member to get off of the aircraft then he&amp;#39;s got a problem. Sure, it may be a bullshit argument for the airline to hang its hat on, and he may well win his case in front of an Administrative Law Judge a few months later, but in the short term he&amp;#39;s still missed his flight and had an encounter with law enforcement. I&amp;#39;m only chiming in to advise caution if you find yourself in this situation. If you put up a fight they&amp;#39;ll say you&amp;#39;re disruptive and are threatening safety of flight, and when that happens you&amp;#39;re in cuffs. Whether or not they have a right to bump you is secondary to the question of whether they can kick you off the airplane for noncompliance.
