The commentary given by the likes of Total Biscuit or the random ramblings of Jesse Cox aren&amp;#39;t as easy to come to as you may think. They sell their entertainment. Same as an actor or musician. If anything the work of a YouTuber is undervalued. The ability to spread information and find a niche to appeal to certain groups of people and disseminate the right information or entertainment is a skill and talent not many people posses. You find your strength and play by them if this is &amp;quot;not a real job&amp;quot; find out specifically how certain youtubers have an impact on the average person. Best example i can give is with regards to Totalbiscuits shaming of G2A which has been found to be selling stolen codes. You tell me whether or not that adds value. If it does then who the fuck are you to determine what constitutes a &amp;quot;real job&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dg925lx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492201103.0, "created_utc": 1492172303.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8xs5d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cybersteel", "parent_id": "t1_dg8xed1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cashier at McDonald's.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashier at McDonald&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dg8xs5d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492188427.0, "created_utc": 1492159627.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -41}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8xed1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gohack", "parent_id": "t1_dg8wz39", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do you do for a living?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you do for a living?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dg8xed1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492187184.0, "created_utc": 1492158384.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8wz39", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -118, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cybersteel", "parent_id": "t1_dg8656x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Its not a real job in the first place.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its not a real job in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dg8wz39", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492185864.0, "created_utc": 1492157064.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -118}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8656x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 331, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gnfnrf", "parent_id": "t3_656xkb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So, there's a long post detailing some of the underlying forces at work, and I can't add anything to it, but I can shed some light on some of the specific things that creators are seeing, and it's not as simple as videos being demonetized.\n(EDIT:  The post I refer to is gone.
