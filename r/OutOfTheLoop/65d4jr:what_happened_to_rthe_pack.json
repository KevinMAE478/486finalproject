I joined the conversation after NTU had said that he would ban anyone who shit talked France.

So then I asked him, &amp;quot;Do you get offended when people say oui oui baguette etc.&amp;quot; so he gets kinda pissed and says &amp;quot;did you really just ask me that question?&amp;quot; For the next few minutes, we kept trying to calm NTU down, assuming he was drunk or something.

He threatens to nuke the sub if the controversial posts keep coming out. The mod and NTU come to an agreement.
