Here are a few reasons. Note that I am a huge fan of Humble Bundle and purchase from them regularly (albeit not as regularly as I used to.)\n\n-Humble Monthly A) is not cheap compared to the \"pay what you want\" bundles, B) does not donate all that much to charity, C) often has games that are simply not very good, and most crucially D) has featured games already given away in regular Bundles (The Witness being the most recent and obvious.) What you end up with is a perceived lack of value.\n\n-Humble Bundle used to be special in that it was the best at what it did. A few other bundle sites existed but nothing really had the quality of Humble Bundle. Often AAA games were included and bundles would sell like hot cakes. Now lots of repeated games are included (I recently gave away around 100 duplicate keys to friends) which makes the entire site less useful. A recent Jumbo Bundle was pitifully small and, frankly, overpriced. Which brings me to...\n\n-Fixed pricing. Previously it was simple. You paid what you want. 1 cent to 99 cents got you DRM-free games, a dollar got you steam keys, above average got you bonuses. Now they'll have price tiers, so $5 will get you two more games, $10 will get you four more, $25 will get you a tshirt, etc. Again, it's a perceived lack of value, and it's taking away from what Humble Bundle used to be like.\n\n-Politics. The Freedom Bundle was amazing. I paid above the asking price and told every gamer I know to buy the bundle. It was spectacular value and gave money to what I considered to be great causes, especially the ACLU. But by making the ACLU the most advertised recipient of the charity for that bundle and with ALL money going to charity, people who were in favor of Trump's Muslim ban were not happy and nor were people who preferred to choose where their money went; again, this is something that used to be integral to how Humble Bundle operated. Just look at some of the replies on Twitter - https://twitter.com/humble/status/831245058963824641\n\n-Speaking of losing what used to make them special, they also ran a few DRM-heavy bundles, specifically the Ubisoft Origin bundles. Humble Bundle used to be extremely anti-DRM and it was seen as a huge step back to support Ubisoft and their somewhat draconian DRM.\n\n-A heavy leaning towards book and mobile bundles. People tend to favor the gaming ones. No big secret there, it's obvious just from the sales. It makes it a bit disheartening when a book bundle is valued in the hundreds compared to the gaming bundles which are gradually waning away.\n\nThe reason you see so many negative comments and dislikes is because the people getting mad at the service are more likely to complain about the changes they hate than the people who *enjoy* the service are to post about the things they like staying the same.

Note that I am a huge fan of Humble Bundle and purchase from them regularly (albeit not as regularly as I used to.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Humble Monthly A) is not cheap compared to the &amp;quot;pay what you want&amp;quot; bundles, B) does not donate all that much to charity, C) often has games that are simply not very good, and most crucially D) has featured games already given away in regular Bundles (The Witness being the most recent and obvious.) What you end up with is a perceived lack of value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Humble Bundle used to be special in that it was the best at what it did. A few other bundle sites existed but nothing really had the quality of Humble Bundle. Often AAA games were included and bundles would sell like hot cakes. Now lots of repeated games are included (I recently gave away around 100 duplicate keys to friends) which makes the entire site less useful. A recent Jumbo Bundle was pitifully small and, frankly, overpriced. Which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Fixed pricing. Previously it was simple. You paid what you want. 1 cent to 99 cents got you DRM-free games, a dollar got you steam keys, above average got you bonuses. Now they&amp;#39;ll have price tiers, so $5 will get you two more games, $10 will get you four more, $25 will get you a tshirt, etc. Again, it&amp;#39;s a perceived lack of value, and it&amp;#39;s taking away from what Humble Bundle used to be like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Politics. The Freedom Bundle was amazing. I paid above the asking price and told every gamer I know to buy the bundle. It was spectacular value and gave money to what I considered to be great causes, especially the ACLU. But by making the ACLU the most advertised recipient of the charity for that bundle and with ALL money going to charity, people who were in favor of Trump&amp;#39;s Muslim ban were not happy and nor were people who preferred to choose where their money went; again, this is something that used to be integral to how Humble Bundle operated. Just look at some of the replies on Twitter - &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/humble/status/831245058963824641\"&gt;https://twitter.com/humble/status/831245058963824641&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Speaking of losing what used to make them special, they also ran a few DRM-heavy bundles, specifically the Ubisoft Origin bundles. Humble Bundle used to be extremely anti-DRM and it was seen as a huge step back to support Ubisoft and their somewhat draconian DRM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-A heavy leaning towards book and mobile bundles. People tend to favor the gaming ones. No big secret there, it&amp;#39;s obvious just from the sales. It makes it a bit disheartening when a book bundle is valued in the hundreds compared to the gaming bundles which are gradually waning away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason you see so many negative comments and dislikes is because the people getting mad at the service are more likely to complain about the changes they hate than the people who &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; the service are to post about the things they like staying the same. It&amp;#39;s still a great site that does a good job raising money for charities, it just isn&amp;#39;t quite what it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "name": "t1_dg69e88", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048718.0, "created_utc": 1492019918.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vicb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5j7fg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xxXEliteXxx", "parent_id": "t3_64vicb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OutOfTheLoop", "controversiality": 0, "body": "None of the recent console games (or very few) they are offering are available in the UK.
