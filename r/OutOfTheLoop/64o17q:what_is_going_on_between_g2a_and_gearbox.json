There's a lot of bad things you can say about G2A but \"money laundering company\" isn't at all accurate.\n\nI hate to have to constantly be the guy defending G2A but they actually provide a desired service and they're mostly a middleman. Should they be doing more to ensure that the things that are sold on their service are legit? I'd say yes, at the very least they definitely could be doing more.\n\nBut TotalBiscuit is also completely unreasonable, putting way too much of the responsiblity at G2A. He also makes a lot of impressive statements and implications which are in no way proven (not even by what's in his description) about the scale of this. Now I don't know about G2A specifically because I haven't done much business with them, but I've dealt with Kinguin multiple times and I'm pretty confident that the big majority of the keys on there are completely legitimate (or at least legal; many of them are bought in  East-European countries where prices are lower; I think it's perfectly legitimate to resell those in the west but you might think differently). I suspect it's largely the same for G2A, though I do think G2A is shadier than Kinguin.\n\nReally, if G2A was doing really bad things it would've been sued out of existence 10 times over already, considering how controversial it is. \n\nAgain, there's a lot of criticism you can have about G2A and the way they run their business, but the extent to which people go sometimes only harms their own point. If you just want to criticise the very *concept* of reselling keys, go ahead; but you'll see that your point suddenly becomes a lot less attractive to many people.
