Smogon does not try to sell its rules as official; they exist for the community to use. Nobody is forced to play with them.\n\nThe other major competitive Pok\u00e9mon scene is VGC \u2013 the official one, controlled by The Pok\u00e9mon Company. It has a different format \u2013 Double Battles instead of Single Battles, a system where you bring 6 Pok\u00e9mon and only use 4, and a different system of bans.\n\nBoth are healthy, fun, and going strong. It's hard to judge which is bigger, and doing so doesn't really mean anything anyway, as one has official support and therefore plenty of money behind it, while the other is entirely community-driven. Most people just have fun playing whatever they prefer.\n\nNow, Verlisify. He stirred up a lot of drama and got extremely mad at the fact that Smogon is so popular despite being unofficial \u2013 even suggesting that people instead play VGC singles, which isn't a thing that exists.\n\nHe criticized Smogon's rulesets, saying that they \"ban things they can't beat\" \u2013 which is a fallacy on multiple levels. First of all, Smogon is a competitive scene, and people play to win. They *use* the things they ban, and if something overcentralizes the metagame (in other words, is so good that you need to be using it or something that specifically counters it (but might be useless otherwise) in order to succeed), it's tested and then voted on to be banned or not. Secondly, he said shit like (and this is outdated as hell) Slurpuff can counter Mega-Kangaskhan, which is honestly incredibly stupid and shows a total ignorance of how competitive Pok\u00e9mon even works. He was easily not someone to trust on what should or shouldn't be banned. He also became notorious for spreading sets that are just plain awful. [This is more a meme than an argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvaW7EMTVWk), but it represents how most people who knew what they were talking about saw the sets that Verlisify would suggest. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJefn1X1nFw) should show anybody who understands competitive Pok\u00e9mon how poor his understanding was.\n\nAlso, he defended Evasion as a legitimate skill-based strategy. That's right, *Evasion*. Something entirely dependent on luck that any reasonable competitive format would ban. This destroyed a lot of his credibility.\n\nNow, all of this were his opinions. A lot of them were pretty dumb opinions, given that he would present them as fact even though he didn't even understand what he was talking about and people could easily disprove him. But they were his opinions.\n\nUnfortunately, he had no respect for the idea that anybody should just play what they want to play and have fun. Instead, he got pissed at people who played and enjoyed Smogon's formats, stirred up drama over it, and then played the victim whenever he was called out.\n\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GQo1oSccNI) is a pretty interesting, unbiased interview that might shed some light on the guy, and also just say a lot of interesting things about competitive Pok\u00e9mon.
