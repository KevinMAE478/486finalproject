Between 1945 and 1948, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established following the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. Since then, the North Korean people have been fed a steady stream of propaganda (you would not believe what the government tells its people. Seriously, look it up.) \n\nThere have been three leaders of North Korea: Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Il-Sung.  The current leader, Kim Jong-un, is the first to be born into this immersive level of propaganda. This has lead some analysts to fear that believes a lot of the information put out by the North Korean government (such as its ability to crush the United States military with a fart). North Korea is a Totalitarian Democratic Dictatorship (essentially they hold elections but there is only on candidate, so he wins 100% of the vote every time and has compete control of all aspects of the country). This allows the Supreme Leader to take most of their money and spend it on military and defense, and then next on himself, while leaving his people to starve and die. \n\nRecently, North Korea has been showing off their might by testing ICBMs (Intercontinental ballistic missiles). If perfected, this would allow North Korea to deliver an offensive payload to the United States. So the problem is that if they get or develop a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, they can drop it right on our shores. Naturally, we have been putting the pressure on and trying to stop this. \n\nThis is where China comes in! Since China and North Korea are long time allies and both Communist countries, they are close allies. As we (the United States) put pressure on North Korea, China has been telling us to back the fuck off and let their friends, the North Koreans, develop as a state. So, we cannot do anything to North Korea, with out the Chinese (and probably the Russians) taking their side. So we have the US and their allies (and the majority of the UN) trying to sanction and reel in North Korea, while China tells all of us to back off cause they got it. \n\nTL;DR North Korea is feeling tough cause they have China backing them, so they are testing rockets that could attack US territories.

Between 1945 and 1948, the Democratic People&amp;#39;s Republic of Korea was established following the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. Since then, the North Korean people have been fed a steady stream of propaganda (you would not believe what the government tells its people. Seriously, look it up.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been three leaders of North Korea: Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Il-Sung.  The current leader, Kim Jong-un, is the first to be born into this immersive level of propaganda. This has lead some analysts to fear that believes a lot of the information put out by the North Korean government (such as its ability to crush the United States military with a fart). North Korea is a Totalitarian Democratic Dictatorship (essentially they hold elections but there is only on candidate, so he wins 100% of the vote every time and has compete control of all aspects of the country). This allows the Supreme Leader to take most of their money and spend it on military and defense, and then next on himself, while leaving his people to starve and die. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, North Korea has been showing off their might by testing ICBMs (Intercontinental ballistic missiles). If perfected, this would allow North Korea to deliver an offensive payload to the United States. So the problem is that if they get or develop a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, they can drop it right on our shores.
