And I have a story about elderly people dancing.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I played guitar in a covers duo around south-east Queensland. We had a semi-regular gig at a bar in the southern suburbs of Brisbane. Every time we played there, this elderly couple would tear up the dance floor (not unlike like these two) during almost every song we played across our 4 sets, no matter if it was Creedence or the Goo Goo Dolls. I found out their names were Dorothy (\"Dot\") and Jim and they would have been in their late 70's or possibly 80's.\n\nThey weren't together, though, they were just friends. Both had lost their respective partners in years gone by but they'd formed a close friendship through dancing together every week. You could tell Jim really wanted more out of the friendship. I guess for him, his outings with Dot acted as a way of reliving his youthful days and remembering the love he used to have. I'm pretty sure by the glint in his eyes that he'd fallen in love all over again.\n\nDot, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. She was still grieving the death of her husband and didn't think it was possible to be with another man in the same way again. Jim was a support and an escape for her - a valuable friend - but she didn't have it within her to cross that line and turn it into anything more. All the locals at the bar were aware of their story and they'd encourage Jim to keep his hopes up, it was very cute &amp; respectful watching him try to win her over on the dance floor night after night.\n\nThe bar eventually stopped booking us and we moved onto other bars, so I'm not sure whatever happened with them. But their story touched me and I ended up writing a song about them, it's a sweet little acoustic tune called Dancing With Dot.
