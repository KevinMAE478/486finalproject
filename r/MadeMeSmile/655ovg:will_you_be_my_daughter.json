I was scared I wasn&amp;#39;t going to be able to give her the life my parents were able to give me. Then my mom told me about how poor they were when I was born. And honestly all I could remember was the happy stuff. I had no clue we didn&amp;#39;t have much money. Guess what I&amp;#39;m saying is I made the realization that if I love these kids with all my heart and work my ass off every single day to make their lives better then everything will be okay. In the end they don&amp;#39;t want a ton of toys or huge houses or eating out every night. That kid will want you. My girl is almost five now and we are doing much better but she doesn&amp;#39;t have a clue where we started from. She just knows her dad has loved her for her whole life. You sound like you have a great head on your shoulders. Just keep it there and you&amp;#39;re going to be a fantastic dad. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "MadeMeSmile", "name": "t1_dg7vzvn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492133113.0, "created_utc": 1492104313.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uqcm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655ovg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7v8ih", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "triple_yoi", "parent_id": "t1_dg7p5cs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MadeMeSmile", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did the same 14 years ago, totally worth it.

So often people assume that split up parents can't get along at all anymore, and/or that after they split up only one of the parents actually raises the kid(s) while the other only has visitation rights or something. It doesn't have to be this way.\n\nMy personal story: I used to think that I was 'lucky' with my parents divorce as they did it when I was 2 or 3, so I can't remember the situation being any different. I had 2 homes and that's it. 'That's the reason I don't experience any problems right?' - 10 year old me.\n\nOnly later I realized it was way more than that. There was this guy who became my best friend, and his parents also divorced when he was pretty young, so a similar situation right? Nope, the parents would occasionally badmouth eachother, and you could just see him awkwardly stare at the ground while one of the parents would do this. And they **literally** couldn't stand the sight of eachother so instead of coming to the door to pick up the kids when it was their turn, they would park close by and call the kids to come.\n\nAt one point my friend didn't have the money to go to a movie like planned. Why? His mother didn't give him allowance. Why? Because his dad didn't give the mother child support yet.. What. the. fuck. I used to think she was a very nice lady (and on a personal level she is) but that really changed my opinion of her, letting your kid be the victim of this squabble (ps. the mom had enough but I guess it was a matter of principle for her).\n\nAfter seeing his situation I started to notice and remember some things about my home situation. My mom used to occasionally bring her bf over for dinner, and although he was a very very nice dude, I just somehow felt not 100% comfortable having him in our home situation. So what did my mom do? She would only have him over at special occasions like her birthday beacuse she wanted to make sure I felt 110% comfortable in my own home. To illustrate how little I had to do with him, years later when his daughter ended up in my class I didn't know she was his daughter. That's another big difference compared to my friend's situation by the way: The kids of his step parents also kinda lived there so that changes the home situation quite a lot.\n\nI also noticed my parents actually *did* have some minor squabbles over money and stuff occasionally, but I only found out when I investigated myself.

Pretty much **all me and my brother ever noticed of having divorced parents is having 2 places we could call home**, and I don't know how can ever thank my parents for that.", "edited": 1492144730.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you! So often people assume that split up parents can&amp;#39;t get along at all anymore, and/or that after they split up only one of the parents actually raises the kid(s) while the other only has visitation rights or something. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My personal story: I used to think that I was &amp;#39;lucky&amp;#39; with my parents divorce as they did it when I was 2 or 3, so I can&amp;#39;t remember the situation being any different. I had 2 homes and that&amp;#39;s it. &amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s the reason I don&amp;#39;t experience any problems right?&amp;#39; - 10 year old me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only later I realized it was way more than that. There was this guy who became my best friend, and his parents also divorced when he was pretty young, so a similar situation right? Nope, the parents would occasionally badmouth eachother, and you could just see him awkwardly stare at the ground while one of the parents would do this. And they &lt;strong&gt;literally&lt;/strong&gt; couldn&amp;#39;t stand the sight of eachother so instead of coming to the door to pick up the kids when it was their turn, they would park close by and call the kids to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point my friend didn&amp;#39;t have the money to go to a movie like planned. Why? His mother didn&amp;#39;t give him allowance. Why? Because his dad didn&amp;#39;t give the mother child support yet.. What. the. fuck. I used to think she was a very nice lady (and on a personal level she is) but that really changed my opinion of her, letting your kid be the victim of this squabble (ps. the mom had enough but I guess it was a matter of principle for her).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After seeing his situation I started to notice and remember some things about my home situation. My mom used to occasionally bring her bf over for dinner, and although he was a very very nice dude, I just somehow felt not 100% comfortable having him in our home situation. So what did my mom do? She would only have him over at special occasions like her birthday beacuse she wanted to make sure I felt 110% comfortable in my own home. To illustrate how little I had to do with him, years later when his daughter ended up in my class I didn&amp;#39;t know she was his daughter.
