Investigate a derelict space station orbiting a mysterious black hole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: I&amp;#39;m pretty interested in seeing how the co-op portion of this game plays out. It&amp;#39;s almost like Diablo-meets-Mass Effect in some senses. I&amp;#39;ll be backing it if they get closer to their 100k stretch goal for a Switch port.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Top Switch News&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo had a Nintendo Direct for the first time since before the Switch launch. Here is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X06fvObnG0\"&gt;English direct (US)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ft7QVKVOrE\"&gt;Japanese direct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: You may recall that I suggested a new Direct was on the way &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/63638c/switch_week_in_review_326_42/\"&gt;a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. It met my expectations, which was to give dates for already-announced games and some more details on indie games. It was a pleasant surprise to see so many new games announced. I&amp;#39;m going to quickly touch on most of the news below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fate-extella-the-umbral-star-switch\"&gt;Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: The PS4 version &lt;a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fateextella-the-umbral-star\"&gt;received a 67% metacritic rating&lt;/a&gt;, which is worth a deeper look by my standards. The game is very similar to a Koei Warriors-type action game that has fairly repetitive combat but a lot of things to find/collect. There is also a physical version coming. This isn&amp;#39;t high on my radar, but I&amp;#39;d love to hear thoughts from anyone that&amp;#39;s played the game on another platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/monopoly-for-nintendo-switch\"&gt;Monopoly for Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: It&amp;#39;s the kind of game a lot of us want to have on our Switch for taking to parties or gatherings with more casual gamers. It&amp;#39;s Monopoly, so I suspect you&amp;#39;re not going to be blown away by some new feature or gameplay mechanic. However the production value looks quite high on this, so reviews could sway me into a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sine-mora-ex-switch\"&gt;Sine Mora EX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Local co-op bullet hell? Blazeon (arcade) images flash before me and suddenly it&amp;#39;s a day 1 purchase. Sine Mora&amp;#39;s original version received favorable metacritic ratings across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/battle-chasers-nightwar-switch\"&gt;Battle Chasers: Nightwar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Was a timed exclusive to the Switch? Apparently it is &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/AirshipSyn/status/852303980562612224/photo/1\"&gt;not timed-exclusive&lt;/a&gt; and that was some sort of error in the Nintendo Direct. This is a classic 3-character turn-based JRPG-style game based on a comic of the same name. Looks really cool and it&amp;#39;s going on my watch list. THQ Nordic is a major publisher bringing two interesting games to the platform in the next few months! 3rd party support starting with smaller games is still 3rd party support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/payday-2-switch\"&gt;Payday 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Despite the developers treating the community like garbage, and the console versions generally curated poorly (if at all), people have said good things about the game itself. I&amp;#39;m going to be waiting after launch for a while to see how seriously the devs support the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/namco-museum-switch\"&gt;NAMCO MUSEUM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: You had me at Dig Dug on the go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2z9Mxvncfg\"&gt;Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon&lt;/a&gt; (Japan).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: The first game received a &lt;a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nights-of-azure\"&gt;67 Metacritic rating&lt;/a&gt;, which is good enough to get my attention. A solid Action RPG title that seems to be high on strategy. The overall presentation seems well above average. Unfortunately, being an RPG, it will likely be text-heavy and I have my doubts that the Japanese release will be localized. Though one can hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_qbf4Nnzw\"&gt;Shinobi Refle: Senran Kaura&lt;/a&gt; (Japan).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: I feel weird even linking the video, but I&amp;#39;ll do it since it was on Nintendo&amp;#39;s official page. Not my kind of game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Game Announced - &lt;a href=\"https://ec.nintendo.com/JP/ja/titles/70010000000307\"&gt;Maison de MAOU&lt;/a&gt; (Japan).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Lucky for those of us that speak Japanese, this game was announced and launched the same day! I&amp;#39;m a little surprised that it didn&amp;#39;t come with English support since the game is available on Steam, PS4, and 3DS in English as &amp;quot;Unholy Heights.&amp;quot; Perhaps the game didn&amp;#39;t do well in western countries the first round.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Arcade Archives Games Announced - Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, Over Top, Blazing Star, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, King of Fighters &amp;#39;99, Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors, Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad, Last Resort (Japan), and Sengoku (Japan).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: I imagine that the two that were only shown in the Japanese direct will also come to the west. The same video was shown in all 3 directs but was cut off before the last two games were shown in western directs (more likely because of time). Of them all I am most excited to buy Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad and Sengoku on day 1. I&amp;#39;ll likely pass on the others. Good to see some new genres popping up in this series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/12/nintendo-switch-neon-yellow-joy-con-battery-pack-accessory-announced\"&gt;New Accessories Announced&lt;/a&gt; - Neon Yellow Joy-Con (available together or separately {at least in Japan}), Neon Yellow Joy-Con strap, and Joy-Con AA Battery Pack. They are also re-releasing the stand-alone dock at normal retail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: The dock will release on May 19th. All other accessories launch the same day as Arms (6/16). I am glad to see docks coming to normal retail, rather than being a special order from Nintendo. It sounds like they will be limited at first, though it wasn&amp;#39;t clear. The Yellow Joy-Con are amazing and I&amp;#39;ll be pre-ordering a pair when they go up on BB or Amazon. I&amp;#39;m thinking the battery packs are for people who are planning to play a LOT of Arms and are likely to forget to charge their Joy-Cons after a lot of use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release dates and windows were announced for &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/minecraft-switch-edition\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;, de Mambo, Thumper, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tumbleseed-switch\"&gt;Tumbleseed&lt;/a&gt; and Project Mekuru.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Minecraft will feature a bunch of Mario DLC (that was apparently available on the WiiU version). It launches 5/11 in the US and 5/12 Worldwide. de Mambo and Thumper were shown only in the Japanese Direct with dates of May and June, respectively. I&amp;#39;d suspect those are worldwide dates. Project Mekuru really caught my attention in some of the first direct footage we&amp;#39;ve seen of the title. It also features online play so I&amp;#39;m keeping a close eye on this one. It launches this summer exclusive to the eShop. Tumbleseed&amp;#39;s launch date was announced after the direct as 5/2, though regions weren&amp;#39;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More info and footage was given for &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch\"&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/arms-switch\"&gt;Arms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/splatoon-2-switch\"&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rayman-legends-definitive-edition-switch\"&gt;Rayman Legends DE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sonic-forces-switch\"&gt;Sonic Forces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sonic-mania-switch\"&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ultra-street-fighter-2-the-final-challengers-switch\"&gt;Ultra Street Fighter II TFC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Of particular note were the reveal of the rest of the MK8 modes, a new fighter (Minmin) and a new mode (2 on 2) for Arms. Two new Switch-exclusive modes and local multi-console co-op for Rayman, a new character in Sonic Forces, and first-person details for SFII also stuck out to me. I believe I will end up buying all of the games in this list, but I am most on the fence about Sonic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About &lt;a href=\"http://nintendoeverything.com/20-unreal-engine-4-titles-in-development-for-switch-in-japan/\"&gt;20 Switch games&lt;/a&gt; are being developed in Japan using Unreal Engine 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: This is actually pretty awesome to hear, because we certainly haven&amp;#39;t seen confirmation of nearly that many Japanese Switch games using UE4. It gives me hope that one (or several) could be in the Kingdom Hearts franchise, which is one of my favorites. This news MAY be the first confirmation that Shin Megami Tensei is using Unreal 4, but I can&amp;#39;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/disgaea-5-complete-switch\"&gt;Disgaea 5 Complete&lt;/a&gt; will get an English demo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: I was already going to buy it, but for a series that is as niche as this one I think this is a great way to create new fans. Demos make sense in certain circumstances, but not for every game. This is the perfect use of one. I&amp;#39;ll be curious to see how much of the game is playable in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A couple of days before the Direct, The Fall Part 2: Unbound &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBnwZffL9X8\"&gt;got a new trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Cool narrative. It&amp;#39;s got my attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicalis and Headup games are &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HeadupGames/posts/1470525776325410:0\"&gt;bringing The Binding of Isaac to Europe in Q2 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: The boxart looks so much cooler in this version (which is also being used for the 2nd run in the US). I like my manual and stickers, but I wish I got this box art with it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is getting &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64yd1q/mario_kart_8_deluxe_switch_bundle_just_went_on/\"&gt;two exclusive bundles&lt;/a&gt; for Mario Kart 8, but there is nothing exclusive within them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Reddit breaks the news! It&amp;#39;s a bummer we won&amp;#39;t see this bundle in the rest of the world, but it makes sense. Bundles like these are made to drive sales, and Nintendo doesn&amp;#39;t need help driving sales right now. During the holiday season it is possible we will see a bundle like this as Nintendo will have interest in exhausting their available inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Square Enix brought a new Switch-Exclusive mode to &amp;quot;I Am Setsuna&amp;quot; called Temporal Battle Arena.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmauIgTmh8\"&gt;This gameplay video&lt;/a&gt; shows what is essentially an asynchronous PVP mode - the likes of which are common in mobile phone games. I don&amp;#39;t have this game, and this feature isn&amp;#39;t pushing me to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost in all of the excitement of the week, publisher Shin&amp;#39;en Multimedia &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShinenGames/status/852520243276730368\"&gt;announced they would be bringing the Fast RMX patch&lt;/a&gt; that allows online friend play and time attack mode out on 4/19.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: I&amp;#39;ve rarely been this excited for a patch in a non-MMO game, but the inability to play with friends online really bothers me in this game, and I bought it on launch day. I&amp;#39;m really looking forward to it as my brother and I both have the game and don&amp;#39;t live near each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research firm &lt;a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/14/superdata-nintendo-sells-2-4-million-switch-consoles-worldwide-in-first-month/\"&gt;SuperData&amp;#39;s analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows that Nintendo sold 2.4 million Switches in its first month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: We also know that 906,000 units sold in the US alone in this time frame. Of particular interest is that Breath of the Wild sold more units for the Switch &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15296874/nintendo-switch-zelda-sales-numbers-us\"&gt;than actual Switch consoles sold&lt;/a&gt;. Reddit largely belives this was due to Collectors/Masters edition owners buying a normal copy to play. I did this!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There was a new &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCZYpj-OYrs\"&gt;gameplay trailer&lt;/a&gt; for NBA Playgrounds. The game releases in May.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: This game actually looks like a blast for a $20 game, with a cool player-specific progression system. Like I said last week, it just needs to feature my Seattle Suuuuuuuuuuuuper Sonics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A slew of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/line-up\"&gt;new amiibos&lt;/a&gt; were announced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;amiibo Name&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Release Date&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Zelda BOTW Compatible?&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Mario Kart 8 Compatible?&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Splatoon 2 Compatible?&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/link-majoras-mask-amiibo-the-legend-of-zelda-series\"&gt;Link -

Something picked out of an official video and extrapolated on. I sure hope there are more than the 6 fighters announced + these 4. Fighter variety is a key point of interest for me in fighting games. But Arms is a day 1 buy for me thanks to the newly-announced 2v2 mode (which I sure hope works online with friends).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Shifty got a lot of backlash on reddit after complaints about the game&amp;#39;s performance on the Switch were met with an inappropriate comment by the developers to just buy it on Steam. In response to this, one of the publishers (verified) &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6573rr/before_you_buy_mr_shifty_look_at_how_the_devs_are/dg8556e/\"&gt;showed up on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; to reassure fans that the game was being patched immediately and that we could expect to see some fixes as early as next week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: Shame on the Team Shifty twitter account to say what they said and divert blame. Thankfully Alex did give a lot of folks peace of mind that A) the company cared about their customers and B) they were going to do what they could to improve the gameplay experience. I was GOING to buy this game on day 1, but I got distracted. When I got back to my computer later in the day this had transpired and I have held off to this point. I&amp;#39;m waiting to see what folks say about the patch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Tokytome\"&gt;/u/Tokytome&lt;/a&gt; has suggested what &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/65g25c/mockup_i_wish_aca_titles_looked_like_this/\"&gt;ACA banners&lt;/a&gt; should look like on the home screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Take: I absolutely 100% agree. I take great pride in my Switch collection and better key art would present better on the store (which I&amp;#39;m sure would lead to sales for people who don&amp;#39;t know what these games are) and on the home screen (which would lead to my happiness). I plan to &lt;a href=\"http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/contact/\"&gt;message Hamster about this&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;#39;d like to see an eShop mockup I can send them as well. Any volunteers?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Top Comment of the Week&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Acid-Free\"&gt;/u/Acid-Free&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64m9d6/nintendos_splatoon_2arms_direct_means_really_huge/dg3l4el/\"&gt;keeping things in perspective for E3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Look Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter to those that celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a crazy but great week of news... and all before E3! If Nintendo meets the expectations they set with Reggie&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Huge E3&amp;quot; comment a few weeks ago this could be a major comeback for Nintendo in the making. Of course it&amp;#39;s too early to say, but all signs are positive. I hope they can really ride this momentum through the year. Big releases on the calendar like Arms and Splatoon, plus upcoming features like online services and (most likely) Virtual Console make for a great first year if they are spaced out reasonably-well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pocket Rumble is still mysteriously absent with no word yet from the developer about what has happened and why they missed their announced &amp;quot;March&amp;quot; release date. They still haven&amp;#39;t even acknowledged that it is &amp;#39;delayed&amp;#39; really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really looking forward to Wonder Boy next week. When the game was announced it instantly made it into the top 5 games I was looking forward to on the console. So for me this is huge release. It scratches all my itches (I&amp;#39;m a sucker for platformers) and the art looks absolutely stunning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to &lt;a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/switch/aab6a/index.html\"&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/a&gt; a lot after the Testfire and the announcement of the co-op egg collection mode in the Nintendo Direct. I never played Splatoon 1 as I didn&amp;#39;t own a WiiU, but this is turning out to be a really big hype generator for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as what I bought last week - only amiibo. I preordered all of the Splatoon 2 amiibo, bought the whole Splatoon 1 suite, and pre-ordered all of the new Smash ones as well. If anyone finds a link to the 3 new Zelda ones for pre-order PM me first so I don&amp;#39;t miss out. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#39;m hoping to have a special surprise for you guys next week. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did you pick up last week? What are you looking forward to this week? &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64bsq5/mario_kart_8_deluxe_english_teaser_site_live/\"&gt;Mario Kart draws ever near.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switch Tip of the Week:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you know you could check the patch version of each game on your Switch? Just go to System Settings &amp;gt; Data Management &amp;gt; Manage Software. Here you&amp;#39;ll find a list of all installed games and selecting each one will show the version number in the top-left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Tip of the Week:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you a Tetris veteran that&amp;#39;s new to Puyo Puyo? It&amp;#39;s helpful to remember that Puyos need to be connected in continuous chains, rather than clumped together. If you can make a megachain that gets connected with one big play you will surely make your opponent pay with some grey garbage Puyos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Recent Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/62je2d/switch_march_in_review_april_look_ahead/\"&gt;Monthly - March 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/63638c/switch_week_in_review_326_42\"&gt;Weekly - 3/26 to 4/2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64cnu8/state_of_switch_week_in_review_42_49/\"&gt;Weekly - 4/2 to 4/9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: Spelunker date was mistakenly shown as NA instead of JP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi Everyone.

I'll be backing it if they get closer to their 100k stretch goal for a Switch port.\n\n***\n### Top Switch News\n- **Nintendo had a Nintendo Direct for the first time since before the Switch launch. Here is the [English direct (US)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X06fvObnG0) and the [Japanese direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ft7QVKVOrE).**\n\n &gt;My Take: You may recall that I suggested a new Direct was on the way [a couple of weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/63638c/switch_week_in_review_326_42/). It met my expectations, which was to give dates for already-announced games and some more details on indie games. It was a pleasant surprise to see so many new games announced. I'm going to quickly touch on most of the news below.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fate-extella-the-umbral-star-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: The PS4 version [received a 67% metacritic rating](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fateextella-the-umbral-star), which is worth a deeper look by my standards. The game is very similar to a Koei Warriors-type action game that has fairly repetitive combat but a lot of things to find/collect. There is also a physical version coming. This isn't high on my radar, but I'd love to hear thoughts from anyone that's played the game on another platform.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Monopoly for Nintendo Switch](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/monopoly-for-nintendo-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: It's the kind of game a lot of us want to have on our Switch for taking to parties or gatherings with more casual gamers. It's Monopoly, so I suspect you're not going to be blown away by some new feature or gameplay mechanic. However the production value looks quite high on this, so reviews could sway me into a purchase.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Sine Mora EX](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sine-mora-ex-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: Local co-op bullet hell? Blazeon (arcade) images flash before me and suddenly it's a day 1 purchase. Sine Mora's original version received favorable metacritic ratings across all platforms.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Battle Chasers: Nightwar](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/battle-chasers-nightwar-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: Was a timed exclusive to the Switch? Apparently it is [not timed-exclusive](https://twitter.com/AirshipSyn/status/852303980562612224/photo/1) and that was some sort of error in the Nintendo Direct. This is a classic 3-character turn-based JRPG-style game based on a comic of the same name. Looks really cool and it's going on my watch list. THQ Nordic is a major publisher bringing two interesting games to the platform in the next few months! 3rd party support starting with smaller games is still 3rd party support.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Payday 2](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/payday-2-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: Despite the developers treating the community like garbage, and the console versions generally curated poorly (if at all), people have said good things about the game itself. I'm going to be waiting after launch for a while to see how seriously the devs support the Switch.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [NAMCO MUSEUM](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/namco-museum-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: You had me at Dig Dug on the go.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2z9Mxvncfg) (Japan).**\n\n &gt; My Take: The first game received a [67 Metacritic rating](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nights-of-azure), which is good enough to get my attention. A solid Action RPG title that seems to be high on strategy. The overall presentation seems well above average. Unfortunately, being an RPG, it will likely be text-heavy and I have my doubts that the Japanese release will be localized. Though one can hope.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Shinobi Refle: Senran Kaura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_qbf4Nnzw) (Japan).**\n\n &gt; My Take: I feel weird even linking the video, but I'll do it since it was on Nintendo's official page. Not my kind of game.\n\n- **New Game Announced - [Maison de MAOU](https://ec.nintendo.com/JP/ja/titles/70010000000307) (Japan).**\n\n &gt; My Take: Lucky for those of us that speak Japanese, this game was announced and launched the same day! I'm a little surprised that it didn't come with English support since the game is available on Steam, PS4, and 3DS in English as \"Unholy Heights.\" Perhaps the game didn't do well in western countries the first round.\n\n- **New Arcade Archives Games Announced - Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, Over Top, Blazing Star, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, King of Fighters '99, Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors, Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad, Last Resort (Japan), and Sengoku (Japan).**\n\n &gt; My Take: I imagine that the two that were only shown in the Japanese direct will also come to the west. The same video was shown in all 3 directs but was cut off before the last two games were shown in western directs (more likely because of time). Of them all I am most excited to buy Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad and Sengoku on day 1. I'll likely pass on the others. Good to see some new genres popping up in this series.\n\n- **[New Accessories Announced](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/12/nintendo-switch-neon-yellow-joy-con-battery-pack-accessory-announced) - Neon Yellow Joy-Con (available together or separately {at least in Japan}), Neon Yellow Joy-Con strap, and Joy-Con AA Battery Pack. They are also re-releasing the stand-alone dock at normal retail.**\n\n &gt; My Take: The dock will release on May 19th. All other accessories launch the same day as Arms (6/16). I am glad to see docks coming to normal retail, rather than being a special order from Nintendo. It sounds like they will be limited at first, though it wasn't clear. The Yellow Joy-Con are amazing and I'll be pre-ordering a pair when they go up on BB or Amazon. I'm thinking the battery packs are for people who are planning to play a LOT of Arms and are likely to forget to charge their Joy-Cons after a lot of use.\n\n- **Release dates and windows were announced for [Minecraft](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/minecraft-switch-edition), de Mambo, Thumper, [Tumbleseed](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tumbleseed-switch) and Project Mekuru.**\n\n &gt; My Take: Minecraft will feature a bunch of Mario DLC (that was apparently available on the WiiU version). It launches 5/11 in the US and 5/12 Worldwide. de Mambo and Thumper were shown only in the Japanese Direct with dates of May and June, respectively. I'd suspect those are worldwide dates. Project Mekuru really caught my attention in some of the first direct footage we've seen of the title. It also features online play so I'm keeping a close eye on this one. It launches this summer exclusive to the eShop. Tumbleseed's launch date was announced after the direct as 5/2, though regions weren't clear.\n\n- **More info and footage was given for [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch), [Arms](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/arms-switch), [Splatoon 2](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/splatoon-2-switch), [Rayman Legends DE](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rayman-legends-definitive-edition-switch), [Sonic Forces](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sonic-forces-switch), [Sonic Mania](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sonic-mania-switch), and [Ultra Street Fighter II TFC](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ultra-street-fighter-2-the-final-challengers-switch).**\n\n &gt; My Take: Of particular note were the reveal of the rest of the MK8 modes, a new fighter (Minmin) and a new mode (2 on 2) for Arms. Two new Switch-exclusive modes and local multi-console co-op for Rayman, a new character in Sonic Forces, and first-person details for SFII also stuck out to me. I believe I will end up buying all of the games in this list, but I am most on the fence about Sonic Forces.\n\n- **About [20 Switch games](http://nintendoeverything.com/20-unreal-engine-4-titles-in-development-for-switch-in-japan/) are being developed in Japan using Unreal Engine 4.**\n\n &gt; My Take: This is actually pretty awesome to hear, because we certainly haven't seen confirmation of nearly that many Japanese Switch games using UE4. It gives me hope that one (or several) could be in the Kingdom Hearts franchise, which is one of my favorites. This news MAY be the first confirmation that Shin Megami Tensei is using Unreal 4, but I can't be sure.\n\n- **[Disgaea 5 Complete](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/disgaea-5-complete-switch) will get an English demo.**\n\n &gt; My Take: I was already going to buy it, but for a series that is as niche as this one I think this is a great way to create new fans. Demos make sense in certain circumstances, but not for every game. This is the perfect use of one. I'll be curious to see how much of the game is playable in the demo.\n\n- **A couple of days before the Direct, The Fall Part 2: Unbound [got a new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBnwZffL9X8).**\n\n &gt; My Take: Cool narrative. It's got my attention.\n\n- **Nicalis and Headup games are [bringing The Binding of Isaac to Europe in Q2 2017](https://www.facebook.com/HeadupGames/posts/1470525776325410:0).**\n\n &gt; My Take: The boxart looks so much cooler in this version (which is also being used for the 2nd run in the US). I like my manual and stickers, but I wish I got this box art with it!\n\n- **Russia is getting [two exclusive bundles](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64yd1q/mario_kart_8_deluxe_switch_bundle_just_went_on/) for Mario Kart 8, but there is nothing exclusive within them.**\n\n &gt; My Take: Reddit breaks the news! It's a bummer we won't see this bundle in the rest of the world, but it makes sense. Bundles like these are made to drive sales, and Nintendo doesn't need help driving sales right now. During the holiday season it is possible we will see a bundle like this as Nintendo will have interest in exhausting their available inventory.\n\n- **Square Enix brought a new Switch-Exclusive mode to \"I Am Setsuna\" called Temporal Battle Arena.**\n\n &gt; My Take: [This gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmauIgTmh8) shows what is essentially an asynchronous PVP mode - the likes of which are common in mobile phone games. I don't have this game, and this feature isn't pushing me to buy it.\n\n- **Lost in all of the excitement of the week, publisher Shin'en Multimedia [announced they would be bringing the Fast RMX patch](https://twitter.com/ShinenGames/status/852520243276730368) that allows online friend play and time attack mode out on 4/19.**\n\n &gt; My Take: I've rarely been this excited for a patch in a non-MMO game, but the inability to play with friends online really bothers me in this game, and I bought it on launch day. I'm really looking forward to it as my brother and I both have the game and don't live near each other.\n\n- **Research firm [SuperData's analysis](https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/14/superdata-nintendo-sells-2-4-million-switch-consoles-worldwide-in-first-month/) shows that Nintendo sold 2.4 million Switches in its first month.**\n\n &gt; My Take: We also know that 906,000 units sold in the US alone in this time frame. Of particular interest is that Breath of the Wild sold more units for the Switch [than actual Switch consoles sold](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15296874/nintendo-switch-zelda-sales-numbers-us). Reddit largely belives this was due to Collectors/Masters edition owners buying a normal copy to play. I did this!\n\n- **There was a new [gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCZYpj-OYrs) for NBA Playgrounds. The game releases in May.**\n\n &gt; My Take: This game actually looks like a blast for a $20 game, with a cool player-specific progression system. Like I said last week, it just needs to feature my Seattle Suuuuuuuuuuuuper Sonics.\n\n- **A slew of [new amiibos](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/line-up) were announced.**\n\namiibo Name | Release Date | Zelda BOTW Compatible? |  Mario Kart 8 Compatible? | Splatoon 2 Compatible?\n:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n[Link - Majora's Mask](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/link-majoras-mask-amiibo-the-legend-of-zelda-series)|June 23|Yes|Yes|Unknown|\n[Link - Skyward Sword](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/link-skyward-sword-amiibo-the-legend-of-zelda-series)|June 23|Yes|Yes|Unknown|\n[Link - Twilight Princess](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/link-twilight-princess-amiibo-the-legend-of-zelda-series)|June 23|Yes|Yes|Unknown|\n[Bayonetta](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/bayonetta-amiibo-super-smash-bros-series)|July 21|Yes|No|Unknown|\n[Bayonetta - Player 2](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/bayonetta-player-2-amiibo-super-smash-bros-series)|July 21|Yes|No|Unknown|\n[Cloud](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/cloud-amiibo-super-smash-bros-series)|July 21|Yes|No|Unknown|\n[Cloud - Player 2](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/cloud-player-2-amiibo-super-smash-bros-series)|July 21|Yes|No|Unknown|\n[Corrin](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/corrin-amiibo-super-smash-bros-series)|July 21|Yes|No|Unknown|\n[Corrin - Player 2](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/corrin-player-2-amiibo-super-smash-bros-series)|July 21|Yes|No|Unknown|\n[Inkling Boy (Green)](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/inkling-boy-3-amiibo-splatoon-series)|July 21|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n[Inkling Girl (Pink)](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/inkling-girl-3-amiibo-splatoon-series)|July 21|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n[Inkling Squid (Purple)](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/inkling-squid-3-amiibo-splatoon-series)|July 21|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n[Pikmin](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/pikmin-amiibo)|July 28|Yes|No|Unknown|\n\nIn addition it was broadly announced that all Splatoon series amiibo would work with Splatoon 2 (which was somewhat hidden information previously).\n\n\n***\n### Top Community Highlights\n- **More [Joy-Con colors](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/653g3q/joycons_all_possible_future_neon_color_variants/) started popping up on reddit due to the announcement of the yellow Joy-Con.**\n\n &gt;My Take: I'll take green please!\n\n- **There appeared to be [4 more characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/65203x/four_new_arms_characters_leaked_in_the_trailer/) shown in the Arms footage from the Nintendo Direct.**\n\n &gt; My Take: Now THIS is the kind of speculation I love to see. Something picked out of an official video and extrapolated on. I sure hope there are more than the 6 fighters announced + these 4. Fighter variety is a key point of interest for me in fighting games. But Arms is a day 1 buy for me thanks to the newly-announced 2v2 mode (which I sure hope works online with friends).\n\n- **Mr. Shifty got a lot of backlash on reddit after complaints about the game's performance on the Switch were met with an inappropriate comment by the developers to just buy it on Steam. In response to this, one of the publishers (verified) [showed up on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6573rr/before_you_buy_mr_shifty_look_at_how_the_devs_are/dg8556e/) to reassure fans that the game was being patched immediately and that we could expect to see some fixes as early as next week.**\n\n &gt;My Take: Shame on the Team Shifty twitter account to say what they said and divert blame. Thankfully Alex did give a lot of folks peace of mind that A) the company cared about their customers and B) they were going to do what they could to improve the gameplay experience. I was GOING to buy this game on day 1, but I got distracted. When I got back to my computer later in the day this had transpired and I have held off to this point. I'm waiting to see what folks say about the patch.\n\n- **/u/Tokytome has suggested what [ACA banners](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/65g25c/mockup_i_wish_aca_titles_looked_like_this/) should look like on the home screen.**\n\n &gt;My Take: I absolutely 100% agree. I take great pride in my Switch collection and better key art would present better on the store (which I'm sure would lead to sales for people who don't know what these games are) and on the home screen (which would lead to my happiness). I plan to [message Hamster about this](http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/contact/) but I'd like to see an eShop mockup I can send them as well. Any volunteers?\n\n***\n###Top Comment of the Week\n/u/Acid-Free on [keeping things in perspective for E3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64m9d6/nintendos_splatoon_2arms_direct_means_really_huge/dg3l4el/)\n\n***\n### Look Ahead\nHappy Easter to those that celebrate!\n\nWhat a crazy but great week of news... and all before E3! If Nintendo meets the expectations they set with Reggie's \"Huge E3\" comment a few weeks ago this could be a major comeback for Nintendo in the making. Of course it's too early to say, but all signs are positive. I hope they can really ride this momentum through the year. Big releases on the calendar like Arms and Splatoon, plus upcoming features like online services and (most likely) Virtual Console make for a great first year if they are spaced out reasonably-well.\n\nPocket Rumble is still mysteriously absent with no word yet from the developer about what has happened and why they missed their announced \"March\" release date. They still haven't even acknowledged that it is 'delayed' really.\n\nReally looking forward to Wonder Boy next week. When the game was announced it instantly made it into the top 5 games I was looking forward to on the console. So for me this is huge release. It scratches all my itches (I'm a sucker for platformers) and the art looks absolutely stunning.\n\nLooking forward to [Splatoon 2](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/switch/aab6a/index.html) a lot after the Testfire and the announcement of the co-op egg collection mode in the Nintendo Direct. I never played Splatoon 1 as I didn't own a WiiU, but this is turning out to be a really big hype generator for me.\n\nAs far as what I bought last week - only amiibo. I preordered all of the Splatoon 2 amiibo, bought the whole Splatoon 1 suite, and pre-ordered all of the new Smash ones as well. If anyone finds a link to the 3 new Zelda ones for pre-order PM me first so I don't miss out. :)\n\nIn other news, I'm hoping to have a special surprise for you guys next week. Stay tuned!\n\nWhat did you pick up last week? What are you looking forward to this week? [Mario Kart draws ever near.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64bsq5/mario_kart_8_deluxe_english_teaser_site_live/)\n***\n\n**Switch Tip of the Week:** Did you know you could check the patch version of each game on your Switch? Just go to System Settings &gt; Data Management &gt; Manage Software. Here you'll find a list of all installed games and selecting each one will show the version number in the top-left.\n\n**Game Tip of the Week:** Are you a Tetris veteran that's new to Puyo Puyo? It's helpful to remember that Puyos need to be connected in continuous chains, rather than clumped together. If you can make a megachain that gets connected with one big play you will surely make your opponent pay with some grey garbage Puyos.\n\n***\n### Recent Reviews\n* [Monthly - March 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/62je2d/switch_march_in_review_april_look_ahead/)\n* [Weekly - 3/26 to 4/2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/63638c/switch_week_in_review_326_42)\n* [Weekly - 4/2 to 4/9](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/64cnu8/state_of_switch_week_in_review_42_49/)\n\nEdit 1: Spelunker date was mistakenly shown as NA instead of JP.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "id": "65oexc", "gilded": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 917, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PandarenNinja", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65oexc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.NintendoSwitch", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/49m-wM7Wx4v6c0N6trTU5kJfDFxawqk-Sz1vF2BPx1w.jpg?s=96ecc405d5361bcc8d6c3d467cd96c03", "width": 300, "height": 287}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/49m-wM7Wx4v6c0N6trTU5kJfDFxawqk-Sz1vF2BPx1w.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=2613a09ec9bec004f966afea918591f9", "width": 108, "height": 103}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/49m-wM7Wx4v6c0N6trTU5kJfDFxawqk-Sz1vF2BPx1w.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=00ed1c15023a56ded0172650abf10d16", "width": 216, "height": 206}], "variants": {}, "id": "88fgRPYLq1LweE1PT3KZASGGFL5NZYsBIlRqY8HHB2s"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "edited": 1492369352.0, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "author_flair_css_class": "usericon-samus", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/65oexc/state_of_switch_week_in_review_49_416/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492365462.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/65oexc/state_of_switch_week_in_review_49_416/", "author_flair_text": "", "quarantine": false, "title": "State of Switch Week in Review 4/9 - 4/16", "created_utc": 1492336662.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 121, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 917}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oexc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcs081", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ikaris1", "parent_id": "t1_dgcru8p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Damn those NDA's!!! \n\nWell, I hope your company treats you well.

That would be bomb.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NintendoSwitch", "name": "t1_dgdeddy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492459486.0, "created_utc": 1492430686.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbzkbv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Super-Saiyan-Potato", "parent_id": "t3_65oexc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I could not be more excited about the Battle Chasers game.
