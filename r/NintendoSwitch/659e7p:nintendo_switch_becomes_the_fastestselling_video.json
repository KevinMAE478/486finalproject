Everyone at my school who plays video games (sophomore in high school) talks about call of duty or Halo or Destiny. There are a couple who talk about NBA2K and Madden but since it is a multiplayer game I can&amp;#39;t see them gitting a switch just for those games. My generation cares more about multiplayer games where you kill each other rather than exploration or splating the ground with paint. With how connected everything is today, either everyone or nobody gets a certain console and since the Switch is not a new generation, people aren&amp;#39;t buying the extra console for the Nintendo games, until Nintendo gets more 3rd party support, only Nintendo fans will be getting switches. Hopefully there are enough Nintendo fans to make the Switch a trend. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NintendoSwitch", "name": "t1_dg8qody", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492171872.0, "created_utc": 1492143072.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ljji", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 146, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kupovi", "parent_id": "t3_659e7p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've been saying this forever online, since the N64 era.
