Fully charged would unleash Lightning 2, and would radiate out around him for more area damage.\n\nSide B: X-Slash - I had this idea before Zelda got her Down B, but I see holding Side B causes Frog to appear. When released, Crono and Frog launch forward and slash the opponent.\n\nUp B: Falcon Strike - Ayla appears and throws Crono into the air while his sword is drawn.\n\nDown B: Ice Sword/Fire Sword - Randomly goes with either one. Marle or Lucca appears and uses their respective magic on Crono's sword while he does a circular spin with it. Ice sword would have a slight chance at freezing an opponent, while Fire Sword would have a slight chance at exploding on contact. Otherwise, the only difference would be cosmetic.\n\nFinal Smash: Luminaire/Super Volt - Luminaire is the obvious choice for a Final Smash, but Robo is missing, so I'm thinking 95% of the time, Crono performs Luminaire for his FS. But there's a 5% chance that if activated, the FS will end up being Crono and Robo's Dual Tech Super Volt.\n\nStages: I have 2 ideas for Chrono Trigger stages. One would be the Millennial Fair. Have the fight where Leene's Bell is. Lucca's device could be in the background causing temporal disturbances. The characters doing the race going on in he first screen of the Millennial Fair could run through as well, much like the Shy Guy karters on the MK stage. Gato could be a stage boss like Ridley or the Yellow Devil!\n\nThe other idea would be The Final Battle. It would take place outside of Lavos' shell. Just as Lavos changes the time period while fighting him, he could do the same while the fight is going on. The different time periods would create different platforms and have their own various stage hazards.\n\nSomeone asked me why I didn't include Magus in Any of Crono's attacks, and that's because in Chrono Trigger, Crono and Magus don't have any attacks together.
