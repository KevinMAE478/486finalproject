While the faker has to convince people he is not faking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has easily become a favorite game to play at parties. Most everyone has a smartphone and it forces them to just use the phone for the game instead browsing Facebook, Instagram or even Reddit. Plus it&amp;#39;s easier to set up then a board or card game. Then switch version should be interesting because how portable it is and I wonder how it plays over a phone hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of actual ROFL laughing moments with friends and my family. If you host or go to a lot of parties this is a must have game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NintendoSwitch", "name": "t1_dgdi6yy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492466236.0, "created_utc": 1492437436.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6563ga", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6563ga", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8p7sp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "legacymedia92", "parent_id": "t1_dg83k6k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You really need more than two players for this.
