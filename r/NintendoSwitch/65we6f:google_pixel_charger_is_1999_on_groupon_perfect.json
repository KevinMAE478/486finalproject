In typical usage scenarios, that's probably enough to play and charge the Switch at the same time, but only *barely* while playing BotW, and the charging process might go extremely slow at times, and occasionally even drain the battery because the 1.5A isn't enough to satisfy both the game and the charging at once.\n\nBotW was calculated to max around 9W of power draw in portable mode (if I remember correctly), so if you're in a \"max usage\" scenario, then the Switch wouldn't charge and play at the same time, and the battery might even actually drain during gameplay. There may also be future games that draw a more consistent 7.5W or more, in which case a USB A charger wouldn't charge and play.\n\nThe reason you're likely able to charge and play BotW is that it's not *always* drawing the max wattage. The inventory menus and lighter areas of the game, combined with a dimmer screen setting and/or turning off wifi, for example, might have the Switch only averaging like 6-7 watts, in which case you'd very slowly charge the battery while playing.\n\nIn the end, to sufficiently satisfy a demanding Switch game and also charge the Switch at a decent rate at the same time, you'd need a dedicated USB C charger (or power bank) that is a straight up USB C supply (like the one included with the Switch) or has a USB C connector and combined that with a USB C to USB C cable.\n\nAs for the dock itself, you're probably best off always using the Nintendo official adapter to connect to that.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to expand on that: Using a USB A to USB C connection, the Switch will (as makar1 says), only draw a max of 5V/1.5A = 7.5 W, regardless of the adapter&amp;#39;s rated output.
