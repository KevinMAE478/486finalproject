Since today is Easter and we were going to have a family dinner at my grandparents&amp;#39; place I decided to bring my switch along. I downloaded the demo for Puyo Puyo Tetris before going so I could have something multiplayer to play with my little cousin. My cousin is 13, has autism, and family gatherings like this can be a little stressful for him because he gets excited and starts to get too loud and always ends up getting yelled at. A few years ago I realized I could lay down on the floor with him, play my 3DS, and he&amp;#39;d calm down a lot and just watch me play and talk with me. This was great! He wasn&amp;#39;t getting yelled at for being too loud and it just made family gatherings way more tolerable (the intolerable part being the constant yelling at him and the general volume of everything. Some of my family may not be the best at working with him). As he got older I tried to play my Wii U with him, but depending on the game the controls would generally be too confusing for him and he would get frustrated, which led to him getting loud again and yelled at more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, today we got to my grandparents house and after being there for a bit he started to get more excited and eventually started to get yelled at again. So I asked if he wanted to play a game with me and IMMEDIATELY he shook his head &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, said &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I love you!&amp;quot;, and hugged and kissed me lol. So I stopped playing Zelda, popped the Joy-Con off, and started up the Puyo Puyo Tetris demo. He absolutely LOVED it. Plus, the Joy-Con were decluttered of all the other buttons and controls that end up leading to confusion and frustration for him. He ended up beating me in a few rounds too and he was SO happy about that. Honestly, it was a great time playing with him and this absolutely sold me on Puyo Puyo Tetris. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; The switch is so versatile and I LOVE being able to go from playing on the TV at home, to handheld on the ride to my family&amp;#39;s place, to tabletop with my cousin and having fun the entire time. Plus, the Joy-Con are absolutely perfect for what they were made for when split - simple multiplayer experiences.

Deleted it cause it was from a phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So whenever I see a post like this make it through I get super salty. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NintendoSwitch", "name": "t1_dgddnjq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492457775.0, "created_utc": 1492428975.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcuwbp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rudditblue", "parent_id": "t1_dgctxf3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unlike your post about soft resetting your Switch\n\n/s ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike your post about soft resetting your Switch&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/s &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NintendoSwitch", "name": "t1_dgcuwbp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419252.0, "created_utc": 1492390452.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rx1h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rx1h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rx1h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgde3ih", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fizzlefry9", "parent_id": "t1_dgcuxev", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was super awesome.
