After the Festival's opening, participating artists from Manila and the provinces had joined up with members of the Baguio Arts Guild for a dinner at the Cafe by the Ruins, Baguio\u00b4s homegrown cultural center. As they sat around the Caf\u00e9's \"dap-ay\" (a circular rock installation found in the tribal villages of the Cordillera where elders hold their council and initiation rites), someone picked up a couple of pieces of pinewood meant for the fire raging at the centre. Another picked up some bamboo segments. Rum and beer bottles were used. So were covers of pots and pans. Rocks were pounded. Sticks flailed. A rhythm was born influenced by the traditional beats of the surrounding indigenous Igorots. The well known rock band The Blank joined in with lead and bass guitars. A keyboard was set up. Saxophones and flutes appeared. The indigenous Bisaya and Ilonggo contingents from the southern islands of the Philippines connected with their melodies. The music was called \"Rock \u2018n\u00b4 Runo\" (a reed found in the highlands similar to thin bamboo) as opposed to rock \u2018n\u00b4 roll.
