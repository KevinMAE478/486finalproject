At 17 years old, the classically trained singer/songwriter is taking the music world by storm with her inimitable style, which seamlessly melds elements of R&amp;B, Electronic, Soul and Hip-Hop. As Pitchfork declared, \u201cShe roars. She soars. She has the right.\u201d\n\n&gt; Born and raised on Chicago\u2019s often turbulent south side, Lenae is part of \u201cZero Fatigue,\u201d a local music collective that boasts artists like Smino and Jean Deaux, as well as producer, Monte Booker. In early 2015, Lenae released her single, \u201cGreetings,\u201d which quickly became a household favorite in the Chicago area and beyond. Soon after, she signed with renowned Chicago-based record label, Three Twenty Three Music Group. \nIn August of 2015, Lenae soft released her highly acclaimed debut EP, Moon Shoes, which premiered on Fake Shore Drive and My Mixtapes and has well over two million plays on SoundCloud. Hypetrak appropriately described the EP as a \u201ccombination of entrancing vocals, control over creative cadences and superb writing,\u201d and noted that Lenae demonstrates an \u201cincredible collection of skills that many singers work a lifetime on perfecting.\u201d After the success of Moon Shoes, Lenae was named Verizon\u2019s Big Break Artist on WGCI in Chicago, as well as one of BBC Radio\u2019s New Names of 2016. To date, Lenae has performed all over the country, including headlining appearances at Chicago\u2019s African Fest and at House of Blues Chicago. On 7/29, Moon Shoes will be available at all DSPs and will feature two new songs, \u201cRight Of Spring\u201d and \u201cSomething In The Air.\u201d\nGiven her remarkable ability to blend genres, it\u2019s no surprise that Lenae has been influenced by a wide variety of artists, from Stereolab and Outkast to Bob Marley and Ella Fitzgerald. \u201cI tend to take small bits and pieces from my favorite artist, and incorporate them into my own work,\u201d shares Lenae. And, maybe that\u2019s why some of her favorites - like Erykah Badu and NAS - are now reaching out as dedicated fans of Lenae. \n\n&gt; With a lifetime ahead of her, fans can look forward to a whole lot more from Ravyn Lenae. \u201cI plan to touch as many people with my music as I possibly can,\u201d says Lenae. \u201cAnd, I can\u2019t wait to learn more about the world and about myself.
