I know that the Church Fathers accepted a lot of the Marian dogmas, but it just seems doubtful that the Apostles believed such things.  Yes, Mary is mentioned in the Gospels, but why don&amp;#39;t we see the Theotokos being mentioned in Acts or the Epistles?  Why just the focus on Jesus?  It just seems like the Marian dogmas came about as a defense against Pagan critiques of Christ.  The early Christians felt the need to assert that Mary was pure and sinless in order to defend Christ&amp;#39;s divine nature.  I often ask myself: was the Christianity of Augustine or St. John of Damascus the same as the Christianity of Peter and Paul?  Why were there all these later developments about the 2 natures of Christ and all the decisions in the Ecumenical Councils that needed to be fleshed out?

Were the early Christians without a chief source of authority? Think about it.

He gave them no command to write, and never restricted their authority to the written word. His authority attached to their persons and their teaching.\n\nAnd the apostles transmitted this authority to their successors as Scripture and history attest. I think once one comes to accept the teaching authority of the Church (i.e., the Magisterium), issues such as the Immaculate Conception and other teachings of the Church become easier to handle. \n\n&gt;Second, I've been listening to some Catholic and Orthodox podcasts, and was surprised to learn that some of the traditions about Mary have their source in apocryphal works like the Infancy Gospel of James.

I've had conversations with a co-worker who is a Jehovah's Witness who throws arguments like that regarding my belief in the Trinity.

I know that the Church Fathers accepted a lot of the Marian dogmas, but it just seems doubtful that the Apostles believed such things. Yes, Mary is mentioned in the Gospels, but why don't we see the Theotokos being mentioned in Acts or the Epistles? Why just the focus on Jesus?\n\nMary is called the mother of our Lord by Elizabeth in the gospel of St. Luke. So, we have that. As far as Mary not being a prime subject in the Acts or the Epistles ... I think that would be because the overall emphasis is on Christ. He is the Savior, not His mother. However, as the Church progressed and encountered various heresies attacking the person of Christ we see apologetics developing that focus more on Mary as to assuage heresy and defend both the humanity and deity of her Son. \n\n&gt;It just seems like the Marian dogmas came about as a defense against Pagan critiques of Christ. The early Christians felt the need to assert that Mary was pure and sinless in order to defend Christ's divine nature. I often ask myself: was the Christianity of Augustine or St. John of Damascus the same as the Christianity of Peter and Paul? Why were there all these later developments about the 2 natures of Christ and all the decisions in the Ecumenical Councils that needed to be fleshed out? Would St. Paul be a heretic if he held maintained his beliefs at Nicea or Chalcedon?\n\nOf course, a lot of people believe that. But as one who believes in the teaching authority of the apostles and Jesus' promise to be with His Church and keep her strong and faithful til the end, such a thought cannot be entertained by me. \n", "edited": 1492092851.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, shouldn&amp;#39;t the Bible be the chief source of authority since its the oldest and mostly un-changed source of early Christian beliefs?

The early Christians felt the need to assert that Mary was pure and sinless in order to defend Christ&amp;#39;s divine nature. I often ask myself: was the Christianity of Augustine or St. John of Damascus the same as the Christianity of Peter and Paul? Why were there all these later developments about the 2 natures of Christ and all the decisions in the Ecumenical Councils that needed to be fleshed out? Would St. Paul be a heretic if he held maintained his beliefs at Nicea or Chalcedon?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lot of people believe that. But as one who believes in the teaching authority of the apostles and Jesus&amp;#39; promise to be with His Church and keep her strong and faithful til the end, such a thought cannot be entertained by me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dg7l9br", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121388.0, "created_utc": 1492092588.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655bq9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655bq9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655bq9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655bq9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8m66d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fr-josh", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qx03", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Our understanding definitely developed and many of the beliefs weren't explicit (there's an adjective I'm looking for- nascent, maybe?), but nothing has been invented. \n\nUsually things weren't explicit yet because there was no need until heresies popped up and we had to make it clear what has always been taught.
