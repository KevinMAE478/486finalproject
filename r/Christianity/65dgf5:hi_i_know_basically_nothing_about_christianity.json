I'll first start off by addressing your question's main assumption: that there are good people in the world. We must start by first understanding what good means: to be perfect. To call something good, biblically speaking, is to call it perfect. For example:\n\n\"17 As Jesus started on His way, a man ran up and knelt before Him. \u201cGood Teacher,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d \n 18 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? Jesus replied, \u201c**No one is good except God alone.**\" [Mark 10:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-30&amp;version=NIV)\n\nYou see, when the man called him good, he wasn't being entirely picky with his word choice. So when Yeshua responded, he was asking the man if he was calling him God, since \u201cNo one is good except God alone.\" He was asking the man if he even know knew what he was saying by calling him good. This was Yeshua hinting as to who exactly he was.\n\nEnough of definitions; to address you question. We are told by Christ himself that the path to heaven is narrow:\n\n\"13 Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. \n 14 But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it. \" [Matthew 7:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:13-14)\n\nYou question is as to the why, and frankly anything I type will be too short to truly do the answer justice. So I'll leave [this](https://www.gotquestions.org/narrow-path.html) here for you and try to summarize it the best I can.\n\nLike we have already covered, [no one is righteous](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A9-20&amp;version=ESV). We all deserve punishment and hell: I know I surely do. But God loves us too much to just let us go off to destruction without doing something about it. By paying the price for our sins, he was opening the way to heaven open and freely to anyone who was willing to follow Christ. Don't make the silly misunderstanding that someone can just pay lip-service to Jesus before they die and expect to somehow \"cheat the system\". [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_JoE2GioXY). God knows the difference between a truly contrite/repentant heart and one still full of pride and rebellion. As such, saying you follow Yeshua is different then actually doing it. Saving faith isn't the same as lip-service, and Christians would do well to remember that:\n\n\"21 \u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?\u2019 23 And then will I declare to them, \u2018I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.\u2019\" [Matthew 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A21-23&amp;version=ESV)\n\nSimply put, the reason the path to heaven is so narrow is not that it somehow God stacks the deck against us. It's that it is a choice to follow God, and we humans are very prideful and rebellious. We like to do things our way, often brazenly in defiance. I know I do. Christianity is a faith that is different from many other religions in that it openly advertises that you're life will be more difficult if you choose to really follow it. That being said, if it is true then there is a big question we have to ask ourselves: Am I going to let my pride get in the way of pursuing the Truth?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I'm so sorry this is so long haha", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I makes sense friend.

The reason I think it's more powerful to experience than to try and explain or listen to is because of how weird and out of our normal perception it is.  So I totally understand inquiry and skepticism.  \n\nThis will probably be a wall of text, because it's hard to explain succinctly, but I'm happy to answer any questions or chat about it further!\n\nMy first experience with Him was really powerful, and actually came while I was an atheist.  It's directly responsible for me being a Christian.  \n\nI was meeting a friend's new friend for the first time, and we were walking through the city, and the conversation gradually got more personal.  The new friend asked if we believed in God, and at the time I considered myself an \"anti-theist.\"  So, not only did I not believe, but I was not nearly as respectful to people with faith as you're being right now.  I had the perspective that not only was God not real, but that anyone who believe in Him needed to be \"corrected.\" \n\nSo, as I'm about to open my mouth to start sharing this perspective, I became filled with the Holy Spirit.  If you don't know (I didn't at the time!) Christianity makes the claim that God's spirit dwells on the Earth and works in the hearts of human beings, but also provides a witnessing testimony to the truth of Christ.   \n\nI believe this is what happened to me (and I didn't even know it was something that Christianity said *could* happen until I read the Bible as a new believer).  Encountering the Holy Spirit is hard to describe. It's kind of like encountering a living being whose presence and identity you can detect like you can detect temperature.  When it's warm or cold you can feel it surrounding you and within you, and you don't have to consult a thermometer.  Even if you had never heard of the concept of \"warm\" you'd know what it felt like to be warm the first time you experienced it.  \n\nWith the Holy Spirit, I could feel a sentient presence surround me and actually dwell *within me*.  It felt like it was sharing my headspace, as if to say \"I'm here, you reading me?\" as well as enveloping me from the outside.  \n\nIn that moment, I knew what I was encountering was the creator of everything, including me. The only explanation I could give is that something within us must be wired to recognize our creator. I knew this was the \"source\" energy of all things.  I also knew this being shared an identity with Jesus Christ, who I didn't even believe in as a historical figure at the time.  But I could read this identity through feeling this presence as easily as you can tell if someone has red hair by looking at them.  To experience *was* to know and understand.  \n\nThis being was also just positively radiating love in a way I have not experienced a parallel for.  I could feel how much this entity loved me, and truly understood that it was unconditional.  I knew this being had been with me for my entire life, and I was just now being made aware of it through perception.  I knew I had no secrets from this being, that it knew every awful thing I'd done while alone, every malicious thought I'd ever had, but that it loved me as if I had been perfect my entire life.  \n\nI knew at that feeling why Christians always say \"God is love.\" But something that surprised me that I never hear Christians talk about is that this being didn't just radiate *love*.  I also got the clear impression that He *liked* me.  On a personal level.  That I (and everyone) was created to be someone whose company God enjoyed.  That He thought my sense of humor was funny, that He enjoyed my commentary and perspective.  It felt like reunion with a long lost best friend. It wasn't just love, it was a sense of \"OH! This guy! Where have you been?!\"  Just someone I wanted to share company with. Additionally, there was a sense of affection.  The way you might feel for a beloved pet, or maybe more fittingly, a baby.  It was truly the most pure form of warmth and positivity you could feel from another being.  So easy. No fear of \"how am I coming off?\" This being knew my core self, and loved me for it.  \n\nSo all of this feeling and recognition and processing happened in the split second between when I was asked if I believed in God and I was about to answer.  I had to stumble back and say I didn't know and let my friend start talking while I continued to process.  Then I went to be alone and walk with this presence for a bit, which is where it gets a little trippy.  \n\nGod taught me during this experience how He speaks with us, by being *really* obvious about it, and warning me that it's \"normally\" more subtle.  There was linguistic communication, that is to say that I would have thoughts and God would respond in my head.  His voice was not dissimilar from my own thoughts in tone, but they were more \"firm\" than my own. Implanted in my head, rather then me generating them.  He responded in words, some of the time, and taught me that He speaks through our thoughts but we often dismiss them as our own thoughts.  \n\nHe also communicated through imagery.  He implanted symbols in my mind while providing an emotion that often answered a question more than any combination of words could. \n\nBut perhaps more interestingly and more surreal, is that God used coincidences to relay His response to me most often.  During my initial experience, He did this a few hundred times in about two hours.  In part, so that He could demonstrate His mastery over reality to me so that I wouldn't dismiss what was happening as a delusion.  For example, I'd ask a question in my mind, and then overhear some strangers saying something in another context that made *perfect* sense in response to my question.  Or other times, I'd turn a corner and words written on a billboard would perfectly answer my question.  This give and take happened literally hundreds of times during this experience.  \n\nIt took me three weeks after that to actually ask Christ to be my personal savior and to tell anyone else that I believed, and until I did so, those coincidences happened dozens of times an hour. Often leading back to Christ, or something we discussed during my first experience.  After I finally told someone I believed, that intense bombarding of coincidences stopped.\n\nSo, I say that to say that I do feel like you can get a good sense of God's character without actually *seeing* Him.  He's a higher being than us, so He exists somewhere in the boundaries of our reality.  But by pressing yourself up against those boundaries, He can be known personally.  \n\nI get things like \"humor\" and \"playful\" from my experiences with Him.  For example, on that first day I experienced Him, I sat by a pond and was looking at all the trees and animals and stuff, and I heard God say to me (jokingly, of course), \"So, who do you think made all this stuff? Probably just came into existence out of nothing by accident, right?\" He was gently poking fun at the perspective I had held just an hour or two before.  But it felt like we could laugh together about it, if that makes sense. \n\nOr for another example, I was once running very late to a super important meeting and I couldn't find my car keys. If I didn't leave the house within minutes, I'd be late enough that there would be consequences. I jokingly said out loud to God, \"I find it hilarious that you know exactly where they are and are watching me run around looking for them.  Can I get an assist, or does this amuse you?\" \n\nAnd as I finish that sentence, a gust of wind comes through an open window and blows a bunch of loose papers off of my night stand, revealing the keys underneath them.  That's pretty playful/funny to me.  \n\nI've had a couple of \"heightened\" experiences like the first one since then, but they are the exception.  God still communicates with me, though.  \n\n[Here's a couple of examples I posted elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5yjtmq/what_has_been_the_most_clear_and_direct/deqnz34/). It's a little more subtle day to day, but I think that God gave me such a heightened first experience so I'd learn how to see Him in the quiet moments. \n\nI also feel that I can see His hand in my life's shape. [I just posted this as an example if you're interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/65d237/what_is_your_story_of_divine_intervention/dg9cbp9/?context=3).  And He's come through for me against impossible odds. Things like finding the perfect apartment on almost no notice, finding the perfect job when I needed one. \n\nHe has also fundamentally changed me as a human being in a way I could not have done on my own. [I talked a little bit about that here, if you're interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/64ua9g/those_who_have_been_savedreceived_grace_what_was/dg54zpg/).\n\nAfter a little while, it's self-evident from my own perspective. \n\nI think traditionally, experiencing God is like a pyramid.  You step out on faith, and gradually learn how to hear His voice within you and in the world, and then it gets more obvious and more obvious.  Sort of the more you trust God, the less aloof He becomes, and when you get to a point of having very little doubt, you move up the pyramid and He is as obvious and interactive as any human being in your life.  \n\nI feel like I started at the top of the pyramid, where He was immediately obvious and knowable, and He taught me how to perceive Him in the subtleties.  I don't know why He did this for me, and I don't know how to direct anyone to such an intense experience. But I have seen friends step out on faith in the beginning, and \"work up\" to something very close.  It seems to start with honest prayer to know God as He is and have Him come into your life. \n\nDraw close to God, and He draws close to you.  \n\nOkay, sorry for the wall of text!
