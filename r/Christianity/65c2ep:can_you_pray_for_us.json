Is not the life more than meat, and the body than clothing? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your Heavenly Father feeds them.

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all is glory was not clothed like one of these. This is why, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, o you of little faith? Therefore take not worry saying, \"what shall we drink?\" or, \"what shall we eat?\" or \"where will the clothes that we need come from?\" (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.
