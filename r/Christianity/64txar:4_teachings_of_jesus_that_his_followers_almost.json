There was no time, they argued, to wait for private industry to get the job done.

It also increased the amount of people dependent on handouts.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the welfare state took over poverty relief, it crowded out &amp;quot;mutual aid&amp;quot; societies that the poor ran for themselves. They were like a cross between private unemployment insurance and &amp;quot;moose&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;elks&amp;quot; lodges that encouraged members to help each other out. They were better at helping the poor because their members, unlike government poverty workers, were free to make judgments about who deserved help and who didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, there are fewer mutual aid societies because people say, &amp;quot;Why do it myself when we already have giant welfare bureaucracies? My taxes pay for Obamacare, food stamps, housing vouchers, and so on. I&amp;#39;ll let the professionals handle it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those &amp;quot;professionals&amp;quot; do a poor job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, charities still try to do what government cannot do.  If government didn&amp;#39;t discourage it, more charities would do even better work with the poor. Human beings don&amp;#39;t sit around ignoring the suffering of their neighbors. But we are most likely to neglect these moral tasks when government insists it has everything covered. Get government out of the way and just watch what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: In essence, if we didn&amp;#39;t have to pay the taxes that feed into the welfare state, private citizens would be able to do a much better job than the government could ever hope to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dg75z15", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087876.0, "created_utc": 1492059076.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74p84", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg70ygf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dg74p84", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492085799.0, "created_utc": 1492056999.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg70ygf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chew_soap", "parent_id": "t1_dg5gtyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree.
