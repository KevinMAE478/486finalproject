But, for the people at the time when the schism happened, the pervasive indulgence system was one of the main gripes.

But I will still say that churches like the ones you're describing kind of make my skin crawl. I'm the last person to impose dogma, but it seems to me that a church that doesn't at least insist that its members believe in the divinity of Christ is hardly worth the name. Call it a social club or a charity or a Good Samaritan society - but don't call it a church. It's all good and fine if you want to follow Jesus, but don't believe in Christ...it's. just that that's not what Christianity is. \n\nI'm not saying that we shouldn't have a ton of outreach and actively encourage nonbelievers to come to know God, because Lord knows I've had a lot of help from those programs. But to me, a Christless church isn't just pointless, but outright harmful. It's all the trappings of Christianity, all the show and works and good feelings, but without the soul. It takes the message of Jesus and divorces it from God. Call me old-fashioned, but I don't know if I can think of a more terrible sacrilege than that.

Younger adherents will likely be increasingly zealous, but fewer in number with each generation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the rest of Christianity, I see much of the future becoming less partisan. I expect Christianity will shrink, somewhat, as American Evangelicalism loses itself to partisan politics, though. However, those that do remain, I expect to become more active, in multiple ways, but less likely to consistently choose one side in politics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum up: I expect the &amp;quot;religious right&amp;quot; to shift away from Christianity, and eventually die out (while becoming increasingly extreme as numbers shrink), while the rest of Christianity moves away from choosing one particular side in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dgdtxyr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480165.0, "created_utc": 1492451365.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vrxq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnd4b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Emufasa", "parent_id": "t3_65vrxq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As to whether we'll be growing or declining, I don't think we should be surprised if we decline.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and some are quite obvious if you don't live under a rock. There are many more signs that have been popping up lately. I really do not believe these are coincidences. Satan still rules this world. If Revelation is false, then that disrupts what a lot of us have had drilled into our heads about the Second coming, and the 1,000 year reign that comes after End Times. If we are doing so well in this day and age, then how come End Times was prophesied so long ago still? Why are End Times still coming? Just something to chew on. I feel humanity is going to be tested even more here pretty soon, especially those of us who follow Christ. \n\nEDIT: Obviously, not looking down on our attempts of ministry, but if things were getting bettter and End Times weren't coming, then hallelujah, I'd be so relieved.

It&amp;#39;s quite a realistic view.....because...the Bible talks about this in great detail... Yes, Christianity has advanced some to where other countries are accepting it more slowly over time. However, remember, there are the End Times and the Rapture. I understand not everyone believes that. Yet, look at what we are seeing just in the US nation alone that is happening lately: gay marriage and over-the-top gay entitlement, a sudden uproar of feminism with it&amp;#39;s female worshipping men showing up as a cult following practically, the Baphomet statue being erected in Detroit, Satanic prayer being stopped in public by Christians only to make us look even worse in the eyes of the public, Marijuana being legalized more and more throughout the states which just weakens the minds of people further.
