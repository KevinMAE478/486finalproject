If I decided to make a religion that gained a lot of traction in a few thousand years, and it was morally sound, does that make it true? How would you filter that out from Christianity?\n\nIt would be hard, absolutely. Look at Mormonism, how do you filter that out? They have most of the same morals. And seem like a pretty moral bunch. The difference is that faith isn't just placed on morality. There have been various arguments and experiences that made me a Christian.

And supposed miracles happen elsewhere. But the bulk of it, in AD have happened in the Catholic Church. All of these miracles have led to good things. People coming to Christ.

But the programmer can make anything happen. \n\n&gt;Also, how do you reconcile with some of the more horrendous things that happened in the old testament? I realize that the rules don't apply anymore and that the message changed a lot, but they are still things that the bible claims happened.\n\nThe message didn't really change. A lot of people get hung up on the law, but it wasn't ever enforced to the degree the law required. Christians may say the point was to show they weren't perfect. And this is true but lazy. Sin is separation from God. And all sin required an atonement. This culturally was from sacrifice. And while there was a forgiveness of sorts (the psalms mention Gods forgiveness) it wasn't the same kind. Christ was the \"paschal lamb\" meaning he was the ultimate sacrifice. Because of this the law lost it's meaning. In addition to a point it was very cultural. Jesus says \"The sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\" \n\nWhen it comes to God killing others, you have to be careful. The books of a bible all have a point, and they all tell them differently. John tells his point with a lot of allusion and hidden meaning. Luke tells the gospel from a very historical point of view, and matthew specifically to and from a jewish viewpoint. Let's look at Job. \n\nJob is an incredible jew. He loves God and has a ton of faith. He then loses literally everything and has the worst life a person can have. I believe many see this as a parable, but ultimately Job is given everything back. But he also has a stronger faith. Tragedy and bad things that happen all can strengthen us, or destroy us. I believe as someone who has been through hell, we have a choice in the matter. \n\nNow God does kill various people for various reasons. Like the flood for instance. But out of these bad things that happen, out of all the tragedy usually it is either someone directly disobeying God. Or it results in something good happening. Look at the first born being killed. That is because of free will, and the plagues started small and ended up being awful, because of pharaoh not obeying moses. Ultimately God never kills for the fun of it, he doesn't kill just to kill. It is usually to bring greater good, and it often could either be a myth or something that is exaggerated. He also shows great mercy. To Nineveh he spares the city despite Jonah waiting and wishing them to be destroyed. \n  \n&gt;What were your reasons for being an atheist?\n\nI think many atheists hate on \"experience\" that \"experience\" isn't evidence. Well I disagree. I was an atheist because of experience. I saw Christians as awful people. So I separated myself. Then I became an atheist because of poor biblical arguments (I thought the law of Leviticus was supposed to still be followed). But mainly it was because of a sense that nothing in our daily life supports this. Where can I see God outside of the bible? You look around and it's just life, and everything moves forward with no apparent God. \n\nWell if you are a Catholic, you got a lot of tradition, and history of God directly working. I feel like many atheist arguments about the bible and Christianity cannot touch catholicism because of the belief of the authority of the church.

But as an atheist a big problem was that you could make the bible say anything you want to. Or how \"it's in the bible\" is the biggest response. In the Catholic Church you just don't have that.\n\nBut when it comes to God. You have people desperately trying to prove that he exists, and people desperately trying to prove he doesn't. You can find a way for rational thinking to say he does exist or he doesn't. So let's start with what we do have.\n\n* The Bible\n\n* The Church\n\n* The History of the Jews and then Christianity\n\nThese are all evidence of something. It's like if you have a thousand people on a ship who all at once say they saw a humongous sea serpent, it's not only a claim, but also evidence. \n\nSo we know this is different from Santa Claus. Now I want to talk about two things, consciousness and philosophy.\n\nConsciousness is a huge problem. It's not just that we can think and make actions and our actions use thought as a medium. But you are you and I am I. Looking at chaos theory, if a single thing before your conception was different, you would not exist. This means there is a 1/100000000etc chance of you existing. \n\nWhat convinced me of being an agnostic, is that's a little too steep of a number for me to be alive right now. And the concept of a soul different from a body, but attached to one, makes a lot of sense. If a different sperm and egg could result in still a me, then there has to be something else. Otherwise it is near impossible that I am me. \n\nSecondly with philosophy, in the 1800s especially everyone talked about a lack of meaning. This was solved in various ways. From religion to Nietzsche many views, but what convinced me was Camus. He said that religion negated the problem of suicide. But if religion is correct then it solves it.\n\nReligion is a piece that solves philosophy. It gives meaning. For all of our desires there is something that can fill it, except the longing for meaning. Through Christianity God can fulfill this.\n\nFinally there are various miracles that have gone unexplained. Like the miracle of the sun, miraculous healings of lourdes, and even our lady of guadalupe have resulted in some pretty incredible things. Also take into account that the Catholic church is the longest surviving organization for 2000 years, and despite having awful terrible popes at times, a pope has never thrown the church off course. Not once has a doctrine on faith or morality changed.  \n\nFor me you have to look at the implications of things. You look at  the world, yourself, consciousness, philosophy, and it all implies something that we are missing. There is just something that we are missing. Something that philosophy since even before Taoism has acknowledged. If there is something missing, then it implies there is something to fill it. (A hole in a wall doesn't necessarily mean something is missing, but a missing puzzle piece implies something to fulfill that). And once we believe that \"There just has to be something more, something else\" it can either be something we don't know, or something we do know. If it's something we don't know, we cannot act on that and it's mostly up to fate. If it's something we do know, then our entire life is supposed to change. Now we have a bunch of religions. And I think the ones that make most sense are Islam and Christianity (as far as being able to fill that void). And looking at the arguments between the two I found Christianity to make the most sense. \n\nThis is a bad explanation of my entire thought process and various logical arguments that allowed me to believe.
