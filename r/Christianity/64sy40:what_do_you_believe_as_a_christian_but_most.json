Here goes :)\n\n\n&gt;Why Purgatorial Universalism?\n\nI outlined it somewhat [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/62ybg5/what_is_christian_universalism/dfq554t/)\n\n&gt;To paraphrase St Isaac, \"The entirety of man's sin is as a handful of dust tossed into the ocean of God's mercy.\"\n\n&gt; Essentially I leaned toward universalism because God is supremely merciful. But it's a purgatorial universalism. I didn't think everyone just ended up \"in heaven\", but rather that God's presence and love will overwhelm even the most bitter and cynical and hate-filled. It's based on a few ideas: 1) a singular afterlife, not a binary (the presence of God), 2) free will in the afterlife, and 3) heaven wouldn't be heaven if people are suffering in torment next to us.\n\n&gt; The final point I think is pretty key. How could I ever possible have a \"heaven\" if my father is getting tortured? How could you or your friends ever have a heaven if their \"unsaved\" friends are getting tortured?\n\n&gt; ETA:\nIt's also important to note that universalism itself was never condemned by the church -- only Origen's version, and only as a subset of \"the teachings of Origen,\" not directly. That said, the circumstances around his anathematization seems suspect to me as well (The emperor Justinian requested the counsel of bishops to declare his teachings heretical, and they did so before the official meeting, and this gave Justinian the power to burn his writings and exile anyone who followed them. But Justinian was a warmonger and seemed to think God's kingdom was an earthly one tied to the state. It just all seems suspect because of the power involved in the matter.)\n\n---\n&gt;Why support for same-sex marriage \n\nFrom my comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/64dhge/what_is_one_thing_you_dont_agree_with_your/dg1aic1/)\n&gt;Homosexuality, because I don't believe Paul's use of the term he invented (\"man-bed\") is the same thing as a monogamous and godly lifelong partnership between two men or women. There's already precedent reading Paul with \"cultural context\" when he talks about women never teaching men, or talking in church, or covering their hair. There's also precedent within the Eastern Orthodox church for individual priests to hand out dispensations pastorally through something called \"economia\", and I feel that same sex marriage should be handled similarly. A non-practicing gay friend of mine who is Orthodox also does not believe the stance against SSM has the historical catholicity required to be considered \"Holy Tradition\", and questions it on that angle.\n\n---\n\n&gt;first trimester abortion\n\nThis one I haven't talked much about on this forum, at least not recent enough to find in a quick search!  There's a few reasons. Essentially it comes down to the identification of personhood and when the rights of the unborn override the rights of the mother. I think forcing a rape victim to carry her rape baby to term is a greater sin than terminating it first trimester. Also I think there are a few deontological issues that haven't been worked through, even in the church. Most people will say \"conception\" but that doesn't often determine before or after implantation. A fertilized egg is different than an implanted egg. Regular birth control pills prevent implantation as one of its mechanisms. But the body itself prevents implantation frequently. It also miscarries (aborts) naturally as well for health of the mother. Between these measures nearly 50% of all fertilizations end in natural abortions. Why are these not mourned or even seen as deaths? Are women who take oral birth control all guilty of murder since it may have led to the expelling of fertilized eggs? There's of course the arguments for the ability of a mother to care for the child financially or emotionally, and the alternative being worse in many instances. But as anyone who is pro-choice will say, they aren't pro-abortion, only they recognize that abortions are going to happen either way -- it's just better to have it be a medical procedure than with a coathanger. It's a complex issue with no easy solution either way. I lean to first-trimester, which is more moderate than most progressives/liberals, because I recognize many of the arguments for abortion begin to fade after viability begins to be a significant consideration and the mass of cells begins to become an actual human (with obvious exemptions for life of the mother) but I can see why the current system sets it at end of second trimester. The \"pro-life\" camp doesn't really have a line besides \"conception\", which as I mentioned before doesn't seem to recognize the 50% of fertilizations that end in natural abortions. It's just trying to find the most ethical solution *for all parties* for a situation that sucks for everyone involved.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three long conversations/debates in one!

I didn&amp;#39;t think everyone just ended up &amp;quot;in heaven&amp;quot;, but rather that God&amp;#39;s presence and love will overwhelm even the most bitter and cynical and hate-filled. It&amp;#39;s based on a few ideas: 1) a singular afterlife, not a binary (the presence of God), 2) free will in the afterlife, and 3) heaven wouldn&amp;#39;t be heaven if people are suffering in torment next to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final point I think is pretty key. How could I ever possible have a &amp;quot;heaven&amp;quot; if my father is getting tortured? How could you or your friends ever have a heaven if their &amp;quot;unsaved&amp;quot; friends are getting tortured?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA:\nIt&amp;#39;s also important to note that universalism itself was never condemned by the church -- only Origen&amp;#39;s version, and only as a subset of &amp;quot;the teachings of Origen,&amp;quot; not directly. That said, the circumstances around his anathematization seems suspect to me as well (The emperor Justinian requested the counsel of bishops to declare his teachings heretical, and they did so before the official meeting, and this gave Justinian the power to burn his writings and exile anyone who followed them. But Justinian was a warmonger and seemed to think God&amp;#39;s kingdom was an earthly one tied to the state. It just all seems suspect because of the power involved in the matter.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why support for same-sex marriage &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my comments &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/64dhge/what_is_one_thing_you_dont_agree_with_your/dg1aic1/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality, because I don&amp;#39;t believe Paul&amp;#39;s use of the term he invented (&amp;quot;man-bed&amp;quot;) is the same thing as a monogamous and godly lifelong partnership between two men or women. There&amp;#39;s already precedent reading Paul with &amp;quot;cultural context&amp;quot; when he talks about women never teaching men, or talking in church, or covering their hair. There&amp;#39;s also precedent within the Eastern Orthodox church for individual priests to hand out dispensations pastorally through something called &amp;quot;economia&amp;quot;, and I feel that same sex marriage should be handled similarly. A non-practicing gay friend of mine who is Orthodox also does not believe the stance against SSM has the historical catholicity required to be considered &amp;quot;Holy Tradition&amp;quot;, and questions it on that angle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;first trimester abortion&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one I haven&amp;#39;t talked much about on this forum, at least not recent enough to find in a quick search!  There&amp;#39;s a few reasons. Essentially it comes down to the identification of personhood and when the rights of the unborn override the rights of the mother. I think forcing a rape victim to carry her rape baby to term is a greater sin than terminating it first trimester. Also I think there are a few deontological issues that haven&amp;#39;t been worked through, even in the church. Most people will say &amp;quot;conception&amp;quot; but that doesn&amp;#39;t often determine before or after implantation. A fertilized egg is different than an implanted egg. Regular birth control pills prevent implantation as one of its mechanisms. But the body itself prevents implantation frequently. It also miscarries (aborts) naturally as well for health of the mother. Between these measures nearly 50% of all fertilizations end in natural abortions. Why are these not mourned or even seen as deaths? Are women who take oral birth control all guilty of murder since it may have led to the expelling of fertilized eggs? There&amp;#39;s of course the arguments for the ability of a mother to care for the child financially or emotionally, and the alternative being worse in many instances. But as anyone who is pro-choice will say, they aren&amp;#39;t pro-abortion, only they recognize that abortions are going to happen either way -- it&amp;#39;s just better to have it be a medical procedure than with a coathanger. It&amp;#39;s a complex issue with no easy solution either way. I lean to first-trimester, which is more moderate than most progressives/liberals, because I recognize many of the arguments for abortion begin to fade after viability begins to be a significant consideration and the mass of cells begins to become an actual human (with obvious exemptions for life of the mother) but I can see why the current system sets it at end of second trimester. The &amp;quot;pro-life&amp;quot; camp doesn&amp;#39;t really have a line besides &amp;quot;conception&amp;quot;, which as I mentioned before doesn&amp;#39;t seem to recognize the 50% of fertilizations that end in natural abortions. It&amp;#39;s just trying to find the most ethical solution &lt;em&gt;for all parties&lt;/em&gt; for a situation that sucks for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dg5bik6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991990.0, "created_utc": 1491963190.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5988s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheThirdWaluigi", "parent_id": "t1_dg4x06i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why Purgatorial Universalism?
