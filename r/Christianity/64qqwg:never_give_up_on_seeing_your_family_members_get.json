How is this an accurate comparison? God is the one who wants to be our Father and have us live with Him in his place. He is fully rightous, so much so that anything that is not rightous could not be in His presence -it would defile Him. Thats what being holy is all about. He is the one that loves us so much that He created a plan to make us holy by suffering himself. He is the one that created us, that holds everything together, that blesses the rightous and the unrighteous, that nothing is not known to Him, and nothing binds Him. This is what God is to us man. I think your Voldemort comparison is sound if we are talking about another man or wizards apparently, but putting God back into the passages you can understand why He has the nerve to say such things and how these things work in His plan.\n\nMany people outside the Christian church think we are hypocrites because we have morals from God that we determine right from wrong. We are actually the farthest thing from hypocritical because the whole premise of the Christian belief is based on the fact that no man can fulfill these morals. Being a Christian does not entitle us to be self-rightous and call others evil. Being Christians entitle us to believe we are not worthy to be in the presence of God because we are so unrighteous. The only thing that keeps us from hell and that seperates us from from athiests is that we believe Jesus Christ fulfilled the morals of God and through His shedding of blood our unrighteous will be passed over in the day of judgment.\n\nSo if you want to hold God up to your standards, at least know who God is and what Christianity is about. If you do find out who He is, you will understand that you can't judge God. You are now in the place of Voldemort. What nerve do you as a man have to hold God accountable for what He does? What close-mindedness do you possess for not being able to see God's perspective? \n\nI believe in God the Father and in Jesus and His sacrafice through historical records and an obvious cultural phenomenon. I belive in the Holy Spirit by these sources as well with the addition of my personal experiences with it working in life. Some people say they would only believe in God if He came and knocked on their door. For some, I don't think that this would even be enough. If you expect God to reveal Himself in a way you want Him to, you are very close-minded to how He might actually reveal Himself. No? It is clear He is not revealing Himself in a suitable manner for yourself. Does this mean He is not real or He is not revealing himself some other way? If God was real wouldn't it be exciting and wouldn't you want to look into it and learn more about it. I can tell by your current understanding of who God is that you have not fully looked into who God really is. For now, you are happy making up your own morals and making up your own happy endings. Good luck with that. I would hope you are right for your sake. I am not trying to disrespect you in saying all of this. I am representing God as I understand Him, and simply He is quite different from what you represent Him to be. \nGod bless you, stranger.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You seriously had me confused for a minute talking about wizards and Hogwarts lol. How is this an accurate comparison? God is the one who wants to be our Father and have us live with Him in his place. He is fully rightous, so much so that anything that is not rightous could not be in His presence -it would defile Him. Thats what being holy is all about. He is the one that loves us so much that He created a plan to make us holy by suffering himself. He is the one that created us, that holds everything together, that blesses the rightous and the unrighteous, that nothing is not known to Him, and nothing binds Him. This is what God is to us man.

They're taken directly from the Bible (Hosea 9:11-16 NLT) | (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB) | (2 Samuel 6:3-7 NAB).  I've merely replaced most of the proper nouns, particularly all iterations of \"God\" and \"the LORD\" with \"Voldemort.\"  \n\nThe point I wished to make is simple: any objective, unbiased eye would be able to tell that the Voldemort character above is an unequivocal douche and villain.  He's a straight up evil, murderous, child-slaughtering, baby-killing, hateful person.  The same is true of the God character in the bible in many *many* passages.  Yet, many religious believers are perfectly willing to overlook this same exact horribleness simply because it's their religion, and the cognitive dissonance that occurs when the \"God is always perfect and good\" bias collides with these terrifying examples of evilness causes them to do one of 3 things.  Either they:\n\nA) Blissfully avoid the bad passages all together, rendering any notion that God can be bad virtually invisible to them.\nB) Or they see the bad stuff, but choose to ignore it and just focus on the good parts. \nC) Or they *somehow* attempt to rationalize these horrible things like murder and rape (ie. God wanted them dead because they worshiped a false idol, or lay with another man, or ate shellfish! As if any of that is in ANY way a good enough reason to justify murder.)\n\nThe fact that religion has the power to warp the perspectives of people who are otherwise probably decent and good so much that they can defend - passively or actively - this kind of terribleness is the only thing that frustrates me.  My only \"bitterness\" is toward **religion** and some of its more extreme and condescending practitioners who align themselves with this awfulness and then have the audacity to condemn good people as \"evil.\"  It's ludicrous and, from my humble atheistic perspective, completely hypocritical.  If there *is* a hell, I think it's far more likely that people like that would end up there than your average, kind, reasonable, honest, non-evil, non-believer.  \n\n(Please note that I don't (and can't) have bitterness toward your capital G.o.d., which I don't believe exists :P  That wouldn't make much sense, would it?  I have no more bitterness toward the biblical God than I do toward Vishnu or Ra :D)\n\nLastly, I'm TOTALLY down with everything being about love and kindness and respect and goodwill and empathy. Those are precisely the virtues most atheists hold in the highest regard.
