About an hour after I got there Jimmy&amp;#39;s father came up to me to thank me for coming and also to invite me to church tomorrow.  I declined his request.  Undaunted he asked if I would be interested in leaving a tithe in the donation tray.  I know it&amp;#39;s odd for an Atheist to say something like this, but I consider myself &amp;quot;blessed&amp;quot; in the money department, so I said &amp;quot;Sure&amp;quot;, and handed him $100 from my walled.  Everything was fine after that and the dinner went really well.  About an hour ago I decided it was time for me to head out, but before I left I asked Jimmy to come out to say goodbye.  I chitchatted about keeping out of trouble, don&amp;#39;t do drugs, etc., etc...  He said he was going to be good, so we said bye and I started to get in my car.  Before I could close the door he said to me &amp;quot;Hey, you wanna see something my uncle gave me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His uncle, a dyed in the wool redneck, had thought it would be smart to give a 17 year old on house arrest a set of BRASS KNUCKLES as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SMDH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was frustrating to say the least.  I ended up talking to him for another 10 minutes about bad decision making and I ultimately asked him if he didn&amp;#39;t think throwing them away would be a good idea.  He was dead-set against that, so instead I said &amp;quot;Tell ya what, why don&amp;#39;t you sell them to me?  Will $5.00 do it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He jumped at the chance so I gave him the last $5 I had in my pocket and took the knux from him and left.  I threw them in a dumpster at a car wash and didn&amp;#39;t think anything else of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 10 minutes ago I got a phone call from Jimmy.
