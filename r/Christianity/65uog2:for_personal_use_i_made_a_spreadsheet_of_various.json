If you are in a relationship with somebody, you don&amp;#39;t want them to do things for you simply as a result of rules you have set and agreed upon. You want it to come out of their love for you and a desire to do good things for you. That, I believe, is what God wants from us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in a relationship you might set guidelines for yourself, like, &amp;quot;I should buy flowers for my wife once a week.&amp;quot; But if you only ever buy flowers to fulfill that promise, and not out of a desire to do something good for your wife, it&amp;#39;s meaningless. So, for me to say I want to give 10% is fine. But to impose that on someone else, or to count every penny and make sure I give exactly 10%, or to give begrudgingly only to fulfill the rule; that is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dge5skd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493594.0, "created_utc": 1492464794.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge5ahp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShaneSupreme", "parent_id": "t1_dge534m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for your response.
