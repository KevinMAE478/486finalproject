But **radical** reduction, without any form recovery, leads to a complete loss of meaning.\n\nIt may sound like I'm speaking another language right now. [Here's a short article](https://stanrock.net/2015/03/11/the-sun-also-rises-or-the-heterophroneo-of-everything/), including a comic, that explains the terms I'm using.\n\nOne of the big problems at my job is designing an elder game experience that keeps folks around, which means keeping things meaningful. Existential crisis, in a person's life and in a video game, happens when achievement outpaces novelty.\n\nThere are a few speculative reasons why eternity probably won't \"run out\" (from [this article](https://stanrock.net/2014/03/27/christus-victor-existentialism-faces-eternity/)):\n\n* First, our material brains don\u2019t store things very well. Can you recall what you were doing exactly one year ago? No, you can\u2019t. You even find new enjoyable elements in movies you\u2019ve seen dozens of times. You take pleasure and satisfaction in that \u201cweakness\u201d of perception and memory.\n\n* Second, God\u2019s universe is likely stocked with innumerable things to discover. And the time it would take to discover even a miniscule fraction of that universe would represent a period under which innumerable new potential discoveries would be born.\n\n* Finally, however God\u2019s universe is brimming with things to discover, it\u2019ll be brimming over exponentially more with things we\u2019ll be building ourselves for his glory.\n\nBut these things are \"forgettable\" when we fast-forward past all of this stuff (using terms like \"quintillions\" is a red flag for radical reduction).
