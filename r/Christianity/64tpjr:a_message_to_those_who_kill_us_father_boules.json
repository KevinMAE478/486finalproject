BOULES GEORGE)\n\nBoules George\nToday, Palm Sunday 2017, two bombs exploded in Egypt, one inside St. George\u2019s Church in Tanta, and one just outside St. Mark\u2019s in Alexandria wherein Pope Tawadros II was praying. At the Eve of Monday Pascha service, Fr. Boules George gave a most powerful and compelling sermon. Because we English-speakers are deprived of 90% of the beautiful things that come out of the Church (this is not a statistical fact but it is a feeling), I tried to translate as much of this clip as I could in my weak understanding. It gave me SO much comfort and SO much strength, and I felt it would be wrong not to pass it on. Tamer Mina did what I could not\u2013he created a subtitled video of the clip which originally inspired me. Please watch even a bit of it to get a feel for Fr. Boules. My written translation is a shadow of the force of his words and the Holy Spirit that fills them. I am confident that Coptic priests across the globe gave similar messages.\n\nA MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO KILL US\n\nFr. Boules George, St. Mark, Cleopatra (Cairo, Egypt)\n\nA VERY sincere thank you to Tamer Mina for creating a video with subtitles! Watch + read at once! Or just read the transcript below.\n\n\n\nWhat will we say to them?\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nThe first thing we will say is \u201cThank you very, very much,\u201d and you won\u2019t believe us when we say it.\n\nYou know why we thank you? I\u2019ll tell you. You won\u2019t get it, but please believe us.\n\nYou gave us to die the same death as Christ\u2013and this is the biggest honor we could have. Christ was crucified\u2013and this is our faith. He died and was slaughtered\u2013and this is our faith. You gave us, and you gave them to die.\n\nWe thank you because you shortened for us the journey. When someone is headed home to a particular city, he keeps looking at the time. \u201cWhen will I get home? Are we there yet?\u201d Can you imagine if in an instant he finds himself on a rocket ship straight to his destination? You shortened the journey! Thank you for shortening the journey.\n\nWe thank you because you gave to us to fulfill what Christ said to us: \u201cBehold, I send you out as lambs among wolves\u201d (Luke 10:3). We were lambs; our only weapons: our faith and the church we pray in. I carry no weapon in my hand. We are so grateful that you helped us fulfill this saying of Christ.\n\nThank you for helping us achieve our goal. You\u2019re helping us, and you don\u2019t even know it. I know you don\u2019t understand, but I\u2019m trying to explain it to you. There are people we visited at home to encourage them to come to church\u2013three, four, five times. Still they won\u2019t come. What you\u2019re doing here\u2013you\u2019re bringing to church the people who never come. Believe me\u2013it\u2019s bringing to church the people who never come!\n\nPeople who were living in sin and away from God, after the bombing of St. Peter\u2019s Chapel in the Cathedral, they were saying, \u201cYou never know when your number\u2019s up. Better take more care [in our spiritual lives].\u201d All these vistations we do\u2013you\u2019re so much more effective. You\u2019re filling up our churches! You\u2019re filling our churches!\n\nLet\u2019s speak plainly here\u2026 Usually attendance at the Eve of Monday Pascha is very little. People are usually so tired after a long Palm Sunday Liturgy and the General Funeral, and they don\u2019t come to the Eve of Monday services. When I came in tonight, there were people on chairs outside the sanctuary, there were people in the balcony seating. The church is completely full. There isn\u2019t even one empty nook. Thank you. We are so grateful that you\u2019re helping fill up our churches.\n\nWhen you do this, you irritate the soul of the person who was lazy before. You wake his conscience and the love of God within him prods him to come to church.\n\nCan you see why we thank you? We\u2019re not being deceptive. A priest holding a microphone can\u2019t lie to you! I say to you: THANK YOU. Thank you for all you have done for us without even noticing.\n\nWE LOVE YOU\n\nThe second part of the message we want to send to you is that we love you. And this, unfortunately, you won\u2019t understand at all. Maybe you won\u2019t believe us when we say we\u2019re grateful. But this\u2013you won\u2019t even understand. Why won\u2019t you understand it? Because this too is a teaching of our Christ. I want to explain to you about our Christ. I want to tell you about how wonderful He is.\n\nSee what Christ said: If you love those who love you, you have no profit or reward with me. Even thugs and thieves love those who love them. Any gang loves its members. Even the drug dealers all like each other and take care of each other. Right? But I want to tell you that \u201cif you love those who love you, what reward have you\u2026 But I say to you, love your enemies\u201d (Matthew 5:46, 44).\n\nWe Christians don\u2019t have enemies. We don\u2019t have enemies; others make enmity with us. The Christian doesn\u2019t make enemies because we are commanded to love everyone. And so, we love you because this is the teaching of our God\u2013that I\u2019m to love you\u2013no matter what you do to me.\n\nI love you very much. And I want to say one last thing to you: we\u2019re praying for you. Because the One who told us to love you told us to \u201cbless those who curse you\u2026 and PRAY for those who spitefully use you\u201d (Matthew 5:44). So my instructions from my loving God make it my duty to pray for you.\n\nIn one of the dioceses, there is a bishop. In that diocese, there is a man who gets on the microphone every week to say terrible things about Christians\u2013unheard of things. So the servants [of the diocese] are hearing this man and are so upset. We didn\u2019t do anything to this man. He\u2019s just taken a vow to curse us. Every Friday he comes out and curses the Christians.\n\nSo the bishop is sitting with his servants, and he asks them, \u201cAre you upset by what this man says?\u201d And they say, \u201cOf course! We are so upset! What\u2019s he doing to us!\u201d The bishop gets quiet and his face darkens with sorrow. The servants say to him, \u201cYou have a right to be upset from what he says, Your Grace. You have a right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not upset with him,\u201d the bishop says, \u201cI\u2019m upset with you! You are servants\u2013you? How many of you pray for him every day? Because if he tasted of the love of God, if he knew who our Lord is, he could never hate again because God is love.\n\n\u201cHow many of you are praying for him? Aren\u2019t you servants! Aren\u2019t you Christians! So you are a servant teaching in the Sunday School here, and you\u2019ve broken the commandment of Christ to pray for this person?!\u201d\n\nSo what do you think? How about we make a commitment to pray for them? Pray that they know the God of love? Pray that they experience the love of God? Because if they knew that God is love and experienced His love, they could not do these things\u2013never, never, never.\n\nThey are a wretched lot. And because they are wretched, we must pray for them. But when someone loves God, he won\u2019t know except love.\n\nWe need to pray for them so they can sleep at night. A person who has all this inside them, how can he sleep comfortably?\n\nCan you imagine? We are being slaughtered and the King of Peace gives us peace to sleep. And the one who slaughters, all night he can\u2019t sleep.\n\nYou know where this happens in the Bible? With Daniel and the king. Daniel is put in the lion\u2019s den and he stays up all night praising God and praying for the king. And the king is up all night, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.\n\nPray for them. Take it as a command. Take it as a duty. Take it as the application of Christ\u2019s instructions.\n\nWe must ALL pray for them today that God opens their eyes and open their hearts to His love.\n\nBecause if they knew Him, they could NEVER do this.\n\nI don\u2019t want to take too long. God comfort us. God give us understanding. God give us JOY because Christ\u2019s promise is truth. He said, \u201cI will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy NO ONE will take from you\u201d (John 16:22).\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed to say at the beginning of Holy Week that the Church, though she is in pain, rejoices because today\u2013I don\u2019t know what the final count is. They said 40-something, and, of course, many people in the hospitals will catch up to them. All of these are crowns. They are rejoicing with God. And they will attend the Resurrection up there. And they are praying for us. The rest is on us.\n\nO, you lucky, lucky, lucky ones! And until it is our turn.\n\nTo our God be the glory now and forever. Amen.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=\"http://www.copticdadandmom.com/fr-boules-george/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:\nFAITH\nA MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO KILL US (FR.
