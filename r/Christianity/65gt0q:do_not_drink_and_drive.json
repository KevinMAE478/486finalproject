I have a little too much to drink and my buddy tried to get me to crash at his house but I decided to go home and sleep in my own bed, nut i never made it home. It was raining and I was speeding down a country back road and I didn&amp;#39;t have my seat belt on,  i ended up crashing into a culvert going 70mph my buddy that said I should sleep at his house was following me to make sure i got home safe and he pulled me out of the car (which I absolutely loved RIP in peace Kia spectra) I was taken in an ambulance to the nearest hospital(which my mom works at)  and I was so bad they decided that I should be air lifted to a hospital that was an hour away, I died twice, had to have 30 some pints of blood IVed into me ,and the doctor had to go inside my chest cavity and pump my heart with his hands to save me, while he was pumping away I had a shower of blood rush into my brain causing me to have a few strokes and that caused me to lose my voice and it caused me to have dysphagia so I can&amp;#39;t swallow correctly and I drool ever time i open my mouth. I  stayed in the hospital for what seemed like a year but in reality it was only 3 months, in that time i got stuck with a needle more times the i can count, i was in inpatient therapy and I  couldn&amp;#39;t even dress myself and i couldn&amp;#39;t pick up a small container of shampoo.After a 3 long months I got the best news ever: I was going home!!! All the way home I had a grin plastered on my face and when I got to my home town there were signs welcoming me home and we all had a small party. My mom had to feed me for almost a year after the accident,  I eventually got to the point where I could feed myself but I was sloppy so I had to wear a bib everyime I ate (soup was the worst)  I ended up going to therapy 3 days a week for a year, there i worked on speech, OT, and PT. I got better but i am FAR from being back to where i was and i want my accident to be the best thing that has happen to me. I see all the time where God turns a tragidy into a blessing but all my friends are getting married and having kids and I still live at home with my parents and they  need to do EVERYTHING for me for example: I had to have my mom bath me for 2 years.I just took a shower by myself for the first time In over 2 years .my mom is my rock and she was always religious and I was a good Christian but the accident changed my life, i used to be popular and now my parents are now my best friends  there&amp;#39;s a christian rock station here in St Louis called 99.1 joy fm and I crank it every time I&amp;#39;m in the car with my mom.
