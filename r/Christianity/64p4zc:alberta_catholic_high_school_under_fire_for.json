This is your failure, since the structure of my argument is very clear. \n\nThe portion you quoted is not *intended* to have anything directly to do with the occurrence of pregnancy, and it only meant to highlight how we treat bodily autonomy in our society. The only thing you say here that actually bears to this portion of my argument is \"i would also take issue with your blanket claim that bodily autonomy is 'sacrosanct.'\", which is obviously insufficient as a response. \n\n&gt; **do we? not regarding pregnant women, from the perspective of someone who thinks an unborn baby is a person. but what you could say, is that we tend to treat life as sacrosanct. that is a much more commonly held belief.**\n\nNo, we don't, and no, it isn't. The examples I gave demonstrate this clearly. If you wish to disagree, do so with substance. Tell me *why* I'm wrong, not just *that* I'm wrong. \n\nFair warning, I have no interest in teaching you basic argumentation and logic skills. If after this post you demonstrate the same kind of carelessness and flippancy you so far have, I won't respond. \n\n&gt; **like my previous point, you seem to have defined the undeniable, universally agreed upon, fundamental truth of existence, to be that \"bodily autonomy is sacrosanct\"; that bodily autonomy is the trump card, the one universally true position that makes anything else subordinate to it, including life. this is just an abortionist supporters' claim. because if you go and poll a random sample of people and ask them which statement resonates with them most strongly, \"bodily autonomy is sacrosanct\", or \"life is sacrosanct\", it will be the latter.**\n\nWrong. The portion you quoted is true *whether or not* we take bodily autonomy to be sacrosanct. It's a direct response to your assertion that, to be pregnant, one must have chosen to be pregnant, which is a statement that lives or dies on its own, entirely unrelated to bodily autonomy. \n\n&gt; the \"abrogation of one's bodily autonomy\" does not invalidate the personhood of a person. if a person is walking down the street, and a 5 year old jumps on your back, thus robbing you of your bodily autonomy, for, say, a 30 second period, you do not have the right to put that child to death at any moment in that 30 second period.\n\nBut you do have the right to remove them from yourself. That's key. \n\n&gt; if baby making solely occurred by taking a man's sperm, a woman's ovum, putting it in some sort of incubator, putting them in an incubator, then returning in 9 months to pick up the baby, and after 6 months the ovum provider opened up the incubator with a knife and slashed the baby to pieces (note, the bodily autonomy issue isn't there anymore), would you then change your position from the act being an \"ambiguity\", to \"equal with the worst act of inhumanity and barbarism in human history\"?\n\nPersonally? No, since I don't think \"personhood\" comes about until far later. After birth, in fact. I *would* have more *sympathy* to the comparison, though. \n\n&gt; you present the issue as a \"bodily autonomy wins, whatever the cost\" one, and imply it is a universally agreed position. it isn't, specifically regarding pregnant women. if a pregnant women was sat on a park bench, punching her pregnant belly, it is not a fact that everyone would look at it, thinking \"bodily autonomy wins. i feel nothing with what she is doing. bodily autonomy trumps life\".\n\nPeople behave irrationally with respect to specific circumstances all the time, and the fact that they do this does not violate the fundemental principle. We treat bodily autonomy as the be-all-end-all in most situations, including many life-or-death situations. That a specific situation makes some people emotional doesn't really mean anything except that people are irrational. \n\n&gt; life trumps financial burdens. it's not a tricky issue. the sanctity of life trumps health issues of pregnancy. \n\nUnsubstantiated. You don't *get* to just assert things. Again, actually present an argument, or don't reply. Those are you options, and you won't be told again. You've been extended far more charity than anyone can argue you deserve, and my patience is not infinite. \n\n&gt;  but you're happy to put a child to death since \"health issues\" override that child's life.\n\nNo, personal choice and autonomy override that \"child's\" life. \n\n&gt; who is this \"we\" you keep referring to? you assume your position is the universally agreed upon one. it isn't.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people and the law. My position is *near universally* agreed upon.

It's not acceptable to trivialize women's health issues like this and I will not put up with it, do you understand? \n\nFurthermore, as already established we typically don't take \"low cost to the violated\" as justification for violating bodily autonomy even in life-or-death scenarios, so this argument of yours was dead on arrival. \n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n^(1.
