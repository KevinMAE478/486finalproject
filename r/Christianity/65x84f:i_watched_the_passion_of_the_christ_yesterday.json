I cried for Him because all Jesus asked is that we love one another, and yet because of this He was put through literally the most painful and terrible things possible, all the while asking God to forgive those who torture and maim Him. The most powerful scenes for me are when the man who has his ear cut off is healed and realizes that the man they have been sent to arrest is indeed the Savior of man, and is left kneeling on the ground awestruck; when He is being scourged, which was incredibly difficult to watch for me and even more so for my mother (who has seen this before) who was quite literally unable to watch and had to avert her eyes for the scene; and when He is being crucified and asks God to &amp;quot;Forgive them, for they know not what they do.&amp;quot;\nWhen the movie ended I gave my mother a hug and immediately read the book &lt;em&gt;A Guide to the Passion&lt;/em&gt;, a book explaining the movie that my mother had gotten from her church when the movie first came out the really helped explain the movie and scenes from it further.

It truly changed me as a person during watching. I knew myself to be an extremely angry and hateful person before watching this, and after watching I feel that I should strive to truly change my way of living from being spiteful and hateful to (trying) to be more understanding and compassionate towards all people.\nMy questions now are what do I read besides the Bible, and what do I call myself now?
