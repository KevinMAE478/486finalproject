God loves you and is clearly drawing you to himself!  The word \"faith\" in the New Testament means \"to be pursuaded by God.\"  He is the one creating the desire and belief in you even as it develops, how cool is that? \n\nNow, in reply to your comment, a lot of people have differing opinions of exactly what a \"literal\" interpretation even means.  My best explanation would be to say that everything that the Bible says happened, actually happened, exactly as it says... regardless of whether the author of the passage actually meant for it to be taken literally.  \n\nA simple example:\n\nMost of Jesus' teaching is through parables, or stories that have representative meaning. Sometimes he begins them \"Suppose a woman has ten silver coins...\" but sometimes he begins them like \"There was a man who had two sons.\" Now, in my view, a literal interpretation of Jesus' teaching would be that this man and his sons actually existed, because of how he phrases it.  But there is good reason to believe Jesus is making up this story to illustrate a point, and this would be generally understood by his audience, much like beginning a story \"once upon a time\" indicates that this is fiction, even though your literal words are saying that this story happened.  Think about most fiction you read; rarely if ever does it explicitly state that it is fiction -- usually it just says this stuff happened and you are supposed to understand that it didn't.\n\nSo... there are parts of the Bible that are believed by many Bible scholars to have been written with the intent of teaching a principle but not to be a literal, historical record of fact. There are MORE parts of the Bible that are certainly standard written histories, and many of these stories have fantastic and miraculous elements. So I am not saying that you can't take the Bible at face value, because most of it is absolutely meant to be read that way.\n\nBut there are parts that are written about the beginning of the world, and for reasons I won't get into explaining here (you can research if you're interested), many who know this stuff better than you or I ever will are convinced that they were written to illustrate the truth that God is the creator of everything, but not written to describe exactly what his specific method and timeline was for creating.  Similarly, there are visions people have of their future which are written in an extremely metaphorical way, much like dreams represent true ideas but not literal ones.  When I dream of my teeth falling out, it means I'm stressed about something, but not specifically about my teeth falling out.  So many of these predictions were not thought to be literal representations even by the people who had the visions or made the predictions.  \n\nThe good news for you, as a person investigating faith, is that these interpretations do not really have to have significant impact on your journey at the moment.  Your focus should be on the love of God for humanity, and the (historically factual/literal) accounts of Jesus' life in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Get to know God and spend time reading the Bible, with the Holy Spirit guiding you, before you draw your line in the sand about what kind of interpretation you insist on being correct. That would be like me placing a million dollar bet on a baseball team to win the world series before I'd ever even seen a baseball game.\n\nYou have been given some good book recommendations already.  Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis is an extraordinary book that spends a fair amount of time just pondering logically the likelihood that God exists at all. It gets more specifically into Christianity later in the book.\n\nThere are also two books by pastor Timothy Keller that you may enjoy: [Making Sense of God: An Invitation to the Skeptical](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Sense-God-Invitation-Skeptical/dp/0525954155/?tag=thegospcoal-20) and [The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism](https://www.amazon.com/Reason-God-Belief-Age-Skepticism/dp/1594483493/?tag=thegospcoal-20).  These again are more about the arguments for and against God's existence which you may or may not need at this point in your journey.\n\nBut of course, the most important of all is simply the Bible.  The Gospel of Mark may be a good place to start because it is a historical record of Jesus' life written for the Romans, and therefore explains a lot about the Jewish customs that they would not have understood. But any of the four gospels are a wonderful place to begin.\n\nEnjoy your journey, and I encourage you to take that leap of faith and ask God to show you the truth, even if you are not yet sure he even exists. I would pray such a prayer every day, or every time you begin reading anything about God.
