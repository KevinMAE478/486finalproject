It never was. Not in the Old Testament, not now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And when they sent out the letter explaining that this was NOT the doctrine being taught at Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;they explained that the question under consideration was the unsettling claim that &amp;quot;You must be circumcised and keep the law&amp;quot; (15:24).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be saved. That was their claim. I already told you that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can believe what they said or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;#39;t believe is your interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was not a question of takkanot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It kind of is. You&amp;#39;re forgetting how the term &amp;quot;law&amp;quot; in Second Temple/Rabbinical Judaism more often than not includes the teachings of the sages, aka takanot. However, there are instances were it&amp;#39;s just the Torah, like Matthew 5:17.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If it had been, then you&amp;#39;d better believe that they would have offered more explanation to a Gentile audience who didn&amp;#39;t even know what that was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The commandments of men are a burden and yoke, and Apostles are against these burdens and yokes. Simple enough. However, if you think that the Law is that burden and yoke, that&amp;#39;s not only a contradiction, but blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dgbby00", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492327149.0, "created_utc": 1492298349.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbbd70", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "harmless_zephyr", "parent_id": "t1_dgayb95", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Citation?

We were In a state of death, a state of unrighteousness. The reason the presence of God was removed from Adam in the first place was because Adam (mankind) entered that state of unrighteousness. \n\nBecause of this, God instituted the law. He needed to have a way to come back into fellowship with mankind (This was, after all, the purpose of man's creation). There were laws on how a person should live or act toward others (e.g. The Ten Commandments). Then there were laws which were directed specifically to the priesthood. But none of these actions alone brought mankind into the justified state in which God could come and dwell with his people. At this point God ordained the priesthood to offer up a yearly sacrifice (among many others) that would cleanse the people of their sin (unrighteousness). Because of this God was able to dwell with his people once more, at least in the ark of the covenant in the tabernacle.\n\nSo the purpose of the law was to help determine what God considered to be righteous and unrighteous, and to offer up a method of becoming righteous.\n\nNow we come to Jesus. \n\nMatthew 5:17 - Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\n\nAt this point we can see Jesus' \"mission statement\", what Jesus came to do on this earth. Jesus came to this earth and abode by every dot and tittle of the law (e.g. Circumcision, keeping the Ten Commandments, tithing) he also fulfilled the law of the priesthood (which was not required by all Jews to fulfill) which is why we can imagine he didn't cut his hair or trim his beard. And lastly he fulfilled the sacrifice of atonement, he became the lamb that would be offered up in sacrifice on behalf of the sins of the people. \n\nSo Jesus' purpose was to obtain the full justification of the law of Moses that no other man could obtain. Jesus did the work for us so that we would not have to try to obtain the righteousness of the law through our own works only to face the fact that we could never do it. Jesus obtained the justification of the law and now offers it freely to anyone who will believe on him. This is why Christians are now justified by faith. \n\nWe can see this in Romans 10:4 - \"For Christ is the end of the law FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS to everyone that believeth. \n\nJesus came to bring us to a state of righteousness, a state in which God could come and not only dwell with man, but dwell in him and have the intimate fellowship he once had with Adam.\n\nDid Jesus abolish the old covenant? No, he simply made it better, the new covenant was born. Gal 3:13 says we were redeemed from the curse which not abiding by the law would bring, this did not mean that we ought not abide by it. We ourselves ought to seek to live a life like Jesus led on the earth, a life that fulfilled the law. Only we don't need to fulfill the law the same way he did, love is now the fulfillment of the law. If a man loves God, he will not seek other idols. If a man loves his parents he will honor them. If a man loves his neighbor, he won't lie to them, steal from them, or covet anything they own. Love is the fulfillment of the law.\n\nI think your question can point to an erroneous grace message that is being taught in the church today, that since we have received redemption and the grace of God we can live whatever way we want. If we were in sin and came to Jesus to be forgiven of our sin, why go back and live in it? Besides, it is the goodness and the grace of God that leads us to repentance, to come back and lead a life that is pleasing to him (a life that fulfills the law). It is my belief that we no longer need to obey the law specifically for the purpose of obtaining righteousness, Jesus has already done this, but simply for wanting to please our Father and live in unhindered communion with him. Sin, or trespassing the law, creates separation from God and so abiding by his commandments removes the separation.\n\nTo put it in other words, the church should not be teaching that we need not abide by the law for abiding by it is simply for our own good (Deuteronomy 5:29). Abiding by it has simply been eliminated as a method for obtaining that righteousness.
