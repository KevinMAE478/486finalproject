We're in a situation where we're supposed to love God no matter how bad our lot in life is.

I think you see that by praising not going to the dark side.  We could imagine a group of no good beings who want to do evil all the time.  God could give them a paradise, and it would turn to an awful place in short work.\n\nGod even provides help in this current life.  So you know, even if your faith in Jesus is weak, pray to him sometimes, and try and be good and loving.  If you keep up with it, it is the start of an amazing future where you'll someday experience paradise.  The future will get better for a Christian.
