Even Paul struggled with sin. A just man falleth seven times and riseth up again. God still loves you. The trick is to just relax. Remember the power Jesus has given you. Tell the devil to flee from you  in the name of Jesus. The devil has no power over you. Read Psalms 25, 32, 38 and 51 and Romans 6 and 8 everyday. Those Psalms chapters were prayers from David asking God for forgiveness and cleansing after he just committed adultery and murder. Read those chapters as prayers to God and ask him for forgiveness and cleansing. He will cleanse you of all unrighteousness if you let him\n\n1st John 5:5\n\nWho is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?\n\n1st Corinthians 10:13\n\nThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it\n\nYou're an overcomer through Jesus. When you believe in Jesus, you overcome the world and all of its sinful urges and temptations. Sin has no control over you anymore. The only power that sin has over you is the power that you give to it. The devil is weak and he's already been defeated by Jesus. His temptations are just an illusion. Jesus was able to resist the devil in the desert at one of his weakest moments. He fasted for 40 days and still resisted temptation. Ask God for strength. No temptation will ever have enough strength to overpower you. Pray to be lead not into temptation. Pray to be delivered from evil\n\nRomans 6:14\n\nFor sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace\n\n\"Shall not have\". It has 0% control over you. Don't let the devil fool you. Ask God to fill you with the holy spirit everyday. Also try praying and fasting. Jesus said that praying and fasting can give you mountain moving faith. Pray, fast, read the bible and ask God to give you strong faith so that you can overcome these temptations. \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble\". Rely on his strength at all times. Make sure that you truly want to stop and it will become much easier to resist. Jesus said \"and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free\". The truth is that Jesus has already taken care of your problem. The devil is the father of lies. He would like for you to continue falling for his deception. Read those Romans chapters everyday and you'll begin to know more on who you are through Jesus. Use bible verses to fight against the temptation. The word of God is the sword of the spirit. Push out the sin that you struggle with with scripture. The devil is weak. He is pathetic. He is beneath your feet. He can't control you any longer. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. God is ready and waiting to give you strength. All you have to do is depend on God and ask him to give you strength to deliver you from whatever you struggle with and he will. I pray everyday for God to keep me away from temptation and he does. Follow the example of Jesus. Read the bible and see everything that Jesus taught and did and temptation will be much easier to handle. I asked God to help me and he took away my desire for porn. He can help you as well if you truly come to him and truly want to never look at it again. I was addicted to pornography but when I truly asked for his help, he freed me from the addiction. Pray to God everyday and ask him to kill your desires for the sinful things that you struggle with. Ask him to take away your interest for them. He may not do it at first, but don't get discouraged. Keep on praying and asking for his help everyday and soon you won't struggle those sins anymore. Don't give up. Draw nigh to him and he'll draw nigh to you. Always fight your sin with scripture or it will defeat you. Trust in God and always rely on him and his word to fight for you. Get into the mindset of \"Jesus has freed me. I'm never sinning or giving into temptation again. Sin is beneath me\". Here's a good verse to use against temptation. Make sure to memorize it\n\nGalatians 5:1\n\nStand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage\n\nAlso read the two most recent posts on my profile.
