Based on what, I'm wondering? Why do I expect \"color of skin\" to be a significant factor?\n\nNo. There's no one single thing. If there were then we wouldn't have this problem in the first place, there'd be a definitive line. Skin color is actually a pretty poor line to use as far as racial groupings go. When it comes to race I prefer the term population groups, much more accurate to what we're talking about. A West African population group is distinct from an East African population group even though both may have the same skin color. Skin color is just one trait of racial difference and a rather minor one at that, though it has been elevated because it's easily and instantly noticeable. \n\nBut again you seem to be looking for some pure Form of things. That doesn't exist. What makes a chair a chair? Conceptual groupings are always fuzzy around the edges but we still utilize them effectively and they still matter. A large part of what matters is self identification. The fact that a certain group of people see themselves as belonging to a certain group. Lots of Catholics don't adhere to all the teachings of the Catholic church, but what matters most is that they identify themselves as Catholic. They have joined that team and construct their self around that group. It matters to them. It has value to them. Self identification isn't everything. I doubt most would agree with Rachel Dolezal that she's actually black even though she identifies that way, but self identification and probably also acceptance by other members are major factors in classifying whether an individual belongs to one group or the other. \n\n&gt; Not as distinct as you make it out to be. As I said, homogeneous groups are not based in reality, because they've never existed.\n\nIs this supposed to be a counter argument? Yes groups change over time. Some are conquered and destroyed, some assimilate other groups, etc etc. \n\n&gt; Key term: \"relative\". What you ignorantly don't seem to grasp, is that when something is \"relative\", it shifts in significance, depending on context. Differences that are \"relatively\" minor on a global scale become \"relatively\" much bigger locally. \"Relatively\" homogeneous nations don't stay \"relatively\" homogeneous when you then close them off. Those \"relatively\" small differences become \"relatively\" big in the context of one nation.\n\nSuch rudeness is unbecoming. Of course it's relative. but there are certain aspects that human beings put the most value in and that work to build peaceful cohesive societies. Race. Religion. Culture. Language. Politics. etc. Of course on the small scale small differences are blown up to be huge. In a town of ethnic, religious, and cultural homogeneity people would get in fights over sports teams. But those fights would be far less frequent and far less violent than fights over the things humans value much more, like religion. Most people kill over religion. Most don't over sports. People can still have passionate arguments and disagreements about tax policy or gun control, but it's vital that they agree on the basic political foundation. Once you start arguing between Communism and Democratic Republics, that's an chasm so wide that the very stability of the state itself is at stake. \n\n&gt; Bullcrap... The most oppressive nation in the world, right now, is highly homogenous, by your standards. Meanwhile, one of the most free nations in the world is also one of the least homogeneous. When you have to ignore actual reality as part of your argument, it shows just how detached you are from it, white nationalist.\n\nThe oppressiveness of the NK regime has nothing to do with its homogeneity.

The influx of millions of Mexicans and Latinos over the past few decades hasn't exactly made the situation any calmer. It's done the opposite, raising the tensions higher and more complex. And as the Muslim population increases it will only add even more fracture points and complexity to the situation. It will be an intersting situation to watch.
