But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved me, even when I was dead and a sinner, made me alive in Christ, and brought complete miraculous healing to me. All by prayer, without any medical intervention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love basketball: whether it\u2019s playing like trash or watching the Cavs play like trash. I\u2019d rather shoot hoops than give my dogs belly rubs, which is ample evidence that I may love it too much. I first started playing after I regained ambulation. Every time I lace up my shoes, I\u2019m overwhelmed with gratitude that I can even sprint up and down the court, hustle for a rebound, and maybe score a basket or two. Sometimes my friends break my ankles (lol), or I get blocked into the dark ages, or my competitiveness breeds frustration and anger, but these are all much better than falling over in a wheelchair, trust me. It sucks, because it reminds you that you\u2019re not much different than a turtle. To echo Eric Liddell: I feel God\u2019s pleasure most when I play basketball. And so whenever the game requires a jersey, I always reserve number 17: Not because I\u2019m asian and try to imitate Lin, as inspiring as he is, but because it\u2019s a staunch reminder that April 17th\u2019s message to me transformed from \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t even be here\u201d to \u201cbut here you are.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know this can be all taken away form me with one simple awkward landing or unlucky collision. If that day comes and I\u2019m in a wheelchair again, I\u2019ll be okay with it, because I\u2019ve found something infinitely more fulfilling and satisfying: the divine love of Christ. You see, Jesus could have saved me from myself without ever healing me, but that\u2019s not how he operated. He gave me the gift of finding delight in running around in circles chasing an orange ball with 9 other grown men. Basketball reminds me not only that my legs have sensation and that I have life, but from whom that life comes from. Basketball is an undeserved gift, just like my salvation is an undesired gift. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the most amazing thing on April 17th, 2007,  was not a paraplegic miraculously being able to walk again, but a dead man being able to come alive in Christ. So every April 17th, I\u2019m reminded of this truth that what I\u2019ve found in Jesus is better than what I\u2019ve found in basketball. This is a hard story to swallow, but my deepest desire is that Jesus reveals himself to you just as he did to me when I was in a wheelchair (not hoping you end up in a wheelchair just to clarify). If you want to know more about who this Jesus is, I\u2019d love to talk to you about him, because he surpasses anything this world can ever offer. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Today, April 17th, is a special day for me because it commemorates the 10 year anniversary of the last day I was a paraplegic with an unknown neurodegenerative disease and the last day I subscribed to the belief that the Christian God was either omnipotent but unsympathetic to my plight, empathetic but powerless to help my debilitated condition, or simply did not exist.
