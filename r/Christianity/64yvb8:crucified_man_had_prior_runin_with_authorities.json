In many cases the ticket Terms of Service (the contract) will stipulate that the airline may deny you boarding or may remove you for a specific list of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;United&amp;#39;s ToS specifically states that a passenger may be prevented from boarding the plane for any reason at the discretion of the airline, BUT it only stipulates that a passenger may be removed from the plane once boarded if the passenger causes a disruption or refuses to comply with the laws and regulations relating to air travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the man had already been boarded, United (as per their own contract) had no legal recourse to remove him, barring his own misbehavior. By forcing him off the plane after boarding they violated their contract with him, and further, used local authorities as a means to do so. Had they prevented him from boarding to begin with, they would be in the legal right to restrain him from entry and simply compensate his loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Christianity", "name": "t1_dg7b39p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492099945.0, "created_utc": 1492071145.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ax2x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "devhow", "parent_id": "t1_dg79m1u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Christianity", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can you let me know where in the law that it is explicitly illegal for an airline to bump someone?
