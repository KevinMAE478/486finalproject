I will post s link to a great documentary on the Shroud as well as a fact sheet but I want you to open your mind like I did and maybe you will get a slightly different understanding of what this world is. At least in my view. Ymir you have already heard this, I beg your pardon. Well, when I first got saved I didn't feel any different, but then again I didn't have the understanding of history of the world and how Christ actually fits into it. My understanding is derived somewhat from the book of Enoch. It discusses the Garden of Eden as Cain and Abel were the sons of the Devil and Adam respectively. There was no fruit perse, Eve was beguiled by the serpent and had sex with him and a race of half human/half serpents were created. Which is why God commanded Adam to \"know\" Eve after the serpent beguiled her, and then he cursed her with the pains I childbirth. We know Cain is of the devil because he was the firs liar and the first murderer in history. Cain was then cast out of the Garden as were Adam and Eve. They conceived Seth and his lineage went on to become sheep herders, and Cain went to Egypt and started the Canaanite lineage Which was responsible for the megalithic structures that we still can build that are so perfectly aligned with the solstice and whatnot. This indicates that there were two very different lineages. Which leads up to the flood. The angels which God had cast out of Heaven came upon the daughters of man and found them attractive and had sex with them. The offspring of these fallen angels and human women were a race called the Nephilim (this is all in the Bible) they were giants. Goliath was one of these giants that David slew, who would eventually become King David who wrote Psalms. \nAnywho, the flood came and God preserved Noah's lineage but Noah's wife had a son from a different marriage named Hermes. Hermes was a hemaphrodite and raped Noah while he was drunk. Noah's biological children came and rescued his father and looked up into the sky so they would not see him disgraced and naked. Hermes was also responsible for some megalithic structures and I think was involved with the Tower of Babel.\nSince there was still evil in the world Jesus was sent to earth to do away with the old law and start a new covenant  by offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sins. Before Jesus came if anyone sinned they would have to kill an animal and it was kind of a big deal. But anyways God had created us in his image and he loves us very much but he is so Holy that we can't be near him if we die in sin. So in order to rectify this and fulfill prophecy, he sent Jesus to be born and live a life free from sin and resisting of temptation to eventually be crucified and resurrecting to create the new covenant that whoever shall believe in him and he is the son of God shall have everlasting life. It's a plan that's so complete yet sort of complicated and I didn't understand exactly why God cared if we went to Heaven or not. It's because he always intended us to worship him voluntarily that's why he gave us free will; but the Devil tricked us to get back at God and today we see satanism everywhere. Transgenderism (not that I have anything against them personally) is being shoved down our throats and it's a twisting of Gods natural order. This combined with the sheer amount of pain and suffering in the world is proof of the existence of satan. He was given dominion of this world by God when he was cast out of Heaven. But that's why he sent Jesus to free us from satans destruction. I will wrap this up with this. The Shroud of Turin is the most researched artifact of all time and in December 2012 scientists arrived at the conclusion this was not a medieval forgery, it is an authentic burial cloth but we can't say for sure it's Jesus. However it is from Jeruselum and from the time of Jesus and has all wounds reflected in the biblical account of the crucifixion and it has a mans blood on it that for some reason hasn't degraded though it's 2009 years old. There were accounts of this Shroud being taken from the tomb of Jesus and it turned up somewhere in 1099, but basically this thing is real. Plus a \"face napkin\" exists in Spain that also has this same rare blood type on it, which is believed to have belonged to Jesus too. Now, Im aware of the 1988 carbon 14 dating that was performed dating this to the 1500's but it was proven to be a flawed test given the Shroud was involved in a fire in 1500 and there was a fresh carbon release. On top of all of this there is an image in the Shroud of a man, that no one knew existed until it showed up after a photograph was taken of it in 1931. The negative image revealed much greater detail of this man, blood flows coming from parts of the forehead were muscles would be likely to bleed from if one had s crown of thorns. It also depicts four fingers because once you drive a nail through the wrist or hand, the thumb folds underneath due to reflex. Scientists determined the man in the Shroud died  of suffocation and the image was created after the body had been dead between 60-72 hours (3days and 3 nights) . But what's amazing is the image has three dimensional information in it that implies that something passed through this Shroud and made a photographic image without any heat. Scientists suspect it was a cold neutron burst... they don't know but some believe this image was created at the exact moment of resurrection. In a flash. I know all of this sounds crazy, and I've left out a lot, but it creates an understanding of what this all actually is and combined with the physical evidence I consider proof of Christ's existence and resurrection. Therefore, Christ is real he walked the earth and died exactly as the Bible says, and he died for you and me and everyone to wash our sins clean so we could be in the presence of God when we die. We are made of flesh and flesh decays and dies but our souls are eternal and Jesus is the way to live eternally in Heaven and the God sends him to us as the Holy Spirit to comfort us in times of despair or need. My chest feels like an emptiness has been filled because I feel like I knew what Jesus was and once I proclaimed him as my savior he came into my heart.
