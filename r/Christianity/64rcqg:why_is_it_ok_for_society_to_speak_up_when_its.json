Speaking specifically about my own country, America, Christianity is very much part of the mainstream. Our pledge to our flag and our money mentions God (which is generally understood to be the judeo-Christian God), we have the ten commandments up in front of several government buildings around the country, there's a massive commercial industry catering just to Christians that sell us music, movies, books, t-shirts loudly proclaiming our beliefs, mints with scriptures in them etc. The majority of our government is made up of Christians. Our president was elected thanks in no small part to him having massive support from not just Christians, but a particular  category of Christians (white Evangelicals) supporting him, partially due to his endorsements from major Christian celebrities like James Dobson and Franklin Graham. Heck I'm currently sitting in the library of a state-funded campus and my view out the window is of a church with several crosses displayed prominently. The idea that Christianity as a whole is \"counter-cultural\" is honestly a bit ridiculous. We can say that many of those who claim to be Christian aren't \"real\" Christians, but there's no denying that Christianity is a major force within one of the most dominant cultures in the world.\n\nHowever, there's a popular belief taught in American Christianity that we know we're \"real\" Christians if we're being persecuted. (See for example DC Talk's popular \"Jesus Freak\" album and the books about Christian martyrs it spawned--and just for the record  I owned this album when I was younger, loved it, and find it really nostalgic, so I'm not trying to bash on them here.) We talk a LOT about how we're going to struggle and be critized for following Jesus.\n\nHowever... Again, we live in a culture that's very heavily influenced by Christians. I'm not going to say Christians are never persecuted in the USA, but it's not an everyday occurrence, and it's certainly not systematic.\n\nSo we've got a large, dominant element of the population put on the defensive, ready to fight for our faith at any moment, but with not a whole lot of active attacks against them. But we're still so READY for those attacks, and I think on some level we kind of crave it as a way to reassure ourselves that we're doing the right thing, so that means that sometimes we get very loudly offended by minor or even unintended sights against us. That's where you see stuff like the \"war on Christmas.\"\n\nSo now we come to the \"society\" that you mention--or, rather, people that don't subscribe to a particular version of Christianity. Sometimes they're Christians, \"culturally\" Christian or otherwise, but for the sake of simplicity let's say they're something else--athiests, Muslims, Jews, what have you. If you're not a Christian you're an actual religious minority in the USA. But they see us carrying on about how persecuted we are, because we got told Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas, or because we didn't want to make a cake for a gay couple and got complaints or were sued, or people don't like a Republican president... It comes across as really self-important when Christians are as powerful in society as we are.\n\nSo I think this is why there's this perception that criticism of Christianity is ok, but Christians's criticism of others it's not.

MLK Jr. is a big example.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I haven&amp;#39;t seen brought up much yet is, assuming that by &amp;quot;society&amp;quot; we&amp;#39;re talking about Western culture, is that Christianity is very much a PART of society. Speaking specifically about my own country, America, Christianity is very much part of the mainstream. Our pledge to our flag and our money mentions God (which is generally understood to be the judeo-Christian God), we have the ten commandments up in front of several government buildings around the country, there&amp;#39;s a massive commercial industry catering just to Christians that sell us music, movies, books, t-shirts loudly proclaiming our beliefs, mints with scriptures in them etc. The majority of our government is made up of Christians. Our president was elected thanks in no small part to him having massive support from not just Christians, but a particular  category of Christians (white Evangelicals) supporting him, partially due to his endorsements from major Christian celebrities like James Dobson and Franklin Graham. Heck I&amp;#39;m currently sitting in the library of a state-funded campus and my view out the window is of a church with several crosses displayed prominently. The idea that Christianity as a whole is &amp;quot;counter-cultural&amp;quot; is honestly a bit ridiculous. We can say that many of those who claim to be Christian aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; Christians, but there&amp;#39;s no denying that Christianity is a major force within one of the most dominant cultures in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s a popular belief taught in American Christianity that we know we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; Christians if we&amp;#39;re being persecuted. (See for example DC Talk&amp;#39;s popular &amp;quot;Jesus Freak&amp;quot; album and the books about Christian martyrs it spawned--and just for the record  I owned this album when I was younger, loved it, and find it really nostalgic, so I&amp;#39;m not trying to bash on them here.) We talk a LOT about how we&amp;#39;re going to struggle and be critized for following Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However... Again, we live in a culture that&amp;#39;s very heavily influenced by Christians. I&amp;#39;m not going to say Christians are never persecuted in the USA, but it&amp;#39;s not an everyday occurrence, and it&amp;#39;s certainly not systematic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve got a large, dominant element of the population put on the defensive, ready to fight for our faith at any moment, but with not a whole lot of active attacks against them. But we&amp;#39;re still so READY for those attacks, and I think on some level we kind of crave it as a way to reassure ourselves that we&amp;#39;re doing the right thing, so that means that sometimes we get very loudly offended by minor or even unintended sights against us. That&amp;#39;s where you see stuff like the &amp;quot;war on Christmas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we come to the &amp;quot;society&amp;quot; that you mention--or, rather, people that don&amp;#39;t subscribe to a particular version of Christianity. Sometimes they&amp;#39;re Christians, &amp;quot;culturally&amp;quot; Christian or otherwise, but for the sake of simplicity let&amp;#39;s say they&amp;#39;re something else--athiests, Muslims, Jews, what have you. If you&amp;#39;re not a Christian you&amp;#39;re an actual religious minority in the USA. But they see us carrying on about how persecuted we are, because we got told Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas, or because we didn&amp;#39;t want to make a cake for a gay couple and got complaints or were sued, or people don&amp;#39;t like a Republican president... It comes across as really self-important when Christians are as powerful in society as we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I think this is why there&amp;#39;s this perception that criticism of Christianity is ok, but Christians&amp;#39;s criticism of others it&amp;#39;s not.

For me, I don't really spend much time in Christian spaces, so basically the only time I hear about Christianity and Christians (other than in wonderful, pro-discussion places like this) is when they are talking about how something in society bothers them.  This perception meant that, when I first read your comment, I had to think for a minute for how to respond to someone who is in such a different headspace than I usually am.
