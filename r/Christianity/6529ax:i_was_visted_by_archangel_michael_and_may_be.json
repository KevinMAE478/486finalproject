This is my honest recount of what happened this Good Friday. Before I start, I'd like to say both that one, I went to a doctor to check for any symptoms of mental illness, and they found nothing. I'll go again to check though. And two, as God is my witness I will not lie once in this recount, and it will all be a truthful retelling of what I've seen and experienced.\nI'm beyond ecstatic. I think I met Jesus today. Not just in spirit. This is confirmation of my faith to me, and you can bet I'll spend the rest of my life a good Christian.\nSo, anyway. On Thursday, I went to speak with the priest of my local church about what I saw. He essentially told me he would not question whether it was real or not, but that I should pray by his altar and he would pray for me too. On Friday I did this, for a few hours at least. I participated in all the activities and prayers with the public. It was about 5:00 when I left. I went to sit at a pond next to the church, just to be with myself. The message from last Friday had almost left my mind, though I was still anticipating something.\nEventually I convinced myself nothing was going to happen, so at around 6:00 I started home. My route home goes through a forest, and a larger, main pond/almost lake I go past. If anyone ever fishes here, I haven't seen them.\nOn the pebbled shore of this lake next to the path, there was a man facing away from me, attempting to untangle a giant fishing net that was spread across from him on the ground. It was very tangled, and he seemed to be struggling with it. I almost just walked by. I was tired and honestly just wanting to get home after my disappointing night. But something in me told me to help. After all, that's the Christian way.\nHe was tall, I'm 5'10 and he was definitely taller. He had fairly short hair, and wore a light beard. His skin was an olive complexion, I thought nothing of this as where I live has a moderate middle eastern population. He wore a blue polo shirt and jeans. There was nothing inherently striking or powerful about him, and as I approached his expression seemed pained, but smiled as I came. I'll put M for me and H for him for what was said, as much as I can recall. His voice was calm and quiet and soothing, but hit me right at my core.\nM: Can I help you with that, mister? H: I would like the help, if you could spare the time. M: Of course. I'm sorry if I'm no use, I've never fished before. H: I was once the same. My friend fishes more than me.\nI sat down next to him next to this lake and we both started untying the biggest knot. His hands were long and slender, and I remember hardly being able to look away from them.\nH: Are you looking forward to Sunday, (my name)? I always do. (I didn't notice at the time and only realised later I never gave my name to him.) M: Yeah. It's a nice celebration. I like eating all the eggs too. We both laughed. The knot we were working on came undone and we picked up the next. M: It won't be the same as usual though. My father died a month ago, and he loved Easter. I'm still not over it. H: Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Your father is alive, as you will see when you too are risen again.\nI sat thinking about this as the strange man untangled the last knot and we both threw the net into the water.\nM: Why are you even fishing here, mister? There's probably nothing in there, and it's all polluted anyway. H: Do you hunger when a bowl is shown to you? When there is food to be had, I deliver it.\nWe sat there, the net in the water. No one else was around. I had the feeling I could be open with him, and I told him about my girlfriend breaking up with me. He told me not to be afraid, and we held each other. I was on the verge of tears, and as I embraced him I no longer wanted to cry. What he just said reminded me of my encounter last Friday, so I broke away and asked him 'who are you?'\nH: I am what I am. If you think I am, I am within you. I didn't know what to think. About ten minutes passed, and the man pulled in his net. Nothing was in it but a single, tiny fish. I remarked how little it was.\nH: Is life not more than food? Take it and eat it and be thankful you can eat. M: Thank you, sir. H: You should go home, your friend is worried about you. I'll stay here and try to catch some more. M: Um... ok, thank you for the fish.\nHe smiled and waved me off as I went away. My chest felt lighter as I walked home. When I got in, my dogs greeted me happily and my friend was indeed concerned where I was and was glad I was back. For dinner time, I insisted we share only the little fish I had. My friend was confused, but agreed because for easter he was open to shows of faith. So I cooked the fish and we ate it, and I gave him the bigger half.\nSo, that's what happened today. You can decide for yourselves whoever that man was, or whether this was all insane talk.
