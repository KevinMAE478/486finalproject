The design would have either had two small islands or one large, long island. The two smaller islands were chosen. The location and alignment of the islands are based around the 2.4 metre diameter gas turbine exhausts which were pre-fitted in the island and below in the ship superstructure.&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;  -- &lt;a href=\"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/why-are-the-queen-elizabeth-class-carriers-so-big/\"&gt;UK Defence Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the following quote from Aircraft Carrier Alliance (the consortium of builders for the QE - MoD/BAE Systems/Babcock)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_ &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Advantages of the two island configuration are increased flight deck area (instead of one long large island), reduced air turbulence over the flight deck and increased flexibility of space allocation in the lower decks.
