I still don&amp;#39;t understand why people were (and as I see now they are still) complaining about the difficulty.. I saw people play the prologue and they were dying over and over again in the part where you need to carry Foltest and need to avoid the dragon&amp;#39;s fire.. I really, really didn&amp;#39;t understand how can someone be so bad at a game.. there wasn&amp;#39;t anything challenging about that part but people were still dying and dying in that part.. so CD Projekt RED was forced to nerfed the difficulty because some people were bad at their game.. still pissses me off why would they do something like that.. the game was fair from the start, just challenging but people were expecting some Skyrim or Assassins Creed difficulty, so their were complaining and complaining, when in reality they just needed to be better at the game.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t write this because &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so good at this game and if you are not, git gud&amp;quot;, but because how modern players can&amp;#39;t handle difficulty and more precisely, how they don&amp;#39;t take the time to learn the basics of games.. if people would atleast read the journal where they had every information they needed to learn the basics of combat in TW2, they wouldn&amp;#39;t complaining that much.. tutorial in TW2 wasn&amp;#39;t perfect, but really, when I saw how some people were struggling to play the game I was wondering if they ever even played another game before TW2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I believe because of this, the difficulty in TW3 is pretty much non-existing.. game is easier than any other entry in the Witcher series at any difficulty and even easier than games like Assassins Creed or Skyrim&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "witcher", "name": "t1_dgbuy6j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492361078.0, "created_utc": 1492332278.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcmyq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Insidious_void", "parent_id": "t1_dgbaiv4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/witcher", "controversiality": 0, "body": "TW2, even on easy, is somewhat challenging.
