There&amp;#39;s also a part in Kaer Morhen, so it&amp;#39;s fun to compare that area to TW3. And a DLC in Kaer Morhen as well, with surrounding areas like in TW3.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TW2 was in a few locations along the Pontar: La Valette Castle (a city and fort in northern Temeria, on the border with Redania), Floatsam (a small trading town in a swampy rainforest thing located on the border between Tameria, Kaedwen and Redenia), Vergen (a dwarf city in the Pontar Valley, or a military camp near that city if you take the other path) and Loc Muinne (an abandoned Vrann city).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your decisions in TW2 had much bigger consequences then they do in TW3. Depending on one choice in the early chapter, for example, your experience in chapter 2 and 3 will be completely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "witcher", "name": "t1_dgbulkk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492359922.0, "created_utc": 1492331122.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sebi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jpsy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcu27", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nick3122003", "parent_id": "t1_dgbbio0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/witcher", "controversiality": 0, "body": "-they weren't open world\n-somewhere at the pontar\n-yes", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;-they weren&amp;#39;t open world\n-somewhere at the pontar\n-yes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "witcher", "name": "t1_dgbcu27", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328417.0, "created_utc": 1492299617.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sebi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jpsy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbp1o4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "worstseanna", "parent_id": "t1_dgbbio0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/witcher", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Witcher 1 takes place mostly in the Temerian city Vizima, which you may recognize from Witcher 3.
