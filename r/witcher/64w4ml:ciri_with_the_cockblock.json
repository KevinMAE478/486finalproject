Yennefer is aware of most if not all his thirsts, the only one she takes seriously to the point of getting genuinely mad is Triss, and that&amp;#39;s mainly because they&amp;#39;re best friends and she expected more from her. It&amp;#39;s described best in the last book of the saga in a very short passage right here: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/4rCly2F\"&gt;http://imgur.com/4rCly2F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, that brief conversation is not as superficial as it seems initially. She&amp;#39;s fully aware he&amp;#39;s slept with others, but she&amp;#39;s willing to ignore it/put it aside simply because she knows he only loves &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; and none of the others could ever compare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "witcher", "name": "t1_dg6tfn3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492071211.0, "created_utc": 1492042411.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sebi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w4ml", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6t2z8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chrispenny1995", "parent_id": "t1_dg6skgs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/witcher", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know they're just as sterile as he is.
