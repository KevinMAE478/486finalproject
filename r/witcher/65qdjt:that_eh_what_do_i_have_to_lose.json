In the very next sentence Sapkowski tells us the real reason for the one night stand - Geralt and Yen got into another fight and had split up. Triss was just in the right place at the right time. Furthermore Geralt does not feel wronged or manipulated by her, as he would be if he were taken advantage of I'm sure, as he invites her to Kaer Morhen to help him with Ciri and cares for her when she gets ill as a good friend would until she's better. The way Geralt rejects Triss' advances afterwards makes it clear he only sees her as a friend, even though he cares about her a lot - which he would not do if he were magically manipulated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Quote from BoE:** 'And you, Triss?' 'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty. 'I'm not important. I let you down. I let you down ... in everything. I was . . . I was your mistake. Nothing more.' 'Mistakes,' he said with effort, 'are also important to me. I don't cross them out of my life, or memory. And I never blame others for them. You are important to me, Triss, and always will be. You never let me down. Never. Believe me.'\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the Witcher 1 after Geralt helps Triss recover she tries talking to him about the past, but he explicitly cuts her off and says he is not ready for that yet. Afterwards, throughout the game, Triss helps Geralt to recover his memory by discussing every major event in the story with him and allowing him to form his own personality - as Geralt himself tells Regis during B&amp;W. After the start of the Witcher 2, during the journey to Flotsam, Geralt asks Triss to tell him everything even if it hurts and she does that. Bear in mind that at this point while all the history with Yen is revealed neither Geralt nor Triss know if she is alive or not yet. Then in the bath house Triss is the first to suggest they drop everything else and that she wants to help Geralt look for Yen in any way she can.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile I do agree that it was wrong how Triss took advantage of Geralt's amnesia in the Witcher 1 - by accepting his advances without him having his memory back, it was definitely Geralt's choice to initiate. Thus I have to side with Yen on this one - Geralt's amnesia was no excuse and portraying him as a feeble dolt, who had no choice or agency in the matter is doing a disservice to his character in my opinion.", "edited": 1492430793.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit late to the discussion, but I have to disagree with this interpretation of events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the scene in the book referenced is open to interpretation, I believe the &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; was a metaphor rather than any sort of mind control spell. In the very next sentence Sapkowski tells us the real reason for the one night stand - Geralt and Yen got into another fight and had split up. Triss was just in the right place at the right time. Furthermore Geralt does not feel wronged or manipulated by her, as he would be if he were taken advantage of I&amp;#39;m sure, as he invites her to Kaer Morhen to help him with Ciri and cares for her when she gets ill as a good friend would until she&amp;#39;s better. The way Geralt rejects Triss&amp;#39; advances afterwards makes it clear he only sees her as a friend, even though he cares about her a lot - which he would not do if he were magically manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote from BoE:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#39;And you, Triss?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;What about me?&amp;#39; She swallowed with difficulty. &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m not important. I let you down. I let you down ... in everything. I was . . . I was your mistake. Nothing more.&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Mistakes,&amp;#39; he said with effort, &amp;#39;are also important to me. I don&amp;#39;t cross them out of my life, or memory. And I never blame others for them. You are important to me, Triss, and always will be. You never let me down. Never. Believe me.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Witcher 1 after Geralt helps Triss recover she tries talking to him about the past, but he explicitly cuts her off and says he is not ready for that yet. Afterwards, throughout the game, Triss helps Geralt to recover his memory by discussing every major event in the story with him and allowing him to form his own personality - as Geralt himself tells Regis during B&amp;amp;W. After the start of the Witcher 2, during the journey to Flotsam, Geralt asks Triss to tell him everything even if it hurts and she does that. Bear in mind that at this point while all the history with Yen is revealed neither Geralt nor Triss know if she is alive or not yet.
