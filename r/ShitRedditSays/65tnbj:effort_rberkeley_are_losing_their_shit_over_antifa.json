Given the mess yesterday, it&amp;#39;s important we come out strong. To do that, me and a few other members of Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) are attempting to invite President Trump to speak at UC Berkeley Sproul Plaza. We&amp;#39;ve written and called the White House numerous times (&lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/write-or-call\"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/write-or-call&lt;/a&gt;) and recently we were able to contact White House advisor Kellyanne Conway.\nI want to know your thoughts on this. Overall I think President Trump should come speak at Berkeley if he could, to spread his message of peace and patriotism to fellow golden bears. But there&amp;#39;s also the risk of Antifa riots breaking out as before. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;peace and patriotism&amp;quot; l m a o And this guy says he wants to bring peace. If Trump came here, &lt;em&gt;assassination attempts&lt;/em&gt; probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be out of the question, and there would probably be a riot so huge it would end up completely destroying wherever it happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+59.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/65t2ed/official_call_for_mayor_jesse_arreguin_to_step/\"&gt;Official call for mayor Jesse Arreguin to step down.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The mayor has become a disgrace. The Antifa riots yesterday were not a surprise that caught anyone off guard. The mayor and police department have already seen this several times.\nEvery time Antifa has attacked innocent people, rioted, smashed stores and banks, committed arson, etc.. the mayor has ordered the police department to stand down. Dozens of people have been hospitalized and almost killed because he told the police to hang out several blocks away and ignore violence and destruction.\nThe police force is supposed to be there to stop crime. Under order of the mayor they failed all of Berkeley multiple times.\nWhen you call off the police and allow riots and violence to happen you are giving these people an invitation to keep doing it over and over. There will be no consequences if you come out as a mob dressed in black with your face covered. Feel free shoot kids, rape women, drown puppies. The cops won&amp;#39;t stand in your way.\nCan we please come together and demand that the mayor resign or be impeached? He has made Berkeley a national embarrassment on 3 separate occasions since he took office.
