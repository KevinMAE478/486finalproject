There is hatred for *exactly* the reasons that there could ever be conflict.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Full disclosure: concentration camps for gays is disgusting, don't think I'm defending that)\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, hate exists precisely because different groups of people feel so strongly about their identity, and the control of land, resources, and policy by people of their identity, that they mean to exclude or *remove* others from those structures of political control, receipt of resources, or lands! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; People have lots of things factored into their identity, and when they don't align, there are - in terms of \"who\" has control over what - winners and losers,  identifiable and perpetuated on group lines by members of groups. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is the root of almost all conflict, and it's not avoidable unless there are nicer, easier structures of competition.\n&gt; \n&gt; The world has always and will always be like this. \n&gt; \n&gt; The only thing to do is ensure large, peaceful, mutually beneficial arrangements exist for all groups/individuals to inter/intra compete (markets help a lot, but so do regulations on them!), and maintain, deep down, the ability to protect against the final level of competition (martial competition) those groups you care about.\n&gt; \n&gt; _______________\n&gt; \n&gt; Don't believe me? \n&gt; \n&gt; *I can almost guarantee* the prescribed solution by one side of this debate is to, through education of subsequent generations by deliberate political campaign/NGO outreach, or by mass media proliferation/activism support, *diminish and reduce the political control of those in power who are anti-gay identity*. If that totally fails, and the other side keeps physically imprisoning gays, I'd bet they'll support *physical removal and replacement* and regime change.\n&gt; \n&gt; The prescribed solution by the otherside was to ban demonstrations/refuse applications for greater political control/voice in society, and they've already moved onto physical removal and suppression.\n&gt; \n&gt; All conflict is on these lines, all conflict is by these means - - warfare is the continuation of politics by other means, but politics is exactly the same as warfare by prior means. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/uCz6OsH.png)\n\n[Vote History on srscharts](http://74.207.230.31/srscharts/#dg2w4m1)\n\n&amp;nbsp;^This&amp;nbsp;comment&amp;nbsp;posted&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;bot&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[Report&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;error](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SRScreenshot&amp;subject=Bug%20report&amp;message=%5BComment%20thread%5D%28https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/64rxml/full_disclosure_concentration_camps_for_gays_is/%29%0A%0APlease%20add%20any%20additional%20comments%20below.%0A%0A)&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[FAQ](/r/SRScreenshot/wiki/faq)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;[...] (Full disclosure: concentration camps for gays is disgusting, don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m defending that) [...] If that totally fails, and the other side keeps physically imprisoning gays, I&amp;#39;d bet they&amp;#39;ll support physical removal and replacement and regime change.

There is hatred for &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the reasons that there could ever be conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Full disclosure: concentration camps for gays is disgusting, don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m defending that)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, hate exists precisely because different groups of people feel so strongly about their identity, and the control of land, resources, and policy by people of their identity, that they mean to exclude or &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; others from those structures of political control, receipt of resources, or lands! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have lots of things factored into their identity, and when they don&amp;#39;t align, there are - in terms of &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; has control over what - winners and losers,  identifiable and perpetuated on group lines by members of groups. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the root of almost all conflict, and it&amp;#39;s not avoidable unless there are nicer, easier structures of competition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world has always and will always be like this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing to do is ensure large, peaceful, mutually beneficial arrangements exist for all groups/individuals to inter/intra compete (markets help a lot, but so do regulations on them!), and maintain, deep down, the ability to protect against the final level of competition (martial competition) those groups you care about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t believe me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can almost guarantee&lt;/em&gt; the prescribed solution by one side of this debate is to, through education of subsequent generations by deliberate political campaign/NGO outreach, or by mass media proliferation/activism support, &lt;em&gt;diminish and reduce the political control of those in power who are anti-gay identity&lt;/em&gt;. If that totally fails, and the other side keeps physically imprisoning gays, I&amp;#39;d bet they&amp;#39;ll support &lt;em&gt;physical removal and replacement&lt;/em&gt; and regime change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prescribed solution by the otherside was to ban demonstrations/refuse applications for greater political control/voice in society, and they&amp;#39;ve already moved onto physical removal and suppression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All conflict is on these lines, all conflict is by these means - - warfare is the continuation of politics by other means, but politics is exactly the same as warfare by prior means. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/uCz6OsH.png\"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://74.207.230.31/srscharts/#dg2w4m1\"&gt;Vote History on srscharts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;This&amp;nbsp;comment&amp;nbsp;posted&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;bot&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SRScreenshot&amp;amp;subject=Bug%20report&amp;amp;message=%5BComment%20thread%5D%28https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/64rxml/full_disclosure_concentration_camps_for_gays_is/%29%0A%0APlease%20add%20any%20additional%20comments%20below.%0A%0A\"&gt;Report&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;error&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"/r/SRScreenshot/wiki/faq\"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ShitRedditSays", "name": "t1_dg4idzd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957256.0, "created_utc": 1491928456.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
