Been listening since around the time takk came out. At the time, I was in high school and they never toured close enough to me for me to afford seeing them. I was so bummed every time they toured because I had read about how transcendent they were live. Towards the end of college they finished up their four year hiatus and released valtari, an album I believe is majorly underrated in their catalog. Their first show after the hiatus was in philly. I didn't even think, I just bought the tickets the second they went on sale. My then girlfriend, now wife, and I headed up and saw them. It was....totally underwhelming. The graphics were recycled from music videos for the most part, the venue sucked ass (in my opinion) and the crowd just didn't seem as enchanted as I guess I had imagined they would be. It was your typical outdoor concert crowd. A handful of us were totally transfixed hoping for an amazing experience, some people were fucking obliterated or totally fucked on substance of choice, and more than anything, a shitload of people seemed so nonchalant that I would have guessed they were giving away tickets to people who had never heard the band in their life. I'm assuming that after being in Disney films and shit they reached an audience that probably didn't care too much about seeing a transcendent live show. Anyway, I moved on. A few months later, they announce their \"biggest show ever\" at Madison square garden. Fuck it. I bought tickets. Not to mention Tim Hecker was opening. Seeing Tim Hecker play MSG was almost worth the cost of admission. Again, totally underwhelmed. Actually, it was way worse than before. Tim Hecker should never play MSG. That's pretty obvious. But the venue fucked that whole set. Tim Hecker is meant to be listened to loud as shit and in total darkness. I suppose because people were still coming in, they refused to turn all the lights down. So Tim just played in this dimly lit room and probably at half or less the volume it should have been. Most people talked during his set. By the time sigur ros came on, I realized why they don't play MSG. They just aren't that big. The venue was probably 3/4 full. Lots of empty seats. Oh, and the recycled visuals again. I was so annoyed. How can a band this creative recycle so much shit for so many years. It really killed them for me. I stopped listening to them for the most part. Fast forward to the next tour. They were playing my hometown for the first time ever maybe. I decided I wouldn't go unless I got in free (I run a local blog and can occasionally get press passes/photo passes for stuff like this). I inquired and never heard back. The day before the show their management got back to me and had a photo and press pass for me. My wife and I went. It poured rain the entire time and somehow it was absolutely magical. The visuals had changed. This was right after they released Kveikur and kjartan Sveinnson's departure. Maybe it really was just major creative differences causing rifts in the band? I'm not sure. Anyway, I probably won't ever see them live again. Although, I am extremely excited about taking some time to watch this later while trying to get my daughter to go to sleep. Sorry for the wall of text.
