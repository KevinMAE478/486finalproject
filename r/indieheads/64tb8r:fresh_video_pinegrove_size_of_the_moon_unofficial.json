She needed a caregiver to take her to her appointments, cook meals for her, and just generally hang out with her. We watched a lot of TV \u2014 most of it about O.J. Simpson. Anyway, towards the end of my stay there, I realized that Evan was playing some solo sets in the area, and I asked if he wanted to come play a little show for Monica. She's a fan of Pinegrove. He said yes! So Evan came and played a show for her in her hotel room. It was very good. He played music and we talked a lot \u2014 the conversation ended up at the intersection of disease &amp; art, how limitation is often painful, but can yield to something beautiful and unexpected. Monica has an ability to see beauty and warmth in everything \u2014 it's her best defense against this disease and has been a shining example to me throughout this whole ordeal.\n\nAfter Evan left we texted about the possibility of making a video for \"Size of the Moon\" about Monica, for Monica, starring Monica. I was only in town for 2 more days, and the only device I could film with was Monica's old i-Phone. (I don't have a smartphone.)  Suddenly the parallels between our conversation &amp; our present became clear. I wanted to go for it \u2014 so I went for it.\n\nAnd as I worked, the limitations on my end piled up \u2014 data limit, space on her phone, problems uploading the footage. It was hard also because the treatment center is a quiet zone, and people are there for serious treatment, so I had to be stealthy. Also, Monica was in a lot of pain &amp; being filmed was an anxious process for her, so it was hard to navigate how much to film. Before I left, I started to put together a cut. My Final Cut Pro crashed and wouldn't open, so I started editing this on iMovie -- the worst editing software out there. I leaned into it. The mechanical restrictions, the raw, flawed sterility of the footage\u2014it all felt right. \n\nThe video ends with footage my frequent collaborator Kenny Polyak had taken in Wyoming, where my parents and Monica live \u2014 the place she's always dreaming of. The contrast in visual quality mirrors that distance. One she saw the first cut, Monica gave me her blessing \u2014 she knew that it would help other people struggling with chronic illnesses feel less alone. \n\nThroughout all of this, Evan and I have been talking about the therapeutic properties of music, and I've been trying to practice art as gift-giving. I've been impressed by Pinegrove's generosity of spirit, and they way they re-tweet and promote fans' interpretations of their work and message. This project, created in conversation with Evan, felt like a parallel work to \"Size of the Moon.\" It's deeply inspired by the song, but it's also using the song as a shape, a form, to help things feel better. \n\nThere's something that feels right about having this video to this song \u2014 something gritty &amp; intimate, stiched-together &amp; hand-made, alive with hyperreal familiarity &amp; sadness \u2014 and the urge to both stay in it and flee it \u2014 visit the future &amp; dance in a field of light. \n\nOn top of all this, we've been fighting Monica's medical fight against Lyme. It's a mysterious, rapidly-evolving disease, and it's extremely dangerous. Unfortunately, the medical establishment &amp; particularly the health insurance companies are gravely behind in their approach to the disease. Insurance doesn't cover any of Monica's treatment. We've been forced to fundraise to keep Monica afloat. It's an exhausting endeavor. If anyone who sees this video is inspired to help out, they can donate to her fund here. It's also extremely helpful just to spread the word &amp; share the video. Ultimately, it's a piece about one woman during two days of a difficult journey. Throughout this all, Monica has struggled as much with mental and emotional pain as with physical pain, and she and I would quote this line of Evan's: \"Do you wanna die?

I wanted to go for it \u2014 so I went for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as I worked, the limitations on my end piled up \u2014 data limit, space on her phone, problems uploading the footage. It was hard also because the treatment center is a quiet zone, and people are there for serious treatment, so I had to be stealthy. Also, Monica was in a lot of pain &amp;amp; being filmed was an anxious process for her, so it was hard to navigate how much to film. Before I left, I started to put together a cut. My Final Cut Pro crashed and wouldn&amp;#39;t open, so I started editing this on iMovie -- the worst editing software out there. I leaned into it. The mechanical restrictions, the raw, flawed sterility of the footage\u2014it all felt right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The video ends with footage my frequent collaborator Kenny Polyak had taken in Wyoming, where my parents and Monica live \u2014 the place she&amp;#39;s always dreaming of. The contrast in visual quality mirrors that distance. One she saw the first cut, Monica gave me her blessing \u2014 she knew that it would help other people struggling with chronic illnesses feel less alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout all of this, Evan and I have been talking about the therapeutic properties of music, and I&amp;#39;ve been trying to practice art as gift-giving. I&amp;#39;ve been impressed by Pinegrove&amp;#39;s generosity of spirit, and they way they re-tweet and promote fans&amp;#39; interpretations of their work and message. This project, created in conversation with Evan, felt like a parallel work to &amp;quot;Size of the Moon.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s deeply inspired by the song, but it&amp;#39;s also using the song as a shape, a form, to help things feel better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something that feels right about having this video to this song \u2014 something gritty &amp;amp; intimate, stiched-together &amp;amp; hand-made, alive with hyperreal familiarity &amp;amp; sadness \u2014 and the urge to both stay in it and flee it \u2014 visit the future &amp;amp; dance in a field of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, we&amp;#39;ve been fighting Monica&amp;#39;s medical fight against Lyme. It&amp;#39;s a mysterious, rapidly-evolving disease, and it&amp;#39;s extremely dangerous. Unfortunately, the medical establishment &amp;amp; particularly the health insurance companies are gravely behind in their approach to the disease. Insurance doesn&amp;#39;t cover any of Monica&amp;#39;s treatment. We&amp;#39;ve been forced to fundraise to keep Monica afloat. It&amp;#39;s an exhausting endeavor. If anyone who sees this video is inspired to help out, they can donate to her fund here. It&amp;#39;s also extremely helpful just to spread the word &amp;amp; share the video. Ultimately, it&amp;#39;s a piece about one woman during two days of a difficult journey. Throughout this all, Monica has struggled as much with mental and emotional pain as with physical pain, and she and I would quote this line of Evan&amp;#39;s: &amp;quot;Do you wanna die? Fine, you&amp;#39;re right, but I wonder what it feels like to stop feeling so alive.&amp;quot; More than anything, I want this to be a video about being alive. That&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "indieheads", "name": "t1_dg58gwj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491988009.0, "created_utc": 1491959209.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg56ffu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "koalabeard", "parent_id": "t3_64tb8r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/indieheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Anyone know the story behind this?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone know the story behind this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "indieheads", "name": "t1_dg56ffu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491985322.0, "created_utc": 1491956522.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zj24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tb8r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5uzo7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GalacticArachnids", "parent_id": "t3_64tb8r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/indieheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Welp time to listen to Cardinal for the infinitieth time.
