Lazy compositions that are barely distinguishable from each other, almost comically disinterested vocal delivery, the same three chords over and over. What is most surprising is the complete lack of emotion here, the lack of anything to really feel, this is ostensibly a heart-breaking album dealing with the loss of a loved one, and yet there is no feeling, no passion, no effort to actually channel that pain into catharsis, into something worth listening to. Something worth listening to, this is the point, because music isn&amp;#39;t just art, it is a specific form of art, where by using instruments one creates intriguing sounds that engage a listener, in one way or another. &amp;quot;A Crow Looked At Me&amp;quot; is not music in that way, it does not engage you at all, Phil seems anything but engaged or interested by his own compositions or words, in fact the only thing he seems to care about on this wreck of an album is making sure the listener realizes that he is so apathetic and devoid of energy that he can do no more than sadly pantomime the motions singing and songwriting. 1/10&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "indieheads", "name": "t1_dg4jq0d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958704.0, "created_utc": 1491929904.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zj24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s1yn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zj24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s1yn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4m0fb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "howtofall", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jreg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/indieheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Loveless by My Bloody Valentine\n\nViet Cong by Preoccupations\n\nYeezus by Kanye\n\nevery album from Merzbow (fair warning, this is literally all noise, but I recomend Venerology or Pulse Demon)\n\nSpirit They've Gone, Spirit They've Vanished by Animal Collective\n\nMidcity by Clipping, basically rap over Merzbow\n\nThe Glow Pt. 2 by The Microphones, it's been a while since I've listened to this, but if I remember correctly it's decently noisy.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loveless by My Bloody Valentine&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Viet Cong by Preoccupations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeezus by Kanye&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;every album from Merzbow (fair warning, this is literally all noise, but I recomend Venerology or Pulse Demon)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spirit They&amp;#39;ve Gone, Spirit They&amp;#39;ve Vanished by Animal Collective&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Midcity by Clipping, basically rap over Merzbow&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Glow Pt. 2 by The Microphones, it&amp;#39;s been a while since I&amp;#39;ve listened to this, but if I remember correctly it&amp;#39;s decently noisy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "indieheads", "name": "t1_dg4m0fb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491961205.0, "created_utc": 1491932405.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zj24", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s1yn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4kefv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Royskatt", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jreg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/indieheads", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails.
