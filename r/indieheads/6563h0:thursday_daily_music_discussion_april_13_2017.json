OK next couple of tracks are more what I was expecting. The lyrics are woeful, not just that but they keep repeating them as if they're the most revelatory couplet ever written.

Insufferable. \n\nThe Coldplay song actually didn't start off too bad but fucking hell that drop is awful. And the song's ruined from that point on. This band might actually be able to rise to the level of mediocre if they didn't have such awful decision making. It's mostly generic and bland for the next two songs, nothing too bad. It Won't Kill Ya is a decent pop song, same as the opener. Oh wait here comes another shit generic off-putting drop. Fuck this band knows how to self-sabotage.

Jhene Aiko gives the first decent vocal performance on Wake Up Alone but there's this really dumb painful bass synth backing her, and the drop has no energy to it at all, like it was more of a semi-drop. Did they even intend that to be a drop? But then it happened exactly the same a second time later on. Have they given up completely? The lyrics are still painfully dumb and repetitive, and the few semi-decent ideas for what to do musically have fully deserted them. What the hell is that bass keyboard combo thing that happens 50 seconds into Young? Jesus. One track left. There's no overtly bad decision-making or painful noises in this one but it also does nothing to justify existing. \n\nOK I'd call this a 2.5/10 overall, at its worst this album is actually painful to listen to.
