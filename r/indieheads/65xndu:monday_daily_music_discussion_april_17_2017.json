Absolutely nothing FJM says is new or insightful on that front. I'd argue that FJM's more talking about his own frustrations with the world and his place in it, to an extent that I can't help but wonder if depression might play a bit of a role in it. It's basically an album about exhaustion, and with each song he goes more into how lost, afraid, and ultimately scared one can feel agains the weight of the world. Being caught between wanting to fix everything and wanting to watch it all burn, between hating everyone and hating yourself because deep down you know you're no better. I think Leaving LA is most upfront about this, because it strips down FJM's usual facade of smug superiority to show the vulnerable person underneath rather than letting the light shine through the cracks. \n\nIt's still a personal album, but it's way darker in themes than Honeybear. It drags on in the second half and could use with more climaxes like in Pure Comedy, but I don't think seeing it as \"you suck America: The 70 minute piano ballad\" is entirely right.

It wasn\u2019t like when ENDLESS dropped and it didn\u2019t feel quite complete or when FUTURE happened and was real mediocre regardless of what came next. This album is a well thought out statement. I view this as Kendrick\u2019s \u201cFUCK THE FAME\u201d album, he proved he could master the \u201cclassic rap\u201d style in his own way while bringing some new things to the table.\n\nthis album spans the gamut of smooth, soulful sex jams, shocking political and social callouts, and some straight up bangers. the production is cohesive, yet each song has its own vibe. The features are used sparingly, but INCREDIBLY. Seriously, some of the best use of outside musicians since TPAB. Steve Lacy, James Blake, and BADBADNOTGOOD brought their A game on these beats. Zacari, Rihanna, and the U2 features all worked better than I expected. The no name guy who raps at the beginning of FEAR. was one of my favorite moments on the album.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite up to par of GKMC or TPAB, but still entertains enough to be considered a top tier album. I actually think it beats TPAB on front-to-back replay-ability.
