This is just the tip of the iceberg, that thing can do some *crazy* things if you make the right \"patch\" (path of wires).\n\n He's being subtle about it, so it's not obvious what he's doing, but a drum machine wouldn't give you nearly the degree of control over texture that that thing can.  A good one could come close, but it won't have that analog sound that wierdoes like me notice and love.\n\nIf you want to know more about that kind of synth, the documentary \"I Dream of Wires\" is really good.
