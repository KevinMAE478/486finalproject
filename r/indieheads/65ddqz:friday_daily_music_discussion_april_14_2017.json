It was amazing. I highly endorse you giving it a shot...\n\nThe venue is one of the coolest I've ever been in. I think it's a re-purposed train station, so it's a huge hangar-like building with a glass roof. The two stages are on either end of the building with the drinks/merch in the middle. There are also elevated areas, one side containing an arcade and these giant swings, and the other side containing a record fair.  It was much smaller and more intimate than the majority of the large-scale American music fests I am used to.\n\nThe atmosphere was also a lot more laid back. Everyone was incredibly friendly and sociable to us (shout-out to the British guys that we hung with all night on Halloween). Most people were sipping red wine, which, once again, is a huge difference from the beer-guzzling bros I'm used to seeing at music festivals. I kept running into Kurt Vile in the crowd, which was also kinda surreal.\n\nThe only issue I had (albeit a minor one) was that it was A LOT of work to be exploring Paris all day and then head to a music festival at night. I ended up having to apply some very smooth talking to get my GF ready in time to make it to the first band we wanted to catch each night and get her excited for the fest. Walking around a city all day and then standing at a music festival all night was not an easy feat, but other than that is was a truly memorable (and romantic) experience for both of us.

I highly endorse you giving it a shot...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The venue is one of the coolest I&amp;#39;ve ever been in. I think it&amp;#39;s a re-purposed train station, so it&amp;#39;s a huge hangar-like building with a glass roof. The two stages are on either end of the building with the drinks/merch in the middle. There are also elevated areas, one side containing an arcade and these giant swings, and the other side containing a record fair.  It was much smaller and more intimate than the majority of the large-scale American music fests I am used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere was also a lot more laid back. Everyone was incredibly friendly and sociable to us (shout-out to the British guys that we hung with all night on Halloween). Most people were sipping red wine, which, once again, is a huge difference from the beer-guzzling bros I&amp;#39;m used to seeing at music festivals. I kept running into Kurt Vile in the crowd, which was also kinda surreal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only issue I had (albeit a minor one) was that it was A LOT of work to be exploring Paris all day and then head to a music festival at night. I ended up having to apply some very smooth talking to get my GF ready in time to make it to the first band we wanted to catch each night and get her excited for the fest.
