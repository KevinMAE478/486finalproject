Not without its flaws but it\u2019s probably my favorite from Cube. \n\n**Thundercat - Drunk**: Pleasant stuff no doubt but ultimately went in one ear and out the other. There's a nice consistent sound on this album but it's almost a downside, as most of the songs end up sounding samey. The track with Michael McDonald/Kenny Loggins was tight though, probably the biggest standout cause it fits their style so well. Idk I'll have to come back and see if it sticks any more. \n\n**Kendrick Lamar - DAMN.**: Haven\u2019t listened to this to really get a great impression but I liked what I heard so far. The beats are far less chaotic than TPAB, as they lean more toward the mellow side for the most part. Some parts feel a bit too sloppy and poppy for my taste (\u201cLOVE\u201d, \u201cLOYALTY\u201d) but I thought it was pretty tight. Feel like this reminds me of early Kendrick in a good way but like I said, these are just my first impressions. Wrote a better review on the LH thread though.  \n\n**Donovan - Sunshine Superman**: Awesome folk release from the mid 60s. The whole thing has a very nice psych feel, with heavier tracks toward the end sounding kinda vaguely like Jefferson Airplane. The dude was able to switch between lighthearted, poppy cuts and heavier psych ones quite easily and abruptly without disrupting the flow of the album - which I definitely appreciated.. \u201cSeason of the Witch\u201d and \u201cThe Trip\u201d in particular are awesome cuts, definitely gonna be coming back to them.\n\n**Gary Numan - Pleasure Principle**: Way darker than I was expecting based on the hit single \u201cCars\u201d. Has an ominous, futuristic vibe that was very well done and consistent. NoIt exactly up my alley but it's solid. \n\n**Tennis - Yours Conditionally**: I just recently saw these guys in concert so I'm probably biased but I really dug this. It's kind of generic dreamy pop stuff but it works surprisingly well. The main singer has an awesome voice (great in concert as well btw) and helps carry a lot of the tracks.

Been digging into a lot of new music this week.\n\n\n**Future Islands - The Far Field:** A serious AOTY contender for me. A massive improvement on Singles (an already great album) in pretty much every way. The songs are more interesting and varied but still just as catchy, and it's great to see the band experiment with new sounds as well as Sam's incredible vocal range. Also hands down the best night driving record of the year so far.\n\n\n**Carissa's Wierd - Songs About Leaving:** Probably one of my favorite records of all time. Achingly beautiful acoustic guitars, unison vocals, and string arrangements pervade the songs, every single one of which hits way too close to home. It's been my soundtrack to probably the worst time in my life I've ever experienced, and I would recommend it to anyone who's got the sads.\n\n\n**Fugazi - Instrument Soundtrack:** Glad to see Fugazi's getting brought up more around this sub. A consistently fantastic band, and even this soundtrack to their own documentary is no exception. Some great demos on here, some of which made their way into studio albums and some that didn't. It really gives an insight into the band's unique creative process.\n\n\n**Prince - Sign O' The Times:** My favorite Prince record by far. One of the best double albums of all time, he truly makes every second count. From psychedelic pop tracks to epic rock ballads to electro funk jams, Sign O' The Times showcases Prince's eclecticism without seeming overblown or messy.

Still, the highs on here are very high, and it has all the things that makes me love FJM. The good wit, the thoughtful themes, the mix between genres. *Pure Comedy* is not a letdown at all, even if it doesn\u2019t come close to the expectations. Favorite Track: Leaving LA\n\n**ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$** by *Joey Bada$$* (2017) 8/10\n\nThis is such a great rap project. I think I like it better than *B4da$$*, but that\u2019s just on a first listen. Really enjoyable project overall. Favorite track: For My People\n\n**Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)** by *Wu Tang Clan* (1993) 5/10\n\nMy apologies to the gods of hip-hop for not liking this album. This is just not my style of rap, and I found it to be all over the place, packed with filler, and overlong. Some good beats and verses, but every track has something that drags it back in my opinion. Favorite Track: C.R.E.A.M.\n\n**Sea Change** by *Beck* (2002) 9/10\n\nNew favorite Beck album. Simple and folksy with some neat ambient experimentation. I really love it. Favorite Track: Lost Cause\n\n**Arca** by *Arca* (2017) 7/10\n\nThis was so interesting. I liked the vocals, I loved the production. A song or two on here was not my fave, but generally it was really very good. Very strange though. Favorite Track: Child\n\n**50 Song Memoir** by *The Magnetic Fields* (2017) 4/10\n\nThe concept is the best part of this incredibly difficult listen. Favorite Track: Never Again\n\n**Number 1 Angel** by *Charli XCX* (2017) 5/10\n\nSome really cool production and some really forgettable pop music. Favorite Track: Dreamer\n\n**Hot Thoughts** by *Spoon* (2017) 8/10\n\nI know it ain\u2019t popular opinion, but this is one of my favorite things I\u2019ve heard by Spoon. Favorite Track: Hot Thoughts\n\n**Overly Dedicated** by *Kendrick Lamar* (2010) 9/10\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that this mixtape is as amazing as it is. K Dot was unreal before *Section.80* obviously despite the fact that I never dug back that far before. Favorite track: Ignorance is Bliss\n\n**DAMN.** by *Kendrick Lamar* (2017) 8/10\n\nI\u2019m gonna need more listens, but on a first listen half asleep, I really really enjoy it, but it\u2019s more of a *Section .80* than it is a *GKMC* or *TPAB*, or even *Untitled Unmastered*.
