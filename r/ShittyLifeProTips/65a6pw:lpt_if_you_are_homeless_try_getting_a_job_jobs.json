The only treatment that works is tough love. The guy I spoke of, well after a shit ton of tough love is now productive. His psychiatric state makes mine look like a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: i love how the only person that has experience with a psychiatric condition, that some claim is debilitating, and has experience fixing the homeless situation of a person with severe psychiatric issues is downvoted. Fuck you pussies get off your theories and do something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: who else here is a schitzo that goes to school, maintains employment, and forces themselves not only to get out of their box, but to act like a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that brought me to where I am is a rural country family that wouldn&amp;#39;t let me check into a psych ward or call it quits because I didn&amp;#39;t feel ok upstairs. Give me a fucking break. Seroquil is what they give prison inmates to keep them in check. If you care about yourself or a loved one don&amp;#39;t let them take the crap. Find an alternative or stop completely. That shit will stop you from waking up on time and maintaing a job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ShittyLifeProTips", "name": "t1_dgbp6g2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346930.0, "created_utc": 1492318130.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9p1sy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "punromantic", "parent_id": "t1_dg9or68", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ShittyLifeProTips", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm glad you got treatment.
