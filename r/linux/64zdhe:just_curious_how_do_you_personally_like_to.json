This helps with clutter but it doesn&amp;#39;t make switching windows that much faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other is to have a separate virtual desktop for each different window, and have a dedicated keyboard shortcut for each desktop, which effectively means a dedicated keyboard shortcut for each program. For example, I can press Super+1 and go to my browser, Super+2 and go to my file manager, all the way down to Super+9 for my email. I&amp;#39;m not sure how this could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be faster than picking out your window with a mouse on the taskbar, launcher, gnome activities overview, or the spread/expose method that you mention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(KDE and Unity allow you to use Super+1,2,3, etc. for the first, second, third, etc. programs in your launcher, which allows something similar, except that your launcher is more likely to change states and so you&amp;#39;re more likely to have to look at it to remember which shortcut to press than to be able to rely on memory.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Alt+tab is an easy way to use the keyboard to switch windows, and it&amp;#39;s just as fast if you have 2 or 3 windows, but with a lot of windows you&amp;#39;ll end up having to press it a lot and it won&amp;#39;t be as fast.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to stick with doing things the way you prefer, I&amp;#39;m just commenting on what I think is fastest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linux", "name": "t1_dg6c85x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051618.0, "created_utc": 1492022818.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zdhe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zdhe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zdhe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fzi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sisyphusrox", "parent_id": "t1_dg6exve", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Actually i think your answer was fine and informative.
