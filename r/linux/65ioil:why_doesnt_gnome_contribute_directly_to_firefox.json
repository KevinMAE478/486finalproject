Back then, Linux (and the Intel BSDs) were toys. Stuff nerds played with in their free time at home because a Sparc 20, an SGI Indigo, or DEC Alpha or HP9000 workstation et all cost upward of $20K - $50K a pop. Those machines ran 'real' UNIX with 'real' OSF CDE. \n\nKDE and then Gnome projects were founded to copy CDE. Just look at KDE 1, it looks exactly like CDE. The free software guys couldn't afford CDE because OSF charged an arm and a leg for Motif and CDE licenses under Linux. Because no one developing for 'real UNIX' thought Linux was anything but a toy for sysadmins to play with at home. And in those days, they were right. \n\nBut the UNIX workstation vendors didn't think through Moore's law. They didn't realize Intel - with all those hundreds of millions of x86 chips sold (then!) - could possibly beat their more elegant RISC designs by economic brute force, with better lithography and chip fab. But Intel did. And drove them all out of business. \n\nWith them went commercial UNIX. Which left Linux the last one standing. Along the way were twists and turns (SCO!). But ultimately, CDE died a brutal death by the early to mid 2000s, and even Sun standardized on Gnome. Because they'd long given up on the desktop market, and were just trying to hold their own in the datacenter. \n\nKDE and Gnome share this history of trying to re-implement the failed strategy of OSF, building a common desktop for UNIX that would bring about application unity. Only everyone's forgotten this history. And the projects continue pursuing this strategy - like it's embedded in their unconscious - on inertia alone, seeking these goals even though they don't even remember why. \n\nYet if Wintel had changed the world by 2000, extinguishing the potential of Desktop UNIX by price power and mass deployments,  today the powerhouse of Wintel is falters because the desktop has been relegated to power users in lieu of tablets and smartphones. None of which run Windows. \n\nSo, what does it mean to take back the desktop? It means servicing those power users who need a computer to perform some task crucial to their workflow. From freelancers on up. Linux won't displace Windows across the board here, but it could break through in niche markets with the right strategy and tailored distributions. Like what Ubuntu has been trying with their creative distributions. (except they have no idea what creatives actually need - they're just throwing software in carte blanche, another problem Linux distributors have had since forever). \n\nIf the dev teams at KDE or Gnome realized this. That people will never install Linux to run KDE or Gnome, because the desktop was commoditized almost twenty years ago. But they could attract people to run Blender or OpenToonz or Krita or Inkscape or Audacity etc - essentially any tool that comes close to performance against its commercial counterparts and - most especially - available to render en masse across clusters for free (do you know what a yearly per seat subscription is for Maya!?!?!). If they realized this is a use case that could draw in ten of thousands or more seats of hardened professionals - a core community to attract a mass following in that field. And tailored their desktop to use cases like that. Basically, chasing ways to undercut major commercial offerings... You might see one or the other actually win this thing. This Desktop UNIX showdown in the not-so-OK corral that's been shooting duds for over thirty years. \n\nThis was Apple's marketshare. They've abandoned it to Windows. But it could be Linux's for the taking. Because you want to run the same stuff on your desktop that you plan to run on the farm so you know your render output will be consistent and deliverable on time. \n\nKDE and Gnome won't win by being 'better' (whatever that means).
